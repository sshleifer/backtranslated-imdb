I loved all the other Don Knotts movies, but I've never heard much about "How To Frame A Fig" and now I know why: I can't think of anyone who would find it funny. This film seems to appeal to 9 or 10 years, but even most of them would give a thumbs down. At best there are short moments of mild fun, mostly from Don Knotts who plays the same nervous and losing character that made him famous. <br /> <br /> When the film was finished, I was curious to know if my teenager could have understood the film's fatal flaw. We fully agreed: the sidekick character from Prentiss Gates was even more stupid than the character of Don Knotts. <br /> <br /> Be happy that Mr. Limpet's films, Reluctant Astronaut, Shakiest Gun and Mr. Chicken are available.
