"Congo" poorly managed and ill-directed, tries in vain to recreate the feeling of "Jurassic Park". But the truth is that the book was not so great. However, the film's first problem is that Tim Curry's character has been added; the second problem is that the talking arm has been added; the main problem, however, is that cast members don't create realistic characters. I guarantee you that this movie won't make you think that there are gorillas who are murderers everywhere on earth. Also starring Laura Linney (happy birthday, Laura!), Dylan Walsh, Ernie Hudson, Grant Heslov, Joe Don Baker, James Karen and Bruce Campbell; I guess they don't want to emphasize this film in their resumes.
