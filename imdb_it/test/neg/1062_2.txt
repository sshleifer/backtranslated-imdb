It is as if the Marshmallow Man from the Ghostbusters, suffocated, had reincarnated in the body of Rutger Hauer and was taking revenge on a rival's pregnant wife! If seeing an obese Hauer chasing a very pregnant Isabel Glaser (imagine the tingling chills in that race) sounds good to you, watch this movie! Seriously, if Hauer is what looks like an Iraqi prisoner of war after six years in prison, then wherever hungry people should make a line of bees in a Baghdad prison. Overall "Tactical Assault" has 2 stars instead of 1 because Mike Mitchell as Hawk is terrifying. Mitchell burns the screen like a NATO pilot until his plane is burned alone (by an enemy missile), after which the film loses that little verve he had to start with.
