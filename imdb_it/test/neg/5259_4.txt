Bulletproof is clearly a disposable film. The type in which the bullet has riddled the good guys and the bad guys are scattered everywhere, so much so that you really shouldn't see them as humans. The yawns between the lines of Wayans and Sandler are truly remarkable. They strive but, alas and that's it, the person himself doesn't make a good movie. Jimmy Caan plays a villain, but he always had that redneck side ready. My favorite scene is the repeated clips of a TV ad in which Caan reveals that America's virtues can be shown to the world by having 2 cars in each garage. Apart from that, it's a friendly film with guns for the brain. Move on to this.
