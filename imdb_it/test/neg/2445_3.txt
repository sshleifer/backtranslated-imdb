Genre: cartoon without dialogue, African girl and lion. <br /> <br /> Main characters: Inki, the lion and the minah bird. <br /> <br /> What happens: a lion wants to eat an African girl named Inki. There is also a rather confused Minah bird. Is it on Inki's, or the lion's share ..? <br /> <br /> Message: Erm ?? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I agree with Lee Eisenberg, this is rather mean for the poor Africans !! Sad I like the main character, Inki (who is an African girl) is a pretty main character, but still portrays her rudely and makes a younger audience not look like her much just because she's HUNTING !! GRRR CHARLES M JONES !! I don't really like the lion and I think the Minah bird is RIGHT (I suppose) Personally I prefer the Looney Tunes comics by Charles M. Jones in the future. <br /> <br /> If you still want to see it, then I recommend the YouTube site. Type "Inki" in the space on the main page and you are there. <br /> <br /> I wish Charles M. Jones had been kinder to Inki in this brief. So there. <br /> <br /> Recommended: People who are interested in old cartoons and / or people who are just joking about You Tube.
