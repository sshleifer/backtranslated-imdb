Slayer is a brainless vampire movie with few twists on an ancient plot. The special ops team is sent to South America to hunt down bloodsuckers. Their leader is a real old man who has aged well. There is an environmental breakthrough when vampires are attacking villages because their rainforest and old wild animal diet are disappearing because of greedy corporations and peasants. Lost in fights and so much blood, they never bothered to wash the cast away for the entire movie. Looks like they slept with blood on their bloodstained clothes. While every cast member brought his own talents, it wasn't all like a movie. The effects were OK, except for the vampires dangling from the buildings on the wires. If you are looking for a lot of blood and violence, this is for you.
