WARNING! SPOILER! This film is an absolute crap. It is not entertainment. I don't have the words to describe the disgust I felt in the end. <br /> <br /> This is a poorly made film on the scum of society. Throughout the film, I kept waiting for it to improve. It was not so. Instead, it continues to get worse and worse. <br /> <br /> When I see a film as bad as this, I always try to find at least one good thing to say about it. In this case it was impossible. I don't have a good thing to say about it. How bad was it? Well, here's an example: Towards the end Dan Akroyd suffocates and kills Vincent D'Onofrio while Reeves and Diaz watch! This is not entertainment!
