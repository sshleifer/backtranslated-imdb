You know, I really hate IMDb's censorship system, since my entire review is almost over if you remove the curses. But here we go. Assembly time! <br /> <br /> Holy Moley is so bad. I thought it could be a great fantasy film, judging by the plot summary, since, at first glance, I blindly rented gems like Frailty and American Nightmare. But this is simply abominable. It is a killer who uses the works of Edgar Allen Poe as a reference for his murderous exploits and the story of a detective who must stop him. Can these evil hacks not make a good film without contaminating the grave of a great horror writer? I mean, the killings here are completely devoid of thought or originality, and Poe's references are fake and fake, without enough thoughts put into it. They are superficial and have shamed Poe's work. Full of holes, with terrible sequences. Also the acting is bad, reminding me of the known abortion in some third world countries as "Fear X", with all the lines of pause and not emotional. <br /> <br /> I realize that this is an indie film, but it's not an excuse. I saw high school kids behaving better than these idiots, and I myself could have found better scenes to kill and a better plot, given all the time. <br /> <br /> This has no reason to exist. Avoid at all costs.
