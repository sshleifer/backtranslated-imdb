Like other films of the worst director of all time, Ed Wood, this film is very ugly, but for that it is also very funny. It may not be for everyone, but I laughed a lot. It's a strange thing when you enjoy a bad movie. How do you rate? Like a very low movie, like entertainment at least a little higher. <br /> <br /> The film tries to explain what a transvestite is and does it through a scientist (Bela Lugosi) and an inspector (Lyle Talbot) who talks to a doctor (Timothy Farrell) who knows these things. The doctor tells the detective two stories and this is what we, and apparently the scientist, see. The doctor faces these stories because a dead transvestite is found, a suicide, and because of a headline in the newspaper that talks about a sex change. The first and longest story concerns Glen (the same Ed Wood) who is in love and is about to marry Barbara (Dolores Fuller) but has never told her that he likes to dress like a woman, when he calls himself Glenda. The film tells the same thing over and over again, especially the fact that a transvestite is not necessarily a homosexual. The film almost says that being a transvestite is not a bad thing, but being homosexual is, since it continues to tell us that a transvestite is not a homosexual. The second story is about a transvestite who really wants a sex change and doesn't just want to dress like a woman, but it's much shorter and less interesting. <br /> <br /> A couple of things make this movie very bad, and therefore ridiculous. The way the story is presented is the first thing, the way in which the same things are told over and over and the conclusion of all this is other. This is not where it ends. The acting is very bad, especially Dolores Fuller seems to read her lines directly from a small screen somewhere. Everything he says is fun. The whole dialogue really made me laugh. <br /> <br /> There is also a sequence in which someone enters a room. The door remains half open and we see something hanging on the wall, not completely straight. Then the door, in what appears to be the same shot even though we know it is not, is a little less open and suddenly the thing hanging on the wall is suspended. Ed Wood did not mind leaving this kind of continuity errors in his film. It can be a good thing, because basically it's just another laugh for the modern public. I think you understand it's a bad movie and I think there's a good chance of laughing even at ridiculous mistakes.
