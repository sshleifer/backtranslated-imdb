After the failure of "Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth", the chapter that served as a sort of "mortal blow" to the franchise, another embarrassing cheapo cashing wasn't a surprise. An abysmal attempt to explain every single mystery of Pinhead and the puzzle box, which covers literally centuries of history, in a film that lasts less than 90 minutes ... On display is understated by the miserable acting, sup-par to the miserable B- movie special effects, and a ridiculous and offensive attempt of dark humor, while STILL trying to keep the whole project completely serious. I wonder how many directors did this thing? Poor Pinhead has VERY screen time, that every little mystery and threat that this iconic character possessed is completely lost. After an hour of listening to lengthy speeches and dramatic attitudes, we simply want to tell the guy to shut up! moderately funny in commercials, especially in the first segment, this mess starts to look a bit cheap, horrible made for a television splatter movie after a while, and ends up in the most ridiculous way imaginable: Pinhead, along with his dog Cenobite, kill a bunch of idiots ... in space! I'm sorry, but any real fan of the first two films in the series, who gave this abortion to a movie more than 3 stars, should be ashamed. On the sidelines, the film that follows; "Hellraiser: Inferno" is actually a surprisingly smart, and elegantly crafted film-noir, which brilliantly reinvents "Pinhead" as a master of illusion and cruelty, and reports the concept of evil inherent in mankind, which was the centerpiece of the original film and the whole point of the story. For any serious horror fan, see Hellraiser I & II, skip the bad III and this one, and continue with "Inferno". You won't miss anything by skipping this garbage ...
