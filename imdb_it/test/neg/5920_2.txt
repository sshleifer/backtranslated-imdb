I thought this movie was horrible. I understand that it was shot on a limited budget but the acting was terrible and the film itself was simply stupid. The plot was predictable and the central character was an obnoxious idiot. In reality, all the characters were unpleasant and none were fully developed. The public does not refer to anyone in the film. It had to be full of suspense, but if you don't care about the characters, it's hard to get "into" the movie. I felt like a stranger was forced to listen to someone telling me a stupid story. All the twists at the end were just a little too much - actually I was laughing when I imagine I should have been "shocked". All in all, I thought it was really just a bad movie.
