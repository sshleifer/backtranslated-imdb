OK: some colleges in Southern California have a film class. And some guys were only drafted to film girls, and they gave them a camera. And then they were drunk / stoned / or just stupid to actually use a camera, and they turned this to their degree. AND FAILED. <br /> <br /> This is my only explanation for this, this, what. Good God, they left the date and time counter during some of them. The image started in a new scene long before the sound and forgets about a plot. Well, apparently there was one and they had to tell you all this once the 3-hour presentation sequence ended. But I'm glad I did it because I'd never seen him looking at this. <br /> <br /> YOU ARE AWAY from this.
