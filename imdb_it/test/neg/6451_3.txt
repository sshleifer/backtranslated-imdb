This film was a weak point for both Jason Robards and Sam Peckinpah. The main points of the plot are taken directly from Sergio Leone's masterpiece "Once Upon a Time in the West" (published two years before and with Robards): a man finds a watering hole in the desert, being the only water for many miles in each direction plans to build a "station" around the hole and to make sure there is a love interest, falls in love with a prostitute. To this I add an intemperate preacher, bad music, stupid fast action shots, even sillier T & A shots - and it's you. There is little demand because it failed at the box office. The real question is "how did it go so far?"
