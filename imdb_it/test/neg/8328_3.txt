"Tragic Hero" is a film that is certainly trying to emulate the classic Godfather films, focusing on family, crime, loyalty and revenge. Furthermore, this is part of a two-part series as well as The Godfather (currently). However, this film is by no means close to the level of those classic films and actually worsened compared to other Triad thrillers published in Hong Kong at the time. <br /> <br /> One reason is acting. With the exception of Chow Yun Fat, acting is generally exaggerated and unbelievable. The public tends to find the humorous procedure simply because the inability of the actors to maintain any degree of seriousness. Consequently, the film is not really engaging or emotionally intense, since we are not particularly interested in what happens with these characters. <br /> <br /> Another reason is its lack of concentration. The narrative tries to incorporate many elements of the story into the film, but this means that some parts of the film become underdeveloped and lack a real sense of coherence. The public sometimes gets lost in the proceedings we are looking at, not knowing what the character's motivations are. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film contains a reckless fight, but once again because we don't care about the characters, we don't care who lives or who dies; This is why the scene loses intensity and suspense. The other sets of actions are rather mundane in nature, with the feeling of being too controlled rather than free. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a strictly medium film and is not recommended for the general viewer film ... Only fans of the hard core genre and Chow Yun Fat fans should consider this film for the vision.
