Anyone who pays to see Troma movies knows, and appreciates, what they will get. That said, I didn't think it was possible to make such a bad movie, and still be compelling. I found myself looking only to see how much worse it could get before the end. First of all, it is an Indonesian action film with an American protagonist who looks and behaves like the bastard son of "Taxi" Christopher Lloyd and Rambo. He posters himself as Sly's "Cobra" everywhere and even has a custom-built polygon (with clippings of his greatest enemies) in Jakarta, although he is in the CIA and has just arrived a few days before. There is a lot of action that involves the game of the gun (no muzzles on those M-16s, only sound effects), motorcycles (which come out through the walls), karate (where nobody makes physical contact) and even a little bit of sex (where all the actors are ugly). The main plot of an epic like this should at least be reasonably plausible, but not here. It involves the most dangerous drug cartel in the world that freaks out to find a "drug detection device". Why should they need it? This is never revealed, why not kill the dogs that sniff the drugs? It doesn't make sense, but it's taken seriously. The actors must be praised because they really seemed to think that this film would make them famous and try to "behave". The best line? "Now dance on your dirty whore grave!" The best scene? Rambo jumps on the flying helicopter, pulls out the machine gun from the villain's hand, we go, he falls, he shoots the helicopter while he is falling, the helicopter explodes, cut to a mannequin launched into the water. F ** re genius! If you can't appreciate the garbage, don't look at it. If you can, it's great. One last thing, did I say it was directed by the three Punjabi brothers?
