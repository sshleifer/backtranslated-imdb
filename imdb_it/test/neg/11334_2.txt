!!! Spoiler alert !!! <br /> <br /> The point is, however, that I didn't think this movie had a TO spoil ending ... I just started looking at it in the middle, after Matt had entered Sarah's body, but then I was fascinated from the weirdness of the plot, even for a Channel 5 movie ... and I couldn't see how happy Matt would end up. And his girlfriend? At one point it seemed that he would arrive with his best friend, definitely icky and wrong ... and then the whole thing today today DOES NOT WORK like a touching buddy buddy-buddy, it's just ridiculous ... so it was going 'surely can't just come back to life? yet how can she live as a woman? and then the film ended up not explaining anything !!!!! What is it ??? I was so angry, I lost a whole hour of my life for no reason !!! :) but it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, so swings and roundabouts
