This is just one of the stupidest things I've ever seen. Maybe he's not the worst competitor ever, but if you haven't seen so many villains, this could easily make your Top Ten Worst List. When you consider what was made in 1933 with the original "King Kong", you have to ask yourself why someone would stoop so low as to produce this debacle. So, taking one more step and realizing that the leap towards "Star Wars" the following year has reached a new level in science fiction entertainment, this offer will make you laugh and cry at the same time. <br /> <br /> Now let me ask you, what could the Professor (Peter Cushing) have to bring an umbrella with him as a main piece of underground research equipment for the passage to the center of the earth? OK, so it was useful to repel the parrot / tyrannosaurus (parrotosaurus?) At the beginning, but come on. Somehow, I don't think this was what Edgar Rice Burrough had in mind when he wrote his short stories about Pellucidar. He probably didn't even think of Caroline Munro as Princess Dia, probably the only saving factor in all this escapade. At least there was some pseudo-scientific explanation that kicked me out of; I'm always looking for films like this. It should be the way the sky at the center of the earth really was the lower part of the earth's crust, explaining that ethereal rosy light. But as much as he tried, the story just could not attract me in a way to find something interesting about Hoojah the Sly One or Jubal the Ugly, much less those stupid human means and half pterodactyl creatures. To paraphrase the good professor - "You can't hypnotize yourself, I'm paying attention!"
