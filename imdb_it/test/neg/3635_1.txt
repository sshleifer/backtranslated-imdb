This television program is stereotyped and unlikely in many of its aspects. <br /> <br /> First of all, the setting. All the characters attend the PCA, this incredible college with painted and elegant dormitories. The campus does not seem to have reasonable rules, for example children are often seen in girls' dorms and vice versa. But this can be simply because the dorm councilor, a foolish character who basically bores the viewer instead of having fun, since I assume his purpose is, he sits down and does nothing. I have friends in colleges, and they laugh at many aspects of school in this show. <br /> <br /> Next, the characters. I was so disappointed to discover that Nickelodeon was not at all creative with the personalities of this show. All of them represent an exaggerated feature to the extreme: Zoey is presumably perfect in everything she does (look, votes, sports, boys, judgment, creativity, etc.), Michael is the jockey, Logan is the arrogant asshole who basically does nothing In addition to aggravating all the characters as well as us poor spectators, Nicole is the preppy idiot who knows nothing but somehow keeps straight-A, Dana was the tough girl, Quinn is the unrealistic 'smart guy', with whom she they make fun of it consistently, Chase is the guy who is afraid to confess his "real feelings" that really aggravate me like the show goes on, and that new girl - Lola or something like that - is just another Nicole clone. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists the characters that aggravate me the most are Zoey and Quinn. First of all, I don't understand Zoey's character. Obviously it was created to be the 'perfect' character as I said above, but it seems to be the most wrong of them all - in most of the episodes it creates a problem, so it has to solve it. What's frustrating is that we should love it and think it's wonderful when they haven't even created a very realistic character to begin with. <br /> <br /> Quinn, on the other hand, bothers me because she is exaggerated to the point where her character is absolutely offensive. The impression I got about Nick about his character is that "geeks" and "nerds" are people who laugh, criticize, mock. In the spring episode they did a year ago, they introduced two other "nerds" that the characters had to make "cool". I found this highly offensive and stereotyped. What kind of message does Nick send to these guys? It's: don't do well at school, don't have good grades, don't study hard, you'll end up becoming a geek and I'll laugh at your profession in the next TV series! Because this is certainly the message I get from these badly constructed characters, and it's a horrible message in every way. <br /> <br /> All I can do is hope that one day Nick realizes that by putting down smart people in our world, they're not doing anyone any good.
