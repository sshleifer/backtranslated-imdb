This film, which I just discovered in the video store, apparently will sit around for a couple of years without a distributor. It's easy to see why. The story of two friends living in New York looking for their high school friend who now lives homeless under the catwalk in Coney Island, has a flash of being a great movie, but in the end is weighed down by the story centered on Stan and Daniel , rather than on their homeless friend Richie. As usual, Cryer is very good and the film looks nice with the ghostly images of Coney Island. However, writer Cryer and director Richard Schenkman are too busy dealing with the uninteresting lives of Stan and Daniel rather than focusing on Richie. A flashback in a music store, where Richie has a crush on an employee, stands out and really shows the viewer where this movie could have gone. But in the end, not much. Two different nuisance scenes, such as inside the Skeeball building. ASSESSMENT 4 out of 10.
