One of the worst surf movies I've ever seen. This film is so ugly that I don't know where to start ... Ok, let's start with the premise - a guy from the continent who barely knows about travel to Hawaii and takes part in a big wave competition that is more or less expected to win. A good analogy for those who do not sail would be that of a grossly overweight smoker who slaps on a pair of running shoes and enters the LA Marathon with the expectation of winning. There's no way! And, the competition takes place in The North Shore which conjures up images of 15-foot waves, but on the day of the race the waves are maybe 6 feet. The acting? What acting? If you have to see this plot see it on TV, don't waste your money by renting it. If you want to see a good surf movie - assuming it's defective, but that's another story - rent the Great Wednesday.
