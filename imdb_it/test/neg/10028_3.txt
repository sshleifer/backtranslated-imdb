Silly hikers go camping in the Utah mountains only to encounter a killer and disfigured gypsy. <br /> <br /> The Prey is a beautiful series of slasher films, which suffers above all from lack of imagination. The characters of the victim are idiotic teenagers all too familiar, which means that they don't really care about anything, we only wonder when they will die! Not to mention the fact that it has too many moments of cheese and is full of endless and useless videos. However, he does have some interesting moments for slasher fans, the occasional touch of a spooky atmosphere and a decent soundtrack by Don Peake. Still, it's a business as usual for dead camper films. <br /> <br /> There are much better films in this sense, but on all The Prey it could be quite watchable for slasher fans. Although one might be more rewarded in seeing Just Before Dawn (1981), Wrong Turn (2003), or even The Final Terror (1983) again. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on ****
