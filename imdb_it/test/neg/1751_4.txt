I recently saw Shame, directed by Ingmar Bergman. The film was interesting and truly unique. I liked how it was in Swedish with English subtitles and it was also in black and white. These features allowed me to relate better with the characters, the time period and their stories. I didn't like how in the beginning the film was very slow and I didn't know what was really going on. At first, it was mainly a story of the relationship between Eva and Jan. The film also ended with a very depressing note because nothing good happened between all the conflicts and changes during the film. I probably wouldn't go back to seeing Shame, but it was a very cultured experience.
