This is a poor film. It certainly belongs to the way of not making a movie category. History, direction, acting and style are all flat like a pancake. The story is composed of five ?? yes five ?? the football matches lasted for the entire duration of the film, each one more boringly compared to the last one, as an amateur football team no longer works. Here, this is the plot. It is difficult to know who this film is for. It's too trivial for football fans and there's nothing for teenagers or adults. There is nothing for women, not even a female character. Sadness scares you while the team plays after game after game after game after game. History, as it is, dialogues and mannerisms seem relieved by a past Ireland, with all the actors who emit the theatrical accents of Dublin. It must not be seen to be believed. Avoid at all costs. Someone can give me back my 90 minutes. Highest point is the credits at the end, low point too numerous to mention. Brendan Gleeson is in this movie.
