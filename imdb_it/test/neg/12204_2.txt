Has anyone found the plot somewhere in the movie? Perhaps it is the thing that is lacking in this pretentious exercise of cinema on the cinema. It is quite surprising that Gordon states that "A film without plot is nothing" ... It is possible that the characters have more to say than their own Wim Wenders. Was this sentence in the original plot or did the actor decide to send a suggestion to the director?
