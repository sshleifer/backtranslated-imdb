Everything about this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> You can tell in the first five minutes that this movie will be terrible. However, you can't evaluate how bad it will be. <br /> <br /> We start the film with a seemingly endless introduction scene, aided by gay music and without dialogue. Having the camera moving up and down the big boys who are trying too hard to look mental does not cause the slightest emotion. <br /> <br /> What then begins seems to be one of two separate stories. The first half of the film is made up of wogs around to compete in midnight pay battles with other ethnic groups. Wogs always win, of course, because they seemingly lift weights and have "respect". It is in these scenes that we see for the first time the degree of bad acting, editing, screenplay and hatred for the people who financed this film. <br /> <br /> Eventually the main character and his companion are sent to prison. The whole part of the film's prison is not related to what I assume is the plot, and consists of a group of struggles. <br /> <br /> Once out of jail (3 years for murder?) The main character and his companion get together with the wogs. Then they go "across the city" and try to stay low, because apparently everyone wants to kill them. <br /> <br /> soon the wogs prepare for the rape of another gang girl, and they run around the city fighting off hordes of different gangs. This point in the film can be compared to an arcade game, as wogs simply run around and fight enemies that seemingly get worse with time. <br /> <br /> The film ends with some huge climatic fight scene in which the remaining wogs (the two main characters) face all the gangs that have fought so far. Apparently the other gangs have no problem joining to deal with the remaining wogs (skinheads don't care about Asians). After about a million more people are beaten by the invincible wog brothers the film ends with the main characters headed home. They can't get home anyway, because they are burned to death by the thousands of angry movie critics who rage the set and leave angry letters everywhere. <br /> <br /> This movie could be more like a computer game then a movie, because this would explain how two guys can take about a million punches in the face from a million different people that most of the time they have twice their size. <br /> <br /> There are also tons of more stupid inexplicable events in this film, like an Asian who fights his own gang and takes a katana in the head just to make the woges escape. <br /> <br /> As someone else mentioned, this movie is not so bad it's fun, it's so bad.
