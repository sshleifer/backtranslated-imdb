This film is so bold that it doesn't try to hide its similarities with The Shining. Originality is lacking to do so. And when he does, towards the end, he tries to hide his story of "father going psychopathic under the influence of a haunted house sketched in a foreign place", he does it by bending to a lot of other already established conventions and ideas. In other words, it comes down to simple clich√©. But hell, I too like a good predictable horror or thriller as long as there is an interesting story, full of violence and blood, somewhere before the film makes the terrible turn to the predictable and the trivial. Well, this film doesn't have a good story and I was really disappointed. What "Darkness" is doing is an exceptional direction and cinematography. It is a well shot and carefully constructed film full of disquieting shots and shots. What "Darkness" does not intend to do is pretty much everything else. To start with a little quirk: the editing in this film is hateful. Jump from one scene to another, sometimes to no avail. For example, the old man in the film (who brings more or less the background story, later filled by another character) is underlined by a hamster circle. I mean, it sounds interesting the first time, but why keep using the same image? I guess you should see it for yourself, to understand what I mean. Another problem with this film is the character of Anna Paquin who essentially complains about the whole film, crying and worrying too much about everything - she is the film's failed attempt in a character-based horror movie. The film has scenes of exaggerated sentimentality and the family drama it describes is simply not credible. In the end, "Darkness" is a confused melodrama, with a mystery that does not involve a too simple ending. And it's almost scary.
