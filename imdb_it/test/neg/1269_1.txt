I was excited that my favorite comic book hero was on television ... and deeply disappointed with the final result. <br /> <br /> The only "surprising" thing was the crawling wall (despite the visibility of the cable). I didn't think Nick Hammond was Peter Parker ... and he was visibly of a different build than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit. It could be said that they were two different actors. <br /> <br /> Of course, I can also spot the modern Spider-Man movies when I watch Tobey Macguire and when I watch CGI. But this is from an expert eye and from the experience of working with CGI. However, the 1970s version could have been better despite the lack of special effects. <br /> <br /> The cobwebs were pouty and looked like ropes that seemed to wrap things up rather than stick to them. And what was happening giving him a spider cell phone to ride on. Hello? He is the people of the web slinger. <br /> <br /> Sorry ... I didn't want to be so excited, but our beloved wall crawler deserved better.
