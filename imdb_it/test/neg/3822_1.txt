Any horror film showing Robert Englund (Freddie Kruger!) Then kills him in the first 5 minutes before the credits are even published should be seen immediately with nothing but suspicion. <br /> <br /> Tony Todd (Candyman!) as a swamp tour guide (his impression of James Earl Jones's voice is hysterical, by the way, I don't know or care if he was trying to be funny but I was laughing at it). Unfortunately his role was also 5 minutes long. Other reasons for suspicion and rightly so. <br /> <br /> Mercedes McNab (Buffy & Angel's AKA Harmony, I had to watch her to see what I remembered her from, but she gets half naked!), Marcus the black guy token (Not Another Teen Movie) is filling up a comic role that is not required in a horror film unless it is intended as a parody. <br /> <br /> Joel Murray (the brother of Bill Murray and Pete of Dharma & Greg) plays Shapiro, the guy who shoots the gonzo video with the 2 cute girls. While taking a "Spooky Swap Ghost Tour" the 2 male protagonists meet with other people and get stuck on the rocks and have to leave the boat. So now they are all isolated in the swamp at night in the rain. <br /> <br /> Once the true story of Victor Crowley has been told (his trick looked like The Goonies Sloth) we have established that he is dead (well, you haven't come back from being hit in the skull by a Ax!) Once the old man is attacked, despite shooting his gun and having a very clear shot, Marybeth takes more than 30 seconds to start shooting at a guy who is tearing an old man with an ax. Is she stupid? This is too long 29 seconds! In terms of plot there is not really one (I don't classify undead psychopaths as plot, I'm sorry) and even the pace is really bad. You have a murder, some run away, some slight relief, then a little slow dialogue before starting the cycle again. <br /> <br /> After an extremely long scene investigating a shaky bush with a raccoon, Victor appears again (with some sort of electric tool) and kills the dark-haired porn girl, even manages to split the guide tourist in the middle with a shovel? Once Misty was left alone to look for Ben, I felt that it was pretty obvious that she would be the next one to die (I was right but you can't see it). <br /> <br /> Directors? The rain DOES NOT shut off the burning petrol, OK? Idiots! Obviously after the 2 almost missed in the cemetery Marcus was close to dying and Ben was injured at the foot with the tip but they managed to find a boat after impaling Victor on the peak. <br /> <br /> She was pulled into water by something you can't see, trying to save her, then suddenly she's pulled into the boat by Victor and is screaming and the movie ends abruptly. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right. No clue if Ben was dead (he seemed to be missing an arm) and no clue if Marybeth would survive and what happened with Victor. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible ending and without a doubt my verbal attack on the directors canceled the last review. So much for freedom of speech, eh?
