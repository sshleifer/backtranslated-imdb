I'd bet the month's salary "The Magnificent Seven Returns" (MSR) was made for TV. Other reviewers attest that MSR was a theatrical film, and I will take the word for it. The logical answer must assume that it was originally shot for TV, and after a change of heart study, it was instead distributed in a theatrical way. Each actor is primarily a television actor: Mariette Hartley, Michael Callen, Ralfe Waite, Stephanie Powers ... All television actors. Lee Van Cleef has divided his time between TV screens and theater. Stephanie Powers has only made 3 or 4 "real" cinema appearances in the last thirty years of a very prolific television career - the test was shot for TV. Minor players are small-screen veterans that can be seen in old "Gunsmoke", "Wild Wild West", "Streets of San Francisco" replicas and so on. <br /> <br /> Ho-hum sets are identical to Universal Studios Tour sets, often seen in old episodic TV. And the editing betrays the one-or-two-faces of TV, with limited camera movements, positioning, cutting and lighting. The soundtrack, exclusive to Berstein's original themes, is directly from television in the 1970s. Yes, I bet the money was shot for TV. <br /> <br /> This is an important point in the evaluation of MSR. Initially I saw MSR via cable assuming it was an old film version. Compared to the original "Magnificent Seven", it is a joke, a cartoon, an amateur attempt at creating a film. Acting, lighting, writing, setting, action, cinematography, music (exemption from Berstein themes), editing, rhythm, ... and so on ... everything pales in comparison to the classic "Magnificent Seven" which is close to the perfect western years '60 is one of the great action films of all time. <br /> <br /> However, seen as one of the first 70s movies made for TV, as I suspect, the film is actually better than average. Those who unfortunately live the 70s as adults know what I'm talking about. MSR would compete against "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" and equally bland network shows. During the seventies, "Gunsmoke" was a quality show, focusing on character development rather than action, emphasizing the game of pistol with two shootings a week. The first shot, usually a murder, sets in motion the plot of the hour - the second shooting culminates in the episode killing the host star, his nemesis, or otherwise resolving the conflict with Marshal Matt Dillon. MSR has more action than a whole season of "Gunsmoke". In this light - in this frame of reference - MSR is a passable entertainment, a cut above the television tariff of that decade.
