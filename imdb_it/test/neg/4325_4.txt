If possible, try to see all five films of the Universal "Mummy" in order, not so much for the continuity between the films, but for its obvious lack. Obviously it is obvious that the original Boris Karloff classic "The Mummy" should not even be mentioned in the same breath as the so-called "sequels", which are all accepted as campy or cultish. <br /> <br /> This time, it was revealed that the mummified remains of Princess Ananka headed to the United States. And once again, while your eyes deceive you, Kharis the Mummy is not really dead for the second time in "Mother's Tomb", but she is alive and in search of her lost love, Princess Ananka, with the help of the nine rhetorical den leaves produced during the full moon cycle. To complete the mythology, Kharis needs a guardian, cleverly filled by a skinny John Carradine in the role of Yousef Bey, who is entrusted with the task of Andoheb, high priest of Arkan by George Zucco. <br /> <br /> Kharis and Ananka must be returned to their last resting place on the hills of Arkan in Egypt. But as we have seen before, being entrusted to the duty of a high priest is a sure bet to end up in failure, with the character of Carradine who falls in love with the reincarnation of Ananka, Amina Monsouri (Ramsay Ames). It is shocking to see Yousef Bey and the blindfolded man coming into a fight on the beautiful Amina. <br /> <br /> Riddle me - in both "Tombs" and "Curse", Lon Chaney portrays the Mummy with a limp floppy right arm bent over his chest. When he meets the fainted Amina, he raises her on both arms without problems; as soon as he puts it down, his right arm returns to his paralyzed position once more. <br /> <br /> The ending of the film is the most remarkable - the monster gets the girl! But it is a short-lived victory, since the Mummy and its kidnapped bride succumb to a marshy tomb, an ancient Egyptian curse is fulfilled: "The fate of those who challenge the will of the ancient gods will be a cruel and violent death".
