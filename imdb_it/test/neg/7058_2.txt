When I was 13 I was lucky enough to find this movie. It was part of an endless Danish series of really tacky things. But this was the most corny I've ever owned - but I think I sold it, too bad. Well, what to write ... Better than "Manos: the hands of destiny" and worse than "Critters 4". But it is certainly worth an hour and a half since it was created by people who wanted to make it. The acting is not so terrible compared to many other eighties - in fact I like the old man a bit, even if he never looked at that Indian. But I guess you can't have everything ... Do yourself a favor and watch this ...
