It could be the biggest disappointment I'll see in 2009. I seem to be the rare person who didn't like Park's Oldboy, but I think his "Lady Vengeance" and "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance" are among the best films I have Ho seen in the decade of 2000. Therefore, I couldn't wait to see it, especially because it got positive reviews. Instead, I found the movie clich√© and broke little, if only for the vampire genre. And while I appreciate a bit of humor in movies like this, I've heard that Park did this in very inconvenient times. <br /> <br /> Others have compared / contrasted this with "Let me in" and I must say that "Let the Right One In" was far superior to this, and it was a new approach to the vampire genre . Unfortunately, Park's grip was tiring.
