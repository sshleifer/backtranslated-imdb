A bit horrible and confusing from the south of the border. Now I've seen him twice and I STILL don't really know what was happening. It had something to do with a stupid-looking Aztec mummy, a "human robot" who is the stupidest robot I've ever seen, and a woman who is the reincarnation of an ancient Aztec chick. Most of the story is told painfully slow and buzzing by an incredibly boring scientist. This guy is a wonderful sleep aid. His nemesis is a fat hangover called The Bat, which is a rather unimaginative name for an evil scientist. I imagine that the boring scientist and his worm-like assistant dig up the mummy, and that shocking, the scientist's wife is NEXT reincarnation of his mother's girlfriend. They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I imagine the bad villain who has the upper hand can steal it. It takes him five years to do it, because he is inventing a "human robot" to steal the mummy, or attack it, or anything else. He's looking for a treasure that his mother has, so he can be rich. But excuse me, if the boy had this huge intellect and a strong drive for success, why didn't he patent some of his ideas and get rich like that? <br /> <br /> Oh, well, I suppose it would make too much sense. Instead, there is a ridiculous struggle between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which is the false or the poorest aspect. To tell you the truth, I saw it because I was thinking of a film with a name like The Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy must have been fabulously cheese. Instead it was just terribly horrible and the mind blew confused.
