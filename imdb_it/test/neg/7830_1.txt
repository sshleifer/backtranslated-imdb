Asia Argento has never made a film (as far as I know, and this includes those directed by his father, Dario) where he can't show all his anatomy at some point. Of course, in the most boring opening dialogue scene ever, poor Madsen lets her into her office and right there, reminding us that even if she has her hair gathered, she can always stick her fingers in her horse in a given second (which she but in such a way "what am I really seeing?" The DVD box, pack, makes this a femme fatale movie, so keep waiting for her to become a sleek and minimalist killer ... he's not so lucky. It is long-winded, hanging on a certain aging has been and, worse still, it does not have credible abilities in the physical agility if not (surprise!) To remove ALL the clothes when any scene allows it. His accented English would be nice if he just didn't try to make him look so impressed and try to talk like a 12-year-old boy. What about this plot? A woman with a weak mind but at the same time a nympho is suddenly pushed to kill while she already has another business on the move and is doing some cheap drugs ... eh? what? Does anyone have the motivation in this film to do anything other than buy a hamster? The script seems to be oriented letting everyone talk a lot about the same things over and over again (I expected to see the worst acting of this look like a producer who was downloading money just to have some screen time) - there is no nothing replacing the obvious defects of the Asian character that at any point in the film offers what the DVD cover promises. He's weak ... but he knows how to kill. she lets go MUCH. She moves naked, shakes half-dressed, shakes even in the clothes of a dead woman ... she is very flaccid and unmotivated. In fact "Floppy" would have been a great name for this film .. and a shot of Asia passed out looking angry on the cover would have been a better representation ... there are indeed photos of her eating air food !! ! What is it? <br /> <br /> The ending makes sense 0 - all are simply annoying and washed in their intent and in their execution of all goals. Lester's wife offers no REAL revenge (bringing someone to bad Karoeke is life threatening, but it's not really valid) .. and Lester floats around without really making much proclamation of anything. The key art totally misleading ... yes, we know that Asia has lost the small fat of its firstborn, but in reality a whole film that tries to pretend that it is interesting enough to drive a film about a passive-aggressive chick is worth. See instead Point of No Return.
