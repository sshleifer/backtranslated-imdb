You know, I'm sure the boys were sitting in the office one day and they said, "HOW CAN WE MAKE MORE MONEY?" They had made every possible variant of the toy they could do with their current characters. So they decide, we steal the idea of ​​Star Wars, A PREQUEL, and we can invent all the new characters and sell them as toys. Incidentally, something they did in phantom 3, but who cares? However, they choose a point in time before the first film when Toulon is still alive, he and the puppets are sitting around, and a wooden head rolls on the floor and the puppets want to know if he is a dead family member or something, it doesn't matter Start so the story of the lineage of puppets. It is long, boring, there is no care for the body. <br /> <br /> The funniest part is that they tell the origin of these new characters in the movie, but they give no clue as to their fate. SO WATCH OUT WHAT, once the revenue from the new toys is successful, they can fund a new sequel (and the rotten fourth straight), entitled "PUPPET MASTER 8 THE SEQUEL TO THE PRE-PRIEST OF THE RETRO DEAD PUPPET DESTINY!" hold your breath!
