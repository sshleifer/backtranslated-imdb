My age: 13 <br /> <br /> Keats, played by Damon Wayans, and Archie Moses, played by Adam Sandler, are best friends and have been for a year. What Moses doesn't know is that Keats is actually Jack Carter, an undercover cop, who is waiting for the right moment to destroy Moses and Frank Colton, a major criminal with whom Moses is involved. When Colton and Moses find out that Keats is a cop, Colton wants to kill Moses, but leaves after shooting Carter in the head, which doesn't kill Carter. Moses is found by the cops and is taken for proof of Colton's wrong actions. But when the policemen, including Carter, are about to escort him across the country on a plane, all the other policemen are killed and Moses and Carter are alone in the desert. Carter must stay alive and take Moses too. <br /> <br /> A fairly normal action comedy, Bulletproof has the right storyline, but much of the film is simply stupid. For a comedy, I found most of the jokes completely unpleasant. But as an action movie, it has some pretty good action scenes. Not being a good fan of Adam Sandler or Damon Wayans, I found the acting and therefore, the characters, well below par. The climax is not really exceptional, and the film is so unrealistic. It's not all bad, but it's not too good, and it's too short. As I descended below 85 minutes, I still had 15 minutes left before it ended, but it wasn't there, and the movie seemed too short. Overall it's not a complete waste of time, but I wouldn't recommend it anyway. Bulletproof. <br /> <br /> Australian classification: MA 15+: mid-level violence, sexual references, medium-level raw language <br /> <br /> Evaluation: 56 out of 100
