I bought this movie on DVD despite the "stale" review and this was an idiot ... That review was completely accurate and I've never seen any worse "erotic" movies in my long life! Although in part it was beautiful turned and had an interesting environment, besides a nice cover ... But my films Extreme Erotica (c) are over 100 times more erotic (only in the soft delicious aspect) with probably less than 100 times of this budget movie! The story has no logical connection with the first film or the famous book ... Or any new (exciting) slave training element, except for some very strange and sad developments ... Then the male main character - Klaus Kinski - not it seems a bit like the second Master of "O" who tries to play ... And even the adorable Arielle Dombasle, looked delicious in every scene!
