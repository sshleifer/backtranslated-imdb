Guy Pearce almost looks like Flynn, and this resemblance is the only one that this film can claim. Nowhere in Flynn's autobiography is the mention of Klaus Reicher's character, the homosexual encounter is a speculative fiction, and the film's claims that Flynn treated his native work badly are unfounded. Director Frank Howson has made no memorable films, and I find it to be a cause for defamation for his Flynn slander for his insignificant career. <br /> <br />
