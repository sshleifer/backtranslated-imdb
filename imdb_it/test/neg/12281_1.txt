I had to write a review for this film based on what they say gory, non stop action, great movie .. <br /> <br /> These people were obviously watching a different movie. Killpoint honestly sucked into the word !! I kept waiting and waiting for the movie to improve and I couldn't. Some have said that this film was brutal and others said they are bloody, but I can't find any of those adjectives that appear in this, I mean that there are so many scenes with people being shot and there isn't even blood is not even funny! ! I imagine the best way to summarize this is that it probably should have been classified PG by 1984 standards and now in the year 2010 there is no doubt that this would be PG !! Bad, BAD not in the fun variety of "B" varieties !!
