Imagine being trapped in a museum of the dark Middle Ages and a resurrected vampire and his manic companion is chasing you. Where is the last place you want to hide? I would say within the mysterious device of torture of the Virgin of Nuremberg, because there is a good risk that you will be brutally beaten to death. Still, the old lady in this movie stupidly meets her spiked coffin. "The Vampire's Coffin" is a rather disappointing sequel, as director Fernando Méndez does not recreate the gothic atmosphere of the 1957 original, but focuses on comic situations and dialogues. No more threatening castles with disturbing cobwebs and obscure vaults, but confused doctors and clumsy assistants who provoke laughter instead of fear. The story opens inside the last resting place of the Count de Lavud, where an eminent doctor and a hired assistant steal the coffin to examine the body in a private clinic. Of course the wooden stake is removed from his heart, and the vampire count returns to life, immediately enslaving the petty thief to do his dirty work. The vampire has his eye on a beautiful patient in the clinic, and it's up to Dr. Enrique Saldívar to save his soul and destroy the leech. "The Vampire's Coffin" uses a limited amount of positions and there is very little action. The whole movie would be really boring if it weren't for a handful of memorable sequences and decent acting. Photography is surprising, however, with the sublime use of shadows and darkness. This is particularly so during the scene in which Count de Lavud chases a young woman into the deserted streets of the small town at night. It is the only really useful scene of the whole film, the rest is quite mediocre and déjà-vu.
