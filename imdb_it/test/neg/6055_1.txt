Paul Telfer, who plays Hercules in this TV movie, must be the strongest thing on two legs EVER. Wow. <br /> <br /> But this film is a 100% distortion of the Hercules story. Just like "Troy", this film has nothing to do with the original story. Zero. What makes it particularly insulting is that they actually invented a gay character just so people could hate him, making him as cowardly and evil as any character in TV or movie history. This is triply offensive since Hercules may have had a wife, as this was the expectation of those old times, but he also had at least a dozen male lovers. So it's ironic that they should create a gay character for real opponents for this movie. No, not ironic. Evil. The creators of this parody should lower their heads in shame.
