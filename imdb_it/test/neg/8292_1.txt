While I've been a Shatner fan for a long time (since we watched Trek during dinner time in the early 1970s), I can't think of any reason why I wanted to make this film, either for personal development or for reasons of work. Lost a bet? <br /> <br /> As a movie fan, I like to enjoy bad movies with the greats. But "Shoot or be Shot" has no talent or funny bits, unintentional or not. <br /> <br /> Even without scoring, there were no questionable scenes (blink or you will miss the nudity, the shots of the "violence" cartoons with the endless bullets), so you are taken to believe that the producers simply wanted to save the required fee in order for MPAA to evaluate it. This will make its way to cabling with just 10 seconds modified. <br /> <br /> Of the eight people who were in the theater with us, four of them left half-heartedly, murmuring statements like "This is stupid." <br /> <br /> Shatner plays an escaped mental patient who was denied release because he considers himself a screenwriter. The bulletin board prints your "INSANE" request. He runs into a group of Z-class filmmakers who "shoot on video because it's 80% cheaper than the film" and decides to force them to shoot the script under the threat of a gun. There are some secondary subplots that develop some of the secondary characters, but for the most part, this is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to spend 90 minutes in a Shatner "art" movie, see "Free Enterprise" instead, it's a much better movie.
