This program was shown in a morning slot on SPACE, a sci-fi cable station. I'm amazed that someone can pay for it or pass it on; it's incredibly amateur. <br /> <br /> The entire show is a sequence of short monologues or scenes performed on a set that looks like a cabinet with a pile of printed circuit boards attached to the wall. There is very little continuity between the scenes and no plot. A typical scene revolves around some lame joke or special effect and is only a minute or so long. Dialog makes little sense and special effects look like Photoshop filters. The actors are all adults, but I literally saw high school games with better scripts and scripts. This program is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Maybe every scene would work as an interstitial; a filler between shows instead of advertisements. Combining all the scenes makes the limits of the material extremely obvious.
