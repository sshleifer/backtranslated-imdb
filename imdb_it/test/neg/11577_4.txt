Jim Wynorski strikes again with the very literal KOMODO VS. COBRA. No conjecture here. A giant komodo dragon in CGI - similar to a dog without fur - takes on a giant CGI cobra, with a group of poachers and others caught in the middle. Tree huggers take charter boat captain Michael Pare (who else?) To take them to a federal island off limits. An experiment by a mad scientist in the cultivation of very large vegetables has become an experiment to grow very large creatures, thanks to our crazy army. Now all that remains on the island are the very large creatures and the tiny and shapely daughter of the mad scientist. The group comes across her in the old plantation workshop, the monsters arrive and the hunt is open. If you watch enough Wynorski / Sci-Fi Channel movies, you will recognize some sets and positions from many other films. The acting is non-existent, as is the plot. At the very least, you can have fun looking at the badly animated composition / dog that stops on the designated victims before bursting them. The cobra hits and swallows. No imagination.
