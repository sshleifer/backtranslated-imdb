First let me tell you that I am a ghost believer, and in fact I know they exist. I have had enough experiences with them to know that they are there. <br /> <br /> What I hate are the people who carry the Bible and Religion in all this. People forget that there is more than one "Bible", thousands of religions and beliefs and different ways of interpreting what is said in the Bible. Not everyone believes in God, and not everyone believes in stereo-typical religion. <br /> <br /> Religion does not make everything done, one of the things I should mention in the Bible that many people don't know is that even the most rampant bickering in the Bible breaks the same rules written inside .... they shouldn't never wear more than one fabric at a time, slavery is OK, and you could kill your neighbor under certain circumstances. None of this, "Oh this was the Old Testament, and now we have the New Testament". If the Bible is the word of God, and cannot be changed ... there should be no changes or versions. Religion is full of misinterpretations, mixed facts and people who follow it so blindly that "There is no other way". The excuses used by the aforementioned blind followers are pathetic, or they are not able to correctly explain the discrepancies, and instead use excuses handed down to them by their Pastor or teacher. <br /> <br /> But anyway, on the review. I'm a passionate fan of "Ghost Hunters" and when I heard this show it would come soon, I was pretty excited and thought it had potential. As much as I like to watch "Ghost Hunters", I don't like some of their members, and I don't like the way they can dismiss a haunted place, yet they can't explain everything that's happening. Just because your investigative equipment doesn't pick it up, doesn't mean the camera that filmed the show didn't. I'm glad they're skeptical, but it's as if they didn't understand that just because you didn't get anything on your recorder and the movie doesn't make the place haunted or not. If Ghosts were so easy to capture, it would be known as a fact, not as a belief. It's more like "in the right place at the right time", as if there's something there, what makes you think it's going to "perform" for you? This show is pretty stupid. It's usually boring, and there's a lot of talk, lots of psychics, but something hardly happens. The protagonist's filtered narration is usually boring to listen to, or fundamentally not necessary. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the addiction to psychics is too abundant, since I believe that MANY of them are actually gifted. Silvia Brown is one of those in which I firmly believe, but most are sometimes hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to really appreciate this show, but of the few I've seen I haven't been very impressed yet.
