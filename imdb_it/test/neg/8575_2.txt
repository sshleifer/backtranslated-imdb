I don't usually like to comment on acting in a film, because it's the only thing that people who have a diary against a movie will go after. In this film, I will make an exception. The acting in this film is below average all around. I mean in the middle of the film, I wonder how the heck did the producer and / or director shoot such a group of people who can't act. Although the value of production was good, the badly written story has just added to the bad performance of the actors, and there are even mild attempts to make a change at the end of the film, which ends up being rather confusing. Are all Spanish horror movies disappointing?
