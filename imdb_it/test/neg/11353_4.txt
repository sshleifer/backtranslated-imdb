"Mararía" really disappointed me. I can't consider it a bad movie, but the development seemed too hasty and not credible to evoke emotions. The dott. Fermín shows a bizarre behavior unprecedented by passion that cannot really be understood from where it was born. I mean, how many times have you ever had a conversation with Mararía ?? Maybe once? Furthermore, Mararía never seemed to be a real character, but rather a stereotype of a film that just had to be in the film (... or was another title necessary?). Some of the best actors come from a role that was not very important for the story, that of Marcial, the sub-intelligent but humble drunk. Of course, the scenario, the cultural curiosities of the Canary Islands and other "wow" moments were interesting, but the film was not up to a documentary (in case this was its true intention) and, more importantly, like a solid drama.
