Oh my lord, what were they thinking with this. Not only is it frantically little fun, but worse, a very good original has been trashed in the real deal. Believe it or not, Jane Fonda actually turned her life's performance into that. Even better than where he plays the whore in the other so-called performance of his life. Maybe she is simply flat as a scammer. At any other time, wow, what a waste of time. But she and Segal come together beautifully, so if you have even remotely glimpsed something funny about this child, take the anvil on which he was beaten to a pulp. <br /> <br /> Because very very very little of that remains, to this horror. Nothing in this child is remotely funny except maybe a couple of moments when Dick and Jane are full of butterflies and lepers can't kiss each other ..... and uhh ........ oh my lord, is that it? Well, it looks like this. <br /> <br /> It's really a bad movie.
