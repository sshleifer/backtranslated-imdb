I can't understand why anyone should make a film like that. From the beginning to the end this film is really, really bad. <br /> <br /> The characters are all very superficial, terribly recited and definitely annoying. There is absolutely nothing under the surface of the whole with the characters or the plot. <br /> <br /> "Humor" if you can call it aimed at an adult audience (I assume from language and nudity) even if it comes across mainly as humor in the toilets and would have problems even drawing a smile from a half 16 years old. <br /> <br /> I would recommend avoiding this excuse for a play. It has absolutely nothing that a fan of cinema can like. Non-existent laughter and a non-existent plot lead me to wonder "Why was this film made, why, why, why?" <br /> <br /> I have plenty of time to see this film on top of the top 100 worst movies.
