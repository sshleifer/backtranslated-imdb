I didn't see Ishtar, but I had the misfortune to see Kevin Costner Postman, this is worse. Perhaps the absolute worst piece of trash I've ever seen, and if you look at my review for Moulin Rouge? this is saying something. Bad plot, poor acting and even wasted (although, yes, Michael Keaton has been in some of the worst movies I've ever seen), and this film has no saving value for anyone with more than half a brain. DON'T SEE IF YOU HAVE DECLARED THE 4th DEGREE as you will find an insult to your intelligence.
