I just saw this movie. I liked the soundtrack. I've seen the trailer before and it was great, like all Hollywood movies, they know how to sell. But the film is almost horrible, the first 30 minutes are interesting, but then ... like almost all new films, blow it up. Does the idea come to me because that child is dead? It's a clich√©, every nigga movie must have a child to kill and everyone has to become good after his death. LOL.I don't understand what the connection with the film is ... And it's so predictable, you know the end from the first minutes. Nothing new in this film. I saw "You got the same idea" but also ... something new ... this is something like "Honey", but it's not a small difference between them. If you have no other option, watch this movie, but make sure it's the last option you take. And the choreography is worst of all before. This is NOT a must see for sure ...
