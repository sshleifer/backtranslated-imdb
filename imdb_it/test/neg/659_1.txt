The Cheesiest movie I've ever seen, not scary, just bad. First film made by WWE, and trust me, the only person this film might like is wrestling fans. He has a terrible acting and the worst directing I've ever seen. I found myself laughing at the plot and the bad actors. I saw that the people of WWE really tried very hard to put many of the wrestling moves into the killings and different shooting effects. I think they copied a lot from Silent Hill. Even this film is not engaging, so if you saw it, you'll find yourself solving because of the lack of suspense. The ending is the worst, no matter what, you'll come out wanting your money back
