This welcoming middle-class sitcom became the object of much hatred by the new generation of talented comedians in the 1980s, such as Ben Elton. Did he deserve such malice? Well, Terry and June have never been smart, it has never been a well-written story with different threads intersecting at the end. It was the show your father and mother and probably grandparents looked at. They chuckled rather than laughed, but they had never been offended by the show, so the fact that he never challenged them was immaterial. <br /> <br /> One Foot In The Grave initially suffered because it appeared at first sight to be just another Terry and June. <br /> <br /> A few days after Terry Scott's death, an episode was broadcast on terrestrial TV, and that was his last release. There have been few replicas of the show on any TV channel. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the television comedy is presented by Terry and June. It is hard to find kind words for this - Terry Scott has made the best of weak screenplays.
