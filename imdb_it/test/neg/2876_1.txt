For me, Bollywood films are generally not that much, although they are still quite desired and Bollywood is a big producer of files because they have their own fans. <br /> <br /> The only reason that made me watch the film was to see how far an American actress could change or influence the logic behind the Indian film. Not only did it not change the story of the film, this mixture also caused ridiculous series of events. <br /> <br /> I mean that it is quite common to see a lot of illogical things through Indian films since they have their world in their film. But once you see such incidents happen to an American, it makes you laugh. For God's sake, you can believe that a famous American actress is stuck in a desperate situation and feels powerless. Can you imagine that an American actress falls in love with a dance instructor whose girlfriend has already fallen in love with the American boy and they met at the same time. There were many similar things to mention. the less I said the better. <br /> <br /> Maybe I was wrong because I was expecting too much from Indian films.
