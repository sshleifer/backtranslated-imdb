By far this must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I watch practically all the movies that come on at night (whether in the program, hbo, cinemax, etc.). "Three" AKA "Survivor Island" gives you the same suspense of looking at the dry paint just to make you fall even more miserably. If you want to feel like you've just wasted what seems like an eternity in the worst movie ever created, then look at this movie with all your senses. I must have screamed at least 900 times from the idiotic twists. If I had 4 hands I would give this film 4 inches down. <br /> <br /> In my personal opinion, I believe the only people who would like this movie were those with a terrible moral.
