Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness, had a vivid sense of description that made this book surprising. While reading this book I had the whole scene completely drawn in my head and I knew what each character looked like. This book had many pieces and when I finished reading this book it looked like the puzzle had been completed. After finishing reading Heat of Darkness, I saw the movie, which was a mistake. The film cuts out many important parts. For example, in the novel Marlow waited a long time before the rivets came to find his boat. This was a great source of futility. That part had just been left out in the film. The film added other parts that were useless and made no sense. For example, when Kurtz was talking to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz broke the monkey's neck and killed him. What was the purpose of that scene, besides making the public feel sorry for the monkey? It is as if the writer did not even read the entire book and simply put the parts he read into the film. If I hadn't read the novel before seeing the movie, I would have been completely confused. The book was fantastic and really a classic in American literature, but the film may have been a provocative candidate for the worst image of the Razzie Awards.
