As this film could be classified as Drama, I have no idea. If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen, I would try to delete it from my CV. It was historically accurate as Xena and Hercules. Abraham and Moses merge into Noah. Lotto, Abraham's nephew, Lot, dates back thousands of years before he was born. The Canaanites roamed the land ... really? What were the writers thinking? It was just ignorance ("I remember something about Noah and the animals, and Lot and Canaanites and all that Sunday School stuff") or they were trying to offend as many people as possible on the planet - from Christians, Jews and Muslims, to historians , archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists ... in fact nobody was ever offended? Anyone who had even a minimum of taste would have made a face at this!
