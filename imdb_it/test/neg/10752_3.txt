A reviewer says of those who might not like this movie that "it will be appreciated only by movie goers who are tired of the movie as a diversion". This, I believe, is rather unfair to those of us who find it boring. <br /> <br /> I didn't get tired or disillusioned with films or directors, but I found this boring and self-indulgent. But then, it is true, I am not too big for deep meaning. I feel it could have a great meaning for those who know, you know. <br /> <br /> He is very slow and spends a lot of time trying to make his single points, using the images, in fact, to do so. But these days, it seems possible that a film like this could be the kind of thing you come across in one of those dark and discouraging booths of modern art galleries, rather than on the screen of a popular cinema.
