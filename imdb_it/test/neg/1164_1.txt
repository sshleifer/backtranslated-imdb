This is the worst movie I've ever seen and you believe I took a lot of bad movies. I love the cheeey horror but this was just terrible. There wasn't a scene in this movie where I felt scared. All actors must be people who found 20 minutes before the shoot in a bus stop. I wish Blockbutser had returned my 99 cents. The acting was terrible. The writing was incredibly bad. Someone had to show this film before it was published and he had to know it was terrible. I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this monstrosity. Don't rent this movie. If you do, don't return it so that no other poor person can ever make the mistake of renting it.
