This is a pale imitation of "an officer and a gentleman". There is no chemistry between Kutcher and the unknown woman who interprets her love interest. The dialogue is of wood, the situations trite and portrayed. It's too long and the climax is anti-climatic (!). I love the USCG, its men and women are fearless and difficult. Action scenes are fantastic, but this film doesn't do much for recruitment, I'm afraid. The script is formidable, but confusing. Is Kutcher's character trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasn't his fault? Costner is raging against the death of light, but why? His "conflict" with his wife is as deep as a puddle of mud. I saw this free preview for free and I certainly felt I had the value of my money.
