I'm a big fan of prison dramas that is reflected in OZ, my favorite American TV show of all time. I imagine the attraction lies in a kind of smug voyeurism in wanting to see bad things happen in the ass of bad men, but I found Don Siegel's RIOT IN CELL BLOCK 11 rather disappointing. Ok, I knew it since it was created in 1954, it would be devoid of scurrilous language, graphic subterfuges and group rapes, but even so it is a rather weak film compared to the representation of the prison in the previous films as EVERY DAY I DIE and WHITE HEAT. The problem lies in the tone of the sermon of the film with the leader of the Dunn riot which is something of a prison reformer. Yes, it seems ridiculous since it is a violent anti-hero rather than an embrace of a tired and soft tree that does more good with a salary, but it is what it is in essence, it wants to see the detainees rehabilitated to be reunited with society rather than being forced to suffer. There is also the problem of creating a B movie with such radical themes (rather ironic that Siegel would later have made DIRTY HARRY where the only good criminal died) and that the cast is not very good with Emile Meyer as the particularly guardian irritating in his performance. like I said a disappointing movie
