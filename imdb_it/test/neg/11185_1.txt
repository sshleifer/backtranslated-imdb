How do I describe the horrors? !!! First, some points: first, this review should be taken with a pinch of salt - I saw it more than 20 years ago, when I was a boy, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm giving away some scenes and points of the plot. However, it doesn't have much plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, I don't like this kind of art film anyway. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by the proto-author Luis Bunuel. He was a surrealist and a Dadaist. These were critically popular modernist themes or movements in the 1920s and early 1930s. Surealism was the art school that made things hyper-real, but often had a Freudian symbolism. Dadaism is based on what is presumably the first word made by a child - Dada, or father. <br /> <br /> Made in black and white, it was also created by a band of communists (or as they preferred the term, socialists). Bunuel and his group of fellow filmmakers and artists worked on a series of symbolic ideas and problems in Spain and France between the world wars. Dadaism and surrealism have influenced many artists - The Police (Doo doo doo da), the poet Arthur Rambaud, Edvard Munch (The Scream), Rene Magritte (hats floating in space), Salvador Dali (dissolution watches) and even Hitchcock (Psycho). No Norman Rockwell. <br /> <br /> Here's what I remember most about this movie: a girl meets a cow; his eye is torn by a razor; clownish men cavernano in a meadow. There is not, as I said, much of a plot, but then again, this must be the point. <br /> <br /> This was attacked like a movie then, and it would be back today. One of the marks of surrealism is a significant anti-feminism.
