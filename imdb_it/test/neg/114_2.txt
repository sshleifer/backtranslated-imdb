I saw the Vh Mogul video of this. This is another one of the old distributors of the 80s, whose catalog I would like to have! <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty bad. Although entitled "Do not Look in the Attic", the main admonition that is repeated in this is "Do not go to the villa". Going to the villa grounds is a bad idea. A character doesn't go to the attic until an hour in the film, and actually he should have done it earlier because of what he learned there. <br /> <br /> The film begins in Turin, in the 1950s. Two men are fighting and a woman is telling them that the villa is having them done. One man kills the other, then he repents and the woman pulls out the knife and stabs it with it. She runs away from the villa, and after she has left a chair she moves by herself (what's the point?), But when a hand rises up on the ground in the garden and drags it into the earth. <br /> <br /> From there, it is the present, thirty years later. There is a session that suddenly appears and seems to have nothing to do with the film. The children of the prologue woman inherit the house. The main daughter is played by the same actress who played her mother. At least one of the two men in the prologue appears to recur as another character. She is obsessed with some warnings not to go to the villa, but everyone does it, because if they don't use it, they lose it. People die. A lawyer who has won all his cases tries to investigate a little. The finish is rather poor. Why was the family cursed? A film unfortunately boring. <br /> <br /> On the back of the video box is a funny little disclaimer that reads "The scenes depicted on this package could be an artist's impression and may not necessarily represent real scenes of the film film. " In this case, the cover of the box is an illustration that shows more or less accurately the subtitled scene carried by the woman mentioned above, although there are two hands and the woman is different. True, sometimes the cover has nothing to do with the film. I also remember seeing a reviewer who had a bad movie preview scale, in which films with illustrations on the cover instead of photos had at least one point for that.
