A lot of people in the cinema enjoyed this movie, but it made me feel like a misanthrope. If the smug "intellectuals" revel in their irritating sexual lives, it sounds good to you, look at it. I felt bored, but happy to have met people like that. The premise of the film was that, as with all societies or great civilizations, in the end they are destined to fail. According to the character of the female historian, who bores us with this fact, America is showing signs of decline (he admits that it goes into more detail than me). The next part of the film is about the vacuous, fatuous and asinine behavior of his friends and colleagues, and the various miseries caused by their libido behavior, with a vague attempt at humor. Many people liked this movie where I watched it. I could not relate to it.
