Wow, this version of THE RACKETEER was hard to watch! While none of the other reviews mentioned this, the public domain version I saw was seriously flawed. The soundtrack was off by about 10 seconds, which means that the dialog box and the action never approached the match. So you would hear something happen before you see it - a very confusing proposal! The worst is where you hear a gun being fired and only later is the boy struck and falls to death in a taxi. <br /> <br /> While this has seriously ruined the film, it has also focused on easier dialogue - and has also shown serious shortcomings. The dialogue was simply terrible - often delivered with almost no inflection or feeling. As one reviewer said, it was like watching a school play. A part of this is understandable, since the sound was a new medium, but the dialogue of this film was bad even compared to other films of 1929: really bad. And, like many of these early sound films, the film was too eloquent - with a sloppy and too melodramatic language and only little action. AND THINK with a title like "The Racketeer" that there would be some action !! However, it really is a corny love story - with very little action. <br /> <br /> The film finds Carol Lombard astride an alcoholic musician. She herself ends up stealing to try to take care of him - and the con man, Robert Armstrong, comes to her aid. When Armstrong captures his card cheat, he covers himself for her and then helps his drunk brother get back on his feet - and of course he falls in love with her in the process. The problem is that once the drunkard uproots, he also wants Lombard and needs to choose between them. Wow ... a drunk in recovery or a mobster ... talk about a couple of great prospects! Overall, it's a bit difficult to evaluate considering the bad print I've seen. However, even if you ignore it, the film has many problems due to its poor use of dialogue and its overly discursive nature. And ... he was also a little tired.
