One of my colleagues recommended this, implying that it was one of the scariest movies he had ever seen. I checked with my girlfriend and we gave up after about 50 minutes. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I spoke at length with my colleague (we are still friends!). <Br /> <br /> This film is as original as the last film starring Steven Seagal. It brings absolutely nothing original to the table. The spectral parts have been made thousands of times before. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw, however, is the painfully slow pace of this film. The periods between the fears are completely wasted with meaningless dialogues and a lot of ... nothing .. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10 Molotov cocktails
