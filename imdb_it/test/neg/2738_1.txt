The script of this film is indistinguishable from the others, in particular The Core, another bad movie. It is clear why Luke Perry does not have much work, but to see the beloved Lt. Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) resigned to something similar is just sad. <br /> <br /> I really can't think of a twist that can't be seen a mile away. It is not an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> The special effects are very scarce, even for television standards. The lava flow at the beginning of the film that signals the next global disaster begins things at a very amateur level. And it doesn't improve from that moment on.
