Rebecca De Mornay can be a fascinating beautiful actress, but as for the parts she has played, if you can't say something nice ... <br /> <br /> De Mornay portrays a woman who has had terrible traumas as a child with a father who can barely bear to grow up and become a brilliant brilliance. He has a relationship with Banderas, which we suspect is (ahi! How original!) A serial killer. Sometimes she remembers Banderas' mother Tippi Hedren's character in "Marnie". But I wouldn't count on it: Hitchcock died twenty-four years ago, and many regents are desperate to replace him. The director pulls out all the stops to make a thriller with an unexpected end, but that ending is so far-fetched that it's absolutely impossible to buy it. The film includes the "conversations with a serial killer" obligatory in the tradition of the "silence of the lamb", murders (humans and cats), dividing the personality and opening the finale in case the crowd should ask for more. They belong to them no, and they were right.
