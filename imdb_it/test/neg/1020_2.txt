It's the only reason to watch this movie. It gives a very good performance - much better than this shit deserves. He is very handsome and very talented - he deserves better. Also depressing is seeing Malcolm McDowell in this. He is another talented actor who deserves better but, like Esai, he gives a very good performance. So if you're a fan of both, you might want to look. Otherwise, stay away. One more complaint: couldn't we have more bare-chested Esai scenes?
