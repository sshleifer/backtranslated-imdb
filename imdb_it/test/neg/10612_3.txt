I'm not one of those people who complain every time a movie based on an old television program is released. Rather, I usually run away and see it (if I had seen the show) and try to become nostalgic. But if someone wants to find movies based on old shows, this is exhibit A (so you can actually say more than just "McHale's Navy"). "Mod Squad" is sad, tiring and lethargic. At least the original series had long been distressed before anyone knew that the boys could be so gloomy, making it revolutionary. This is just boring. Claire Danes is nice to look at, but does nothing but the mood swing and sneak around to spy on the bad guys. The extension of Giovanni Ribisi's acting in this film is that Droopy the Dog lasts for an hour and forty-five minutes. And Omar Epps seems to want to escape from the set, but the chlostrafobia of the script has trapped him. Of course, the production is beautiful, with the "rave" disco, now apparently mandatory, which opens a sequence of actions and shootings in abundance. Oh, and the children scream and get very angry with each other and even their superiors. It's a bit like deciding to use Scooby Doo's mystery machine to go on a family vacation to Hollywood with your teenagers that you and your spouse need for intensive care and prescription drugs. I really wanted to like this movie, and there were promising moments, but the next scene would suck. You can beat another Spelling remake, "Charlie's Angels", anything you want, but at least that movie knew he wanted to have fun with himself. "The Mod Squad" makes you wonder where the inspiration of the original series ended.
