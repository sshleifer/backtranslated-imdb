First of all, let me start by saying that I am a lover of Laurel and Hardy. I read all the books printed on them and saw all their movies available more than once. I even took a chance once and called Stan on the phone. He was very kind and spoke to me for over ten minutes. I followed with a letter and he wrote me a letter back. I still have that letter. <br /> <br /> This film has some good comic moments, but Stan and Ollie are not up to their usual shape. Stan was seriously ill during production and looked worse than he had ten years later. In my opinion, any film by Laurel and Hardy deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> But the final opinion of this film comes from the great Stan Laurel himself. To put it in his words, "This film should never have been made."
