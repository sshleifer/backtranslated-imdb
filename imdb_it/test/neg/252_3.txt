The reputation of "RVAM" preceded it. I heard it for the first time in one of those Medved-style movie books, "The 50 Worst Movies Ever" or "The Golden Turkey Awards", or something like that. Basically, every review of the film said that this movie was so bad that it made your eyes bleed to look at it. So when the Exposed Film Society finally proved it, I was anticipating the kind of cathartic experience that only a real smelly movie can provide. <br /> <br /> However, "Robot" was not so bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, this is definitely a "Z" movie for everything. Some of the vocal dubbings (as usually happens with K. Gordon Murray's imports) are terribly mischievous, and the film itself seems structurally a kind of Frankenstein, since a huge portion of it seems to be the film of a precedent " Aztec Mummy ", narrated with a voice off the main man. A dead gift: at any time the question "So what happened?" you are asked more than twice in the dialog box, you are looking at a recomposed movie put together with a minimum of attention to the consistency of the plot or to the quantity of motion. In RVAM, "So what happened?" or "What happened then?" it is pronounced at least four times in the first hour. <br /> <br /> Even without the structural problems, the plot and dialogue do not translate well into an older American audience. For example, as the hero explains (and explains and explains) the background. includes an observation about Dr. Krupp, "a doctor who suddenly turned into an evil criminal master" and began his search for the treasure that the Aztec mummate guards. No priority, no explanation, simply "suddenly turned bad". Obviously, this was aimed at a rather indiscriminate audience. <br /> <br /> The clincher, however, is the "Robot", the alleged "showcase" of this film. This robot is the worst special effect of the robots from the "submarine kingdom" or even "Santa Claus against the Martians". Compared to this piece of junk, the Tin Man of "Wizard Of Oz" looked like the Terminator frame that chased Linda Connor through the T2 foundry. The same Aztec mummy is well designed and executed; he is recognizably not dead, familiar enough to look like a mummy, yet distinct from the "Boris Karloff" bandage collection familiar to most of the American public. But those who designed the robot in this follow-up did not hear the concept ... or the budget. They could at least give him knees, for heaven's sake. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the titular battle is terribly executed and lasts less than 60 seconds. (I've seen games being pushed into younger playing fields that are more convincing.) So the film stops in practice. It seems a little repugnant considering the amount of time the film spends on the battle itself. <br /> <br /> Despite all these problems, the film is not horrible or incompetent as Coleman Francis's film or a Larry Buchanan film was. Compared to "Monster A-Go-Go" or "Attack of the Eye Creatures", "RVTAM" is like a Coppola movie. It's just a little boring, boring and silly. Actors are competent (in a way of film series B) and reasonably photogenic; Dr. Krupp, in particular, is having a great time with his waffles and textures and capers in his "Phantom Of the Opera" cloak and dress. I often found myself rooting for him, despite being the villain. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I've seen much, much worse. File with "Samson Vs The Vampire Women", under "interesting Mexican youthful oddities".
