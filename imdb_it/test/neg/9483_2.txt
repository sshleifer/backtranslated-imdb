the boys were the most tempting things about the whole movie. the girls were lame and pathetic, I mean, how can they have their own line of clothing, dolls, movies, production studios and not smell this bomb from far away? to get a sort of responsibility, which I don't really see the sense in the punishment ..., are sent to Paris, very far from home to live with the so-called severe grandfather who holds an important position with Paris. I don't really remember what it was, so who really cares? the detail does not help, the girls are sent to Paris to learn something .. so what exactly do they learn when they meet two French and are able to manipulate the guy who should watch them so they can meet these guys on scooters? the typical pre-teen movie, with all the pre-teens who want to behave badly and be able to afford the trip to Paris or some distant country away from their parents? I don't really like olsen, they never managed to shake off the image of michelle, on the full house ... in case you didn't see it, then you were lucky from the start. (F F-)
