I'm sorry, but I can't understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they thought it was "Ethan Mao". I saw better acting, character and development of the plot in porn! ATTENTION: I intend to give away a key element to the "plot". After holding his family hostage during the night, Ethan lets go of his hateful, wicked and stubborn stepmother in the bank - ONE !!! - to retrieve the jewelery piece of his late mother who so desperately wishes. Guess what? You call the police! Wow ... what a twist! I couldn't see it at all. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that less than 90 minutes have passed. <br /> <br /> Pure, pure trash!
