I'll be honest: the purple floor pimp with Snoop Dogg at the helm is a fun visual gag. It would have been a decent concept for a 30 second commercial video, or maybe a 3 minute music video. But the producers have committed the age-old concept of comedy, the shame of lengthening 30 seconds of material in an hour and a half of film, and the results are predictably lame. The rest of the 89 minutes are full of the typical range of racist and sexist humor and fart jokes, offensive and - worst of all - painfully little fun. The frayed plot screams under the weight of his devices. Better to be avoided unless you are drunk or stoned.
