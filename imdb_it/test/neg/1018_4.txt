The DVD of this film is from Alpha Video, a company that almost always publishes the poorest quality prints. In defense of Alpha, this is often the only press available, but specializes in films in the public and economic domain. If you can find another print from a different company, check first how the print of this film is scratchy and faded. However, compared to most of the Alpha DVDs, this is excellent - especially since the sound is quite clear (and Alpha never seems to include subtitles - even with films with horrid sounds). <br /> <br /> went out with a lady for a long time. One night, he's a bad boy and he spends the night with another woman. Soon after, he gets clean to his girlfriend about this, she forgives him and they get married. <br /> <br /> Very soon after the wedding, he receives a frantic call from the other woman - he NEEDS to see it and has just tried to kill himself. When they meet, he finds out that she has an STD and she wanted him to know that he too could now have it. Then, even if there is a nurse there and they are treating her for the suicide attempt, she somehow finds a gun and kills herself! The makes a huge mistake. He does not tell his doctor and does not tell his new wife. Spend some time and now you and the baby are infected! At this point, the doctor meets with the boy and talks about the importance of being treated and shows him rooms full of horribly infected people (actually, these were only films of people with sexually transmitted diseases that they implanted in the film - the most who have syphilis). <br /> <br /> In a sense the film is very progressive. He faces a serious problem and it is interesting how the film encourages couples not to wait to get married but to marry quickly and give in to those sexual urges - but only between them (not bad advice). On the other hand, the film never says exactly what you're talking about. They never use the terms STD, VD or similar, nor do they even name diseases. It often refers to syphilis, but other times it speaks of herpes or other sexually transmitted diseases - the information is not very clear or specific - a VERY common problem with films of this period. Viewers at the time had to feel rather confused about what they were seeing and many of the more naive probably needed to have some of their 'faster' friends explain everything to them! <br /> <br /> Speaking of "such films", in the 30s and 50s, many small and often squalid production houses made films denigrating the dangers of drugs and sex (although they often only wanted to promise a little cheesecake for the public that usually didn't see a rate so lively in Hollywood movies). Many of these are hysterically funny since they are so rigged and the information so inaccurate. The most famous examples are REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS (both from the same two-bit production company) and compared to how stupid and stupid those two films are, this low-cost movie seems to be in the Criterion Collection !! <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that there are weirdos out there (I would certainly be included among them) who like to watch movies because they are so bad and so horribly made that they are very funny. This, however, is not so bad, nor is the message that it is complicated and the victims' film is not as grotesque as some similar films. Although the message should have been more explicit and useful, for a 1933 film it is pretty good, despite the occasionally mediocre acting and the ridiculous suicide scene. Remember the children - just say "NO" to suicide! <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, the "two years of treatment" they talk about in the film was actually the norm for syphilis in 1933. Today, it is much more treatable - as are the other STDs.
