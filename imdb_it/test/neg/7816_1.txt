This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There's so much at home that it goes wrong that it wouldn't happen it's not even funny. Of course, this is a film that means that things that will not happen in normal life happen here, however this film is more exaggerated than the theories that no child left behind is working. All these people are in the house and no one has noticed another, not to mention the damn owl that seems to arrive everywhere but in its cage. I could take care of an owl joke the first few times, but after an hour I can't stand it, I'd rather kill myself than see that damn owl again. Did I laugh during this movie? no. Not even once? no. Horrible, horrible, horrible. The fact that this pile of rubbish is plugged with Ashton Kutcher that bends his head and removes his pants in front of everyone makes this film worse. But wait, the day is saved because the owl can fly. WOW FANTASTIC! Anyway, I give a little credit to this movie, it's not as bad as Epic Movie .....
