I just don't know how this stupid, disgusting, garbage, garbage and good for nothing film is a hit. He was so boring with a very, very weak plot (or not) and it wasn't even funny. The film was about 135 minutes of a single paragraph of history on Prem (Salman Khan) is a love guru and is helping the defenseless and romantic Bhaskar (Govinda) to take the girl he wants. I'm not saying that I didn't like the film because it wasn't fun or anything, I'll accept a movie that isn't funny but has a decent story. The only two reasons why I can say that it is super-successful are: <br /> <br /> 1. Salman Khan and Govinda are on the screen together but the first time together was in Salaam and Ishq, which was a flop therefore cannot be. But it was a really nice movie. <br /> <br /> 2. The name of Salman Khan is Prem and all the films with that name were a hit including the Maine Pyar Kiya. So it's just luck. I heard it's a Hitch remake, I didn't see it and I'm glad I didn't. The music is OK, the only good songs are Want a partner, You're my love and Soni De Nakhre but what good is it in a really bad movie, even that, if you have someone like Katrina Kaif dancing with two feet left? She is completely crappy. Nor does he know acting, language (his voice is always nicknamed for her), dances and never fails to amaze. I don't like it being a bit disappointing for Koffee with Karan. Overall Partner is a disposable film with a disposable actress Katrina Kaif. It's better to get kicked out of Bollywood and never come back.
