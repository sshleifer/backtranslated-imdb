I was shocked to read all these wonderful comments on this film because I hated it. I put it to the end, but it was painful ... especially having to listen to that child's voice. As Socact-1 noted, even though the girl claimed to be from Chicago, she didn't have a Chicago accent - she seemed more like she was trying to imitate a NY accent - but couldn't. I was so confused that I was waiting for the punch line. Of all the wonderful actors that could have played that child, why did they choose this? And why force her to talk like that? It wasn't even the accent, it was the script, the monologue created for her. The reason I chose this film is that the idea of ​​the plot fascinated me: this was in history, the kind of poor and ignorant characters, the setting and the love triangle. As far as I am concerned, it could and should have been much better. I was just sooo relieved to read that at least one other person felt the same way I did it for this movie.
