This film has shaken my will to live because this abomination is not the list of the 100 at the bottom that I don't know. <br /> <br /> My life has been saved by the healing power of danny trejo. <br /> <br /> Worst movie ever, I challenge you to watch. It's like a 90-minute collection that calls commercial, only much worse. I prefer to look at the blue screen, it's really so ugly
