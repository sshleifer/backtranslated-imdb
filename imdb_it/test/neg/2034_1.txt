It is the first morning of our discontent, and some of my friends and I have just finished watching "The Wind". Truly a catastrophic film. Not in the sense of forces of nature that sow panic over an unsuspecting population, but rather a terrible film that is devastating an unsuspecting public. To give you an indication of how frustrating it was to watch this particular bomb, I will quote you an example quoted during my first suffering. If given the opportunity to watch this film for the second time and, for example, to boil, I am afraid to say that the choice would not be immediate. But rather than doing "ad peliculam" with bad jokes, I will try to understand why exactly my friends and I took a look at this particular film. <br /> <br /> To start with, I like low-budget horror movies. I also like low-cost artistic and horror gestures. I liked "Cold Hearts", "Midnight Mass", "Jugular Wine", etc. Ambitious and daring films, even though they lacked production, execution and even acting value. Generally, an interesting premise, an unusual shooting technique or just a well-made scene or two will save a film that moves a little roughly. Keeping these predictions in mind, I would like to say conclusively that I hated "The Wind". <br /> <br /> The film was probably the most disappointing, in the sense that it was incredibly frustrating to watch. From the actions of the main characters, to the flow (?) Of the plot, to the great portents suggested by the opening that in the end aspired to dust (and did not even logically cling to what happened in the rest of the film, and left the viewer, expecting something more, with a sense of a lot of noise for nothing). The dialogue was questionable at best, delivered in wood and completely unrealistic. By this I mean, no one in any of the situations where the characters were present would react as the characters did, or he said the things they said in the way they said them. There was a clear lack of vision and direction that would correct this problem. <br /> <br /> The interaction and development of the characters have been abysmal. Claire, the "goddess of lambent sex", or so the aggravating and passive-aggressive critics of the film thought, was so blatant in her manipulations that she might even have thrown a gun at the characters. However, she was the pinnacle of the film. The other main characters (with the exception of Mick's Milfy Mom, which was not terrible) are so indistinct that they could even have been played by the same actor. Let's see if I missed something: borderline personality, co-submissive gozzoni with deep feelings of sexual confusion and inadequacy, spurred on by puerile anger through the artless orchestrations of a Californian with loose lips - suddenly-and-stubbornly transformed. No, I think that concerns you. <br /> <br /> Lack of purpose was also problematic. How those involved in the making of this film expect the casual viewer to deduce that this was the beginning of the end of the world from this amateur amateur pentagon, incredible, badly described (well, what would you call it?) Which occurred largely in the woods in the middle of nowhere? There were no witnesses to the "atrocities" presented. There were no witnesses anywhere in this film. <br /> <br /> The credibility problems resulting from this lack of attention to detail have also been spread from the point where the plot begins to fall ill. Case-in-point: if that guy Bob took that road through the woods to get home from the gym, and here's the key, **** every day ****, there's a good chance someone else would been around to see something at some point later, while the perpetrators openly discussed the crime scene. One might think that with the murder of a young man in the woods, that city would have been in turmoil, the characters would have been interrogated, etc. But instead, there was not a witness in sight (besides Earl, the psychopathic wardrobe without interior monologue). We suggest that there are no witnesses * for * this film, either. <br /> <br /> As for the quasi-homosexual mazes present, I don't even have problems with those. It's not as if they were a surprise, considering we were screaming about most male characters from the second scene. Again, not problematic in and of itself, but thrown for the wrong reasons. It was absolutely useless, thrown out of pure "shock" and / or "dangerous art" value, and neither shocking nor dangerously artistic from any perspective. What we had instead was an awkward attempt to redeem a boring and awkward movie with a boring and clumsy plot. The little-known sexual tension, which has only been hinted at heavily in anticipation of this flaccid snogging scene, has only pushed this film further down the totem from the "mediocrity that justifies the criticism" to "the movie that sucks so badly that it lacks the inherent grace to suck enough to mock and harank adequately. "<br /> <br /> So it is with most of the film, a lot of artistic fiddling, very little meat and a lot of exasperation. It's not that we don't understand. Oh, we have it, all right. We simply don't want it. Look, the very fact that we were cheering up the club in the final scene like the tableau * only * that made sense on his face indicates something terribly wrong with this movie. Rather than moving as fast as the name suggests, this film dripped languidly forward like the trail of sweat that runs down the side of the nose while the hands are full. Argh. That feeling very well sums up the intestinal frustration that was created during the vision of this train disaster. There is no breath of fresh air about this film, only the stale miasma of badly realized bad ideas, putrefied before coming to fruition.
