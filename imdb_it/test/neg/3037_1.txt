Unlike most reviewers, I hated this film, simply because the writer / director's inflated ego was an otherwise potentially interesting topic. Too many fans of the film identify "EXTREME self-indulgence" with "movie GENIUS!", But I don't buy myself into that cult of personality. A film should be about the subject, not the director (unless it's a Woody Allen film, of course). * SPOILER * (which is just as good, save your time ...) There is nothing brilliant about showing you the long star of porn you know, what in the last frame, which is actually called a tacky maneuver that SCREAMS hackism of film school. <br /> <br /> The poseur fist has achieved the status of "great film" based on its indulgence and its harassment to the public ?? which, first of all, is the writer / director. But the rest of the public should look down on the grumpy and brutal nature of porn porn. The film had a detached angle for the porn industry, observing all the players it could have hit. It doesn't matter, I love your writer / director. I love those four-minute steadicam segments, which should show the energy of the moment, but somehow they had all the verve of a switch. I love the story - no matter how boring it is - for the magician's rise and the sordid fall of a porn star. But look up too, of course. While the subject has the potential to be fascinating ?? innocence, money, degradation, beauty - your lovely writer / director has somehow managed to make it all look DULL again. Partly because of its durability. Here is something your copyright hero HAS NOT proven: Give the size of the characters. O soul. Everything to EVERYTHING for a hoot, apart from Genius That Paul Is, of course. But I'm not buying. I do not buy the indulgent hacks with amazing clamor. <br /> <br /> Another piece of copyright hackers too long, with fifty times more hype than quality. I know some of you agree. The rest will probably see this indulgent blow again. It's not my problem.
