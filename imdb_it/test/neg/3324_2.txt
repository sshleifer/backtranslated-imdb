I should have known when I heard that Anne Rice had left the project and that the film would disappoint me. I could not have foreseen that years after its release only the thought of the film still angers me. The novels are fantastic and, while I understand that much is lost in the translation on the screen, this film was a big middle finger for his original work. I hope that one day someone will try again, in the right way, starting with The Vampire Lestat. The roles and appearance of the main and minor characters change in the same way without a good reason. They destroy the history of Lestat. The Queen's acting is exaggerated to the point of becoming a comedy, but I can't make myself laugh. The charm and the charm of the novels is simply not there. The film is a bad excuse to put together so many "obscure" musicians and images in one film, hoping that the Goths of America teenagers would stone him. Part of the charm of the first film, of Louis's story, is that he is caught between his humanity and his curse. Lestat should take over and show the magic and excitement of the vampire world. Thank God I read the books first, or I would never have touched them after this movie.
