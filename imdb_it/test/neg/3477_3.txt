This documentary attempts comedy, but it never gets enough for me. Field? Ehn, maybe. The most appropriate word that everyone will agree on and try to avoid in every review is kitsch. Kitsch dripped. It was as if the filmmakers had feared that their viewers would take the film too seriously, and so they leaned back to insert kitsch and proclaim: "We're kidding here! See ???" <br /> <br /> In short, I felt he was trying too hard. For example, the sock puppets that introduced each scene were (to me) annoying when I'm sure they had to be funny - or at least (ehm) kitsch-ey. <br /> <br /> No, however, avoid this movie based on my complaints. Just be ready to have fun with kitsch rather than pushing yourself unprepared. If you are interested in light cooking, you could do much, much worse. At the very least, the facts surrounding the rise and fall of the Bakers make this interesting and worthy of consideration. In the best case, the herds of kitsch-like lovers with similar mentality will heat up and scream about pieces chosen during the film.
