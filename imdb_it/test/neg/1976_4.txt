So, after the initial disappointment for the first Final Fantasy film, which seemed to have no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children got rid of a warm welcome and, now, of a group of dedicated fans . And the reason for the film's success is understandable as it has lush graphics, fast-paced combat sequences and fantastic characters. However, if you've never played FF7, chances are you won't like this movie because the storyline continues from the game without a previous explanation and you could lose yourself from the plot even if you played. Secondly, there is no character development, without previous knowledge of the game your opinions about the characters are limited to "cool" and "not cool". Of course, for FF7 fans the film is almost guaranteed to entertain, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it's nice to see all the characters you've learned to love from the game made in a truly amazing computer animation. One last complaint, the film, at least in my opinion, has tried to cram too much in less than two hours, so the last half hour seems horribly rushed. If you played and enjoyed FF7 rather than a useful watch, although nothing too special. If you haven't played FF7, you'd better play it before watching this movie.
