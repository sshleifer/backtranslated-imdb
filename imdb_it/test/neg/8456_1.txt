So you have a number of models on an island, and one by one they are chosen in Agatha Christie style. We lost someone at sea, pushed by a cliff, poisoned by a solvent, thrown by a cliff, blown up, etc. Nothing terribly graphic. <br /> <br /> Before one of these begins, a woman inexplicably has a dream of a murderer in a strange human mask. <br /> <br /> The owner of the magazine is a squalid one who had an affair and someone took pictures of her before she came of age. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's about business, or something like that, <br /> <br /> There's a 80s-style montage of a photo shoot, most of the costumes from bathroom are unique pieces, surprisingly. A couple is quite translucent. During editing there are camera clicks where the camera frame appears as a white square or a rectangle inside the image. The photographer is pretty bad at framing!
