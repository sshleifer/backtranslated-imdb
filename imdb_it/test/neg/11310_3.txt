Only one word can describe MR MAGOO - slapstick. Unfortunately this is not an AIRPLANE. Looks can be decided, and that's exactly what MR MAGOO does. Based on the old cartoon, Leslie Nielson plays Magoo, an almost clumsy blind man who comes across a couple of jewel thieves. Now he has to hunt them down ... basically blindness. And that's all that this movie plays. The blindness of MR MAGOO. Now, maybe, if they had funny jokes involving this, but more or less it's just one of those "stupid smiles on your face because you're too ashamed to admit you paid to watch this" movie. <br /> <br /> But MR MAGOO is not as bad as it was hacked. At least it has funny jokes, and it's good fun for the whole family (Nielson tried to make a "NAKED GUN" for families in MAGOO, but it's not as good as that). So see it once, you could hate it, you could love it, anything. Personally, I didn't hate it, but I certainly didn't like it, or even judged it "okay". 2/5 stars for MR MAGOO- <br /> <br /> JOHN ULMER
