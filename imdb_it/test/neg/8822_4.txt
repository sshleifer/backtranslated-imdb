Strange, often effective hippie zombie movie with the unforgettable pair of Alan and Anya Ornsby, this film is not as bad as most of its genre, but it is still very much at the top of the cheese factor. It includes several basic bargain zombies, outrageously campy dialogues, a chewing performance by Alan Ormsby, several gay / perverse grave robbers and an extravagant soundtrack. His wife Anya does such a strange performance, one has to wonder if she really acts. There are many worse photos of this type during the era (look for an Al Adamson fig), but it is not the Night of the Living Dead. The director / writer "Benjamin" Clark, is really Bob Clark, who continued to create the purest juvenile exploitation disasters of "Porky's" in the early 80s. He has just re-emerged after 1 inexplicably good film ("A Christmas Story") to return to his terrible ways with "Baby Genius". Weirdo Alan Ormsby later wrote the vicious version of Nastasia Kinski / Malcolm McDowell of "Cat People". Moocow says to watch this hippy horror movie for fun, zombie jokes and campy dialogues: = 8)
