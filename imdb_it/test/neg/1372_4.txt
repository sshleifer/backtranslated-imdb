This show reminds me of an episode of "The Simpsons", in which Smithers had just been fired from Mr. Burns and was forced to live a miserable life being unemployed. All he did while the hours were to drink and watch Comedy Central. The implication was that Comedy Central was a pathetic television channel for unhappy people who had nothing else to do to occupy their time. "Mind of Mencia" is slightly better than most of the Comedy Central programming, but it still represents an example of why this channel is of low quality filling for people who have no lives. <br /> <br /> To be sure, Mencia is a fairly competent comedian who brings out trivial and soft ethnic jokes and collects on bland stereotypes of people based on their race, gender or economic status or a combination of two on three of these features. If you've heard one of these jokes from one of your friends at the bar or at work, believe me, you've heard what goes on as a comedy in "Mind of Mencia". Carlos also tries to make fun of current events, but lacks creativity or originality. This does not mean that Carlos is always a failure. I found some of his funny skits, like his portrait of a rap video like an oil sheik. If you find a bland and banal comedy, you'll probably like "Mind of Mencia". For those who are tired of repetitive and pedestrian walkers who are trotting the usual jokes consumed by time, stay away.
