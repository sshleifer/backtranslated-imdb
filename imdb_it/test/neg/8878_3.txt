This is not exactly a complicated story. It is not a mystery, or a plot that you have to spend time looking at because you have lost an intrinsic part of the dialogue. Stating that a film must be seen several times for you "to have it" can be applied to very few films, but this is not one of them. Those types of films have substance and are so engaging that it's easy to miss an important part of the dialogue, or a subtle nuance to trace the details that you might have overlooked. This does not apply to Goya's Ghosts. The main flaw of this film is the absence of details. Jump from one character to another, never giving enough substance to any set of scenes to allow the viewer to get involved. For this reason, you don't connect with any of the characters. You don't get to the point where you care. Or the main actor is gone just as it seems that the film is redeeming itself, or that their actions are contemptible and you are not inclined to do so anyway. Goya's refusal to go very far to help Ines is a good example. His refusal to engage further reflects the general tone of his part. The only characters you could momentarily try are Ines, when she is interrogated and then tortured. After his rape by Lorenzo, any attention to his character is practically over. Later the only other deep involvement comes from the best scenes in the film centered on Lorenzo's invitation to dinner with the Ines family, and all his fathers try to force Lorenzo to sign a confused confession and bring his daughter back. So as things start to develop again, they disappeared from the movie. I read a lot of comments here about how the film didn't know what it wanted to be, etc. I found that basically he could not be more than nothing. Since Lorenzo's return and Goya's casual vision of Ines's daughter, everything seemed nothing more than artificial. Without much of a plot, no effort to really examine the turbulent times in which they lived took place. The essence of who Goya was did not materialize, apart from his actions, or lack thereof, showing that he was more self-centered than anything else. As for his art, the film seemed intent on examining some of his paintings, but again it dissipated another opportunity in examining the reactions to this work rather than the work itself. To better summarize things, the film had no cohesion, the substance was grossly lacking to investigate the covered historical environment and, in the end, it left you as if you had just seen a series of aborted attempts to involve the viewer moving from one thing to another without properly involving the viewer in any of them. It is not possible to look at something like this several times expecting it to improve with a more thorough examination. There isn't enough to waste time. There is no need to lose anything, it would only be more proof that the ingredients needed to make this film good are simply not there. What about the best film ever made? It's not even the best movie I've seen today.
