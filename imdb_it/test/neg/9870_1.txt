this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. this movie goes beyond the ridiculous, it's as if the director wanted to fuck his ass by the actors to misinterpret their roles as the fantastic four, I think the movie should have been released in comic book stores for the only way you should say it, desperate geeks who can't get enough cravings and want to see more and more shitty movies. In conclusion to my statements and thesis on the paradox, I believe that this film had great disadvantages for the future of the cast contributors, with the exception of the character of Jay Underwood, in which I believe it was his best interpretation, considering roles such as not entirely human films in which the story is told in a way that has no character. He cannot act, and people have made good decisions not to go and see his films, which is why it is very likely that he will have no huge role, unless he takes his career in a rarer way, but interesting.
