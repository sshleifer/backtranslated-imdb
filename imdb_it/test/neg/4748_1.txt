With this film I really hoped that the idea was to compensate for the ineptitude of the first AVP, and yet to my horror: Requiem is much worse than I could have imagined. <br /> <br /> My hopes were in the opening moments of the movie inside the Predator ship, and I almost breathed a sigh of relief when we finally saw the Predator home world (a digital opaque painting uses and throws, but still nice to see it finally) and then, of course, humans (if they can refer to these badly written characters) are introduced ... <br /> <br /> One must ask why it is impossible for Fox make a good movie with Aliens and Predators. At least the supposed directors could have done their homework. <br /> <br /> The characters are set up the same way we would expect from the worst Friday, 13th Sequel. The pizza delivery scene was indecent, like any other scene of interaction between the characters that followed him. Bimbos and non-actor teenagers do not make a REAL film, create an economic movie, and Alien 1-3 and Predator movies are good because they were produced above the concept (remember that the first Alien is a "B" movie made like a film "A") The Strause brothers have really missed an opportunity, which could have been rectified by simply knowing their roots. Alien + Predator: in both the Alien and Predator films there are introduced characters that are part of a larger group (Alien : Refinery workers, Aliens: Marines, Alien 3: Convicts and in the Predator movies we generally follow a part of the main hero of a unit: Predator, Arnold - Special forces, Predator 2: Danny Glover, Police) and it's easy to see where the directors of both franchises have started to make mistakes: in Alien Ressurrection we have pirates ... or something, AVP we have ... explorers? ... with guns ?? and of course in AVP-R we have cliches for kids. What is there to identify here? In the concept, the idea of ​​a prisoner returning to a small town and a returning veterinarian seemed like a set up for a First Blood action hero, but like many things he never paid off. <br /> <br /> The film -making is equally without rhyme of reason. There is no sense of pushing forward towards the action, just small sequences that build the tiniest levels of tension or interest just to cut away when they get interesting ... taking the audience out of the movie at every turn. The action scenes themselves, though very burrate in the trailers, are so illuminated by darkness, it's literally impossible to tell what's going on during the fight scenes when they finally show up. Basically, the film is hampered by many levels. The bad actors combined with a bad direction and an atrocious script (which I noticed myself as a screenwriter, I noticed striking every wrong note and cliché that only the most talented writer without ideas could combine together) so called, it is not even directed to video quality, nor does it show a modicum of respect for the established tradition of the previous entries in the series. Why do Predaliens suddenly have the ability to shoot alien embryos along the throat of a pregnant woman to use it as an incubator for jackals? More than likely because the brainwriter needed a way to have more aliens for the predator to fight (and given the accelerated growth time even more than the first AVP: as quickly as possible.) Because insignificant chatter between the cardboard cutouts on the sticks (in the sense that the alleged characters) replace the development of the real character? (Remember that a character is defined by what you DO, not SAY). Why is the sheriff leading civilians to a weapons depot (isn't he a law officer? How does the child of all people know where they are? Why do the Predalien wait for the Predator to REMOVE his mask VERY SLOWLY before attacking? Why do aliens still fall into that bad post-Alien series 3 habit of hissing all the time to let the prey know to run? Why this series was donated to a character who said "People are dying ... we need them the guns! "(how this writer works too goes beyond me and reflects badly on Fox already destroyed artistic reputation. It's like everyone involved in the making of this film has suffered from mental impairments or is really inept at all levels of the production process cinematographic. <br /> <br /> EFFECTS are pretty bad this time around. Aliens look like men in suits and ADI is getting lazy with their creature design. leftovers modified by Alien Resurrection, with the same bulky muscles around the arms as if they had not learned from that film that it was not a good project, nor a good one to recycle. Again, everything is wrapped in such a state of darkness so as not to create mystery or atmosphere, but simply to hide how bad the creatures are. And just like in the AVP, Stan Winston is definitely missing when the fake Predator face is revealed. <br /> <br /> There are too many mistakes to list so I'll just say this: don't waste your money on this movie. Fox doesn't care about the fans, because this cheap and scruffy movie is clearly the proof. I felt bad having taken my girlfriend to see him (even though it was free) and apologized profusely to her afterwards. This is a huge fan who has finished with the franchise. <br /> <br /> Note for Fox: What we really wanted was not a meaningless film, it was a film adaptation of the original Darkhorse Comicbook, which was better than anything you produced for this post 1993 franchise. <br /> <br /> Signature.
