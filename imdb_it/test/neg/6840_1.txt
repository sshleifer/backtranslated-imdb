Among all the many problems that make this a terrible piece of celluloid is the most stupid plot device in the recent history of cinema. Richard Gere determines who the true objective of the Jackal is through some form of revelation. He doesn't do anything, it's just for him. In case of doubt "He is chasing the First Lady!" This film blows pieces.
