I have to admit I'm disappointed after seeing this movie. I was expecting a lot more from the trailers. The film was absolutely horrible. There was no real plot and the acting wasn't exactly the best. Do not waste time. The film is not what the trailers make you think it is. I have to say that I usually don't write anything about movies on IMDb (actually this is my first one), but this film was so disappointing that I only registered to let people know not to waste time and money. The plot is that of a robbery that must happen and it seems to have the potential to be good, but the things that happen in the film are a bit far-fetched to be credible. Look at another movie, maybe the inner man ???
