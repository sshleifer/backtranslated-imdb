Evan Almighty continues the traditional Bruce Omnipotent series, this time with a journalist who has returned from Freshman Congressman of Buffalo, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), in his center. A totally harmless man (and not really able to self-doubt), God (Morgan Freeman) decides to impose some sort of research on Baxter, to illustrate the importance of ... mutual kindness, so that Baxter can "change the world "(aka, pay it forward). <br /> <br /> Think of Evan Almighty as a healthy derivative of "Distinguished Gentlemen". Baxter is not a scammer, but his colleague, Congressman Long (John Goodman), wants his undisputed support on a bill that is essentially harmful to the environment. And well-intentioned, Baxter, knowing the importance of networking and visibility, is willing to support it. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, with the new job comes more responsibility, and in a sense Baxter is defamed for not having spent enough time with his family. <br /> <br /> So God, decide to give Evan Baxter some advice, forcing him to become the modern Noah. His orders: build an ark. Except that, although it may seem a bit humorous to see Baxter's transformation into the "weirdo with a beard", there seems to be not much to say about everything that becomes abundantly clearer when the film's climax goes out. (SPOILERS: if no one of the population is killed by the "deluge", then what was the point of calling the animals ... or at least those that obviously weren't from the outskirts of Virginia? Or, more importantly, if all the Baxters had to realize that Long's designs were false in their quality, so why did he have to build an ark?). <br /> <br /> So, even if a comedy like this doesn't have to be a hysterical laugh, it was definitely made a lot less pleasant because it was full of too many homilies (and not all of Morgan Freeman) and actions that seemed destined to a film of more epic events.
