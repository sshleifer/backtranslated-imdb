This film was absolutely horrible. Stupid premise and horrible acting by all. Anyone who has written this garbage should be hanged. It reminds me of a student hacker movie, BUT HE GREETS. Who ever produced this should give up now. I know that opinions are subjective and all, and some might think that this "fantastic", like some think that "Dune (1984)" was fantastic, ride down and watch some real movies. OK, acting was tolerable, and with better direction it could have been a lot better, but that's not how it suffers. I don't know how much more I can say about this waste of film, if not to throw it out completely. However it was horrible and I advise you to avoid it like the plague, if you come from somewhere near "Dreamland", rent the next movie instead.
