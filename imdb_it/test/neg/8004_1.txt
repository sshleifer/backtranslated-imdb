This film could be far better if they didn't use Brian Conley as a gangster and if they hadn't started the movie with Christopher Biggins. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie I had absolutely no idea what was going on. There were too many double crosses and twists to make the film credible. The film deserves a 0, but since there's no 0 I gave it a 1. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy, I'd rather hit my eyes with some rusty scissors than watch new this movie. I'm telling you, it's been an hour and a half of my life that I won't come back. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a gangster movie, don't understand it. Look instead at "Going Off Big Time" or "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels".
