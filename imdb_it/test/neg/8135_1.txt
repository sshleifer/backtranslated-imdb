I went into Heart Of Gold thinking I was going to see a documentary about Neil Young. Instead, I witnessed a selfish tribute to the arrogance of older baby boomers who lost their edge and forgot their roots. Much appreciated by older baby boom critics, directed and performed by younger baby boomers, Heart Of Gold is a festive event from start to finish, that is, if you can sit for the whole movie close to 2 hours. Neil Young and the crew have long lost their advantage and want the rest of us to join them in a rocking chair stuffed with medium-high mediocrity. What happened to the vulgar guitar of his previous solo commitments? I guess all his boxes of fuzz are rusty and his vacuum tubes exploded in the hot air of his generation. As for Demme, is this the daring director of Something Wild and Melvin And Howard? A student director could have made a bolder film than this poorly displayed surface performance film. Don't waste your $$ on Heart Of Gold and go directly to The Last Waltz and Gimmie Shelter. And if you really want to explore the personality of a rock and roll icon, scan a copy of Chuck Berry: Hail Hail Rock And Roll which is definitely out of print. And baby boomers, don't worry about how this review is tired of someone younger. I too am one of those baby boomers who listened to Cinnamon Girl on acid and danced in the streets up to the Street Fighting Man of the Stones. Go back and look at Do not Look Back or Gimmie Shelter and then come back and tell me that Heart of Gold has some value as a document.
