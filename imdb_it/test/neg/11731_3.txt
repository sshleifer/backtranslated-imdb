The first review I saw on IMDB says that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins in this role. It makes me think if he saw the original. It's difficult to review Psycho if you don't have the perspective of how revolutionary the film was in 1960. You have a heroine who is not very nice and is killed not very far in the film and a bad guy who is creepy, but makes you try for him . Add some graphic violence and you'll have a blue print for some of the slasher movies of the 80s and 90s. <br /> <br /> Where does this film end? Let's start with the casting. Anne Heche is fine as a Vivian Crane, but like Norman Bates, Vince Vaughn is wrong. First, it looks too young. Secondly, he has no idea how to play shooting. His nervous laugh reminds me of Ron Howard trying to play a tough guy on Happy Days. Everything that makes you scream I did it! The original film, even for those who know everything about it, still makes you feel uncomfortable with the mother's influence on Norman, and turns it into a true separate character. What about the shower scene? When I finally saw the 1960 movie on a big screen, I was surprised by his power to scare me to death. The soundtrack of Bernard Herrman becomes incredibly sharp and noisy and goes further to scare you than Danny Elfman's performances during the scene. This shower scene only serves to show us the naked body of Anne Heche and a beautiful blood color. Which brings us to the choice of filming in color. It did not work. <br /> <br /> There is something in the remake of classic films that almost never seems to work. Some might see this as a noble experiment, but honestly, if Gus Van Sant had nothing to add to this film, he would have to leave it alone
