Principal director / actor Dutcher delights in this look-at-me movie, in which he attempts to gain acceptance of the world for tarnishing the otherwise very optimistic world of Mormon missionaries. Some acting is right. But some roles are not realistic, namely the omen of the mission (rather than paternal), etc. The film takes a good look at how some missionaries can struggle with their faith, but the current missionary program it claims to represent is far from its concept of it, in terms of being optimistic, cohesive and inspired. The only inspiration I see in this film is Dutcher's self-inspiration. The film is slow and boring, and the shooting and screenplay look like a university student project.
