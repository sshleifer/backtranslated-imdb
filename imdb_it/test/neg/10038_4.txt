I wanted to like this movie. I really, really did. I was so excited when I saw the preview, which scared me to death. But when I saw the movie, I was disappointed. Acting is written, and comedy attempts are sadly out of place and forced. And I'm sorry, but a guy chased by an asshole in a pan isn't funny or scary, it's just stupid. I grew up in the Bell Witch legend, so I know quite a bit. A lot of the facts in the film are right, but this film should have been much better. The entire birthday party scene, for example, lasts about fifteen minutes, adds nothing to the plot or story and should have been left on the cutting room floor. A heavier editor may have been able to get a decent movie out of this mess. <br /> <br /> Understand, I'm not in any way, shape or form involved in the other Bell Witch movie, and I'm not trying to "attack" this IMDb announcement. I'm just telling it as it is.
