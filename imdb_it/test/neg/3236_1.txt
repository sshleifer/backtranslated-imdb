This was a film based on the novel written by the modern literary god who is Koontz? I refuse to believe that the studio has purchased the rights to this film for anything that uses the Koontz name of Genius. Since my vision became so poor as to require large printing, I could not read this book as I had done at least twice a year since the first reading. I lost the book a lot and couldn't find it in Large Print. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that by renting this movie I would at least enjoy the pleasures of my vicarious observer, but this film was a parody. Due to subtle points of the plot, it is my opinion that none of the authors of Koontz, or the most respectable ones, can be amassed in 1-2 hours of film. <br /> <br /> It will be the wise network, cable or otherwise, who buys the rights to this novel and makes a multi-part television movie, namely the mini series, of this book the RIGHT way! <br /> <br /> one in five stars - I wish you could go lower ...
