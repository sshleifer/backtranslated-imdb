I'm really surprised to see all these positive reviews for this movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't like 'this kind of film'. <br /> <br /> Although I can very well enjoy a senseless Hollywood movie like Die Hard 4.0, I like "dogma" movies, or "real as they are" movies, and so, IF they are well made. <br /> <br /> A good example is Festen (1998): no music, no dramatic angle of view, no special fx, no fancy positions. Just a good story combined with excellent acting and the result is an excellent film. <br /> <br /> Is Is Nine Lives free of dramatic shots, special and imaginative places? Yes. Is it a good movie? I'm glad you asked. <br /> <br /> The answer is: Absolutely not. <br /> <br /> First of all, everyone is excited about acting. I'm terribly sorry, but you can do anything you want, but if history and dialogue are not credible, the acting immediately falls on his backside. And this is exactly the case with Nine Lives. <br /> <br /> Not once did I get the feeling while watching 'Nine Lives' that I was looking at real people who have a real conversation. I had the feeling that I was watching actors trying to look like "real characters" while they were saying things that a "real person" would never say in these circumstances. <br /> <br /> You can hardly call it SPOILER, but there are some dialogue steps below. If you think that reading ten lines of dialogue (ridiculous) can ruin your cinematic experience, STOP READING HERE. If you want a good laugh, read on. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was tragic. Do you want examples? A lot of those in "Nine Lives". <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE1: <br /> <br /> Imagine it. The couple visit their rich dirty friends in their new villa. The woman sees this castle of a house and tells her husband: <br /> <br /> Woman: I could get used to this (which means the expensive house). Man: no. Woman: why not? It could be. Man: No. They are who I am and who we are. Woman: I like the sound of this - we are what we are. <br /> <br /> Do you like the sound of that? Her man behaves like an idiot, but she likes the sound of that. Then an elderly couple overcomes them holding hands. This is what the woman has in mind: <br /> <br /> Woman: Look! They are like children after school. They lived so much. Shared everything I love you. <br /> <br /> Are they like children after school? And then the most abused clich√© phrases you've ever heard? Finish with "I love you"? Does he say this while his man is an idiot for her? Yes, very logical, very realistic, NOT. If anything, this kind of dialogue made me want to strangle some of the characters in the movie for saying these horrible and horrible things. <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE 2: <br /> <br /> Elderly mom, dad and younger daughter at a funeral. Dad: I didn't realize that Andrew was religious. Mom: It's for convenience. Daughter: it is necessarily. Mom: life is fleeting Dad and daughter DISCOVER THE LAUGHTER. <br /> <br /> Yes, this one-liner makes me sick every time, especially at a funeral! Sorry, I must have lost the joke here. <br /> <br /> And it goes on and on and on .... <br /> <br /> What do you think of the camera? Don't even go there. Boring would be a compliment. It should seem "realistic"; instead, you lose half of the actors' facial expressions (the only thing left to watch in this film), while half of the time the camera is aimed at someone's back or side instead of their face. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Well, don't say I didn't warn you! It's a good movie to rent if you want to see your date or something during the film, because you don't even care if the movie is playing or not after the first five minutes. <br /> <br /> Overrated and more boring than watching the grass grow somehow sums it up.
