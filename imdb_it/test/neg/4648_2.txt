Cameron Mitchell plays an actor coming out with a young actress who was dating a film studio director (he's too young for both!). At a party, when he lights his cigarette, the head of the studio throws a high alcoholic drink in his face and ignites. In the hospital, his face is completely bandaged and he continues to smoke a cigarette! Become the resident sculptor of the Movieland Wax Museum and Palace, where he also lights cigarettes! <br /> <br /> Mitchell recovers, more or less, with a really badly done trick on one side of his face that looks like spackle and gray ribbon and an eye patch. When Mitchell is not smoking, he is killing people. Well, it kills people only sometimes, because they prefer to inject them with something that puts them in a kind of waxy coma. If he doesn't perform it regularly (and he never seems to remember), he starts moving again, even if he's in some sort of hypnotic zombie state. But not all his sculptures are people. Evidently he has talent as a sculptor. <br /> <br /> The finale, which seemed to have been hit by a much poorer print than the rest of the film, is truly absurd. They seemed not to know what to do and returned to the title for an idea. Apart from the grainy final shots, the rest of the film is quite fit, except for the audio in some scenes that seems to have passed through a burned out loudspeaker. It is certainly not one of the best wax museum films.
