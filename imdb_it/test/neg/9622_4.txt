I'm trying to figure out what MirrorMask liked. I'm an avid movie and hobbyist viewer. As I was telling friends during my lunch hour, MirrorMask could be my biggest cinematic disappointment of the year. Just like the short Moongirl, the film lacked its marks. Several times during the film he made attempts at humor. It prepares you for laughter. Instead of making you laugh, it leaves you drained. The lines recalled one of the recent Star Wars movies. They weren't funny unless you were five. And the acting felt equally terrible. I've seen actors actually act in front of a blue screen. And I believed it. But not in this movie. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> Does this film take a formula and try to apply it with beautiful artwork? And even if the script is totally feasible and the special effects are quite beautiful, it has no heart and fails miserably. I left the movie shaking my head and thought about leaving the theater. I felt sanctified and unhappy and I still didn't have the sour taste from my mouth. I love independent films. I encourage people to see independent films to support them. But not this movie. This film should not have been made. At least, not like this. Why did the director miss the vows so clearly? Were they clearly set ?? Not just humor. But the emotions. The drama. Even the lines were poorly planned and delivered. It was as if the film had walked on three legs instead of four. His steps are embarrassing and lacking time. And could it fall with the slightest push ?? Don't see this movie. I don't care who you are. It's not worth your time.
