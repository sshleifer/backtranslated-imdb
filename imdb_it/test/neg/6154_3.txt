Yeeee-Haa! <br /> <br /> I saw that he claimed that most American films are cowboy films in disguise; that Hollywood is so in love with its truly original creation that it continues to reinvent the myth of the cowboy. I'm not sure I totally buy that topic, but Slipstream is a test to support the theory; it's a cowboy movie with airplanes. <br /> <br /> Actually it's better than that. It is a Western Spagetti with airplanes! Replace planes with horses, make the android a priest, and this film would be indistinguishable from any of a dozen "semi-artistic" pretend shooters "from the 70s. <br /> <br /> The movie does it's bad as I had been made to believe in some of the reviews I had read here, but it certainly wasn't going well.
