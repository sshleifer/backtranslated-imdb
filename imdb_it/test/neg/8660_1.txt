What a lousy movie! The main character of this film had to be born and raised in Canada, yet he had an Indian accent more often than his parents! Is it just me or Uday looks gay in this movie? Also, do all the chicks in Canada dress up like sluts? At least that's how it is in this movie. All the females are dressed as strippers. Don't waste time with this! The only positive thing about this film is the setting in beautiful Vancouver. I wonder why Bollywood is going through a crisis? It's because of movies like this. I miss the good old days when Hindi movies were really fun! I couldn't even finish this film because it was so ugly. I think Bollywood should stop trying to replicate the Hollywood style because it's not working. They need to stick to their roots because that's what makes Indian movies fun.
