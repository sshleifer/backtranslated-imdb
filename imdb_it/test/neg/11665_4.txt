This turned out to be more of a suspenseful romantic romance film than what I hoped was ... simply a tense thriller. Yes, the last 20 minutes were of great suspense, but most of the previous 75 were completely tedious. <br /> <br /> Ruter Hauer was a bit too subdued, not interpreting his normal and intense character. Most of the time Natasha Richardson looks a bit silly and her character is very unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The story is so-so. It's not as bad as I'm doing, but it's definitely not something I would watch again, and the back of the VHS that describes this movie was misleading.
