okay, my question; who is the idiot who wrote this film, giving it the same name as the fantastic book by Dean Koontz? it's terrible, nothing like the book ... you have the dog and the observer, but the similarities end ... it could be good, if you haven't read the book, but ... but it really disappointed me. <br /> <br /> they should create a new one and let koontz write it ... now it would be a good movie ... I'll say it again, this film disgusts me ... absolutely disgusted me. it was terrible, it was absolutely nothing like the book. I would never look at it again.
