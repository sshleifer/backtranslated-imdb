I watched this movie with great expectations. The blurb on the back indicated that it would be a bad thing. But it was rather docile and a little unsatisfactory. Violence was nothing I hadn't seen thousands of times before, the blood level was only average (I think there was probably more than what was seen in Hollywood in the last 5 years - maybe more), and in no moment was I even feeling uncomfortable letting myself be scared. Again a CAT 3 movie with large wraps was not up to its hype. <br /> <br /> Sure, rent this movie, but don't go with any expectations. I'm so eager to get into the whole Asian horror scene, but I'm continually disappointed. I loved Ichi and Audition, but again, Miike is alone right now. <br /> <br /> Please, inspire me ..... there is a large group of faded genre fans who are hungry for quality horror!
