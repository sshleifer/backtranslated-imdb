This was a very nice concert by the only MJ. The choreography was excellent and the costumes were decent. The voice was okay. I must admit that his voice was shit about Human Nature and Billie Jean. You can't hear it for half the time. The other songs compensate for the singing. The highlights of the show are: Jam Smooth Criminal I Just Can Not Stop Love You Is Out Of My Life Thriller Billie Jean (The Dancing Not The Singing) White or black man in the mirror The concert was almost perfect. If it was someone other than Mj it would have been a 9. It's a must see. I wish I was born then, so I could get a ticket for the best 1992 concert.
