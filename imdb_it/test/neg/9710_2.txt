This film is simply bad. First of all, the story is strange and not well written. It leaves you with questions when you're done. Sometimes it's fine, but not in this case. <br /> <br /> Acting is nothing exciting. Adults do a good job, but children, taken into consideration are children, is not a good job. I thought the main role, Ian Costello as Mickey Mouse, was the worst. Well, to be honest, I'm not sure it was the main role. I never really understood who this movie was. Mickey or Pete. <br /> <br /> There were a few shots that stood out, but above all there was nothing exciting about cinematography. The sound, however, was better. There was a nice score. A bit of a piece-like adventure, even if this didn't seem like an adventure movie. He had some elements of an adventure film, but it was more of a drama. However, it was difficult to tell who this film was intended for. Children? Almost. There is too much language and violence for this. Adults? I do not know. He had many elements of a children's movie. It was like a movie for adults in a children's movie. <br /> <br /> The story was strange. I have no idea what it really was. He was thrown in without knowing anything, but there were always references to something you felt you needed to know. The fact that the children's parents died, for example, and that Mickey accused Pete of this. You expected to know what happened, but you never had it. <br /> <br /> All together this film was bad and a waste of time. There was no guide in it. Nothing to really move the story forward. This is not what you spend on your Saturday night.
