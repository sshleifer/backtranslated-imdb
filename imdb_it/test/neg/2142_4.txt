If I had to classify this film exclusively on acting / screenplay / production, etc., I'd give it a star. All these elements are horrible. I can partially forgive him, in light of the film's $ 250 budget. The film contains many funny scenes, mostly those of the involuntarily funny variety. Some of these include: a fourteen-year-old boy who steals and drives a bus, teenage hooligans (one of whom wears a Joy Division shirt) afraid of harassing the film's protagonists from a woman who wields a obviously false weapon, and a meeting with plastic skull in the Arizona desert. <br /> <br /> I would have given him 5 stars only for the value of entertainment had it not been for the presence of that terribly boring and morally pontificating old grandmother. I had to dock a star just because of him. Who is it that * bleep * makes a wedding cake with black icing, anyway?
