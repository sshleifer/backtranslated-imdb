Michael Myers, the deranged, not-too-young psychopath, who seems to become more muscular with every aspect, is resurrected by his Druid brothers to destroy more threats against his family and anyone else intrudes. The gaps in logic seem to be ignored in favor of a healthy body count. Michael, who originally preferred stranglings and kitchen knives, learns to shake an ax and use all the means necessary to eliminate his victims, and the result is a terrible, patchy dollar stock movie, virtually not helped by some really sequences creepy. Donald Pleasance, who died shortly after production, appears to have been injected into this story simply so * someone * could be advertised as the star. You will not want to cover your eyes during this, but you will shake your head towards the downward slide of the classic John Carpenter creation.
