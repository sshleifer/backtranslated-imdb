I'm shocked and surprised to find miserable reviews for this horrible movie. I rented this "movie" or I did, whatever you want to call, with several friends and after thirty minutes we had to stop watching. Only by listening to the dialogue did I leave a horrible taste of sour milk in my mouth. This film was as smart as a pimple. I hope I will never see that chubby strapless (Julianne Nicholson) again. It was like watching the most putrid pilot for a sitcom that will never arrive on television, but instead of being a quick but painful 30 minutes (all I could find out) this was a terrible 90 minutes.
