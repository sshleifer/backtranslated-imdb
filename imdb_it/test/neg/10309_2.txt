Don't worry when you look at the cover of the DVD, Sandra Bullock only appears at most 5 minutes in this cult classic. The entertainment value here is very high. <br /> <br /> To name just a few of the highlights that should be paid attention to: <br /> <br /> - The doubled evil voices of the main villains - The special cam of the gun - The strange masks and costumes of assassins: the showy ways of hitting a bullet and hitting the ground - The abundance of shots from the bottom up - The space scene where Bullock falls unconscious on the street - The Italian over-cliche guy from the Moe band (LaMotta) - The background music of the economic synthesizer - The fetishism of the exaggerated gun mesmerizing <br /> <br /> And last but not least: the fight scenes with the super horny fist. I wish there would be more of those ... <br /> <br /> Extra point for the successful attempt to make me laugh out loud.
