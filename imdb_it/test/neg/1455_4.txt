Comedy overrated mob. Director Demme makes sure that the actors stop after a few funny jokes to make the audience laugh and not miss the next line. It seems strange - this director did "Silence of the Lambs" - now there is a way to use breaks! The casting seems off. Mathew Modine too young for the FBI agent and Pfeiffer's love interest! Dean Stockwell is doing a Jack Nicholson thing with a squint, and gets a nomination for it! Also should we accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians? Charles Napier as a hairdresser and Al Lewis as a mass attorney are underutilized with one line each - they should be the stumbling hoods. Chris Isaak's soundtrack is totally out of place, better for a movie like "Pretty In Pink". Make this film worth it, but with the correct cast and director and satire will go through ... even the repeated "Forgedaboutit".
