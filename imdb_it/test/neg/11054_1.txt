Jeff Leroy wanted to make fun of Scientology to build a horror movie around a cult similar to it. The turning point is that instead of the frail old L. Ron Hubbard as a cult leader, there is a secular space monster that turns his followers into vampires. Our hero is a dirty college student doing research on the occult. His landlord is an attractive blonde who tries to convince him to clean up his life with the help of the cult. It doesn't take him long to understand that she is only after one thing: his blood. "The Screaming" was filmed very cheaply on video and is simply ugly. The space monster (which looks like a giant winged cat that seems perpetually crazy and skinless) is alternately a miniature miniature of clay and a large-scale animatronic puppet, both of which look horrible. Acting and writing are both terrible and the director doesn't even try to mask the fact that this film was made for nothing. Avoid this unpleasant and pitiful excuse.
