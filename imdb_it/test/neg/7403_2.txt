The film took three hours, including commercials, on the international History channel last night. But it took three weeks. It was not the economic, untimely, and unintentionally funny images of the Dresden bombing. It is not that the film has been deprived of almost all the context surrounding the Second World War. It wasn't even the fact that the attack itself was often made to look like nothing more than a serious inconvenience for a silly love story. No, it was the wooden features without features that sucked life out of history. Oh, and the fact that if it's possible for a movie to be obsequious, then Dresden is that movie. Perhaps a better title would have been DRESDEN - AS URIAH HEEP HAVE GOT EXPERIENCED. <br /> <br /> It is above all the last point that irritates so much. Was the bombing of Dresden a war crime? The creators of this film believe so. But in the typically emasculated way that the Germans came to approach the Second World War, they can't say themselves without breaking "peace" and "no more wars - anywhere" as if they were Mother Teresa. And, also typical of German observance of the English in particular, there is a cumbersome effort to crawl in front of "Britishness", while charging all the "guilt" of Dresden on a person, Arthur Harris. <br /> <br /> Did I say a person? Well, not really. At the beginning of the film there is an exclamation of the protagonist, Anna, with whom we should all sympathize. "Damn Americans!" He shouts, looking at the falling bombs. And a few minutes later, a radio voice introduces warnings about the "American Terror Bombing" inflicted on the Germans. <br /> <br /> Notice the word "terror". I got it? They are really the Americans behind the inhuman target of German civilians. It does not matter that the American strategy for almost the entire war in Europe was the "precision" bombardment of industrial sites and war production sites. Regardless of the fact that it was the British who enthusiastically adopted the "area" bombing of civilian targets in Germany - before the Germans themselves had also targeted the British ones. It doesn't matter that the Americans bombed during the day, suffering more casualties in the process than the British, in order to hit precision targets, while the British bombed civilians under the cover of the night. Never mind that the Americans, in essence, have been brought into the real campaign of terrorist raids by the RAF by kicking and screaming at it. Never mind that most American officials, from FDR to Gen. Dolittle, opposed civilians, while Churchill and his generals could not wait to do so. <br /> <br /> No, in DRESDA, both Germans and Britons, except for "Bomber" Harris, are innocent of a doctrine, he is ordered, created by the bad Americans. And only the strength and power of a love affair between a German nurse and a downed British bomber pilot can adequately explain the "truth" of the atrocity. Quite right. <br /> <br /> By the way, for younger and probably less-read readers of IMDb, the first and still only great literary effort to give a thoughtful voice to the bombing of Dresden was the pacifist novel written by Kurt Vonnegut - an American prisoner of war in Dresden at the time of the bombing. I guess Germany's ZDF can't find a nice nurse for Billy Pilgrim.
