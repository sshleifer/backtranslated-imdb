This is a terrible Norris movie, with one of the most annoying performances ever on Calvin Levels and a weak script. The characters were terrible, and have almost no action, plus Chuck Norris also smells like that! Christopher Neame is very weak as the main villain, and the story was not very interesting anymore Norris seemed bored with everything and did not blame him as I was! Calvin's levels give one of the most annoying performances of a movie, I couldn't stand it, because I was tempted to rip the tape from my VCR, plus Norris and Levels didn't have a chemistry together! If you're looking for great martial arts moves from Norris, don't get close to this, but if you want a movie with an uninteresting story, almost no action and bad acting looks further. This is a terrible Norris movie, with one of the most annoying performances of Calvin's levels, Avoid like the plague! The direction is incredibly bad. Aaron Norris does an incredibly ugly job here, without suspense or shivers of camera work, and keeping the film at a boring pace! There is a bit of blood and violence. We have two impalpable hearts, a torn heart, an exploding body and some gunshot wounds. The acting is really bad. Chuck Norris isn't as AMAZING as he usually is here and he seemed very bored here, his interiors were flat, and his acting wasn't great and I'm a big fan of Norris, this is his absolute worst! (Norris continues to be the regulation!). Calvin Levels is incredibly boring here, his whining and whining performance has severely thanked me, I was hoping he could do it well, but unfortunately he didn't. Christopher Neame is rather weak as the main villain, his voice was beautiful, but he acted in a great moment! Sheree J. Wilson is beautiful and did well to do what he had to do. The rest of the cast is terrible. Overall, please avoid this, not worth the torture, even if you are a big fan of Norris (like me). BOMB on 5
