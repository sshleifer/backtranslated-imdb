This must be one of, if not the greatest Mob / Crime movies of all time. Everything in this film is exceptional, the acting in this film is of real quality; Master P's acting skills make you believe he is Italian! Photography is also excellent, probably the best ever. This film was fantastic; and I have the brain capacity of a terrestrial worm.
