I saw this movie because it had a huge person and was labeled as a monster movie. I don't understand why it's called a monster movie. The film is a drama. I was expecting a lot of destruction, but what did I get? Most of the film was relationship problems and people thought a woman was crazy because she saw a spaceship crash into a giant inside for an inexplicable reason. The action started a few minutes towards the end. Since the woman was killed, isn't this murder? Couldn't they have done anything other than kill her? If you look at this because you expect it to have an action because it's labeled as a monster movie, don't look at it. It's not a monster movie. It's a drama.
