What can you expect from a movie on DVD? You know what you're getting when you rent it. The quality of the film reminds me of reality TV shows. <br /> <br /> Why are the shots always so close to the actors! And why are they always centered? There is nothing to look at. (And the actors are so beautiful, so are the shots.) <br /> <br /> Writing and dialogue are simply horrible. That introductory scene, with the British boy, is hilarious. Just try to listen to these words, they don't make any sense, they circle around. The lines in the rest of the film seem to have been extracted from the pink and science fiction novels, as if the writers had no idea what they were doing. The characters definitely seem to have no idea what they're saying. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible film. I feel bad for the actors involved in this project. Embarrassing!
