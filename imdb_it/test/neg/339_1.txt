I didn't really like this movie ~ !!!! it was boring and I didn't care that much ... I'm more of an action girl, and she had NO. I went and rented this movie because of the other comment that was left .. but it was totally misleading! don't take this movie unless you like dessert and so much trouble. I really didn't like the movie. it wasn't my style, but it could be yours .. you should just watch the previews or something but it's my recommendation if you're a girl .. don't take this movie! This Scandinavian production is based on some observational strategies of Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi, which allows us to reflect on models and phenomena of human and natural existence from intimate and broad points of view. this is not for me!
