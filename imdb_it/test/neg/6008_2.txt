Being a big fan of Laura Gemser, I took him to a store to see another Emanuelle movie. Boy, I made a mistake! <br /> <br /> EMANUELLE IN EGYPT has nothing to do with Emanuelle. Laura Gemser is present with her husband Gabriele Tinti, but this is the only connection with Emanuelle. Here, Laura plays "Laura" (original, eh?) A beautiful top model who goes to visit her rich friend Pia (Annie Belle) in Egypt. At his side there is a Carlo hole photographer (a twisted-looking Gabriele Tinti) and a blonde woman who is never mentioned. Even living in Pia's house is Horatio (the sexy but stupid Al Cliver), a mystic who speaks nothing but nonsense. For the weekend Pia's two daughters arrive, a short-haired lesbian and the other brunette. A lot of sex is implicit, but hardly shown. A good-looking actor plays Ali, the Egyptian servant, who gets lucky with three of the women in the villa. Laura has sex with the lesbian, the lesbian has sex with Horatio, Pia and the blonde have sex with Horatio in an Egyptian orgy, Laura drinks goat blood and is possessed during an Egyptian ceremony, Carlo violates Laura. Everything happens with so little talent that EMANUELLE IN EGYPT is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Far from eroticism, even the actors themselves seem bored during their sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Considering that there were two famous couples in this film (Laura and Gabriele & Al and Annie), the number of sex scenes available is uncountable. Instead, a film that offers a first-rate cast of Eurocult and never delivers the goods will piss off any viewer, except for the hardcore completer Laura Gemser. Otherwise, avoid EMANUELLE IN EGYPT!
