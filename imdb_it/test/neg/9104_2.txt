This film has been bad on so many levels. The writing was horrible, so even the best actors couldn't make this movie watchable. It's a shame because they have had some good actors in this movie. I mean, if anyone saw any of the Police Academy movies, you would know that Steve Guttenberg was good. His character in this film was very serious, and it was a big difference compared to the characters I saw before, so this was an advantage. And I thought Steve Guttenberg was extremely hot in this movie. With or without the shirt you can't deny that it has a BIG body! Even the sexy face. He loved the look of the 5 o'clock, made it dangerous. In one part of the film he is lying in bed without a shirt and I must say that I would be happy to have jumped in and tried to distract him from his problems! So honestly, I would watch this movie again just to fantasize!
