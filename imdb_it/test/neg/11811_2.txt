Well, this is what should have been called, anyway. Above all, because of the ridiculous and pungent use of what can hardly be called symbolism by the director. It would not have surprised me to discover that this was A) One of Lea Pool's first attempts, and B) at least semi-autobiographical. It turns out that A is wrong, though I don't know about B. I bet he attended college, though, and he had a rather terrible same sex relationship. This is the message that was shot down by this film, and the short film that preceded it, whose name I can't remember anymore. <br /> <br /> However, the development of the character was clumsy (Who introduces himself by saying what his name means? None.) the symbols were as thin as an elevator made entirely of glass full of teenage girls who lost a cable and eighty stories fell. All on one speaker. Honestly, the cry of a hawk when Perabo claimed to be a bird of prey and jumped off the table? It was ridiculous to parody. And it was just one of too many symbols to show his point of view to the eyes of the most stupid. And this is that she had a disgusting childhood and feels the need to make films about it, wing Vincent Gallo, instead of seeing a therapist, all of us going ahead with our lives. There was nothing tender, nothing sweet, and nothing touching in this film. It was a poorly represented transgression, and the actors could not save the Brett Ratneresque over "HEY THIS IS MY POINT IN THIS FILM" using cinematographic techniques, writing and acting. Sorry, but it was terrible.
