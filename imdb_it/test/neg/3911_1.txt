There is only one word that describes this film: BAD !! I have no idea why this film was made, or how Dennis Hopper starred in this film. Stuart Gordon is a better director than this and Hopper is a much better actor. The film is simply stupid. I liked the idea of ​​"square pigs" and there was an interesting love scene involving a cyborg, besides this, avoiding this movie at all costs.
