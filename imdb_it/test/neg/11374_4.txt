Whatever the PC Enforcers Committee is responsible for this film it got something I never thought possible: take some really gifted actors (Davis, Hardin and Taylor) and make you want to make sure you never meet them in a closed space, ever. The feelings that underlie the script are so jejeune and idiots that it is impossible to understand or imagine which audience would find this image, much less enjoyable. Maybe architecture students? <br /> <br /> Only one scene is visually intelligent: Marcia Gay Hardin who sashaying, all the flashes and the rhythm, in a bar manages to exude more style and energy in ten seconds than the rest of the film added and multiplied for the tenth power. As for the other cast members, they probably won't want to put this in their resumes.
