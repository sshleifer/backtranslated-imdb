Maybe here in Sydney we are all poop upside down and as a result we get to float floaters like this s-eek! - Uel in classy theaters. Released here in 1980, this hilarious all-encompassing drama was greeted with shouts of joy during the session I attended. In fact, the audience was so involved in the ridiculous antics on the screen that it sounded like a Rocky Horror session. Within 5 minutes we all knew it was a real disaster: the tugboat scene where you can see the buckets of water thrown from the offset. after all he was the patron of himself and the cinema played with advice, cheering for bad acting and oo-waah reactions. The gunfight in the hold between the boxes is particularly idiotic and allows drunken spectators with friends in altered states to also look to contribute appropriately. I call these films with Michael Caine, his holiday home films, because I think he agrees to make them because he saw a house he likes and doesn't want to spend his savings. Like Jaws 3 or 4 or whatever it was called.
