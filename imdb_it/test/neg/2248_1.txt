This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this film? A group of Americans enters Nazi-occupied France and begins to massacre the Germans. You see them scalping their enemies and beat them to death with baseball bats. While joking, of course. <br /> <br /> Some will say that this film is a parody of a certain genre. For a parody, it is neither witty nor amusing. The content is zero. It is exceptionally brutal and disgusting. Below is a subtle political message, because it is again "the good guys" who kill "bad Nazis". The whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around. Can you imagine a plot in which the Nazis (while making jokes) kill everyone in the Warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not, but this film speaks exactly about this, with the exception that it satisfies the strange moral expectations of a certain audience: slaughtering people is so beautiful when it's done by the right people. <br /> <br /> This film only works because of the Nazi ideology hidden below. He does not consider the enemy as a person. And if the latter should be an element of fun, I'm happy to say that this kind of fun will remain a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Another mystery is how this violence can fascinate the American crowd while a little nakedness will drive them crazy. But if a naked body is pornography, this film with all its brutality is pure pornography at its worst. <br /> <br /> Inglorious Basterds is a waste of time and money that is useless, boring and tasteless.
