As a parent of two girls (14 and 11) I have serious doubts about this show and all the shows aimed at couples. First, I am always amazed that the living conditions of Drake / Josh, Zac / Cody, Hanna, Carly, Derek, Sunny etc. Always make them look like tiny, cramped houses. Most people work hard all day to pay less than half the size of their homes for the time being, no one is going or coming from work, paying utilities, rents, mortgages or insurance bills, washing, sweeping, changing light bulbs, fixing toilets, etc. Just walking in and out (and down the wide ubiquitous stairs that exist only on televisions) cracking jokes (most of which involve hilarious lies and outcomes) and slippery work. I think the children who watch these will have unrealistic expectations about how hard they will work and how luxurious their lives will be. Secondly, there is never an intact family, always a mother or father, but never both, who always go on dates without sex but never seem to have one of the negative sides of divorce (food, support, arguments). Once again, children may have the impression that if mom / dad divorced there would be fun fun (in reality mom or dad often isn't around if this helps the plot). Needless to say, there is no mention of spirituality (forgetting specific religion). Finally there is a theme that troubles me. There are "nerds" that are good for school, "athletes" good at sports, "goody two shoes". The protagonists are not good at school, sports or charitable, but they make jokes about who it is. The message is not being good at anything, just being one of the "nothings" that come together in crackling jokes. Needless to say, I give one of these shows to zero and I always turn them off and I'm just short of banning them at my house.
