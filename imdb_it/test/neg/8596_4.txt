I loved this movie when I was a teenager. I love. He didn't grow up with me though. Perhaps because it is a melodramatic load of old garbage, full of macho attitudes, poor dialogues, excited people and characters who say very "cursed". The tangle of buttery narratives without grace from one character to another, a thread of plot to another, without ever putting everything together, and it does not help that the mono-expression of a William Baldwin exhibition is wet enough to extinguish any fire in the excessive runtime movie. Robert De Niro and Donald Sutherland deserve to be watched, but no one is really at the top of their game here, and female people find themselves particularly short on thrift. The only real impact comes from the impressive fire fighting sequences and the majestic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which remains one of my all-time favorites.
