I love movies on the field, believe me and Gordon Lewis's usual Technicolor blood doesn't bother me at all, but this is just one of his most stupid films, even more than BLOOD FEAST, I'm not kidding. THE GORE GORE GIRLS talks about a crazy person who kills a lot of (re) - go (re) girls from a night club. A detective and a reporter try to discover the great secret. Perhaps the performances here are slightly better than the usual H.G Lewis acting films, but this isn't saying much. Camera work is also terrible. <br /> <br /> But at least it's a bit watchable with the go go girls ... you'll spend a good time with it, and the killings are simply crazy in a bad way: a girl is killed with a hammer wood that hits her ass (!) and just doesn't let me talk about what she does with her nipples. Laugh like anyone with this. But the best of all this mess is a scene that I only love about his campness: the go-go girl before being attacked by a lot of feminists who dance in a very American way. Although it is important to note that this was one of the first films that scored X because of its violence. <br /> <br /> ONLY if you want to laugh and have a good time (But only with a lot, A LOT of beers).
