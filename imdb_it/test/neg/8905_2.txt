Last night I was watching through the TV Guide and saw a movie with Heather Grahm, which I liked in movies like Boogie Nights and Austin Powers, so I decided to watch it. In the beginning it was ok, but it could be said that the story was lacking and, in about half, it started to deteriorate. I don't remember this movie being in theaters, and I'm sure if it was, it wouldn't take long. The acting was refined and unconvincing, the dialogue was stupid and predictable, and the story was confused and stupid. Definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I like movies like the ones that have been compared to Fight Club, but this doesn't come close !! Heather Grahm has done much better things since then. I gave a 2 out of 10 but this because I clicked on the wrong number, I meant to give it a 1.
