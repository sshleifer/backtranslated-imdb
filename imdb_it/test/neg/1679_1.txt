I have yet to see the first entry in this series, however, fortunately, I am still able to follow the complex and intricate plot, with all its unexpected twists, and I applaud them for the absolute originality of the concepts contained here. In case there is any confusion, leave no doubt that everything I just said is covered with a pure, carefully cultivated sarcasm, the kind that blooms and grows exponentially when exposed to crap like this movie. A clear sign that this is not important is that it was directed by a visual effects creator, whose only other credit in that field is a Henry Rooker film that was not well received. The acting is average at best, and I challenge anyone not to find ... Scottish computer-woman (come on, seriously, what's with that surname?) The Russian accent is ridiculous and / or irritating. There is an attempt or two of stylization in this, and they are reasonable. The action is not terrible. Cinematography and editing are fine. The music is pretty good. The language is rare, if that too. The violence is quite bloody. I recommend it only to fans of B-movies, and I will say that you can do worse than that. 1/10
