It is often difficult to decide which is the best film you have ever seen, as this can vary depending on the genre, preferences for actors / actresses or even your mood on a particular day! That being said, this film is by far, in my opinion, the worst movie I have ever seen !! I thought the acting was terrible (was there?), The plot was simply idiotic, and the props were totally fake. Could a lower budget production be created without being an amateur production? I don't think so. Even the friends with whom I watched the film agree that it was the worst video we've ever rented, and so far we've still joked about the night we saw this movie.
