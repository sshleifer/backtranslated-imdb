If you want to have a character in a film have a disquieting sexual encounter that the character would be ashamed of in old age, the only thing left that an audience would have seen as shameful was bestiality and has now been done. Judging by some of the other comments, this one also failed. I can't remember a funny scene, although I must admit, I had to turn it off before it was over. I looked at a part of the director's comment and it seems he was as surprised as anyone doing the film well. If you want to get the same feeling you get from this movie, but only cheaper, put your head in a pile of manure and breathe deeply.
