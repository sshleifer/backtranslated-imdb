I would have given this movie a one-star rating if it hadn't been for the laughter I got. Some of the dialog boxes were simply so disgusting to make you laugh !! How could anyone have spoken this way. Not to mention the fact that the bodyguard Majors (Antonio Sabato Jr.) has flown a 747 as a professional and Michael Pare's whining team managed to dig a trench full of gasoline and blow up a huge boulder . Someone noticed the lame tribute to "Fantasy Island" with the boy who says "Boss, the plane !!" to Michael Pare just when the 747 comes into view. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved was the pretty girls and even the cutest female hijackers. Not to mention the fact that the main hijacker deserved to die the lame death he did to be such a prankster !! Imagine running away from being tied up just to hit a "crossbow". Hello. <br /> <br /> The poor pilot probably died on the plane while everyone ate steaks and drank rum !! Just to laugh, they should do a sequel to show us how they all spend the night in the middle of a Category 3 hurricane on the Neptune atoll. I heard Michael Pare call it the "best honeymoon resort in the Pacific". Now it would be an interesting movie !!
