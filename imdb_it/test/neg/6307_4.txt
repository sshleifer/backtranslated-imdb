Dennis Quaid is trying to show us that Jerry Lee Lewis was a stupid guy. And it's doing too much to prove it. TV sequences are very good, like a photocopy of old black and white movies. Music is fine too, because Mr. Lewis himself sings. But the rest is just the Hollywood B-Movie style, with the complex of fifties Happy Days. I think the only good thing about this movie is seeing young Winona Ryder.
