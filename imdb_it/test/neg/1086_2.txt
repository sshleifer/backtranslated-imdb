I am very surprised to see the good grades for this film. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie 9 years ago and I still remember how angry I felt in the cinema and watching this mess. I'm a big fan of John Boorman's work. I really like his films. So I went to "Beyond Rangoon" with great expectations. But it seemed to me to look at a stupid, cheap jungle movie by Chuck Norris with all the action scenes cut out. Even the soundtrack was very annoying. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that John Boorman was the director because this film was so badly done. I think the Burmese people deserve better films to illustrate their struggle.
