Drivel. Sin. The writers must not have read the book or seen the film by David Lynch. It is not worth wasting your time. <br /> <br /> Longer it doesn't improve. Although more in-depth than Lynch's film, it has a gross accuracy and key parts of the history of down-play. <br /> <br /> "A night at Roxbury" is worth your time.
