Not good. -Not at all. <br /> <br /> This episode revolves around the descent of the original murderer inside the Amityville home who has to face his past to get rid of the nightmare terror of Amityville itself. <br /> <br /> It is basically nothing. My bet is that this film was made to earn extra money to buy a boat or something ... because this is simply ridiculous ... Fortunately, it does not kill or ruin the series, but it has no effect on the series to all. <br /> <br /> I should say that only the fact that it is constantly referred to the old, infamous house is probably the only thing that makes this a little more bearable than "The Amityville" Curse ".
