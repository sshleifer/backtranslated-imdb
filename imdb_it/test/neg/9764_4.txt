Since THE MAGUS is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution, you should sit back and enjoy the scenery. Set in a "remote Greek island", starring Michael Caine, a very active teacher who works in a school for boys who is involved in mental games with the mysterious mystery and mystery man Anthony Quinn and his girlfriend Candice Bergen. Quinn, who looks like Pablo Picasso with white hair and a striped sailor shirt, is actually pretty good, but Caine seems ready to explode. Bergen, although amazing, should NEVER wear a British accent. He's not very good at that kind of thing. Guy Green's direction is fine, but unless you have infinite patience with the film's circular logic, you won't like it. A true discordant note is the casting of the effervescent Anna Karina in the absolutely carefree role of Caine's girlfriend. After seeing her in a film like A WOMAN IS A WOMAN and A BAND APART, her presence here is quite shocking.
