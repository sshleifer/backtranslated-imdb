I like Arnold, and I love the subject, but this was a very disappointing film. When I first saw the previews, they were dark and threatening and Arnold's name was not even mentioned. But I recognized him, which led me to believe he was making a film that had a more serious and suspenseful mood. Which was not just another Schwarzenegger action vehicle (although I admit it, most of him is pretty good!). He had, so far, avoided films with a real religious theme. And I was excited. I was wrong. This is just another action, explosion, shooting movie. And it's pretty ugly.
