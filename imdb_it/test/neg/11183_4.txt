Fred Astaire returned to work with Rita Hayworth one year after their great success for Columbia, "You'll Never Get Rich". This was the film that put Hayworth on the map of Hollywood, yet his performance in this romantic, weak musical almost gives no hint as to why he was so suddenly popular. Down the street of Buenos Aires, a tyrannical hotel owner demands that his four daughters marry in order of age; one may think that the film takes place in the eighteenth century, but no, it is 1942 of our days. Astaire is a former hoofer who became a gambler who returns to dance to earn some money, mingling with impersonating a fan of letters to the beauty of Hayworth's cold stone society. Fred looks at Rita with a brotherly smile, but she is so mannerist (her songs bind to her lips like a windmill with wide eyes) that all romantic sparks follow each other quickly. They do dance together quite comfortably, however, and Jerome Kern's score is not memorable, but not too bad. ** from ****
