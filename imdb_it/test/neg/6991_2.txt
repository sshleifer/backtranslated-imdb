I actually liked this movie. Of course, the acting was flat, there was no plot, and the villain was the weakest I've ever seen. Michael Bernardo in the role of Dante is a real laugh, with an incredibly funny slogan and an evil laugh. But it's worth seeing, just for the WORST explosion you'll ever see outside of the Power Rangers TV series. You'll know when you see it. Honestly, this film must have the budget of a low level porn. I almost stopped looking after an hour, but advised me to look through it all; at the very least, there is a lot of eye candy for everyone to enjoy. Recommended for viewers with a high tolerance to bad movies.
