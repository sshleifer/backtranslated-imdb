Sometimes a film cannot be easily classified. A film of this kind is "Tank Girl", partly comic, partly comedy and partly action film. I'm sure there's an audience for "Tank Girl" somewhere, but it's extremely small, maybe punk comic readers. Most viewers will look for an early exit or live with the fast forward button. bursts of humor "find me a microscope and a pair of tweezers", but these small moments of comic relief are far outweighed by the action sequences of the second movie: there is no character development, which is not surprising, since the source is a comic. Do yourself a favor and avoid, avoid, avoid - MERK
