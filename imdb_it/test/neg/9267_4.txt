With an inexpensive pound shop just opened, I thought it was worth seeing if they were cheap DVDs that looked good. And while the back of the cover made it look like a Jeepers Creepers movie, it's actually an anthology movie! and I thought one or two of the stories felt very familiar. It's still a fun light horror / comedy. The plots: <br /> <br /> First story: the classic. <br /> <br /> A young couple feels that it is time to try to prove their financial life by buying a $ 1500 car. But when the guy picks up a car, a car starts talking to him. The machine (called Banns) says that in order to get everything it has ever wanted in life, it has to buy Baans for $ 5,000. While the boys the report collapses, Baans does everything it can to prove who is really in charge. <br /> <br /> Second story: the culture of cooking. <br /> <br /> A boy who could be hunted by his land lord, because of how messy his apartment is, discovers that thanks to the fact of keeping a tuna paste in his fridge for six months, now he it is shaped and evolved into a green and moldy version of itself! And as they start as friends, they end up having a big fall, the warrior leads to a final battle to see if the real guy or his fridge clone will survive. <br /> <br /> Story three: Too good to be true. <br /> <br /> A girl signs up with an appointment agency and she is paired with wi a guy is perfect for her. But she's not sure if the boy is too perfect, and when she thinks she sees him 'closed' he starts to get scared. Watch the movie: <br /> <br /> The first thing I have to mention is the evaluation of the film in England, where it was assigned a score of eighteen, even if it has no nudity, curses or blood and the other strange thing of all the stories is that they all have a happy ending, where the goodies win! And while the first story is too close to the classic Stephen King, Christine, the second story is easily the highlight of the film, with director Tom Parkinson making the nuttiness of the story as a low-budget Muppets episode! <br /> <br /> Final of the film <br /> <br /> Despite having a bit of remake; listen, theirs is weird enough to make this a good horror 'comedy'.
