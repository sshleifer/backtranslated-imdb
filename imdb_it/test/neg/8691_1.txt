Does anyone care about any of the characters in this movie? - Or what happens to them? - I doubt it. This is the key problem: for a tragedy, we have to deal with at least one of the characters and none of them can inspire any sympathy or seem to have some quality of redemption. <br /> <br /> What could have worked in the 16th century, it certainly does not work in one can only assume 'Liverpool post apocalyptic' if it were really what it was meant to be. The problem is the characters of the post apocalyptic Liverpool, while continuing to drive, using mobile phones and watching television, they returned to speak in Shakespearian language - with a liverpudian dialect. Oh dear! Pretty bad you might think - but this often fell into pure scouse - with comments like 'eh lah are you a cockney? And was it an announcement by Merseyrail during one of the underground scenes? Well, the good news is that in post apocalyptic Liverpool - the trains are still around. <br /> <br /> Characters without exception are poorly drawn, in wood and more like characters on the lines of the Joker / Penguin in Batman and Robin except that there is no real plot to talk about - or if there is - it's something that doesn't work in a modern environment where half of the sets are grim and "Blade runnerish" and the other half are fluorescent or simply 21st century. The costumes are also mixed with half wearing their everyday clothes (the Parkers are great in post apocalyptic Liverpool - apparently) and the other half wearing the costumes of the leftovers of a costume party? <br /> <br /> The film explores the ideas of lust, incest and revenge in the most senseless fashion imaginable - the tragedy is that this film was made for everyone. <br /> <br />
