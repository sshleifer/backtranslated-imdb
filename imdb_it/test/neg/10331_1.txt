Remarkable only as a recitative debut of the future hit Hollywood actress, Sandra Bullock, this ridiculous action movie is so full of holes that one could easily suspect termite infestation. The plot is incomprehensible and very ill-conceived. Production values ​​smell like cheese. In fact, a total LACK of production values ​​would have been better ... at least the film could have seemed more petty that way. The ADR is ridiculously bad and omnipresent in the film. It is questionable whether ALL the traces of dialogues of the actual shots have been used or not. <br /> <br /> The performances are, for the most part, horrible, although there are some exceptions. In those exceptions, however, performance is undermined by the fact that the director was obviously giving the actors bad direction and sometimes made them act completely out of character. (ie characters ranging from passive to panic in the blink of an eye.) The bad direction "sound effects of weapons" (loaded loaders, armed slides etc.) are completely abused and, most of the time, totally out of sync with the actions on the screen. Add to this absurd vocal distortion "Bad Guy" for the main villain (especially because you know that he is the villain in this incomprehensible mess of a movie), and you have a recipe for disaster. <br /> <br /> Situations in the film go far beyond the normal "suspension of disbelief" and become even laughable. A protagonist character spends a good part of the film tied to a chair before YOU DECIDE to use the butterfly knife stuck in his sock to free himself. So, my questions are ... because he hasn't done it before, and because he also has the butterfly knife. Wasn't it searched? RIGHT. This is one of a hundred examples of totally ridiculous situations that have somehow been crammed into this 90-minute package. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Hangmen" sounds like an unbearably bad R-rated television movie from the 80s. If it wasn't for Sandra Bullock's success, it would NEVER find her way to the DVD. But he has, so my only advice is to avoid. Watching this movie can actually damage your IQ.
