There were only two reasons for me to see this movie. First of all there were Stellan Skarsgard and Marisa Tomei (both good actors) and I had nothing better to do. While watching the film, I immediately thought of something better to do: SLEEP! This film is a complete waste of time. It's a blow from a former standard cop. The ex-copper is the best we've ever been, but it's been fired. He continues to do things alone for the dislike of his former companions and saves the day. All great surprises (NOT !!!). Go to sleep, or if you have insomnia, try this. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
