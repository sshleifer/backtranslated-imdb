This formidable film (the hero's girlfriend marries the villain) did not move quickly enough given some of the circumstances of the story. Scott seems too old in this, and too often his character moves away from the decisive action, deflating the scenes. Responds to the death of some of his hands weakly; he escapes from Knox's band hiding in a barrel full of rain; his escape to the high country and John Russell's research seem superfluous, as does much of the film. The plot could have been tight. <br /> <br /> Highlights of the film: see "Tennessee" Ernie Ford without mustache sing "Man in the Saddle"; The too short scenes of Alfonso Bedoya as a cook; the color photograph of the high country and the fight scene there with John Russell.
