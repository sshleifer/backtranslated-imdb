Go to the video store and get the original. I don't understand why Hollywood has that need to make a perfect foreign film and do it again. "Mostly Martha" or "Bella Martha" has a much better cast. Beginning with the heroine Martina Gedeck, who convinced me much more in the role of the perfectionist obsessed by the work of the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones, the Italian cook and her mother's sudden niece and forced to live with an aunt, not suitable raising children. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the American version of the film is a copy of the German original. The actors have just exchanged. However, they also changed the story because it would have been difficult and not very credible to materialize a father for the child in an American context. <br /> <br /> I was thinking about it. Perhaps the father could have been Puerto Rican, Cuban or Mexican. Well, there are so many "guest workers" in the United States. Make your choice. But I doubt that any of them would have shown up to their responsibilities like the Italian father had done in the original. Therefore, the American film leaves that part out but keeps the Italian chef. And doing so changes the whole story. In the original "Martha" he is so far removed from reality that she thinks it is right to send her niece to a stranger in a foreign country. <br /> <br /> The American "Martha" is softer and therefore the film is sweeter and does not have that advantage of the German film. <br /> <br /> In the original the "Italian" cook is not so nice but much more charming, the girl is more than a brat but much more credible and "Martha" is more representative of a career woman in the today's world that the watered down version is presented to us in the American version. And the entire opera music in the American version was very annoying. I loved the Italian songs in the original and bought the CD. <br /> <br /> Hollywood recognized that "Mostly Martha" was a great movie. Maybe the distribution companies should have put it in more rooms or it should have been shown in English without subtitles. In any case, the original is much better. By the way, this reminds me of another remake. "Shall we dance" is one of my favorites in the original Japanese version and totally forgettable in the American version.
