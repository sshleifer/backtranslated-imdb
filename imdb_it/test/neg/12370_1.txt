Without a doubt this is and probably will always be the worst movie I've ever had the misfortune of seeing my whole life. Take 5 wooden actors who were thrown out of acting school because they were so wooden that someone sat on them thinking they were a bench. <br /> <br /> Then add a cheap video camera. You know the old types of VHS that cost Â£ 20 on ebay. Add a terrible plot with no effects and yes, you have this movie. What a shock it was. They couldn't even save him by having a fit girl. She was fat and ugly and was the worst of all. Actually I saw everything as I could not believe that this crap was ever funded. <br /> <br /> MISSING ALL COSTS
