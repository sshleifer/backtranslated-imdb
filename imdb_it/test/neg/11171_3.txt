It's really sad to see a director of the past like Deodato who offers such a low level thriller like this. This film was so terrible that it actually put an end to his film career. The mind box, this is not an "erotic thriller", hell during the 97 minutes of running the film, Charlotte Lewis barely shows us a nipple! I thought it would come up once William Burger showed up (in one of his last roles), but his character was killed rather abruptly and weakly. This film fails practically in every way. Claudio Simonetti's music is little more than noise, and the plot made very little sense. For some reason, Lewis is terrified of the ghosts that attack using phones. (?) In the end, the characters seem to have forgotten the previous 90 minutes of hell they went through, and they randomly laugh while catching evil spirits on someone else, Lewis's ex-boyfriend. What?!? This film has done little for me besides making me angry .... and it bored me half. For the real fun of the 1980s Deodato, look at the BARBARIANS or ATLANTIS INTERCEPTORS, let this rot on the video store shelf. Silver could make a better yellow than this!
