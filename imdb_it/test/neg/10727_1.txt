Jim Carrey is a particular brand of humor and I personally think he is a great actor (Eternal Sunshine, for example). <br /> <br /> However, this film is supposedly meant to be nothing more than a Jim Carrey vehicle, so be aware that if you don't think his comedy style is fun, you'll find yourself sitting in front of the whole movie, because it HAS NOTHING to recommend it. <br /> <br /> Even if you like Carrey's comedy, I'm not sure you'll find this movie funny. I went to see him on Saturday night at 10.30pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh. They chuckled at the trailers, which weren't particularly funny, but when it came to the film, stone silence. I think he raised about five genuine laughs. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. He is unable to decide if he is going for slapstick or serious. If he were stupid in all this he could be forgiven but (I imagine) he is also trying to express a point about the relationship between the two central characters. <br /> <br /> The strength of the film is holding ups, and there was a lot of potential here. But these did not begin until about half and remained largely undeveloped. In the meantime, you have to spend the first harrowing 40 minutes while the couple's life deteriorates. <br /> <br /> Four separate groups came out of this movie while I was there, and if my roommate hadn't asked me to keep away from home (his girlfriend just came back from a month's vacation!), I would have did the same. And during my 25 years of film, I only did it once.
