I'm not sure that this film could ever match the first, even though it was in the original seven (despite the fact that four were killed). It simply doesn't have the spark and the chemistry. All the actors look tired and look like they're just following the motions to get their checks. <br /> <br /> It is interesting how Yul Brynner is "magnificent" in the original film but stiff and unconvincing in this sequel. Yet, when she starred in Westworld and Futureworld in the 1970s, her character (with the same matching black pants and shirt and hat) evokes the same mystery and the very presence of Chris Adams from the 1960 movie. this 1966 glance to make worth watching, even on cable.
