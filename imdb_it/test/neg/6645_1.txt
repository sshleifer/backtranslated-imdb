I would not recommend this movie. Although it is rated G and it is clearly a lot of bad words for children (including the dreaded words "F" and "S"). Doesn't this kind of language particularly offend me but in a children's movie? Come. <br /> <br /> There was also quite a bit of implicit sexual content, between one of the first male adolescent characters and any adult woman available who arrived - including a prostitute! <br /> <br /> The acting was as good as in this kind of movie, but the plot was very tacky and even my four-year-old observed that he was "stupid". <br /> <br /> Despite having Elizabeth Shue, this film is not worth trying if you haven't seen it.
