This film was missing in many areas. It is an Elvis type guy who runs cars and is approached by these BIKERS from SATANS ANGELS. One of them is called Banjo and they beat college kids for fun. They wanted Elvis's boyfriend to be their "driver". At times, I wanted the people of MSTK3000 to remain quiet because the film was actually quite good. Of course, there was violence and many cheap lines, like "What kind of beer do you want? A COLD ONE". That was cheese. The guy who plays Banjo is a great boxer and I was glad to see him do some fight scenes. Furthermore, the FATS rider had a NAZI SWASTIKA on his jacket !!! It was pretty bold, if I have to say so too.
