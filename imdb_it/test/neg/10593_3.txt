I wasn't old enough to really appreciate the original Mod Squad, but I knew everyone thought it was beautiful. I have some of the "books" that were written based on the series in my print-to-screen collection, and they are quite light, so I didn't expect much from the movie. This is a good thing, because this film was badly leashed. <br /> <br /> I admire the risk of creating a film that is so faithful to the success of the 1960s. The film's audience, however, has acquired sophistication in 30 years. At least I think so. I certainly expect something more than an hour and a half of the original Mod Squad concept, with (now old) car chases, (now considered scarce) work with the camera, the soundtrack (poor) and poor) screenplay and everything, on the big screen. In the 60s we didn't care so much because we had minimum expectations. A team of integrated policemen of young people wearing something besides clothes was enough. It was this, another exciting episode of "Ironsides" or "Password." <br /> <br /> Evaluation of this "episode" against the usual theatrical releases, the story was ... well, I'm not sure I should even say because I'm not sure there was one. Are drugs bad? Everything. The script was stupid. When the characters exchange dialogues and advance the plot with phrases like "I heard it said over the phone" and "I think I have a plan", we are really in trouble. No wonder the acting was terrible: nobody knew how to pronounce such idiotic jokes. <br /> <br /> If I were Claire Danes, I would go find my agent with a flamethrower right now. (Actually, I think everyone in and watching the movie has the right to ask for pay.) <br /> <br /> And where was the Mod in that team? I realize that these guys just came out of the youth room, but nobody had a velvet dress? "Mod" meant only young and integrated? What happened to white boots? Perhaps the costume department was going well, but all they had was dirty and dirty. <br /> <br /> Since the film was completely faithful to the original series, and required special behavior from the actors, cameramen, stuntmen, etc., we should appreciate it more. Unfortunately, I don't like it yet. If I wanted to watch the criminal drama of the 1960s, I would buy DVDs. No thanks.
