Just released on DVD in the United States; stay away from it. <br /> <br /> I usually give a lot of space to stupidity in horror movies; I will settle for anything remotely suspicious, supernatural, spooky or even vaguely interesting. This simply stank. I knew there were problems when Sara's "best friend" in college, who had a lot of screen time, wasn't even listed in IMDb titles! I wasn't surprised not to recognize any actor, but that character ("Daysha" or "Day-Glo" or whatever it was called) apparently didn't even exist! <br /> <br /> I am so embarrassed that I actually paid a fee for this junk; deeply, profoundly shameful ...
