I saw this film for the first time on Saturday when I was very young. I thought it was beautiful and I often thought about it. Well, I finally reviewed it on DVD. It was still a lot of fun but in a different way. It must be classified as one of the most clumsy and stubborn science fiction films of 1950. It seemed to be full of escort military footage. The dialogue is sharp and the effects are rough. There is a line of dialogue that made me points. The phrase that Jeff Morrow says while on the beach with the child. Rent it if you need a movie to watch with a bunch of drunk friends. It's a classic.
