Anatomie was a film made in German and with subtitles. It was also too long and boring. If it was to be a horror movie, it failed miserably for me. The actors made their way with the aspect most similar to what they wanted to be elsewhere. the cinematographic work was ok, but more attention would have been needed for the horrible trivial script. I didn't pay anything to watch the video and I still feel cheated. Read a book and save your money.
