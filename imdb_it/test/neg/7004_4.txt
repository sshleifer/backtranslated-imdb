I met Yvette McClendon in a movie at the Los Angeles Film Festival and thought it was a doll. After writing my review of his film there, I wanted to see more! Found this film, it was pretty bad. It's not his fault, it's only in the first few minutes he's obviously the person who lets you in to see this bad movie. Bad direction. The scenes are repeated several times, with all the actresses. Amber Smith has bad breast work, but the other actresses looked pretty good. I really like Yvette but, obviously, it was a bad choice. I can't believe I rented this garbage to look for it. I hope to find his other films.
