The only reason I didn't fall asleep during this movie is because the seats weren't so comfortable. Hannibal is PERIORANDO> ALIORAMENTO> BORING and BORING !!! This film is simply terrible, not due to violence or graphic mutilation. In reality it is rather meek about it. History moves at the speed of a lazy snail. I have a feeling that director Ridley Scott has just called this. The actors are fine and only need a certain direction. Even the soundtrack is very annoying. It is particularly evident since so little is happening in the film. He looks good but it is not a sufficient reason to see him. By the way, did I say it's BORING? <br /> <br />
