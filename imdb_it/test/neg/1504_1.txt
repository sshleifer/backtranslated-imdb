A lesson in objects on how to make a bad movie that masks Horror. Without getting too close, I imagine this is the result of a group of film school students who add bits to the story and then ACTIVATE it! It's like a movie lab of some kind and it's a movie that needs an editor, in which case it would have lasted 10 minutes! The manager of this garbage probably had more money than sense. Consider the number of screenplays submitted or even unreleased films that would have benefited. The so-called granny who was killing people in a rather stupid way looked like Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future or perhaps the musicians Johnny Winter / Edgar Winter. Start with 20 minutes of senseless and boring nonsense from the students, something about paranoia. Giving this garbage 1 is because it cannot be reduced. It doesn't have a single saving feature - and when one of the girls thinks that the body on the floor covered in blood is the guy that jokes about her she must actually TASTE the red stuff before she knows her not tomato ketchup! It is an insult to the intelligence of an idiot
