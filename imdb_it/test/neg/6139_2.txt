************* SPOILERS UNDER ************* "'Night, Mother" is the story of Jesse (Sissy Spacek), a divorced epileptic woman who with calm announces to his brazen mother (Anne Bancroft) that he will commit suicide. This is a fascinating premise that is drained of all vitality and excitement. The brilliant hook appears to be a cheat - the plot that follows is lacking in substance, gravity and revealing value. Where are the shocks and surprises while mother and daughter have what could be the last conversation of their lives? Where are the secrets, confessions, fantasies and regrets revealed? They are here, but they have all been painted with the same opaque color that keeps the emotions in the background and celebrates the "genius" of playwright Marsha Norman at the expense of everything else. The result is not a film but an exhausting endurance test. <br /> <br /> Let me prefigure my comments by saying that I find Sissy Spacek one of the greatest actresses in the history of cinema, a woman so magnetic, so natural that she continues to surprise me and amaze me after twenty years of celebrity. Bring a touch of class and magic to everything he does, and I've seen her save more than one movie from the trash bin with her angelic face and vulnerable eyes, her sweet voice and her sweet smile. It was because of the great Spacek that I saw this film in the first place, and that one of his films is terrible must fail significantly. This film fails in two. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film is so faithfully adapted to Pulitzer's winning script, which is claustrophobic and repetitive. The whole film is a dialogue of two women between Jesse and her mother. What worked on stage - a mother and a middle-aged daughter quarrel for two hours at a small house - dies on film. A game, no matter how big, must be * adapted * for the screen ?? it is self-indulgent and arrogant to believe that dialogue is so perfect that a word is not altered. The script of this film could have been shortened to thirty or forty pages, and a wise scriptwriter would have given the brilliant Spacek and competent Bancroft some * physical * sequences, some facial reactions, something to break the wall-to-wall yak party and a single prison set. No wonder the script was adapted by the original playwright Marsha Norman, who may know the theater but turns out to be unable to interpret the film. <br /> <br /> I can't emphasize the effect of the theatrical script in the film. Watching Jesse and her mother discuss Jesse's impending suicide is redundant and boring. The women go from the living room to the kitchen to the den and return to the living room, where they start all over again. A tiny Midwestern home isn't the ideal location for a single-set movie, and the director never looks for anything clever or original, never tries to break the monotony with an external shot or a split or flashback or * anything *. There is no music, no other character, no other story ... only two women covering the cushions on the sofa and discussing their opinions. Is the reverence given to the game nauseating ?? even the most solemn Shakespeare's classics are shaken by the screen. Does the commitment to the original game seem almost spiteful ?? it is as if the film was made only to document the dramatic treasure that represented the theatrical game, with the audience at a later time. <br /> <br /> The other reason the film fails is Anne Bancroft. She may be a good theater actress, but on film - where presence is 80% of performance - she rarely seems to fit. It certainly doesn't fit her, who plays a grandmother from the Midwest but looks more like Mrs. Robinson before her morning coffee. He chases Jesse around the house, appearing more aggravated than stunned, and seems extraordinarily unpleasant, even when his lines convey a loving, if imperfect, woman. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek is as big as ever, honest and open and so beautiful that you actually understand and agree with the choice of her character. Sissy shows us that Jesse is a flat tire, a wrong turn for a woman who has had every bad break and made too many wrong choices. He has never had control of his life, and his suicide will be his way of saying finally "No more - this is where I go". Is that how he puts it anyway, and when Spacek speaks ?? you listen. He shows in all his films that a good actress should not behave like a man, it should not be all bluffing, bravado and testosterone borrowed. In this and in films like "Coal Miner's Daughter", do you quietly demonstrate a soft strength and silent depth that is as impressive as it is hypnotic? you can't help but fall in love with it. <br /> <br /> That's why it was so hard for me to watch "Night, Mom". Spacek is wasted on an acute feat of a film that never serves to engage or distract. I would not recommend this film to anyone but loyal Sissy fans like me and even then you will be disappointed. I give the film a whole letter grade bonus for the ending, which is brave enough to let the protagonist do what's right for * her * and not indulge in a trivial happy ending. GRADE: C
