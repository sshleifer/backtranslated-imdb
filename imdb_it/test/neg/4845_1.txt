I wish I would have read more reviews and more opinions on this film before I rented it. A waste of money. A waste of time. Very little dialogue. Dialogue was difficult to understand in any way. The plot and the plot were both weak. The only thing that was beautiful was photography. <br /> <br /> The characters were interesting. At the same time you will spend so much time trying to understand things, due to the lack of dialogue, that you will get the movie back a lot. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. It was a disaster and it will leave you a mess. <br /> <br /> Will you say, what on earth was it when the film ends?
