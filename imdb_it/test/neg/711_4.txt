OK, so it's not even nice, but just because of how great Laurel and Hardy have been in the past. If this film received a total overhaul, with improved image quality, add a new dubbing to the damn dubbed voices and added nice unobtrusive background music, then this movie would really start to take shape. As it is, it has its problems. People do it for as long as boys are. That surprise! they were about 60 years old and had led a "life". However, for me, they still came across something fascinating, and even if this doesn't even come close to tickling the feet of their classics (I've given it a 4), it's worth looking at simply because it's them. To think otherwise would be an impostor !!
