When I first saw the trailer for The Comebacks, it looked absolutely horrible and I had no interest in seeing it, but when it came out on DVD today, I thought there was nothing else that caught my interest, I would rented and given is a coup. I looked at it in a tone and it wasn't so bad. I think it was immature and stupid at times, but there were some funny moments that made me laugh. I don't really watch a lot of sports movies, so I wonder if maybe I saw more, maybe this movie would make more sense to me, but it's all good, I still didn't mind watching the Comebacks that much. I admit, these "stupid spoof" movies are lame, but what is the damage in a stupid joke every now and then? The Comebacks are not so bad if you give them a fair chance. <br /> <br /> Coach Fields is failing in life, family and career, but when offered the chance to bring his career back to life if he can bring a freer football team into the league. But the team is really terrible, like over terrible. But with a little work and teamwork they try to do their best, even if it could turn into something more sad. <br /> <br /> The Comebacks is not the worst movie I've ever seen, I think it's good for a few laughs and giggles. I know it was stupid, but I couldn't help but laugh when the coach comes in the middle of a fight in the locker room and is beating the nerd's head against the locker, only he and the nerd in general have been so funny together . If you have an open mind and don't take this movie too seriously, I think you'll have fun watching it, if you look at it expecting it to be an Oscar material, this is not the movie for you. /> <br /> 4/10
