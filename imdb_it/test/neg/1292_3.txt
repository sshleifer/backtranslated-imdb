I'm sorry, but this film is just a superficial way for me. In it, Perez is a taxi dancer with her boyfriend Keitel trying to make him an actress. First of all, what the hell is a taxi dancer? Even after having passed all this, I don't know yet. Oh yes, Perez also inspires DeLorenzo to follow her like a puppy in love. There is no reason behind love, it's just like it happens. There are times when characters and events really try to pull the strings of the heart, but they rarely work. The only character you really try anything with or for Keitel's character is just because he does a good job with it. Any other actor and character would have been like the others. <br /> <br /> The script is basically an uninspired remake of how hard it is to do it as an actor / actress. It has been done and said before, language and dialogue seem to be written by a street pimp. The ending is ... well, I don't want to ruin it. Let's just say it looks unsatisfactory. I would be more upset if the story was a good thing to start with. The direction is average with nothing really wonderful, but nothing really painful to watch. To reiterate acting, the only one who does anything worth looking at is Keitel. Although I could have lived without seeing him in tiger print bikini underwear. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, Eddie Bunker introduces himself. As casual as that mention, it is so random in the film. And Tarantino does his friend the friend a favor by showing himself for about 20 seconds.
