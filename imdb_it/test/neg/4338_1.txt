Don't pay attention to the rave reviews of this movie here. It's the worst Van Damme movie and one of the worst of all genres I've ever seen. It would appeal to someone without any depth that requires nothing more than gunshots and explosions to entertain. <br /> <br /> Since this is directed by Peter Hyams he made me realize that Peter has no talent as a director, but he is very good at filming explosions and the like. However, films also need other elements; for example, a story. This one didn't have one. This could explain the horrible nature of some of Mr. Hyams' more recent films, almost none better than this, really. <br /> <br /> You can't help but wonder why some people have been put behind a camera.
