First of all I don't know if I should use my imagination in this film or the director was trying to save money or save on the budget! Here we go .... <br /> <br /> Basically there were so many years and gaps that I don't understand, it's like the movie went up from 9 years to 20 to 30 and so many gaps that make you ask questions like hell happened? and why? I think this is a great flow. Forget the reviews that continue to complain about the story, this film has not only history problems, but also has many flaws. So most people keep saying that you watch this in the cinema you will lose all the cinemas like rivers, deserts, etc. It is true that they are beautiful because I waited for BluRay at 1080p. OK! beautiful scenes, but what's the point? I turned the film off after 1 hour and a half, I just lost interest. The film kept doing exactly the same things by jumping for years (at least he put the director for example, after 2 years after 10 years!) I mean I couldn't watch the movie, I lost the understanding of what's going on! Anyway, I wish I could include spoilers, but when you decide to watch this movie, ask yourself how it happened? you will know what I mean! Not watching this movie is a waste of time.
