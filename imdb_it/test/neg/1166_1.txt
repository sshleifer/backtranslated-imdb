When "Deranged" was released, the directors considered it appropriate to transform Ed Gein into Ezra Cobb even though the resulting film was actually quite close to the facts of the known case. I assume it was fictional enough to think that they would have to change their name and so. <br /> <br /> "Ed Gein - The Butcher Of Plainfield" masquerades as a true story about the Gein case, but in reality bears little resemblance to the story. As a biopic film, it's a parody. If ever a film needs to change its name, this is much more than "Deranged". It's so close to the real crime story as "Dirty Harry" was to the true story of the Zodiac murders. <br /> <br /> OK, so, apart from the annoyance, how is a horror movie? Well, like a horror movie, well, as a film in general, it's pretty scary. One of the worst movies I've sat in these months. The problems go like this: 1) Kane Hodder is surprisingly miscastose like Ed Gein. Absolutely unfit for the part, Hodder merely casts threatening glances. Very ugly. <br /> <br /> 2) Kane Hodder is the best actor in the film! The rest of the cast are rather "dramatic amateurs" and absolutely non-addictive. It is painful to see the publication of some lines. <br /> <br /> 3) The occasional efforts of cinematic elegance seem to come from "The Big Book Of Moody Cinematography Clich√©". You have seen everything before, better executed. Regardless of style efforts, the rest of the film production is largely inept: the cameras tremble, the shot is ugly, there are long unnecessary strokes that slow down the rhythm ... which leads me to ... <br / > <br /> 4) It seems to go on forever. It's less than 90 minutes long, but sitting is a difficult test. You swear it lasted two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> 5) And Gein seems almost secondary. Mostly the film deals with the family business of a newly promoted sheriff. Said Deputy is played by an abysmal actor on whose shoulders a film should not rest. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this? Well, the gore FX are very good. Some convincing wounds are on display and the makeup is generally excellent. None of this, however, compensates for the film's enormous failures. <br /> <br /> It doesn't even have a kitsch value, it's just bad; not bad, not "so bad is good", just really bad. A film to be avoided and despised.
