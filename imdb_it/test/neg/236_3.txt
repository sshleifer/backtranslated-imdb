Like many films involving young children, this starts "real cute" and likeable ... and then, after about half an hour, it becomes the opposite. <br /> <br /> This is certainly the case here in this story of time travel (which I usually love) in which an adult meets a child who is really him at the age of eight! Excellent premise and great actor in Bruce Willis, but ..... <br /> <br /> The boy "Rusty" is a clever and whiny little boy and Willis Rusty now raised as "Russell" becomes abrasive with his continuos yell out. Is this entertainment? No thanks. <br /> <br /> The young Breslin became a very good child actor, being involved in numerous films including "The Cat in Hat" in front of a most famous child actor: Dakota Fanning. <br /> <br /> Overall, a disappointing film, especially with all the good press that this film had when it was released.
