Dennis Hopper had to be really hungry to make this movie. Atrocious special effects, bad writing, poor dialogue, stupid-looking bio-robots. Never mind the resounding contempt for science. The embarrassing scene with the 2 young leaders taking off their clothes. The best part of this film was the cyber-penis on the cyborg-captain pirate. 2 out of 10 stars because I am in a generous mood.
