Very strong, very sad, no real drama. Why not create a documentary? This is not exactly the Passion of Joan of Arc. The only reason to see Chronicles is to listen to the performances. I love Bach's music and I also found it difficult to endure this misery of a movie. The great Gustav Leonhardt plays (in two ways) Bach. We don't have much sense of him as an actor, since he has given so little to do dramatically. Mostly, he can walk intentionally or angrily out of various rooms. Bach's life, of course, was not an Errol Flynn movie. It was really rather dingy and more than a little difficult. This probably means that life is not a formidable candidate for a film. Music, of course, is another story. I recommend Bach's stations. Much more information, first and foremost, and some insights into music, which is, after all, why Bach interests us first.
