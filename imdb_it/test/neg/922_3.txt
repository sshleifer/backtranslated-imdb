Big cast of ensembles, but unfortunately a lot of undeveloped ideas make the film drag. One does not feel satisfied at the end after having waited for some conclusion, closure, or at least an ironic touch. <br /> <br /> He had that familiar "Curb" without daring, I say, Larry as the annoying polar opposite. The music was there, the "show on nothing" scenes opened up, but without any thread or suspense - it falters like a solo project that has run out of budget. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: the title of the film is about cheese but she prefers rice pudding. Is cheese a better title than rice pudding? He prefers any junk food, regardless of the expiration date. Maybe I want somebody "cheese-dogs" or ice cream in a pirate suit to have at least tied some scenes together. <br /> <br /> Marty: this is not at all funny and exaggerated. People don't just care about a "show" in a show. A coffee table on coffee books was more fun. Unless you're a big fan of the cast, save time and eat cheese. You don't even need to be with anyone.
