The most extravagant of all Jaws' crap has been done with regret by one of my favorite directors of all time; Lamberto Bava (below his pseudonym of John Old Jr.). You know how it goes in these cheap European imitations, right? They just want their monstrous animal to be bigger, sicker and more threatening, but this more often leads to the opposite effect. Bava's creature is a huge sea devil and is much more than just a shark! It seems we are dealing with a prehistoric monster, with the jaws and appetite of a great white, but it also has tentacles like an octopus! It is up to a couple of dolphin oceanologists to find out how this monster managed to survive all these thousands of years and why it just started its murderous madness. The script of "Monster Shark" does not make much sense and most of the action takes place on the mainland. The shark itself is an unwittingly laughable creation and it was a wise decision by Lamberto Bava to show it only vaguely and quickly. Acting performance is above average and underwater photography is surprisingly clear and well managed. The plot twists are predictable and you'll probably have the funniest discovery of detailed facts about the characters. For example: it counts all the beer cans that dr. Hogan drinks during the whole movie!
