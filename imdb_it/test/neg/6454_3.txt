A bad and heartless Hollywood shit that waits for nothing but ugliness and heartlessness from its audience. The scenes WITHOUT Spacey reveal how terrible the movie really is. But the Spacey scenes are so funny that you hold on until the end. Yes, he could play this part in sleep, but he does it so well, it's such a joy to look at, so believable and wonderfully monstrous. Enjoy it for its performance, but don't expect more from this movie. If you want to see a great film about the evils of modern Hollywood, take a look at Robert Altman's "The Player". This sad little potboiler is not remote in the same league.
