... when this movie was active. <br /> <br /> What a bore. An attempt at humor, but in reality it does not pull too well. Some good ideas were expressed, and the makeup and wardrobe of the actors were OK. I was expecting a lot more, unfortunately I couldn't see any more, I was turned off in the middle of the video, and expelled the tape, went to the rental shop to get my money back ...
