I have to say this, this is the first movie I'm reviewing here. I haven't finished looking. I mean .. I COULDN "CONTINUE" No matter how adamant I look at things until the end, "The Ballad Of The Sad Caf√©" has not equaled this viewer. Vanessa Redgrave plays the strange woman in the city who does things like walking across the river with a set of clothes on. Anyway, a long lost relative comes to visit, he's a dwarf and ... well, that's what I got. What the hell was the point of all this "I didn't even bother to wait for Michael Carradine to come in, since I was already punched by the combination of the slow script and having to deal with a dwarf in a dramatic role. I call this cinema from table of cinema that attracts only a few of you, but others ARE ALWAYS.
