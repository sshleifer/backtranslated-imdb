The name of this film and the clips I saw made me believe that this film would have interesting emotions and moments. I was disappointed. The desert sands were interesting, but this film proceeded at a snail's pace. He started with an underground cave and something came out, but then he tried to involve us with the lives of some very unpredictable human beings. When they found dead bodies, or should I say, skeletons with some meat on them, did they start looking for why? Sometimes it has become a little different since something was following them in the desert. Some kind of black slime or something that would start to eat the flesh of humans. As the meat was chewed, a bag of bones began to creep up behind the remaining humans. The reason for this black flow, as we find out, was pretty ugly, ants? Unbelievable! So the ending didn't make sense. I imagine the motto of this movie will be, when you get an itch and you will see an ant, kill it quickly before the ant's friends sniff your flesh.
