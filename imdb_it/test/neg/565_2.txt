The doom and the gloomy commissioner Peter Watkins approaches the pond to reach the American judicial system around 1971 with this priceless piece of paranoia zeitgeist that leans over and over again. Watkins is a pure tourist as he assembles this our gang tragedy with clich√© freaks, hippies and black revolutionaries lined up against triggering happy and military policemen and a kangaroo court tribunal composed of calcified disapproving adults who make cheap fashion statements. Let's talk about a revolution. <br /> <br /> In Punishment Park we have a radical youth against a corrupt system because the dissidents convicted of crimes have the choice of prison or a three-day trek through Punishment Park (Death Valley) and freedom. Of course law enforcement officials who monitor their journey are not going to play right and, combined with the stifling heat, the fate of our protagonists seems sealed. <br /> <br /> Punishment Park has elements of Kafka in the setting and theme. Rehearsals are held under a large canvas tent where chained prisoners shout the challenge to a hardcore lover or leave the group of inquisitors (as members of Silent Majority for a Peaceful America) growling. Neither group spends much time listening to each other and the process sometimes takes on a parental battle for the keys to the car's look. Mostly it's just one of the parts that says what's wrong with America, the other that says what's right, nobody offers solutions for change. Meanwhile, the martyrs of Punishment Park incessantly stumble on the cake while the policemen with guns behave like twelve year olds. It's kind of the look of some of my college films from the 70s, when we were younger and we knew more than now. <br /> <br /> Peter Watkins has always been on the losing side and the common man against what he perceives as a few corrupt potentates. Culledon was a strong accusation of military atrocities in eighteenth-century Scotland that still resonates. The war game is a raw look that makes one think about the nuclear consequences that should be required for everyone. Punishment Park also has its value, but for a different reason than expected. Watkins' vision today is a textbook example of the left in full paranoia of the counter-cultural culture of the 1970s and, given the times (Vietnam, Kent State, The Chicago 7), such a strident hysteria seemed not so far from the truth. But 35 years later the fever subsided and Punishment Park with its narrow and unrestrained point of view is a rather stupid race.
