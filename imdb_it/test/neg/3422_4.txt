The Play Macbeth was written by William Shakespeare between the years 1604 and 1606. Since then many other versions of the game have been produced, including remakes completed in 1948, 1971 and 2006. Akira Kurosawa also directed a Japanese version of Macbeth in 1957 titled "Kumonosu j√¥." The game begins with King Duncan hearing about the success of two of his generals, Macbeth and Banquo, in a recent battle with the Irish and the Norwegians. After a quick promotion by Duncan, Macbeth immediately receives a strange feeling of lust, greed and power and does everything in his power to gain access to the crown: even if it includes murder. <br /> <br /> Geoffrey Wright tried creating his version of the famous game in 2006, setting it in the underworld of Melbourne. Just imagine a poor Macbeth who kills hundreds of soldiers with an AK-47 and beats his interpretation of "Bass" at the same time. I'm just joking about it, but one thing it does is pronounce the traditional Shakespeare. And it continues to do so throughout the film. Quite right! Shakespeare meets the ghetto. It's all you could ever hope for! Not?? The new Macbeth is rough and rough enough to match any other action movie of our day, but it lacks decent acting, the right jargon and a good camera work technique. <br /> <br /> The modernized film begins with Macbeth (Sam Worthington) working as a hit man / drug dealer for Duncan (Gary Sweet), a drug lord in Melbourne, Australia. After being promoted to Duncan's Thane of Glamis (as the three witches had predicted), the aspiration begins to take over Macbeth as he lays his eyes on the throne. After promoting Macbeth, Duncan invites himself to Macbeth's home for a night of drugs and alcohol. Before the festivities begin, Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hall) talks to Macbeth about Duncan's killing to take power over the throne. After the bodyguards are drunk and everyone is asleep, Macbeth sneaks into Duncan's room and stabs him to death. After his murder, Macbeth takes all of Duncan's objects including the hidden title and crown. As soon as he thinks he has what he wants, he finds that it will take more than corruption and escape to solve his problems. <br /> <br /> One of the main flaws in the film was acting. A seemingly flashy and full of power Macbeth suddenly turns into a sissy. And he looks like a sad little dog for the whole film. I really don't know if it was Worthington's or Wright's fault, but in any case one of them should have realized that Macbeth was a king, not a knot on a log that took everything to his wife's letter. As I said before, Macbeth should have been rude, arrogant and spiteful. But when his character turns into a drug lord, he too changes his personality. On the other hand, Lady Macbeth really knew how to nip in the bud when it came to recognizing and personifying her character. It didn't seem as spiteful as it was in the drama or in the 1971 version, but it reminds Macbeth that, with respect to murder, anything else he could do would not be up to it. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I found unpleasant was all the nudity. This pussy had to be Wright's fault. The witches didn't do a little acting, unless you call around for the birthday dance. At one point in the film, I started wondering if I was looking at Macbeth or Unique Positions Vol. 2. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong when I say I find Shakespearean dialogue out of place. It's spoken impeccably, but when it's spoken by an Australian gangster, it's really weird. When Macbeth starts killing people, he first lets them know by talking to them in Ye Olde English. Macbeth contains a lot of action, blood, blood and nudity to last anyone for life. Forget all the positive facts even if you start thinking about yourself, "Okay, what on earth did he say in that last sentence?" At some points in the film, I don't even think the actors themselves knew what they were saying. The new era of the film could have been easily pulled out, not for "Thou" and "Thee's". <br /> <br /> Working with the camera was just right for me. One thing I couldn't stand was the constant going back and forth between the characters. The camera technique used emitted that sort of Blair Witch atmosphere and made me vomit a little in my mouth. Matt Reeves tried to try the same camera work, Clover camp, but it doesn't work. It makes me want to get out of my chair and look around for the little bar bags that they comfortably planted on every airplane seat. <br /> <br /> Looking back on this, the gangsta 'Macbeth has a positive one: lots of action. In addition to this, the film contains nothing but an uninspired acting, a correct use of English and a work of chamber that makes the stomach turn. The soundtrack contains one or two of the same songs, but each song is modified or remixed differently for each scene. There is never a variation of interesting or engaging media used. From now on, filmmakers should leave the dangerous world of drugs to Al Pacino and Robert Deniro. Future versions of Macbeth should be created just as Shakespeare intended the show to be 400 years ago. I would recommend the use of medieval clothes, Ye Olde English, swords and shields and a soundtrack prepared by Enya. But in any case, the modern Macbeth makes you want good folk music, a campfire and a bustier.
