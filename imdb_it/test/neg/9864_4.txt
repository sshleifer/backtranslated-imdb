As long as you keep in mind that the production of this film was a maneuver for copyright, and not intended as a serious publication, it is actually surprising how absolutely not horrible it is. I also liked the theme music. <br /> <br /> And if a movie ever shouted for a treatment of Joel (or Mike) and MST3K Bots, that's it! Watch it with a bunch of radiant sages and you'll have a great time. Have a beer, butter some savory pies and have fun. <br /> <br /> Of course, to get a copy you need to buy a bootleg or download it as shareware, but if you're here on IMDb, then it's you. most likely quite experienced to do so. Good luck. <br /> <br /> And look for my favorite part ... where Dr. Doom informs the FF that they have 12 hours to comply with his wishes ... and actually gestures the number "12" with his finger while doing it .... it's like "Evil Sesame Street" .... hoo boy. <br /> <br /> ... and of course Mrs. Storm declares "Just looking at you .. ..the Fanstastic Four" is just so moving ... you will laugh, you cry ..... <br /> <br /> So if you love the schlocky Sci-Fi, this is great for you!
