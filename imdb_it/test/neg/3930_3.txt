A cheap and sad film with little characterization, a lot of stoic underbite style emulation (I think of Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some poor clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for some badly executed Judo flying by John Woo . Even the squibs look horrible. Nowhere in the proceedings does it seem remotely like America. Three old shabby cars don't make a country. The Mustang also has a wobbly right front wheel. The plot, as it is, is so derived and predictable that the ending is like a murder. It couldn't come soon enough. Even the jewels in the robbery look like the most expensive junk-style jewels available. The terrible dialogue and the useless exaggeration of all those affected by a real loss of space and time. It's worth looking at if you want to know how not to make a low budget movie with clichés.
