This movie is an incredible piece of shit. First let me talk about the professionals: Sandra Bullock in a black bathing suit. <br /> <br /> Now the rest of the story is pretty bad. We said computer programmer Angela Bennett (whose online profile is ANGEL - HOW WITTY !!! I bet the filmmakers cheered for an hour) that basically checks the software for other company errors for errors, etc. So let's start with her to order pizza on the Internet and then on the fireplace on her monitor (EXTREME computer skills shown so far). This is after it finds a virus on a Macintosh program that crashes the entire system after pressing the escape key. This is apparently a HUGE problem, but the virus created to do so could be done in about 1 minute with a simple batch file. <br /> <br /> Any event, let's move on. He gets this call from another guy (who works in the same company) and this madman says to go and click on this symbol that apparently opens a secret Internet gateway to a bunch of unprotected "top secret" data woohoo! Angela saves this shit on a record and now the people who created this loophole are out to get it. This, of course, is only after she has been in contact with one of the villains only BEFORE he tries to kill her BEFORE he jumps into the ocean from his boat, BEFORE he ends up in a random hospital. <br /> <br /> Issue # 1: It is not possible to create a loophole on the Internet to gain access to a top secret FBI data set. Where the hell did he come from? Since when can a hacker group control the basic flow of the Internet (even in 95)? Problem n. 2: Angela needs proper identification before a hospital or clinic releases her. He couldn't just put his bags and go. <br /> <br /> So these "hackers" or anything else change Angela's ID so she can't get help from anyone and conveniently all her ID is gone. So go home and a cat and mouse chase keeps going. <br /> <br /> Apparently all the police and FBI staff are stupid and don't believe them. So he must use a series of tactics to enter the building he works in (where the person he is now filling up for her) and return to his old computer. He starts talking to another casual guy and finds out who's behind it all through a BS IP address that the director knows the audience is too stupid to believe. <br /> <br /> Then he runs from some center to send all this information to the FBI. Apparently, it MUST use a mainframe to send email to the FBI. But then the same fool who tried to kill her BEFORE throwing it in the water takes it and easily infiltrates the FBI again (wtf?). But do you remember that beautiful virus? Well, somehow it gets it by luck and even if the virus worked only with the software, now it works on the whole system. It breaks down the entire mainframe that has all the false information because the mainframe was sitting in the middle of a convention ... WHAT THE HELL IS THIS HOUSEHOLD! However, the virus now works and Angela (the real one) escapes and then kills the villain with a fire extinguisher. Obviously he has a gun, he runs towards it, so he is two meters away and then decides to aim. Classic Hollywood. <br /> <br /> All in all this movie is so full of crap and crap. Anyone who doesn't know much about computers will be deceived into thinking that this shit is possible, but not a thing is accurate about computers or the network. And I honestly doubt that I would see a cross-platform Mac virus and a mainframe computer (* LMAO * cough).
