My wife and I haven't seen such a boring thriller in a long time. It is definitely not a compelling story and it is so slow that we almost fall asleep. This could instead be a series of low-budget television crime. There are ridiculous scenes like the one in which the head of the mafia Piran wants to see the jury in red clothes or another mobster can't stop thinking about her and so on. Okay, maybe this should have been a romantic thriller, but believe me, you really don't miss anything. We gave 4/10.
