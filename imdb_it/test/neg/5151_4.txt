No, it's just a cheap 1940 serial that uses the good name of Cap. If you're a fan of comics, you'll be very disappointed. They have radically changed the character. No shield, no Bucky, no fighting with the Nazis, no wings on the side of the mask and, more importantly: Captain America is now a district attorney and is no longer a soldier. <br /> <br /> Dick Purcell as Captain America? Don't look too closely when turning into your costume. It is quite obvious that he was not in the best physical shape when he created this serial (can you say flaccid?). It is also VERY obvious that a stuntman performs most actions here. Almost every chapter has a mandatory fight that is shot and executed exactly the same way. The villain is rather insipid and although he uses an alias (The Scarab), he does not wear a disguise of any kind. The story is repetitive and very simple. The effects are ridiculous and the action is average. On the positive side, there is the sexy Lorna Gray as an assistant to the D.A. and the good captain gets to ride on a bike with a fascinating appearance in a previous chapter. Overall OK but nothing special.
