Taran Adarsh, a noted critic, praised such a dubba movie <br /> <br /> The film has a strange story in which a lover sells his love to a brothel because he wants money to save his mother and then he is also forgiven for this LOL <br /> <br /> The film is crap <br /> <br /> the entire first semester focuses on romance, a comedy that does not work. The twists, but the whole second part is a mess and the climax is clich√© <br /> <br /> The direction of Aditya Datt is bad The music is typical of Himesh <br /> <br /> Emraan plays well his serious role, but his wardrobe, his way of walking through songs.etc is similar to his previous films. Geeta Bhasra annoys Ashmith Patel fails to convince that this actor has been good at Murder only until now and then a Mithun descent for some time on the screen and is fine, but his break in a song is forced Ranjeet is fine
