Seeing this film in the previews I thought it would be witty and in a good mood. Unfortunately it was a standard case of "the funny bits were in the preview", not to say that it was all negative. But "the beautiful pieces were in the preview". <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a teen movie that will put you to sleep then watch this movie.
