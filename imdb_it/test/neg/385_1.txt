Out of 15 people I also lent this film .. No one has finished it .. It was so terribly. ???????? Not good ... Just horrible. He sits in a chair for the entire movie. She is in a closet. The chair that is sitting is pretty. I can't think of anything else to say. But 10 lines of text. To print this. My friend Nick thinks this is a great movie because "he can give it to his friends" and he doesn't have to worry about THAT calling him. He passed it around like a gag movie for 10 years. And that's how I got it .. Then .. I tried to convince my friends to finish this horrible piece of shit at this end ... Not at all, nobody could finish .. It brings boredom to a whole new level. They could use this in Iraq. WITHIN THE WATER BOAT ... PLEASE SEND COPIES Guantanamo BAY CUBA. Makes a great Christmas gift.
