What atrocities. I am not one who demands total verisimilitude from a film, but the plot and the script of "Killing Zoe" are so lacking in art that I found myself wincing for the entire (fortunately short) ninety minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> Readers of these reviews will by now understand the plot: Zoe, a call girl who falls in love with the American safecracker Zed, is also an employee of the bank that Zed will help steal a robbery at Bastille Day at high risk. <br /> <br /> The film puts a strain on its credibility from the start. Zed and Zoe's magic night is very prosaic, and Zoe's claims of having lived the orgasm of a life seem to reflect the screenwriter's persistent adolescent fantasies more than any real on-screen chemistry. Zed's total indifference when his friend Eric throws Zoe out of the hotel room barely places the stage for their strong attachment. <br /> <br /> In the second act, Eric's bohemian band - the drugged losers who lead a marginal petty life - prepare for their big robbery with a night on the town. Here the primary goal of Roger Avary seems to be to show that he knows something about drugs. A secondary thread implies convincing us (with infinite repetition) that Eric is indeed, REALLY happy to see his old friend Zed again. Really happy Eric's devil care, his showy pomp and affection for Zed are nowhere near credible - take a look, for example, at his false amusement at having discovered a dead cat in his apartment building. The development of the characters that will accompany us through the rest of the film is an afterthought. <br /> <br /> The coup is a disaster - understandable, since the plan is ridiculous and the criminals are complete amateurs. This is where Avary continues to pay tribute to his idol Quentin Tarantino by demonstrating that he can be more violent than violent. In reality, though, it's just more boring than boring. To increase the excitement, there is an extra security guard hidden in the main safe. This was boring in video games, and it's boring now. <br /> <br /> Zoe is taken hostage during the robbery, but despite our expectation that she will play a key role, she simply sits nice. Or more precisely, Avary can't do anything with her. In literally the last five minutes she comes to life, breaks the hostage situation and saves the grateful, but continues to stun Zed from suffering the consequences of his crime. Because you don't care that your involvement in the crime - or because they give a damn about him - it's impossible to say. After all, he has not had the chance to see that he is more respectable than the rest of the gang. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the dialogue is fake and fake. Much of it is in French. As a native speaker, I can certify that it doesn't sound even remotely true. Eric's sweet-sweet speech, which alternates quickly with that of a tough guy, is destined to be fascinating and scary, but is instead just a thankful. Meanwhile his scarlet cat accomplices are more Scooby-Doo than Thomas Crown. When Eric is killed in a ridiculous example of excessive force, we can all breathe a sigh of relief: like the bank's hostages, we will soon be freed from this miserable ordeal.
