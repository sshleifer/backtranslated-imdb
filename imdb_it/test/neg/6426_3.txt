The film starts pretty well. It's a really terrifying scene like a couple of fugitives fleeing the law that tears apart an innocent family that lives in an isolated country cottage killing its mother and father. The young daughter only manages to escape with the help of a mysterious specter, who kills the two attackers while she covers in a dresser downstairs. Then, we find her 15 years later as a drugged student who seeks the supernatural, lives with her promiscuous aunt and is cared for by a mysterious redhead. She has no real friends, she was almost raped at a party and continues to have bizarre visions that no one else can see. So life is great. Things become much more pleasant when he has a crisis with his mother's sister, who is then found dead in a bathtub under suspicious circumstances with 11 incisions on his forehead. Hmm, I wonder who will be the main suspect of the police? This is quickly followed by more deaths, all linked by their relationship with our heroine who was in bad shape with them before their death. Could she be the culprit, or perhaps the explanation could be something more ethereal? Clue: if you think the first one, you took the wrong movie from Blockbuster. Go back and take the right one, short-sighted myopic. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was ready to make a quick jump to the good parts, sure knowing that I was not losing anything but a mediocre suspense. But the first ten minutes grabbed me, and I decided to give it a chance. I was pleasantly surprised: it was certainly not a masterpiece, but the acting was quite good and the script continued to raise intriguing situations I couldn't wait to find the solution. Alas, 45 minutes inside, I realized that my attention begins to wander during a long sequence in which the main character is walking around a library, doing nothing. Then we get an economic fright, followed by a quarter of an hour of goddledegook on the paranormal between her and her new boyfriend. Things only got worse from there, since the promising start is thrown out the window when we get one unconvincing twist after another, followed by an anti-climatic ending that is like being promised to the moon and ending a teenage meteorite. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> If it had been bad to the end, it would have been much easier to digest. The fact that he starts as a gallop and barely ends with a groan is not only disappointing, it is heartbreaking. How can something that started so promisingly end up being so formidable? I don't know, and I don't particularly care. I'll just look at the writer and director for the next time: don't spend 5 weeks writing the first part of your script, then 5 minutes to finish the rest. You tend to notice these things in the final product when you treat your project with the same sloppiness you have here ... 3/10
