Stranded in Space (1972) version MST3K - a not very good TV movie pilot, for a series never realized, in which an astronaut finds himself trapped in the evil twin of the Earth. Having a planet of identical size and mass in orbit on the same level as the earth, but on the opposite side of the sun, is a much-consumed SF chestnut - the idea is over 2,000 years old, having been invented by the ancient Greeks. In this version the Counter World is managed as a 'perfect' Orwellian society. Where, for totally inexplicable reasons, everyone speaks English and drives late American model cars. After escaping from his prison hospital, the terrifying Earthian is chased by Southern California and the brave star of Cameron Mitchell, who like his henchmen wears double-breasted suits and black jumpers, an elegantly evil combination that I will absolutely adopt if I ever become a gentleman totalitarian. Our hero escapes several times before ending up staring at the three moons of the alien world and wondering aloud if he ever returns home - thus creating one of those lonely men in a hostile world that makes a new friend every week but moves to end of Each episode is so loved by the 70s and 80s ("The Fugitive", "The Incredible Hulk", "The Littlest Hobo", etc.). The most curiously strange bit was the title sequence. Halfway between the first airing of "Stranded in Space" (with the title "The Stranger") in 1972 and the MST3K version in 1991, he somehow acquired some footage of the 1983 film "Prisoners of the Lost Universe" . Thus, in 1991, the opening credits of "Stranded in Space" came down under some blows of three people who fell into a matter transmitter and vanished. It is a sequence that has nothing to do, even thematically, with everything that will follow. <br /> <br /> Just to add to the confusion of the nerd B, one of the actors in this nailed movie, Kay Lenz, later appeared in a 1994 movie called "Trapped in Space". Knowing this fact could never save your life, but you could score very big points and admire the looks of other trash movie fans - if I could find a way to maneuver the conversation to the point where you could randomly insert it without looking at it as a total idiot ...
