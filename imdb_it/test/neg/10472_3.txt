In Sweet Water, ambitious entrepreneur Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is building a resort in the middle of the desert under the Katonah protest. When three workers find relics and Indian bones in a ditch at the site, they unintentionally release the giant skeleton creature known as Mangiaossa and their bones are devoured by the monster. Half-Blood Sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) a.k.a. Running Wolf is in charge of investigating the disappearance of the workers, having been pressured by Krantz to arrest the protesters. But Bone Eater attacks and kills other locals, while Chief Storm Cloud (Michael Horse) searches for an ancient Tomahawk capable of destroying the evil creature. <br /> <br /> "Bone Eater" is a lame and silly film, with one of the most ridiculous script I've ever seen. The characters and the situation are not well developed and things happen without further consequences. The conclusion is probably the worst part in this film, with the typical North American white Bruce Boxleitner dressed as an Indian (in the story, his grandfather was an Indian), cutting off his wrist (why? And where will the blood be after?) And awkwardly throws the ax in the bone-eater's chest, destroying the monster and my last hope for improvement in history. My last question: if the bone-eater eats bones, what happens to the flesh and clothes of his victims? My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Devorador de Ossos" ("The Bone Eater")
