In the dusty town of Furlough, Texas, an animal is slaughtering cattle and locals. When the teenager Tommy (Michael Carreo) is killed, his friends Anna Furlough (Erika Fay), his Mexican-American boyfriend Miguel Gonzalez (Gabriel Gutierrez), Jill Gillespie (Sara Erikson) and Rosie (Martine Hughes) discover that a Mexican werewolf Chupacabra is the killer and draw a plan to kill the beast. <br /> <br /> "The Mexican Werewolf in Texas" is an amateur crap and one of the worst movies I've ever seen, if not the worst. Nothing works in this film: the script is ridiculous, with some of the most terrible lines I've ever heard. The management does not exist and the camera follows the "style" of "The Blair Witch Project". Amateur acting seems to be a joke of high school students or a school play. The "special effects" are macabre and extremely poor and the "werewolf" is the cheapest I've ever seen. Ed Wood's films are cult, but this "Mexican werewolf in Texas" is pure junk. In the end, Jill says that no man can resist his teats (actually the best thing about this movie). But I think the correct quote should be "no man (or woman) can resist watching this movie until the end". I was driven by my curiosity to see how bad a movie can be and I lost 88 minutes of my life, but I think most viewers will stop seeing with less than 20 minutes of time. My vote is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Lobisomen Mexicano no Texas" ("A Mexican Werewolf in Texas")
