Friz Freleng's Snafuperman is one of the minor Private Snafu short films. A warning about the importance of studying the field manual, "Snafuperman" makes it rather clumsy. The story, in which the Technical Fairy, the First Class makes Snafu a superhuman to help him see the error of his ways, is predictable and little fun. The first "Rumors" by Freleng's Snake had previously been full of ideas and laughter, but here the director is full of rather boring arguments and strives to take a funny example. Even at about three minutes in length, "Snafuperman" seems to drag and, unlike the best cartoons in the series, it looks like an educational film first and entertainment second. Although they were thrown out faster than the usual Warner cartoons, the Snafu courts largely maintained a surprisingly high standard. 'Snafuperman' is a reflection of the kind of quality one could reasonably expect from a less talented group of creative minds.
