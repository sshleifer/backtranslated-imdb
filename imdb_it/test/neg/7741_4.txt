I saw the MST3K version of the film, and this review includes minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, it looked like it could promise me like a sci-fi movie, but the more I watched, the more disappointing it got. The first reason is rather idiosyncratic: I liked the shy and shy girl with glasses much more than the model that Wanda became at the end of the film. More deeply, it was the fact that the loss of glasses and the change of clothes replaced any real character growth. Instead of growing into a character who could take care of herself, Wanda was just as dependent on males doing everything for her as she was at the beginning of the film. The acting could have been better (even though I got tired of the cracks on Ireland's voice - they were even in the movie itself! It's not so bad.) The background was ok, but it was a bit mocking (aliens = humans with facepaint ), and could have used more explanations. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was just that I was interested in the movie itself, but Joel and the robots did little for me. The film could have been better without them. <br /> <br /> In general (for the film itself, not for the MST3K), a 3 out of 10. It was a perfect film, for what it was.
