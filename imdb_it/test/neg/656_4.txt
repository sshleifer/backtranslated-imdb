A wildly irregular film in which the main problem is the difficult mix of comedy and thriller. For me, the unusual premise is clearly a comedy, and they should have gone for an all-out comedy. For example, Rock has funny lines, but sometimes it's too unlikely for a comedy. The scene in which Betty's husband is scalped is too unpleasant for what should have been a less violent comedy. An even better example is the left-wing Hollywood writer who preaches us trite through the character of Freeman, at the beginning, on the situation of the Indians; I mean - yawn! They should have given Freeman something fun to say in that segment, but this is obviously a lot more difficult than just writing a boring talk to him on the PC. <br /> <br /> There is even more PC New Age in the form of the ending: the girl not only does not get the boy - does not get any boy; in fact, the message is that the girl doesn't need any boyfriend! A bit of a feminist statement there. The first half hour is weak, but the film improves - ironically - once Zellweger arrives in Kinnear. I say "ironically" because I'm not very Kinnear fans, even if it's solid here. Zellweger is very nice, as usual; she has that kind of cute all-American look that almost every type should like, and I have to ask myself why nowadays more of these women are not "represented", instead of the dogs that inexplicably become stars, like Diaz, Roberts, Aniston, Lopez or Barrymore. <br /> <br /> Since the film tries to be very serious at times, I have no choice but to criticize the character of Freeman who is the equivalent of the gangster of the film world with the prostitute - golden heart. There is absolutely nothing in the relationship between Freeman and Rock to even remotely suggest that they were father and son.
