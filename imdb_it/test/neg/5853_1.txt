Comic stories by Michael Allred, especially his work on Madman, are usually very funny. "Astroesque", the independent film by Allred, is the exact opposite of the fun. <br /> <br /> The worst acting ever combined with really horrible dialogues makes the cinematic experience brutal. Sure enough, Allred understands that the WTF is happening, but it's the only one. Dare that you watch the whole casino is not enough ... it challenges you to watch the whole casino is more focused. <br /> <br /> "Astroesque" is a kind of cinematographic bond with the "Red Rocket" of Allred 7 "comic strip, which, ironically, is mostly illegible. So, if your" Astroesque "experience it's not terrible enough, surely it tracks down over-sized comics and continues the fun. <br /> <br /> Sorry for Allred, who was totally out of his attempt to shoot a movie, even sorry for myself, what an incredible waste of time and money, please buy my VHS copy, which is available on eBay right now.
