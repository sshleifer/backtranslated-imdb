In Bollywood it is not uncommon for worthless films to become successes, good films that collapse and good actors do not make it great <br /> <br /> AKS is a film of this type <br /> <br /> Himesh after a musical director and the singer tried to recite Hell man, only because his songs became a success, which means that later he becomes an actor <br /> <br /> The producers were sure that the film might work, even the songs were a hit and of course Himesh made his advertising as cheap as usual <br /> <br /> The film tells such a poor story, bad direction, such poor acting that makes you shudder < br /> <br /> Indian rickshaws in Germany, Himesh stunts and many stupidities Himesh's cap is intact even when he is in a car doing somersaults <br /> <br /> Direction is poor Music saves grace even if most of the songs play the same <br /> <br /> Himesh he tries hard but unfortunately his emotional scenes are a joke, there are no expressions, he is the most suitable for his music director and a bit of singing. He cuts a sad image. Hansika is horrible Malika is fine Sachin Khedekar is in place, Dars han Jhariwala
