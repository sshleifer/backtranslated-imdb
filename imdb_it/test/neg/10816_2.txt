"The Cave" was released more or less simultaneously with the British film "The Descent", directed by Neil Marshall. Both films share a similar premise; only "The Cave" is terribly unoriginal, not very exciting and incompetent compared to the splendid horror adventure of "The Descent". It seems that Neil Marshall realized that the basic story was too poor and immediately added ingenious ideas, depth and a personalized style, while "The Cave" - ​​director Bruce Hunt simply dedicated himself to the most rudimentary elaboration of the script that was launched on his desk. The result is an incredibly mediocre film that features every single horror you can think of and where most violence happens off screen. And we all hate him, don't we? The story introduces a clique of unbearable sub-caves that remain trapped in a completely unknown Romanian underground ecosystem. Horrible winged creatures, which also happen to be parasites, soon attack them and escape seems impossible due to a landslide. The first half hour is still pleasantly fun if you keep yourself busy identifying all the clichés and listening to the dialog boxes of the cheese text, but the whole thing becomes really terrible. None of the events is even slightly plausible and it seems that the entire cast is in competition with each other to offer the worst performances. I have already seen better special effects in anonymous films on B, the positions of the shootings have not been exploited to the maximum and the ending has been decidedly disgusting! Very NOT recommended!
