The story briefly talks about the faithless priest, Daniel Clemens (Christian Slater), who is approaching a case where another priest is suspected of murder. The priest denies being guilty but at the same time is unable to discuss the issue because of confidentiality. Enter Daniel Clemens who starts playing the cop ... <br /> <br /> While the plot isn't ridiculous, everything else is. Let's start on the visual side, cinematography is boring, it looks more like a TV series than a movie. The corners of the camera are boring, in fact, there is not a single memorable corner of the whole film. There are no interesting close-ups that reveal details. And the scene transitions, well, there's not much to say about those, they are not fluid at all, there seems to be no connection between the scenes compared to the real storyline. Ok, they used a transition with music between two scenes, but there are no interesting visual transitions in the whole film, fade times were used there was no visual connection between the scenes. <br /> <br /> The boring visual part could be forgiven if the film offered something else. Unfortunately, the film offers only forced acting in wood and clumsy dialogues without punch. Furthermore, the film suffers from audio problems, the sound volume is lowered several times in the film as if the microphones were too far away. <br /> <br /> I didn't foresee the solution of the film. It could be because the film never gave me the opportunity or could be due to the presentation, which was so boring that I never even tried to figure it out. <br /> <br /> Put two plus two together and it is the same as B-movie where "B" stands for boring.
