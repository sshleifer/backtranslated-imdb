That this film was hung on the wall of a chapel as proof that God is really dead. Am I the only one who really saw (rather slept) through this "movie"? This is the only film I've ever seen in the theater that I regret not having started and asking for my money back: it was just so boring. And I even saw "Highlander 2: The Quickening" at the local cinema. From start to finish, Gibson and Downey have absolutely no chemistry as two unlikely, put together by circumstances, that eventually work together as best friends. The action (what little there is) is as stupid and boring as the writer's stem. Thanks to any divinity it awakens us while watching our "cinema" that there is no possibility for an "Air America 2."
