Congratulations to the DP of Baxley for making this look like a real movie, the first time it happened in this series (with the notable exception of the F / X scenes). However, by approaching the production values ​​of the film, it has lost most of the entertainment value of the first two. They were very much in the "so bad they are good" category of hideous animated films. Can a discussion be made even if the "believers" were simply trying to make a generic action movie with prayer in it? There are so many times in the movie where they discard their belief system to be boring. If all that happens is according to the will of God and it is simply his tools, that the people who were infected by the virus happened as part of his plan, right? Apply it to any situation in which someone of faith does not submit to the will of God, and get a little hypocritical movie from the director of "Action Jackson".
