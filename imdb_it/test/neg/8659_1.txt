this is the worst movie i've ever seen and what disappoints me most is that it's yash raj movies so when you first see the promotions you think yes, this is definitely another yash success but when you see the movie your eyes will dry up We disappoint the plot is stupid and stupid we have seen it many times the boy gets married soon and falls in love with a girl blah blah blah. if you see this pathetic movie don't go with your family there's too much scene of exposure and kiss. I don't even see why you would go and see it for yourself. overall this is a disgusting disgrace and anything else that is bad and starts with a movie d not going to see it you'll end up hating yash ji and yash raj films
