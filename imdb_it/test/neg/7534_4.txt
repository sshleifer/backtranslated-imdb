Think of an extremely low rent version of "Heathers" and you have "Pep Squad". This sums up the film in a few words. I have to give credit to those who are due, though. The film looks good. I liked the photography, I liked the wild colors, I liked the costumes. But without good acting, a film has no saving value. I'd rather watch a movie with little visual appeal, with good actors and sharp dialogues (such as "The Brothers McMullen" or any Edward Burns movie). The actors recite their dialogue in monotony or shout it as if they were in a bad soap opera. This is why I don't bite most of the traditional actors. Let's face it, most of the actors who are mainstream are mainstream for a reason. If they are not "big" actors, they are at least competent. Leo DiCaprio's people faint, but when was the last time you saw a movie in which you read the dialogue as if you were reading it off the page? It's a shame, because the director seems to know his stuff when it comes to mis en scene (sp). At the same time I can't totally commend Steve Balderson (the director). He wrote the script, which contains some horrible dialogues. It could also be slightly racist, since there is a black protagonist in the film, who lives in the culmination of African-American stereotypes.
