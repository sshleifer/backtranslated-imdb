A boring yawn of a film that preserves nothing of the zing and rationality of its predecessor, "Gold Diggers of 1933". The production code was firmly in place at the time of the release of this film, so the humor is all I have in mind, the Wocka-Wocka variety, and those that sounded so cosmopolitan dripped from their lips went of the beautiful ladies of the first film. A cast of second-rate stars and character actors pass through the movements, and the "puttin on a show" motif seems terribly forced; instead of the world of Broadway make-and-break, the show here is a charity event hosted by a swanky hotel. Who really cares if the show continues or not? Here too the score is bland. Obviously the big number of the film is "Lullaby of Broadway", which accompanies a long number of fantasy dance on the final disappearance of a New York socialite from too many parties - it doesn't have exactly the same effect as the "Forgotten Man" number used as a final in the '33. Busby Berkeley directs as well as choreographing this film, and any promise made in the film's fluid opening scenes deteriorates rapidly. Unfortunately, no one learned any lessons from this, and there was another Gold Diggers movie two years later. <br /> <br /> Vote: C-
