My original comment on this particular title has been deleted, by an IMDb user or by the staff, just because I happened to not like this movie to the point that I had to honestly write what I felt after seeing this excuse for a movie. where is my freedom of speech? <br /> <br /> Obviously this film was made by the students, so lame and amateurish that one felt. Obviously they too must start somewhere? The script was an inconsistent mess, as was acting. With low budget and b-class actors, what can you expect? There are some CGIs in places, so poor, it seems to be made with an old PC. Some might say that this is a sort of "alien" clone, only this time it's Dracula (in a vintage costume) who is sucking the other dry cast, one by one. The sets are unconvincing, cheap and small (boiler rooms), although the story takes place in a large spaceship. <br /> <br /> It would be fun to know what stars (Erika Eleniak, Casper Van Dien, Coolio and Udo Kier) thought of the film after its release ... Coolio must be the worst rapper to become an actor ever! <br /> <br /> It was a total waste of time and money, I don't know why I took the trouble to rent this movie. Honestly, I hate this movie. With the house of the dead by Uwe Boll, Dracula 3000 shares the indisputable honor of being the worst film ever. (Well, I've seen even worse than these two) <br /> <br /> Avoid! Any other film will do better.
