I LOVE Sandra Bullock - She's one of my favorite actresses of all time - but this is a movie that she should have paid a long time ago to be rubbish. I realize that he is almost 20 years old, but my dead grandmother can behave better than these people did. Warning: not even the $ 5.50 WalMart rack is worth ... You know that when the acting stinks so badly that it's not even worth a couple of dollars - sound quality is horrendous - there are no subtitles to even hear the horrible dialog box, and it looks like it was shot on a budget of $ 1.98. I thought I'd like to see Sandra in an early role to see how she evolved as an actress, but YIKES is a word too kind to use ...
