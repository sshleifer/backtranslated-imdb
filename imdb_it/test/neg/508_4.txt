The recent death of Stephen Bach, one of the producers of HEAVEN'S GATE, has raised the specter of at least a partial resurrection of the reputation of the cursed film. In addition, the original version, the "long version" was recently published on TCM, exposing the film, in all likelihood, to its largest audience ever. <br /> <br /> I saw the film when it was first released in a movie theater in a cinema on 3rd Avenue across the street from Bloomingdales. I think he was released on Friday and retired the following Wednesday. Maybe it wasn't a good show, but it was and is a terrible movie. Since the full version has recently confirmed that judgment and with thirty years of experience in watching and writing films, I am more able to articulate why. <br /> <br /> First there is the dreaded phrase "staging" "whose definition is at the same time so simple and yet so amorphous as to be undecided even after being defined. Basically it is all that happens in front of a camera. For example, an extra crowd will be given a piece of action, let's just say walking on the sidewalk and a starting point. When the deputy director shouts the action, the extra will go through their action. another take, the extra will go back to the starting point and go back to "action". All the extras do this. Then you say that a taxi goes up on the pavement and the star goes down and embraces another headmaster while the crowd are doing their This is mise-en-scene. In the theater they call it a block, but cinema is much more multidimensional. <br /> <br /> The importance of defining the staging is because when French critics developed their own the theory of the auteur unlike an author was a m√©tier- en-scene, even more derided as a "policeman". An author was intimately involved in the meaning of a film and through the director's body of work a different theme or themes. The metier-en-scene was basically a company that made in the film what had been handed down on paper. It's the difference between saying John Ford and Sam Wood. <br /> <br /> The second point is how the director, Michael Cimino, entered the film director position. Cimino earned the record by directing the first million-dollar television commercial. This depicted a Chevrolet floating along the Grand Canal in Venice. This spot never appears on any list of the greatest TV commercials of all time and is noteworthy only for its cost and how exaggerated it was. The effect is similar to that of a three-year-old girl brought to entertain a company that gets its greatest response when it hurls the dress over its head. Cute for a three year old child, embarrassing for a thirty year old. So Cimino was immediately praised for having spent a large sum of money on some exaggerated images and so he learned. <br /> <br /> His first film, THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT (1974) has a scene in which Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are passengers in a moody car that drives back and forth, back and forth, until he leaves the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits and proceeds to shoot one by one. I had the feeling that if the producer, Eastwood, had not intervened, the scene would last until the death of each rabbit. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to HEAVEN'S GATE. I imagine that if you watch the movie on a DVD in fragments like a mini series, it can be awesome. This is because the scenes are directed with such a dense staging that every scene is like an encyclopedia which is simply exhausting to sit through almost four hours of this. It's like sex, at some point it becomes just a whip. There is the 40 minute opening, which takes place at Harvard. Photographed brilliantly at Oxford, it is something non-sequitur. I personally favor the artistic way of explaining a story in contrast to the more commercial "Now I'll tell you what I'm about to tell you" about most movies. However, the whole preface is added to a single line: Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt went to Harvard together. Now twenty years later ?? All this time, money and effort, not to mention all the attention and energy of the public just to provide this information almost useless. <br /> <br /> Then there is the scene in the road between Kristofferson and Masur that goes on and on with a city populated with background extras and horse-drawn vehicles in the background in constant motion to provide a minimum of expository information . It is simply so exhausting. There is only one scene after another like this. It's like trying to eat a thirty-pound pizza. Then there are these long conversations of irrelevant details and incomprehensible and spiritless dialogues, which go on forever and are grueling and boring. <br /> <br /> Of course, every single scene taken seems genial. Altogether it is a rich piece to shoot articles worthy of praise. Seen in pieces with the possibility of rapidly advancing through boring bits or turning it off if you feel the mise-en-scene mounted, it is basically painless. But don't let anyone tell you it's a good movie. When I saw it in 1980 there was a guy sitting in front of me commenting on the scene in which Kris Kristofferson is riding and turns in one way and then in the other and does it about six times. "This is symbolic," he said, "he doesn't know which way to go." This is basically, at its core, the basis of every criticism of the Heaven's Gate program. <br /> <br /> Watch it, if you have to, but be forewarned, this is not a movie whose time has come, this is a stinker that will smell forever. <br /> <br /> HEAVEN'S GATE is historically inaccurate to the extreme. I recommend the book BANDITTI DELLE PIANURE by Asa Mercer on the Johnson County War.
