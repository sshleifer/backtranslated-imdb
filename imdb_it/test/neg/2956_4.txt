Anna Christie (Greta Garbo) returns to see her father Chris (George F Marion) after 15 years. He is the commander of a boat and she remains to travel with him. During this time, he meets Matt (Charles Bickford) and they fall in love. Matt and Chris don't see each other and Anna has the secret to confess ..................... <br /> <br /> What a boring story ..... starts badly with George F Marion and Marie Dressler playing drunk in a bar. The scene goes on forever and they are both terrible. It is also difficult to understand them. In fact, it's difficult to understand the whole cast. I've lost whole sections of dialogue between Bickford, Marion and Garbo because it's incomprehensible! Garbo is obviously something special because you are attracted to her every time she is on the screen and her presence gives this film the 4 stars I gave her. But nothing happens - it's a boring story with atrocious accents. You will do well to stay awake.
