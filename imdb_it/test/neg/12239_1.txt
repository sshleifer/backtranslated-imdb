I'm sorry for me, you know why. I feel sorry for watching this movie. I went to the theater with some friends to watch this movie, and I still didn't give him the satisfaction of watching it in full (I left with about 20 minutes remaining ... hoping that god could make me at least comfortable for a moment.) Most movies now, even the bad ones ... when I watch them, there may be a small part in the movie where I feel a little joy sometimes because of maybe a bizarre joke or a good line ... this movie on the other hand made me feel uncomfortable and angry with myself all the time, especially since I wasted money on it. It was poorly written, misdirected, badly filmed, and decidedly mismanaged ... <br /> <br /> please, for humanity's sake, don't see this movie, even if your boyfriend wants to say he saw like every movie ever ... just don't ...
