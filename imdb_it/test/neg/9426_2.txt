This is a low-grade Cold War propaganda film crossed with soap. It could have a long term meaning as a snapshot of American thought in the 1950s, but there is not much else to praise in the mushy texture, wooden acting and grateful style. There are some interesting photos of aircraft for a long time, but it was not even enough for this fan of planes to leave it on the screen for its entire length.
