After Loomis made a quick summary of Michael Myers, let's go back to the 1989 flashback where Jamie is kidnapped by the man in black before the burning police station explodes. Michael returns to Haddonfeild once again to find Jamie and his baby. In this version the Loomis character gets more scenes and looks a lot more proactive than the final cut. The score is much better, more in line with parts 4 and 5, none of the BS electric guitar. And the ending makes a little more sense. For these reasons, combined with the fact that this cut has a greater characterization and suspense, and reduces the gore factor (Halloween, unlike the Franchise "Friday 13", has never been a shameless phenomenon) is the reason why I prefer this bootleg . . Not to mention that the cut magically turns into a gold rag, just polish the asshole a little and make it more understandable. The whole plot of the cult is still very stupid, as is Michael having a son. <br /> <br /> My Producer's Cut Grade: C- <br /> <br /> My Theatrical Cut Grade: D-
