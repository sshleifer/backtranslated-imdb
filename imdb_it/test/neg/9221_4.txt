This is a stupid movie with a lot of singing and dancing. Acting is average, but writing leaves something to be desired. There are memorable performances by Buddy Epsen, with a brief but exceptional performance by Gypsy Rose as the bitter wife of a rich playboy. An absolutely incredible portrait of college life that ends with a superb ice skating performance by Alice in Wonderland. Many parts deserve to be watched, but don't be afraid to go fast through parts of the film
