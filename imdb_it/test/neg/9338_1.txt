In short, this film was horrible. I understand it's a Disney movie, which are generally shallow films with mediocre plots and bad acting. HOWEVER, I have to say that this is the worst of all Disney movies, with bad acting, A LOT OF IRRITANT SHRIEKING TEEN GIRLS (my god), and an extremely unrealistic plot. Even at 12, there's no way I would have liked this movie. The only way this movie could have been worse is if they tried to put it in theaters or tried to sell it in a local video store. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and change channels before watching this, no matter how bored you are on a Sunday afternoon.
