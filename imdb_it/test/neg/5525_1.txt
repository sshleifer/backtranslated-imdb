This is so poor that it is watchable. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns a team of gray spaceships that is happening on a Russian ship adrift, apparently abandoned. <br /> <br /> In the empty vastness of space, the two craft collide accidentally (!) - and the fun 'Alieno' is unleashed like a cyborg from the Russian ships threatens our crew. <br /> <br /> The interiors of the spaceship are clearly a built-in factory (metal walkways, boilers, piping). In this absolutely unconvincing scenario, 'Kody', 'Snake' and the rest of our hero crew grimace, grunt, run and continuously and repeatedly fit their rifles without shooting. <br /> <br /> The gaffes of continuity are what you call this film, and are nothing short of amazing: <br /> <br /> Stuff appears and disappears. Pump shotguns are decanted. A cigar stretches out smoking. The shotguns are overwhelmed again, just to be sure. The content of a bottle increases to be drunk by. <br /> <br /> The film progresses through the usual clich√©s through intense acting of the ham, working with Poxy's camera and Ed Wood's props up to the height of showdown.
