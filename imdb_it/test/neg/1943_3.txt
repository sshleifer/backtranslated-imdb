In general, I would call this a disappointing performance. Try the old "Horror Anthology" approach, but fail miserably. The acting was bad, and so were the stories. Every skin shown in the film was obviously random, just to attract the R-rating for sex. Typical, I imagine, but still bad. Grab your $ 5 and rent a REAL movie!
