Although some would prefer to comment on the value of Bond films in the connection of learning frequency, and while most of the jargon that tends to limit Bond to a paltry following of 007 has been exploited beyond reasonable contention, there are several plausibility that one extend the credibility of Sean Connery in this dual role which saw his adaptation to the counterpart in a part of a previous performance of Jessica Tandy in Driving Miss Daisy. While Connery had been less visible in the latter, his qualities as a female researcher had perhaps not frowned at the bitter spectators as in this latest version which, for the most part, approached the 007 theme with a gentle resentment, too if the general taste had been altered. Great for those who care about others by pretending to be what you are not!
