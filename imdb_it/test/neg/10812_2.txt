Grab your video camera, turn off all the lights in your home and film the people who run flashlights for an hour and a half and have the basic idea of ​​what this film is like. It is very irritating to watch this type of film. To be honest, there are scenes of daylight at the beginning and end of the film. I like scary movies and the characteristics of creatures, but that didn't do anything for me. I'm sorry. I really tried to like it. There doesn't seem to be much of a plot beyond what we need to find to get out of here. I didn't learn too much about any of the characters, so it doesn't matter if we lost one or two along the way. This is not the worst movie in the world. "Open Water" holds the title for now.
