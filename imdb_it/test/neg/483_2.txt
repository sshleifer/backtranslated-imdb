"Dolemite" is the touching story of Dolemite (I must love the titles of film blaxploitation), a former prisoner who probably should still be in prison. He gets in trouble with cops, friends, drug dealers, women, prostitutes and society in general. He is not so nice. Nor is the film, although it is still exhilarating and worth watching. <br /> <br /> The weak premise is that Dolemite (played with the same enthusiasm as star Rudy Ray Moore) is in prison for a crime he claims to have committed. When a drug shot or a drug bust or drug is about to end, the director releases him to stop him or to help him or simply to watch him. Not very clear All I know is that I was not aware of the fact that the judiciary frees detainees to allow them to prove their innocence. My ignorance, I imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot is twisted and unimportant, in practice Dolemite goes around killing people (usually with very little choreographed karate), having sex and cursing people, sometimes even rhyming. The joys of the film are its total incompetence and its total indifference on the subject. <br /> <br /> I stopped counting the number of times I saw the boom microphone after it was in a scene for the entire duration (about two minutes of film). I stopped wondering why the watchman was looking down where the Dolemite was, even after getting up and walking around, when they stopped the shot and Dolemite was inexplicably seated again. I stopped wondering why Dolemite dressed like that when she went naked in the street to change, because she didn't want to get into the car with ugly clothes (read: normal) that the prison gave him. And I stopped wondering where he learned karate when he makes his hand vibrate on a boy's stomach and somehow opens it up. The only time I was remote and nervous was when the disgusting and flabby white mayor walked completely naked with nothing but a towel hanging from his neck that barely covered him. You keep saying "Cut away ... cut away ... cut away" but the moment they do it, you're already emotionally scarred. <br /> <br /> The film is ridiculous in every way imaginable. Moore as Dolemite, it's fun, fun, or both. If you are looking for a bad movie, you found it with "Dolemite".
