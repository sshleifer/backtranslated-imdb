Maybe it's just the format of this film, a documentary, but I think the film would have been much better served by good actors and a more solid dialogue. The fact that the actors are also business owners is a double-edged sword. They know better than anyone the emotions and the complexities of the business in which they find themselves, but, since they are not professional actors, they do a very poor job in transmitting those emotions and the documentary suffers. There were some really memorable scenes in this film and lots of good jokes but they were delivered so badly that they will fade over time and the only memory I will have of this documentary is that it has had some beautiful scenes that I don't remember. <br /> <br /> See this if you want to have a first-hand account on .com and see what happened to 99% of people in the industry who didn't become instant millionaires. However, be ready for some nauseating, poor acting, mediocre dialogues and a bad movie that sums up the era of the Internet boom.
