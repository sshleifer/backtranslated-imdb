I'm surprised the comparison hasn't yet been made between Mind of Mencia and the television program The Awful Truth, which was published a few years ago. Guided by the controversial director Michael Moore, the show would begin, in exactly the same manor as this show, with Moore interacting with the audience and introducing segments, especially short films and skits, which had been put together in an attempt to provoke thoughts about current problems . The difference? Mencia rarely surpasses the superficial and the reactionary. What he says and does is often absurd and rude, and insults his audience's ability to make decisions for themselves. There is a difference between being "angular", with which I have no problem, but Mencia tries too hard to do so, and ends up becoming arrogant and with little support. However, he makes points occasionally, but often to get to them, he must go through a rather numb attempted shock humor.
