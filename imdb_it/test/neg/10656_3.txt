The plot of a man's love for an innocent child who finds with a malformed face and on the other side of the world a superficial selfish "valley girl" who shares a birth date with her and ends up making a big difference in both of them lives. What a fantastic and worthy plot. But in this story, writing and / or directing and / or editing the screen is so poor that it takes away the joy from the story. The character of Linda Hamilton goes from the understanding of the mother to the evil witch and faster return of a throttle bullet, and for what purpose? Conflict, conflict, conflict, at the drop of a hat. Katie (The California Girl) and her boyfriend, Katie's mom and everyone, including the poor lady at the airport check-in desk, Lin's foster father, who is the kindest and most caring man alive, and his wife and his biological son, all in constant conflict. I really wanted to enjoy a moving story, but the only thing that SMILE did to me was when all the hatred and struggle was over. There have been too many inexplicable or illogical events, many of which are not added to the story. My wife and I kept looking at each other and wondering how such a good cast and what a great story should be, could be kicked so badly.
