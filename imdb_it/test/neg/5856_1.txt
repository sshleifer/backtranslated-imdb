This film is little more than a Verhoeven surrogate. The shots should be tele-realistic, but they are simply disgusting. The parody disappears after about 15 minutes to be replaced by a story that seems to take itself seriously. Brechtian pauses for non-existent advertising brakes are boring and even painful; undoubtedly there was no intention of making this Brechtian movie, it was just an accident that happened that way. If you want to see a reality parody, look at Celebrity DeathMatch: it's more fun and witty and, above all, shorter. I have rarely felt so much pain while watching a movie. To be avoided like a rabid rabbit.
