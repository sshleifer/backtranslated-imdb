When this show started it was quite interesting: we saw what the crab fisherman had to catch during the crab-catching season. Shortly thereafter, however, he lost focus on fishing and concentrated almost entirely on the drama in the fisherman's life. The episodes have become nothing but "the captain does not like the new greenhorn" (this happens too often), "someone is hurt or sick", "a fisherman makes word of some problem at home and is frustrated that it is stuck on a boat, "repeat. I don't know how people can find the new seasons that can be seen, since each episode seems to be essentially the same as the previous and subsequent ones. This show should be moved to a different channel and renamed" Crab Boat Drama or, even better, would have made a perfect segment of a time in Dirtiest Jobs. <br /> <br /> Should the Discovery Channel not have learned its lesson after American Choppers?
