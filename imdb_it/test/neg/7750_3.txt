Even in the glasses that wear the geek mode Kathy Ireland is very easy on the eyes but her acting is not easy to look at. Most of the film's actors go up (apart from "campy fun") or behave slightly embarrassed to be there. The effects and the soundtrack are nothing special and a fairly low budget. The plot plot REALLY extends the ability to suspend disbelief. Take this for a laugh if it arrives on a channel of a premium movie or on a TV network on Saturday afternoon, but DO NOT make money with this thing. <br /> <br /> A noteworthy mention is that one of the underground mobsters is played by Deep Roy. Deep is now famous for playing (and doing it well) all the Oompa Loompas of Burton's "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory".
