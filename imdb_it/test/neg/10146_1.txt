In my opinion of this film, the whole video part of this film was absolutely trash !!!! However, the soundtrack used contained the music of a large heavy metal rock band, I recognized the music as a band called Firstryke and the album was "Just a Nightmare" and it was written very well !! and I'm curious to see what other movie fans think about it out there, if I can remember until then I'd appreciate the feedback, pick up old movies and obscure the film's audio tracks. It is a hobby that takes a long time, but it is very rewarding. I saw this band music sold in Germany on the net for about fifty dollars per album. Not bad for Hugh?
