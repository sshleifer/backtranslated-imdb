I'm completely into this kind of storyline, but once the movie turned on, I honestly said out loud, "I just rented a two-dollar Christian POS." The only thing I could find about this film is that it has a descent history but it was terribly performed. Horrible actors, horrible direction and production. <br /> <br /> The director and producer must go and see the cube before trying to make a film in a single room. There was absolutely nothing that fascinated you so much that you didn't realize you were in the same room as the whole movie. Horrible! The two main actresses were very easy on the eye and you could tell that he was the director who mattered to get your attention. But these two and their bios can talk about this, they are horrible in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this. Unless you're blind, because some stars could come up if you only listen to it.
