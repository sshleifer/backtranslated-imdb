Oh, where the hell am I supposed to start? Do you make a brief summary of the story? No. Either you've already heard it, or you don't want it. Anyway, it sucks. Much like the movie. I happen to be a fan of semi-big horror movies, and I have to say that this is one of the most stupid and clumsy movies I've ever had the displeasure of seeing. <br /> <br /> The script is terribly stupid. The story starts too fast without absolutely no suspense or accumulation in the slightest. All those torture scenes would have been MUCH more effective if we had even given the characters some shit. Since the first scene of the film is when teenage girls meet Capt. Howdy, how the hell should we sympathize with them? First of all, they look stupid for going to a party with a guy they don't even know, and secondly, we don't even know their damn names! Why the hell should I worry if they live or die? Not to mention the fact that they really have the courage to try to make us feel in solidarity with Capt. What happened after being "reformed"? PLEASE! I was rooting when he got his deserts! He deserved them! Hell, he deserved worse! Furthermore, we are forced to sit through a useless, misdirected sequence directly from "The Silence of the Lambs" (and here is HORRIBLY! Of course it will give him a fake address! And even if he gave him the real one, you don't think he'll be waiting and not punching someone from Johnson upstairs? DELAYED!) <br /> <br /> Then there's dialogue. Everything that Captain Howdy says is ridiculous or just stupid. "The dead are so terribly dead when they died" ?? What the hell is shit ?! Dee Snider at one point says "knowledge is power". Well, if it's true, this movie has absolutely no power. <br /> <br /> So, there are the holes in the plot. Yes, I know it's a horror movie (well, ambiguous horror movie), but damn it! You could drive a semi truck in these holes! First of all, these must be the DUMBEST cops I've ever seen! NEVER!! I mean, DEAR GOD, these guys are idiots! Call for backup, idiots! Second, how the hell does that huge septum ring fall from Captain Howdy's nose ?! Obviously this expert piercing says "it's the greatest I've ever seen", but if it's so damn big, how on earth could it fall so easily? Did Captain Howdy just leave the crime scene because he wanted to be discovered? They certainly didn't look like him. Furthermore, they would never release Capt. Howdy, and I know it for a damn fact. He would be in prison for the rest of his life, and there's no way around that. Much less did he return to his old home where he killed / tortured everyone. IMPOSSIBLE AND IMPLAUABLE. <br /> <br /> And now the acting. Dear God, these people sucked. Linda Cardellini is the only good thing in this film. It's poised and surprising. Too bad he will hardly have a good chance of acting in this piece of shit. Amy Smart shows up for about 10 minutes and therefore no longer exists. Even the usual Robert Englund is underutilized and ineffective here. Dee Snider plays the crazy without talent. I never felt threatened, scared or intimidated. I would have preferred to see Dee Snider as Alexis Arquette in "Bride of Chucky". It would have been much more fun to see this talent without talent get it from that lovely psycho doll. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider simply sucks. He can't act (one of the least scary villains I've ever seen), can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?), And he's obviously dumber than Jessica Simpson! This film is just a way for Dee Snider to show all the strange shit he knows about self-mutilation and modern primitives and blah blah blah. Either it has been done before or it just doesn't need to be done. I was bored for all that damn thing. <br /> <br /> The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the rhythm sucks, the special FX sucks, the director sucks ... after all, this movie sucks. This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller / horror film and fails miserably. He cannot frighten, shock or disturb in any form, manner or form. This is probably one of the least effective and absolutely non-original films I've ever seen in my life. A piece of cinematic junk captured on celluloid. <br /> <br /> "Strangeland" gets 0 out of 10. Avoid at all costs. It is not as pleasant as possible.
