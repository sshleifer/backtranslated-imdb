this show is simply horrible. I liked watching Drake and Josh, which was great, and before that, the Amanda show, even fun, but that's simply CHALLENGING. I think watching this seemed like watching those Seltzberg films, painful and unscrupulous. this is about 3 stupid children @ $$ who make a crappy show on the web (while stealing the Ithing hole) while their late brother is doing sculptures (he has no life). the cast is shit, Megan from drake and josh is carly (AHHHHHH!) an ugly b! tch is sam and a kid who pulled out of the street plays fred. all I saw from this (ugg) are random "jokes" that include the brother making a clay film, he also played an arcade game called PAC-rat (genious), Sam and Carly are delayed in their web show , and Fred being a jerk. the only episode of a saw (I don't remember the title) where Fred gets bad luck by not anticipating an email. I find the videos on YouTube more fun than this junk. and why the hell they get youtube jack @ $$ fred, makes sure that AVGN cancels the show with its potty mouth. just skip this show.
