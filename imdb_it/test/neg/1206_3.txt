Don't worry about checking the logic. There is nobody. But on the other hand, there are MANY really cool movies that are totally lacking in logic, so why worry? <br /> <br /> I like and don't like this movie. I like it because the action sequences in the air are really great, you can see many dog ​​fights. I also like the F-16, which is a very nice aircraft. <br /> <br /> But there are too many goofs to really entertain me. I guess it's not fair to want some sort of continuity, since it's really hard to make a really good fighting film - but I also think there should be a sense of reason. <br /> <br /> And I have a question: do they fly from California to the Middle East in F-16 without refueling? I'd like to see it happen.
