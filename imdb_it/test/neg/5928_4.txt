Sometimes I think that somewhere in the office complex of the "Lifetime" channel there is a room where the writer's meeting, with a big wheel on the wall - a kind of Big Six in the casinos. The latter have many points where you win even money, and less for higher amounts, until there are perhaps a couple that pays higher amounts. <br /> <br /> But I imagine that the channel wheel has about six different genres on its wheel, with two of them, it appears more, labeled "The Psychotic Neighbor", or "The Spect with a Hidden Past or Secret or Both. " "Lifetime" films have some repetitive narrative lines, and these two seem to be the most ubiquitous. <br /> <br /> The "Spouse ..." category may have a longtime wife, but some people appear, or an event occurs, exposing that once the good wife was a prostitute, one of the couples was involved in a nefarious act long before, or that something else in a different background than the presumed one ... etc. etc. or, as in this film, one of them entered the marriage for the most nefarious purposes. <br /> <br /> A constant, in all its genres, is that the husband or other males are usually incapable, vacuous, and slow to have no idea what the hell is going up to the climax or, at best cases, very late in the proceedings (unless the male is the unbeliever). This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> If the referenced disbeliever could be the "neighbor" or as in this offer, "the wife", it is always fascinating how easily, successfully and effortlessly they proceed with their cowardly actions. They manipulate many of the others, hit them as needed, take various poses and juggle more deceptions than you can count - with an infallible success until just before the end. <br /> <br /> The main actor here, as many in the films of this channel are longstanding. I noticed that another movie in which he starred was "The Perfect Neighbor". <br /> <br /> Finally, the vengeful "perfect wife" in this video distinguishes those who are on its way with more experience and ease than the more experienced and the competent "button man" of the Don Corleone family could gather . And I couldn't help but imagine that Jack Nocholson's character of Melvin Udall for "As Good As It Gets", with its massive OCD affliction, could provide anti-heroin advice to help manage the obsession that was the basis of this opus.
