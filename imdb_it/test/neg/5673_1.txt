Look, I've pretty much lost all hope in Nickelodeon after seeing their latest hit, the show The Naked Brothers Band, and "ICarly" is no exception! If you haven't noticed, ICarly is now the number 1 hit sitcom on television right now! After hearing it, I decided to watch some episodes to see what it was! I have a word to describe this show in general ... "EFFICLESS !!!" I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT DAN SCHNEIDER WOULD BE THIS LOW AND MAKE SOMETHING OF THIS CRAPPY !!! IT'S HORRIBLE!!! Let me give you the details ... <br /> <br /> The cast of ICarly starts with a girl named Carly Shay, played by Miranda Cosgrove! Carly, unfortunately during the episodes, doesn't really have a personality so to speak! I guess she should be the average girl on the show! (Because MANY people have an army veteran for a dad, an artist for a brother and a popular web show for teenagers registered and produced with thousands of dollars worth of equipment!) !!! She looks like a 3-year-old girl with Tourette's syndrome in half an hour of sugar! <br /> <br /> Next, we have Sam Puckett (good god where they get these names!?) played by Jennette McCurdy! Sam is the "CO-HOST" of Carly's web show! (Wait a minute, if Sam hosts the show with Carly, shouldn't the show be called "ICarly and Sam?" I bet Sam feels like he's been robbed!) Sam should be the bully in the cast! (Yes, because EVERY bully girl wears tight shirts and trousers with blonde hair extensions!) She, too, I think, should also be a Tomboy. I would find it a bit strange, but it is his Cliché PUNS THAT THE ROMAN !!! The play on words "Give me a bucket of fried chicken" is abused. TOO MUCH !!! GIVE THIS GIRL TO SCRIPT !!!! and GIVE A COFFEE because, don't get me wrong, Jennette's acting is fine, but, for half of the episodes, it looks like she's ready to fall asleep !!! <br /> <br /> Next we have Freddie Benson, played by Nathan Kress. Freddie is the technical producer for the Carly and Sam show! There's not much to say about Freddie besides being a techno fanatic and having a crush on Carly, which never works! HERE WE GO AGAIN WITH THE Clichés !!! DO NOT STOP !!! Even Nathan's acting is fine, but sometimes it seems excessive! It's too boring !!! <br /> <br /> Finally, and my favorite, we have Spencer Shay, played by Jerry Trainor! Allow me to clarify it perfectly; IF IT WAS NOT FOR HIM, THIS SHOW FILTER OF A SHOW WOULD BE MUD !!! Spencer is the one who keeps the show alive! Spencer is Carly's older brother! If you had a 5-year-old who was at most caffeine and constipated, you would have summarized this character! Spencer also earns money to be an artist! (Hmmm ... I wonder ...). You would think that a professional artist would make promising sculptures ... yes, I love sarcasm! ITS ART IS VERY PRETTY USER CRAP !!!! I mean, what kind of sculpture name is "MERRY SNIFFMUS !!?" WHAT!!? THIS IS VERY CREATIVITY AS A CLINTON HILLARY SPEECH ON DRUGS !!!! IT'S STUPID !!!! <br /> <br /> PLANT SETTINGS AND MORALS ARE EFFICIENT POOP BAGS !!!! These shows are now telling children that stealing, lying, and asshole your parents is a GOOD THING !!! IF THESE ARE THE TYPES OF FANTASTIC SHOWS SHOW THAT THESE DAYS ARE LAUNCHING TO CHILDREN, THEN I DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN LOOKING FOR ANY OF THEM !!!! THIS IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF CRAP I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WATCHED ON TV! BAR NONE !!! NICKELODEON, "I AM THROUGH YOU !!!!" END OF THE STORY!!!! 1/10
