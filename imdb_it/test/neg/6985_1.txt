First of all, the initial concept of a fortune lost in gold bars discovered in a New Zealand lake, inside a demolished WWII airplane, is a great opening. What follows is nothing but cartoon like drivel. Men chasing men, cars chasing men, helicopters chasing men, helicopters chasing boats, boats chasing boats, for most of an hour, the most boring nonsense, with no progress in history. A special mention must be made of the assembly of the cutting shop, since many scenes seem to have been joined together in random order. The acting of all concerned is embarrassing. One last thing, the image quality and the sound quality are so bad on this DVD that you will be stunned. - MERK
