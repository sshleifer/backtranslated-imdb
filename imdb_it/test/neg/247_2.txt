Ah, a title so original for a very poor movie. Dubbing is exhilarating as the voices and mouths never seem to match. As a result, I had no idea what was going on while watching this mess. There are flashbacks inside the flashbacks and no real time happens until the end. The Aztec ceremony made me laugh. I rewound it twice and got the best ab workout ever. The Aztec lady who sings is comical and natural and the dances and costumes are a hoot. Some guys have a face full of acid, there's a lot of fighting, you have no idea who a character is (not that I really care), and it's all a noir casino. Oh, and the real fight doesn't happen for a while, so during the movie feel free to get up, take a nap, take a trip. You will not miss anything exciting.
