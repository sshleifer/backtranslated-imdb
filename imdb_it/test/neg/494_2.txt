I don't know any idiotic rock'n'roll clich√©s used in this film. Ouffcourz, rock enrolls life is just sexual drugs and parties and tons of supermodels try to ride with you. Tell the stupid boys. The filmmakers seemed to have read too many stories of Guns'n'Roses or Motley Crue. I've seen the daily life of the usual rock band up close and there's nothing to do with reality in this movie. If you are successful enough your life is in touring touring. It means you're mainly in a bus and you're trying to sleep. Just sleep. Because you have to be fresh, sober and clean in the evenings. After life you have some time to download the excitement of the stage. Then you have some time to have fun. But it is not a luxury or a dream. Artistically this film was zero. Stupid characters and idiotic dialogues. The film's ending was fun - the main character left the heavy metal band and formed a grunge band! Yes, what a moral. Real 90s.
