This Fulci schlocker of the last days is a totally abyssal concoction that deals with an incurable player (Brett Halsey) who decides Blackbeard's style to pay his ever-increasing debts, seducing some of the ugliest bitches you can ever set eyes on of you and that only happen to be wealthy widows! The screenplay written by Fulci also makes it possible to incorporate some blackly comedic elements, which translate only into non-fun activities that involve a corpse that will not remain, an opera singer who will not stop singing, etc. doppelganger theme directly from THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE - even if, in this case, the two characters communicate via pre-recorded radio messages !! In the end, I cannot say that I am surprised that this film shows no sign of the refinement of Mario Bava's HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON (1970) which resembles in many ways and is content to pile up only disgustingly (but unconvincingly) effects of dismembered limbs and crushed or loose faces with which, alas, the Fulci had by now become completely associated.
