I honestly don't know where to start when I see a pathetic movie like Ernest Goes to Africa. Apart from two or three good laughs scattered throughout the film, there is nothing positive about this waste of time and life of an hour and a half. It is incredible that someone has been able to gather a group of people willing to act, film and edit this piece of junk, and even more incredible that this is the eighth installment of the Ernest series. <br /> <br /> During the opening credits of the film, we see Ernest posing next to various African objects, such as wooden masks and African animal heads, making faces and gestures that would probably make most children laugh third year. This opening scene gives the viewer a taste of Ernest's frequent attempts at humor, and demonstrates how his comedy falls roughly 95% of the time. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me about this film is how bad it is to act. Everyone in the film is a typical C-movie actor, but Linda Kash stands out as particularly terrible. She is the epitome of exaggerating; all his jokes are accompanied by a shocking inhuman enthusiasm that you could only find in a school play. Most high school theater students would probably have been able to replace these actors and offer a more powerful performance. Jim Varney shows at least some comic skills from time to time, but for most of the movie he acts like a complete retard, trying to be humorous by making silly faces and talking to different voices. <br /> <br /> Ernest Goes to Africa begins in Africa, where an archaeologist has stolen two priceless gems from an African tribe. The gems then return to the United States, where an unidentified man is seen running by several henchmen through a flea market. He hides them in a "two for a dollar" bucket and then escapes from the scene. Ernest is looking for a gift to buy for Rene, a maid he likes, so he goes to the flea market and obviously buys the priceless gems. Later he takes them back to his house, paints them and glues them to make a yo-yo. He gives Ren√© the yo-yo and she explains that they can never be together because he is just a mediocre shmoe, and she wants a man of adventure. Rene and Ernest are tracked down by the henchmen and then taken to Africa to be held captive. <br /> <br /> Most of the film doesn't make much sense. Once Ernest is in Africa, he falls from the truck that are bringing him in and lands in a river. In the next scene, we see him as a Hindu servant named "Hey You". His skin is dark and he wears a flap. At first, I thought Jim Varney would play another role in the film besides Ernest, but I immediately recognized Ernest's idiocy after Hey You started talking. <br /> <br /> Another scene that stands out in my mind as completely ridiculous is the car chase scene in the African wilderness. Rene and Ernest have taken an ostrich truck and are chased by the henchmen. Driving about twenty miles an hour on a fairly straight road, both minions shoot Ernest, who is at the rear of the ostrich farmer's truck. Ernest, on the other hand, is throwing ostrich eggs at the henchmen and their driver. The henchmen never hit Ernest once during the five-minute chase, but Ernest is able to repel them by hitting them and their driver in the face, making their car disappear from the road and exploding into a giant column of smoke. I must also add that Ernest is stuffing the eggs, two at a time, from a large bra. <br /> <br /> The set design is also incredibly poor in this film. There is a large part of the film in which Rene and Ernest are walking in Africa, trying to find civilization. During their excursion, we see them walking through fields and jungles, which probably could have been filmed anywhere in the United States. The fields are simply grassy fields, with no indication of being near Africa (they may have at least digitally added some African trees in the background), and the forests look like the forests of rural Connecticut with papier-mache skulls, vines, and thorns hanging from the trees. According to IMDb.com, the film was shot in South Africa, but I don't believe it at all. <br /> <br /> The film goes on forever, Ernest jokes after Ernest's joke. The rest of the film also makes no sense; members of the African tribe speak English for some reason, and later Ernest is challenged in a "Battle of Truth" by the henchman, who suddenly dresses in a dress that resembles that of a ninja, but somehow resembles that of a submissive slavery. The henchman has in front of him a table of axes, swords, knives and clubs, while Ernest has a table with a sandwich, a teddy bear and some other worthless object. However, Ernest wins the battle and somehow ends up saving the day. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is painful to watch. I could not handle it in a single session; I had to stop halfway and do something productive for a few hours to make up for the brain cells I lost while trying to appreciate Varney's humor. They should really put a surgeon's general warning on the box to let people know that they will actually be slightly more retarded at the end of the movie. I should say that, of all the films I have ever seen, no one comes close to being as pitiful as Ernest Goes in Africa.
