The opening was stolen from "Eight-legged Freaks", a film that is all that is not. Stilted and pedestrian are the words that apply - along with others that can't be repeated ..! The Drifter type returns to his home (?), Meet old friends etc .... the usual annoying child, single mother, local megaphone and so on ... funny special effects, alien ship, atmospheric disturbances, (hey, didn il director sees "Close Encounters"?). Good acting? Nice story? Good shooting angles? Good cut? Not here! Do not rent unless you share the cost and have plenty of beer at hand. Don't watch TV, go drink lots of beer - you'll have more fun!
