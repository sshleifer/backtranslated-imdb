Yes, I really found this movie disgusting. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the character of Sandra Oh, it really annoyed me. It is unlikely to be accepted in Italian rural life due to the fact that it is not white. this was a bit of a PC nonsense. <br /> <br /> the film is also offensive to Italian men. For example, the man she (Diane Lane) has an affair turns out to be a caddish cheat. But guess what: in the end your typical American brick head turns, all smiling and tanned, and finally finds what it has always wanted: a real American man, and now it has colonized another part of the world. <br /> <br /> Actually, this film is rather racist in its representation of the Italians and in the way it subjugates them both as a gaudy lotus or as backward peasants. <br /> <br /> the photography was good but the film and its attitude were garbage.
