I didn't know what to expect when I started watching this movie, in the end I was tearing my hair out. This was one of the most pathetic films of this year ... in fact, in the last ten years. David Dhawan should just give up his career as a director. I have yet to find an original script that David Dhawan worked on. This was a bit complete by Hitch. I have nothing against remakes as such, but this is just so lousy that it even makes you hate the original one (which was pretty decent). I can't understand what actors like Salman and Govinda have seen in this script. I read somewhere, that this was to be Govinda's return vehicle. If this is true, then only God can save his career. Salman has just gone too far. Govinda, who I think is an actor of the highest level, has been completely wasted. Katrina Kaif and LAra Dutta had nothing to do except wear designer clothes and smile for no reason or reason. Please stay away from this!
