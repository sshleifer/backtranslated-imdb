If a film has an unimagined story, trite and bland, it needs to be remedied to be really, really fun. You can get away with it if you're funny. But while there are some fun moments scattered here and there in Grandma's Boy, they are so far and few among them that they can't begin to make up for the hacking work that the film shows in such great abundance. <br /> <br /> the film certainly does not aim to surprise anyone. When Alex hides the marijuana in his grandmother's house in a tea box, you know what will happen later and he does. The film appears to have been written by a committee that made a mediocre comedy studio and grabbed any gags that appeared in more than one of them. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the film is its somewhat unusual setting. The game takes place in a video game development company, which should be an interesting source for an intelligent comedy. But don't be fooled, this is not a video game developer movie. This is basically a university film in which all the boys of the brotherhood have been pushed into a big room to play video games. <br /> <br /> The way the movie completely fails to think about its settings and use it for the originals Laughter can be seen in the JPJP character, I think it's more or less conspired by Doom creator John Carmack . At least inspired to the extent that it is a strange genius that creates games. <br /> <br /> In the film, J.P. is a bizarre and obnoxious geek who is scorned and scorned by the company's game games. It makes absolutely no sense. If you are one of the most significant people in the history of video games (as J.P. should be) then even if you are eccentric and unpleasant, people will continue to admire and respect you at a certain level. If Stephen Hawking is hateful, his colleagues will still not see him in the face. <br /> <br /> In addition, game testers are equally likely to be geeks like JP, but in the film they are basically frat boys. He's a normal and funny guy against the hateful Dweebs movie. And while that formula worked, very occasionally, in the past, it is absurd in the context of a gaming company. If you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie, it doesn't just cram all the movie conventions from different settings to that. Unless you're a hacker. <br /> <br /> I gave up about two thirds of the film. Something happened that I knew would cause a series of painfully predictable events. And I realized that I hadn't yet laughed at all in the last half hour. So I stopped (though I quickly stepped forward just to make sure they followed the most predictable cliches, which they did). <br /> <br /> Normally if a film is ugly I just say that it is bad and then running out of things to say, but this film is such an extraordinarily poor production that it deserves a long diatribe. <br /> <br /> Too bad for the film that attracts a good actress like Linda Cardellini, then surrounds her with Nobili without talent. I will give the film 1 point to give Shirley Jones the chance to be anti-Shirley Partridge.
