Bank Heist / Cop thriller sounds OK right? <br /> <br /> Chaos looks good: well framed, good production values, high action robbery action ... <br /> <br /> But ... <br /> <br / > The plot has the unique result of being both intelligent and incredibly, incredibly far-fetched in the "how we actually got the money" mode and excessively complicated in the "who did it and why" section at the same time ... <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Ryan Philippe is not screaming, it is NOT seriously or scary ... and above all it is not hard or scary when you launch a dizzying attack. Honestly, his big explosion is the only really fun scene in the whole movie. He must be thrilled that he turned down the role of Anakin Skywalker and now he is doing it ... <br /> <br /> Stratham is normally as good as the hard but quiet hard with self-deprecating humor, but here, the extra lines of relationship are so ridiculously bad that he also seems uncomfortable to say that some of the cliched require mush. The quieter the better? <br /> <br /> Snipes is actually OK in a typecast way, but another nail in a gifted actor's coffin: it needs the role of an actor not a rehash of the action hero. Perhaps the business with his taxes will allow him to break this mold and the public and the critics will allow him the vote of sympathy. It would be nice if it wasn't so typified all the time. <br /> <br /> The lines that these guys talk about when they are not doing the development of the plot and the detective's work can be summarized in a word ... .pheeeuuuh. <br /> <br /> The film looks completely out of fashion and never gels: I found it irritating for the first 45 minutes, and the narrower end was passable. It should / could have been good but it cannot redeem the terrible lines, the overwhelming score and the general level of irritation with plausibility levels. <br /> <br /> Overall, I almost didn't make it: incredibly irritating, and Ryan .... please, please, please, get rid of the gold curls ...
