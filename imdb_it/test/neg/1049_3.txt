The kite runner started as one of those "important" films that most people pretend because they are told they should be if they want to be among the elites and quickly descend into an idiotic movie of absurdly extravagant proportions. <br /> <br /> I've never read the book, and I've never felt the need because I honestly don't care. Of course, I feel uninformed for saying it, but in reality I have no interest in another "pulling the strings of the heart, copying all the other stories to get emotions from the readers' novel", even if it's set in Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> That said, I saw the movie. I heard beautiful things about her beauty, and how touching and decisive she was why not? Apparently, there was a good reason why not. Not only was the so-called main character completely unpopular (I understand, he was young and this is a film about redemption, but honestly it was horrible. I hated him and not in that "anti-hero" way, it was just a boring, idiotic, self- absorbed that I felt nothing towards) but the rest of the story was so completely absurd that I could not believe how all the others were flattering themselves about how beautiful it was, and how they cried and moved them. I'm sorry, but I just feel moved by something that seems realistic, Sci-Fi has been known to move me, even fantasy ... but this? Please. This has surpassed many other films out of pure absurdity! My biggest annoyance, Hassan was Amir's brother ... really? Are you sure you didn't tear it from a thousand other stories? Positive that that particular tidbit was not only added to try to snatch more tears from your audience (do you know the kind of people looking for reasons to cry during a movie)? I was rolling my eyes when that "twist" was revealed knowing he could only get out of there (not to mention the return to Star Wars "Amir, Hassan is your brother" "NOOOOOO, that's not true, it's IMPOSSIBLE!") Oh, and he certainly did. Full of clich√©s and silent storytelling plan. How "the good guy miraculously escapes the bad guy against all expectations with the help of a spunky boy who, despite being fiercely sodomized and having no idea who you are, is willing to help with a suitably positioned weapon that has a special meaning for you ". Ooh and don't forget the oh so idiotic "who finally takes revenge on the kid who made fun of you when you were little that, surprise surprise, turned into a psychopathic adult" (believe me guys, I understand that you like to live indirectly through the movies but this will never happen: you know that guy who made fun of you in high school ... he's not a terrorist, he's probably an accountant.) Oh, and I have to mention the CGI-tastic kites! I think those were on par with the "Matrix" and "Transformers" movies, good guys! GOOD BOY! <br /> <br /> It seems that this film was made for the western public that needs a reason to worry about the Middle East (and that an excessively emotional friendship story will work!) This is one of the more superficial films Ho had the misfortune to see, it rests so well ... but when you arrive right away, it's nothing special. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the heart of the American public will do what they "was said and followed" It is a controversial material, so it must be good! "way of thinking.
