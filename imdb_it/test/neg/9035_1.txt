I just finished watching this movie while playing on TV and I had nothing else to do. I also went here to IMDb too look at the trivia page and it happened to take a look at user comments. And what do I find? Every stupid idiot raises this movie in the sky! I wouldn't even write anything, but when no one else takes the time to spread the word about this ass-sucking movie I thought I could. <br /> <br /> The acting sucked by almost everyone in the cast. The worst was the guy who played Brian Wilson (I think I understood the right name) because he was shaking, especially when he was tall. The rest wasn't as bad as he was, but nobody was good either. I'm not an expert on beach boys, so I can't really complain about the story ... except for how much it was sucked. No motivation for character decisions most of the time, but hey, maybe they were idiots in real life. And what I found worse was that I thought it would be a beach boy movie, but in reality you only considered some of the characters. I hate when they do it in movies, the same thing in the doors, even if I like that movie better. You have no more energy to write more ... he sucked! don't buy it or watch it!
