For what it's worth, this is a pretty decent Road Runner cartoon, if a little short (just under 6 minutes). The gags are at most adequate, the animation is competent and the new restored DVD master looks nice. However, this is where the qualities end. Let me give you a little background: in 1958, thanks to a labor dispute, WB got a bunch of canned music that would have been used in 6-year-old cartoons. <br /> <br /> There is only one sentence to describe the music of this short film, and that is "it has the 4Kids sound". I use this phrase to describe music that has absolutely no correspondence with the action on the screen and it seems to have been recorded by an orchestra composed of members of a Sonic Youth cover band. The music in this short seems to be hopelessly attacked and incredibly nasty, especially considering that there are scenes in this short (ie the piano trap) that would have worked better with little or no music. <br /> <br /> I didn't think that a WB cartoon would be ruined by a horrible music (even Lava scores are not so nasty), but considering that the comic is not so remarkable anyway, it becomes almost painful watch it with music. It's a bit like the 80's episodes of Doctor Who that could still be bad, and yet be rendered unwatchable thanks to the incredibly horrible music of Keff McCulloch (which sounded like he pressed the demo button on all 5 of his keyboards at the same time Casio). <br /> <br /> I will make people call me crazy about this, but I would easily watch one of the Larriva cartoons on this one. At least the canned music was usually in tune with the action on those.
