You know this movie is SERIOUSLY in trouble when the best acting job is the supporting role played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. While this was still relatively early in his career and was not the best actor, compared to Brigitte Nielsen, it is Sir John Gielgud. In fact, this film shows that the only reason she has been very careful is her boobs and why she was involved with the incredibly self-destructive footballer, Mark Gastineau. So instead of being his "breaking film", this is a Beverly Hills Cop movie that marks the height of his career by a note. It was also obvious that the funding wizards also gave up on this film, because the supporting cast (apart from Arnold) is rather lame and the script is boring, boring, boring. Fans looking for another CONAN movie would undoubtedly be very disappointed in this slow and non-addictive movie.
