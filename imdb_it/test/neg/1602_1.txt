I thought the sleeping cell was interesting and exciting to watch until the last episode, when nothing happens, its F ****** BS, you Americans portray Muslims as terrorists and Americans as heroes, it's the other way around, I hate it when all the American TV shows end up being predictable, I was hoping the bombs would explode in that stadium, but I knew it wouldn't happen, it takes away the joy of seeing it when you know the good guys are going to save the day, again once, the Americans are the greatest terrorists, he is the leader of all of them, he is to blame for 9/11, and I am P ***** out of continuing to launch these shows to us, who are all if ****** themselves! I have a good show about terrorism, it's called "The Whitehorse" and bush the same cell leader, it's the same with 24, how come 24 was good, the sleeper cell is a fake and should never do a season 2, its F * **** joke! and you American producers too.
