Sappy. <br /> <br /> I liked how they went to "Haaavaad baaa" to quote books to each other to impress the ugliest girl there. <br /> <br /> Probably the guardian of my school is also a genius, but he is waiting to land that big construction job. <br /> <br /> Just because you hold your nose on the millstone there's no reason to try cutting a steak with it. "Do you like apples?" <br /> <br /> the boy nods or something. <br /> <br /> "Well, like you did DEM APPLES!" Wow, this is genius. <br /> <br /> Duh, Minnie Driver would have given his number to anyone. Robin Williams can't paint and keeps the good books on the shelf higher. And there is a professor who always wears a priest's scarf for no reason.
