The only people I would recommend this film to are both blind and deaf, although I'm sure a sadomasochist would get a kick out of it. This film had nothing; no acting, terrible music, horrible screenplay - just the power to suck every happiness out of your soul. Perhaps you are wondering why or even how I managed to go through the entire hour and a half of pure madness, and it is honestly a difficult concept even for myself. First, I had to go back and forth while the movie progressed, finding it extremely difficult to get comfortable. Secondly, I only did it without biting my arm to have something to beat to death by phoning friends for moral support when the plot became particularly slow. The problem was that it became a source of pride for me to finish it after the thirty minutes of opening, and that was a fatal mistake for me. Normally I like movies to leave you something at the end, but all this has been done ... For the sake of your sanity don't watch this movie.
