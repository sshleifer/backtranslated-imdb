This is the worst set of toxins by far. The acting in Tokyo is horrible and you can understand them about half the time. The main problem with this film is all the sudden changes in the original. As if there was a different friend of addicts in this or could be the same character only with a different name and played by a different girl. Because this movie is made like a Disney movie. After about fifteen minutes it starts to feel good with blood and everything else. There are 2 terrifying killings so the movie goes straight to poop. After 20 minutes of film, the film is bear entertainment. H * LL IS BEARLY WATCHABLE. Well, unless your drunk is watching this movie. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
