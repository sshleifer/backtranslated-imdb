This is the only film that represents all that is bad in the world of cinema. The actors are pathetic and the script is horrible. The special effects, if any, are made so bad that it would have been better to do it with cartoons. Plus it's great! I think the creators of the film wanted to have humor, but the only time I was laughing was when I saw Patrick S. with long hair and colorful costumes that everyone had. The scenes at the end were good but they were not part of the film. In the end you will ask yourself "why did I waste time and money with that shit when I could see plants growing or moving clouds". I don't think I'm a critic or anything, but this is a really lame movie! DO NOT LOOK! DANGER OF OVERLOADING STUPIDITY!
