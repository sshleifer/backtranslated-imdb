I was excited about this movie after reading other reviews. What a disappointment! There are so many ways this movie is bad. Computer graphics were deficient to say the least. I found the acting rigid and incredible. Look at the sand as the lost "e-pods" (what an original name!) Have been found. Where do all the tracks come from? I immediately recognized parts similar to other films, such as Alien, Pitch Black. Come on, a big ship to transport a prisoner? And what is the prisoner? Talk, can you talk? I kept waiting for something to tie the pieces of the story together, but it never arrived. If this film was made on a low budget, show. The only part of the film I liked was when it finally ended. I don't want to say that I liked the ending, I didn't. I simply liked the fact that it was over. A trip to the dentist would have been more pleasant. In my opinion. don't waste your time with this.
