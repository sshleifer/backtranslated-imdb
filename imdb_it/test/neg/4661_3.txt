Dear readers, <br /> <br /> I found in my film studies that every time Michael Bay makes a film, people look at it and hate it, yet they still go to see it and that's about $ 100 million. Why? Because Michael Bay is one of the five best directors of all time. Standing next to Ridley Scott, Spielberg, Kubrick and Miyazaki, Michael Bay has established himself as the best Hollywood action / adventure director. This point is demonstrated with his most pessimistic film, Armageddon. A Texas-sized asteroid is heading towards the planet and the only way NASA can think of eliminating it is to have the asteroid land a team of men, drill down to its core, and drop a nuclear warhead to inside and detonates the asteroid. Only one person is qualified to do so: Bruce Willis. Willis plays Harry Stamper, a tempered grizzled oil drill who tries to keep together what's left of his family. His daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler), does not help this to have an affair with his best driller, AJ (Ben Affleck). Hired by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), the head of NASA, Stamper and his team of roughneck punters train to become astronauts and save the world. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is a two-part film. First there are the fun parts where we meet the band and the extravagance abounds. Then they enter the space and the whole comedy is sucked out of the window and is replaced by amazing special effects, fantastic music and great serious acting. Murphy's law becomes insane in the second part, which means that everything that can go wrong actually goes awry, increasing the film's tension to exceptional levels. <br /> <br /> With a cool cast and crew (Michael Bay as director, Jerry Bruckheimer and Gale Anne Hurd as producers, and JJ Abrams as one of the writers.), tons of special effects, great humor, fantastic music , in addition to an introduction by Mr. Ben-Hur himself, Charlton Heston, Armageddon digs great. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector, Matt Macleod <br /> <br /> Parental Warnings: This is not a children's movie. The F bomb is used a couple of times and many other bad words are used, plus there is a strip bar scene and the extremely intense second part may be too difficult for a child to handle.
