This film has some of the worst production and editing values ​​I've ever seen. There are several instances of actors who stop as they try to remember their lines, the actors walking in front of the talking actors, and a point where the film skips about seven frames. Not to mention the heroine who is shot in the chest, yet she starts to limp! Oh, and the secret passage that is well lit and outdoors. Terrible. <br /> <br /> The plot is non-existent, something to do with a primitive atomic bomb and go to the ends of the Earth and a sort of caveman war. Ator pulls out a hang glider at some point in the most stupid moment of the film. The dialogue is stupid, it contains gems like "It's all and nothing". and "I can feel it here." <br /> <br /> The film is a disaster, a confused and tasteless mess. Ator is a bland hero, the sword fights are absurd and the plot proceeds slowly. All in all, this is a film to be avoided.
