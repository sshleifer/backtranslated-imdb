What can I say after saying the summary of a row. Sandra does a credible job but with bad direction and the plot cannot save him. Too much pre-occupation with guns. How can the Hollywood types complain about the need for gun control in our society and spend so much time and footage focused on weapons? It's just worse than expected.
