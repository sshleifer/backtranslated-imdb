The worst thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film is pure junk. All things are bad in this movie. The direction, the script, the arts, the cinematography, the cast or whatever. <br /> <br /> Can I say more? <br /> <br /> The protagonist is a boy. He must be about 20 years old, but the actor who plays the role is 30, and he is a bad actor. <br /> <br /> The assembly tries to save it, but with that very bad material in the hands can not work miracles. <br /> <br /> As I said, the cast is poor, the text is poor, it doesn't help the actors. <br /> <br /> I learned to "not do" a movie.
