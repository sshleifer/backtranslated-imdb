I found the DVD in a store near my house and, since I am an addict of "horror movies and alien movies", I wondered how beautiful it was. He also had two awards mentions on the cover (I don't remember which festival he won), so I thought "Hey this could be good". So I bought it (for five euros) and I came to IMDb to check some reviews. Here, both people hit the movie to say it wasn't good, or people said the film was a wonderful feat in indie bla, bla. I then played the DVD, not thinking about any reviews I had read, with an open mind, and I didn't expect anything. <br /> <br /> Man ... I don't like being so critical, but the film was really bad ... OK, I'm going to give some hints about what I thought: <br /> <br /> 1 -Reception / dialogue: the acting was so confusing ... sometimes the actors did a decent job, but there were scenes where I just couldn't see any effort on their part! The dialogue was even worse ... I think it was probably the aspect that I didn't like most in the whole film. The talking between the characters seemed ... outside. Not just bad, but far from real events in the film. The monologues of the female character, even if well distributed, have become boring and annoying in a while ... But obviously the most ridiculous aspect was the ... "aliens" or "infected" ... I don't even have comments on that, will simply say that it was absolutely ridiculous and took the whole mood away from the photo; 2-Visuals: the strongest aspect of the movie ... if you forget the horrible FX and the flashes of light they used to simulate explosions or what the hell they were supposed to be. The appearance of the "camera in the car" was quite interesting, but they didn't even use the environment to inspire fear or terror. They left this to cheap sounds and video FX and to the three "infected" characters. The film gets boring in so many scenes ...; 3-Sound: talking about editing ... this film has no problem showing how weakly it was modified. From the sounds of computers that imitate forest animals to "alien dialogue" ... ah ... <br /> <br /> So what I liked about the movie ... (SPOILERS) the only thing that is me really liked In reality it was rather scary the succession of two scenes in which the car is stopped and you see something / someone walking in the distance. At first I really thought that I could see things, but when the character realizes that the "figures" addressed to her are his reflection, I was surprised! A rather terrifying idea done well! Other than that ... I had a bad time. <br /> <br /> And I don't recommend it to anyone ... not even to "join the teenagers" because you can't even laugh at this ... <br /> <br /> I give him a solid 2. Only some technical results worked here ... apart from that ... yes ... nothing
