This film was recommended to me by several people, and after reading all the positive comments on this site I went ahead and bought a copy of the film on ebay. The acting in the film is mediocre and a bit friend, especially from the cannibal family, a sequence comes to mind when Jupiter is railed and delirious to the burned corpse, speaking directly into the camera. It's one of those performances where you make yourself shudder and feel bad for that poor actor. It's also evidence of some of the worst editing I've seen, there's a terrible leap in the middle of his "speech". There are some gruesome moments and sometimes the music works well ... but overall the film is not great and I don't know why people think Wes Craven is a great director. So far he hasn't shown me anything that I think is brilliant, the only thing that has improved with Cravens movies, production to production has been his budget.
