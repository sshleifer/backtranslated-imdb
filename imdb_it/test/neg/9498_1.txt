Apart from the glossy appearance, this show had little to recommend. The writing was condescending and twisted. Without exception the characters were superficial and nasty. The female characters have come out of the worst ... reduced to real selfish aerial witnesses whose soul's ambition was to run in dresses and stilettos, and try to plunder a man. This aspect of the show is all the more curious since the series was produced by two women! Acting for the most part was boring and lacking in a sense of humor with the cast playing one-dimensional characters that attack every scene on the same note. This is not entirely the fault of the actors. If they had spent more time developing the characters and the plot, adding a small injection of style and humor, MVP could have been a success. What remains is something flat and vaguely unpleasant.
