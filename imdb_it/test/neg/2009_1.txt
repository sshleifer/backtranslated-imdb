Hmmm! is the worst movie ever? it's kind of, for some of the cast it's a shame to see them in a movie like that but hey if he pays the bills why not, as far as the film goes well. OK Cg effects not bad for a movie so cheap, the music is OK again for a cheap movie, the credits are OK lol <br /> <br /> BAD to many to list but, cast, acting, screenplay, screenplay, ending .. that devil, Drac .......... the worst Drac EVER !, many others but you can't worry about putting them all on the ground. <br /> <br /> The idea was OK but it was necessary ten times the budget and more thought and lighting and better style and change all the critical points, I must say, however, to see this film so that I can say " the FU% $ was all this "as the credits perform. Even his type of a must see only to see how bad he is.
