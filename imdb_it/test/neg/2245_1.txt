Every film that made Quentin Tarantino has progressively deteriorated. I would like to believe that most people would agree with this statement, but since "Inglourious (sic) Basterds (sic)" has an 8.5 / 10 rating of over 100,000, it doesn't seem like the general public going to the cinema has a sense. Even his best work, Reservoir Dogs, was not a "masterpiece". The problem is that to say that you like Tarantino's work has become fashionable. As soon as that happens, you will have a load of people ready and ready to get on another caravan. They will ignore terribly terrible acting and completely self-indulgent writing just to be part of the exclusive club called "everyone". This film is so terrible, that I swear it must be some kind of distorted joke of Tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and will praise him anyway. As another reviewer has already said: "Tarantino's previous films came from a boy in love with other films, one from a boy in love with his own writing." Could not agree more. This film is nothing but a writing full of self-indulgence and in-joke, combined with acting skills drawn from a school play. But, thanks to the fact that the general film becomes public, I'm sure it will continue to be one of the best films ever made. Bravo, Tarantino. You brought out one of the best practical jokes of all time.
