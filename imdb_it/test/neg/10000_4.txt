This is an example of why most action movies are the same. Generic and boring, there's really nothing worth looking at here. A total waste of the barely touched talents of Ice-T and Ice Cube, who have shown many times that they are capable of acting and acting well. Don't worry about that, go see New Jack City, Ricochet or watch New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz the Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal. Ice-T's horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grateful, and I'm still wondering what the hell Bill Paxton was doing in this movie? And why the hell does he always do the exact same character? From Aliens onwards, every movie I saw with Bill Paxton made him play the exact same irritating character, and at least his character died in Aliens, which made it quite gratifying ... <br /> <br /> Overall, this is second-rate junk action. There are countless better films to watch, and if you really want to see it, look at Judgment Night, which is basically a carbon copy, but it has better acting and a better script. The only thing worth looking at was a decent hand on the camera: cinematography was almost refreshing, which came close to compensating for the horrible film itself, but not quite. 4/10.
