It seems at least vaguely possible that this film provided some inspiration for "The Sopranos", its main character, Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a hit man who has so many problems of his past and his profession that he is in therapy trying to deal with everything. Everything finally comes to its 10-year high school meeting. The problem was that when Blank arrived at the meeting, I stopped worrying. Frankly, I found this film a drag from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> It had potential. There was a reasonably good cast, directed by Cusack and Dan Aykroyd, played by Grocer, his archbishop in the businessman affair, along with Minnie Driver in the role of Debi, Blank's lover of high school who stood up dance night and a limited role for Alan Arkin as Dr. Oatman, Blank's psychologist. That rather talented cast never really seemed to unite, though. The drama lacked intensity and the comedy lacked true humor. What I thought had the most potential to be a comic story was Grocer's proposal for a successful union, but aside from being a bit of a joke, the idea never developed. As for the love story, one wondered why Debi would ever think of letting this guy come back into his life. <br /> <br /> There were a handful of giggles, but nothing caught me and held back and I spent most of the film time wondering if this thing would ever start clicking. It never happened - at least not for me. 2/10
