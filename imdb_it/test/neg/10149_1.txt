I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever until I saw this monstrosity. My friends and I went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half searching for a movie. We couldn't find one since we've seen almost all the movies created. We decided to take a look at the low budget horror section. We looked for the most attractive cover with poorly dressed women. We finally decided on Last Slumber Party, THE. Oops, we made a mistake. It seems that this film was shot with the cheapest camera that could be found in K-Mart. The actors were collected in a Salvation Army, and as for Steven Tyler. We will leave it only to the imagination. The plot of this film was ridiculous. SPOILER NOTICE During the movie there is absolutely no closure. Then come and discover that all events were just a dream. This film should also have been around 30 minutes. If the whole camera magnifies the shots and the scans of the walls have been eliminated, it would have been much shorter. All I can say is that I'm glad there wasn't a sequel.
