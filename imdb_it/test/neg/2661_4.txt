An unusually cold and silly drama by director Sydney Pollack. The soapy texture revolves around the adulterous couple who perish in a plane crash, leaving their spouses to find themselves and connect to their intimate level. Romance writing becomes a slow treatment, although I thought that the interpretations of the protagonists Harrison Ford and Kristen Scott-Thomas went well. The smooth production is interesting, even if the plot continues to cover the same terrain and never creates emotional momentum. As a result, the climax at the airport is a big "So?"
