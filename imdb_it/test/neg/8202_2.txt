A 1957 non-epic Roger Corman in which a diverse group of characters ends up in a lead-covered valley (sic) just as the repertoire of nuclear thermal findings is unleashed. It's the end of the world. Four men with guns, two women (one unmarried virgin the other a Las Vegas show that drinks and smokes - guesses which one gets to the end of the film?) Time passes, tensions develop (or are supposed). Something is in the woods that eat radioactive rabbits. A mutant monster! Seven weeks of radioactive dust have made "a million years of evolution" (on an already living human being) the result is a ridiculous evil, zip on the back, rubber monster that is strangely afraid of their only source of fresh water. It is raining. The monster dissolves. The remaining two characters, the Fusto and the Vergine. he left to repopulate the world while the caption 'The Beginning' fills the screen after it emerged that the brief rain of rain washed away all the radioactivity and dissolved all the monsters that ran "out there". <br /> <br /> The only thing of real note about this is the incredible amount of "curtain" that takes place in it. One of the fundamental elements of the film was the overabundant use of curtains in the scenography. It was cheap. Finished with a set-up? Pull a curtain, drop another piece of furniture in front of you and have a different position in a few minutes without having to move the camera or change the lighting. <br /> <br /> 'Curtain acting' is a skill in which the actor will be able to comment on what happens outside of any building in which he is ("It seems to be Rain" or "Here they come now, and it seems they have the sheriff with them! ", what sort of things). He will do it standing on one side of the window - reaching his body and lifting the curtain from the window, but along the axis of the shot - that is towards the camera - that allows him to pretend to look outside and tell us what happens off-screen, without showing the public that he is staring at the studio wall three inches from his nose behind some cheap velvet curtains. There was a lot of this in this movie.
