I will give a second chance but I was very disappointed in the first one. It would not hold a candle to the other series. It has a lot of meaningless dialogues that add nothing to the plot. I agree with others that it does not seem to develop a story that is interesting. It's slow and tiring and I only know what the Comanches are thinking of doing. Maybe they will all connect in the second episode but I'll have to force myself to look at it and find out. They are an Apache heritage of the Texas / New Mexico area, but I don't recognize much of what is happening. Maybe I'm just ignorant of the facts but this isn't doing much to educate me.
