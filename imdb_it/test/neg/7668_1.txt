This film is a real dishonor! I really enjoyed the original airport, and I can't believe that the same people could produce this twilight for nine years. First of all, acting is bad. The original had actors who had already made quality films (not catastrophic), but this uses actors who have already made the circuit of the disaster (Blakely, Kennedy, Wagner). Moreover, Patrons of George Kennedy seems to be promoted very quickly. Now he is the protagonist of the film, but his character is not strong enough to carry it forward: he has lost the charm and humor of Airport (1970), and the character is now only boring. Did I mention the plot? Is it credible that someone sends a missile after the Concorde ?? NO!!! There are too many free parts; scenes that have no relevance to the plot. The scene in which the balloon lands on the runway, the pursuit of the thief at Charles De Gaulle airport are two such scenes. Both would be interesting - if only they had something to do with the actual story. There are also many unanswered questions: why does Patrons open the window and throw a glow on the other plane? Why does the character of Robert Wagner kill himself? (Must it have another foolish and expensive way of Why is there no investigation after the missile almost blew the Concorde? Why are the rear projections so ugly? (It looks like a cardboard missile follows the Concorde, even if it works good when the plane lands in Paris) Why does Patrons think he is in a flight simulator? (when he turns the Concorde) Why does he receive a hero's welcome in the cabin of the plane after terrifying the passengers? can define an ending? Given their unidimensionality, nobody seems to notice it.The blessing given to the young couple on the plane by the girl's trainer is shmaltzy, the man who playing the saxophone is annoying, and the woman with the bladder problem is just silly scenes in which Susan Blakely is lying on the roof of her winter garden, and when she tells Wagner that she still loves him, they are pretty horrible, this film should have been the point culminating of the previ ous three airport films: instead it is a diabolic, sub-moral, complete and total waste of time, money, energy, celluloid and "talent" !!!!!!! Do you remember when Patroni asks the French driver if he ever "landed on his stomach?" This film certainly makes the abdominal flop, and lands slowly on his pointed nose ...
