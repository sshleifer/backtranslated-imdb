Terrible. I hope I can save two hours of your life by telling you about this. I just finished watching the movie, BTW. <br /> <br /> I love good genre films. This is not one of them. Show me a science fiction musical, a drama or a religious action movie, I'll watch them all. But you can't just make epigrammatic jokes in a touring, rural, slavery-horror festival and attract my applause. <br /> <br /> I love philosophical films. This is not one of them. Anyone who is amazed by the depths of the intellect scanned in this film has not read a good book lately. Or ever. The "stimulating" dialogue is trivial, at best. Maybe he lost something in the translation. <br /> <br /> I love a good horror comedy. This is not one of them. To laugh! I thought I would never start! Squirm? Only when I try to think of a kind way to express my feedback of the film to the friend who recommended it. <br /> <br /> Rupert is incredibly good at this movie's setting, but even he can't resurrect it. I just hope he shot the director instead, if the zombies. <br /> <br /> In shame, even the land that gave rise to Hell should give rise to this. Dante turned in his grave.
