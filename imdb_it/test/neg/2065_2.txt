I was an extra in this movie, but I wish I wasn't because it's junk. the worst thing about this film is the music, but also acting, screenplay, editing, direction and history are terrible. the main reason is that the budget is low and the only way to make a good movie on a low budget is to have a good script. the script that should have been torn before the film was made is not funny, I didn't laugh once. what made me laugh is how the producers probably think that the most important thing was the making of the film, who cares if its garbage is total. the film needed about a million pounds over budget and a better writer. the only reason I didn't give the movie, is that one out of ten is sorry for the guy who will lose a few hundred dollars doing this, if you do you will go and see just make sure you're drunk right now. ha ha
