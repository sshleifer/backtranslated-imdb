The update of the game by Clare Booth Luce and the 1939 film is a great disappointment. The cast of women is excellent, most of the individual scenes work but nothing is suspended. There is no connection from one scene to another almost as if the film had been made in parts and then assembled in a vacuum. Admitted the story of a woman who treats her husband's infidelity and how she is helped and hindered by her friends is less shocking in an age where divorce is so common, but at the same time is just as timely as ever , I just wish they had managed to connect all the pieces together because as it stands now you don't really feel attracted to the plot. Wait for the cable.
