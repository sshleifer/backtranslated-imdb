And one just, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> That's the reason for Margaret Leighton. She is a wonderful actress, on stage and on screen. We have little chance of seeing it, though. I think it's particularly true in the United States. <br /> <br /> Here he plays a sympathetic role. Not only that, but it is also very pretty and designed to be a kind of bomb. <br /> <br /> Walter Pigeon does not hold up the tradition of Drummond artists. It's always reliable but it's not very funny. He is not a villain or a villain. As a result, this seemed like a friendly effort with little action or suspense. But take a look at Leighton.
