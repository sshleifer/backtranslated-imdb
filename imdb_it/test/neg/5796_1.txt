Unfortunately, this film had potential with a cast so available, but everything was badly thought out and poorly executed. I don't think I've ever seen any movie where every scene is simply flat with a loud thud, like it did here. Also, I don't think I've ever seen a "stoner" sexual comedy that didn't provide at least one laugh, but this whirlwind of pain provided nothing but groans and suffering. The last time I was amazed by how nasty a comedy can be was with the horrible "Big Momma's House". Scene after scene, these films will turn your brain into jelly. Silly and stupid can sometimes be fun, but here, fools and fools are used as a torture device against the viewer. A real disaster.
