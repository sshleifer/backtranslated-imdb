Diane Lane, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson and Thomas Jane ..... It is not a negative cast in my opinion, but they have been totally wasted in this film. <br /> <br /> There was no real direction, there were not unusual turns, in fact the whole film was very predictable from beginning to end. Mickey Rourke has had a really annoying companion who has done nothing but irritate you from the start. Rosario Dawson was completely wasted and there was almost no point in his character in the film. I truly believe that this is one of those films that are directly on DVD that everyone will forget very quickly and that is a shame because the film could have been much better.
