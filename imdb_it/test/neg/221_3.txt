I'm so angry to the point that I usually do reviews with spoilers, but in this case I'll make an exception. The first scenes of this film are weak and then when they come to the film's meat and potatoes it sucks. This is a movie I rooted for the bad guys because the captain-save-day was incredible and there was no connection with him or anything to make you like him. The main actor gave the weakest performance and Laurence Fishburne or Matt Dillon failed to save this film. Sometimes there are open eyes or big moments in a movie that might not be so nice ... this movie doesn't have any. If you are looking for a movie to watch in the meantime while nothing has made your interest peek out ... don't choose this ... save your money.
