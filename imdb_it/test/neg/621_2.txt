Making a film based on a true story, especially one as incredible and terrifying as the 1972 plane crash, is difficult even for the best directors. But the Mexicans behind this forgettable and cheap exploitative film don't even try! ALL the actual names of the survivors and victims of the Uruguayan plane crash have all been altered, the incident itself is obviously staged in a very slippery manner, and the cannibal aspect was unnecessarily and gorily played. Incredibly, he made a lot of money on both sides of the border. Fortunately, he thought, it was mercifully forgotten. But the same people behind this would later give us the equally revolting GUYANA: CULT OF THE DAMNED! <br /> <br /> This cheap horror film made it necessary to make ALIVE about fifteen years later. That film was a masterpiece. Survival !, to put it mildly, it is not.
