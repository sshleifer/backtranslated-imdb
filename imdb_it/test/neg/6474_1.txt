The remake of the Disney studios of their classic slapstick of 1965 concerns an intelligent feline who leads a F.B.I. agent to a kidnapped woman. Christina Ricci gives a hurried performance and let-out-here as the cat owner and the feeder is played by Doug E. Doug, embarrassingly exaggerated, like a human cartoon. A pair of rich neurotics (Dyan Cannon and the original cast member "Cat" Dean Jones) are fun and the plot-formula still has some juice in it, but the manipulation here is so heavy and dismal, and the cat it is so lifeless, that it is strictly DOA <br /> <br /> * from ****
