I thought Sliver offered the most boring and trivial "deceptive" ending in the history of cinema, but obviously I was wrong. I had no disillusionment that this film would be good. Unfortunately, it was worse than I expected. The worst part is that the obvious ending is so ridiculous and horrible that you can't believe it until it actually happens.
