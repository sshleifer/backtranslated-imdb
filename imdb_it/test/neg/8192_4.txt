It's schmaltzy, but then what else did you expect? Heroin is the younger sister of Cinderella, full of bad mother, sister and brother-in-law; the hero (if you can call him that) is an ineffective putz; and rival amorous interests are full of melodramatic evil. <br /> <br /> The cast, the settings and the wardrobe were all very attractive, and I thought the actors did a superb job considering how weak the material was. The film was gracefully filmed and boasted a soundtrack that was carefully crafted to suggest to the viewer what emotions he should try. Megon McDonough sang sweetly and offered some of her best moments to the film. <br /> <br /> If you love Danielle Steel, you will love this movie. If you love archetypal romance, you will love this movie. Not me. I was able to sit down, but he was close.
