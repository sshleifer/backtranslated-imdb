The Bone Collector is set in New York City and begins as one of the world's leading criminology and crime experts. Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is involved in an accident that leaves him with a quadriplegic bedridden. Jumps forward four years and Alan (Gary Swanson) and his wife Lindsay Rubin (Olivia Birkelund) are kidnapped, soon after New York policewoman Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is called to a crime scene and finds the buried and mutilated body of Alan. Amelia notices some unusual evidence of the crime scene and notes what impresses Rhyme when asked to work on the case, but quickly realizes that the evidence is actually cryptic clues about Lindsay's location. After discovering the clues, the cops arrive too late to save her, but this is only the beginning as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill and leave forensic clues for Rhyme and the police ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Phillip Noyce I saw The Bone Collector last night and I must say that it is one of the worst films on the big budget The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Se7en (1995) that I saw in serialized thrillers, indeed, makes it Friday 13 ( 1980) seems sophisticated and realistic! The script by Jeremy Iacone was based on the book by Jeffery Deaver and is so poor on so many levels that I don't know where to start. To begin with, it is taken seriously from the mortal point of view and this makes all the other defects seem double. The characters are really horrible and I didn't think any of them were real human beings. First we have Lincoln Rhyme who is paralyzed from the neck down and there's not much that the script can do with him, in fact, he literally can't do anything but stay in bed throughout the film. He is apparently struck by Amelia because he stopped a train and thought that a fresh footprint next to a murdered person could be relevant, I'm not funny here but he would never have understood that a footprint near a murder victim could have any relevance ? Why is he so impressed with her? Then there is Capatin Cheney who is not only unlikely and cries to everyone for no apparent reason, but is so incompetent that he cannot connect several murders committed in a short period of time in which each victim had sections of flesh and skin surgically removed from their bodies, how exactly did this boy become a police captain? Then there's the murderer whose motivations are less plausible, are you trying to tell me that they came up with a complicated plan to kill at least seven people because they spent six years in prison for something they actually did? If they wanted revenge on Rhyme because they killed all those other people who had no connection with anything, I could perhaps buy someone who wanted revenge on the guy who put them away, but not kill many other people who have no connection with themselves, the Rhyme desired target any other thing. Moreover, after having devised a complex plan to kill these people and get away with it, they suddenly become the most stupid person in history, despite being in possession of a big knife and able to walk and use their arms they are actually defeated and almost killed by a quadriplegic who has no movement in his body under his neck! How did it happen? I should also mention Amelia who is a terrible character, actually she buys her camera to take pictures of crime scenes and shoots rats for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> In addition to some of the worst characters ever written in the story and the plot It's not much better We never find out why the killer is using the book The Bone Collector as a source of inspiration We never find out why the killer was taking strips of meat from his victims. It has never been explained why a novice cop like Amelia is allowed to enter the crime scenes even before the right forensic teams. There is no reason why the killer chooses his victims. Even the clues of the killers are a bit dark, aren't they? I mean a bone of bloody blood and shaved rat hair? Logically, how does someone move from bone to mouse to the exact exact location of the next victim and have the whole of New York to choose from? There are some nonsense about a bird that is on the ledge of the Rhymes window that is completely random and in almost two hours The Bone Collector is really slow. There is so much wrong in The Bone Collector and it all comes down to one of the worst scripts of all, it's atrocious at all levels and has no credibility. Apparently Angelina Jolie said she shot nude scenes for this movie, but they were cut off because they were too distracting. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of around $ 48,000,000 The Bone Collector is well crafted with good production values ​​and that Hollywood glory about it. I must also add that I think Angelina Jolie has played one of the worst performances I've ever seen, I think it's absolutely terrible in this. Denzel Washington is right there, Queen Latifah is horrible and even Michael Rooker can't do much because he's stuck with a cliché and a one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> The Bone Collector must be one of the worst Hollywood movies I've seen in a while, I saw it for free on telly last night and I still feel cheated and robbed. There are so many things to do holes in is it stupid, awful awkward or should it be terribly embarrassing? It works both ways to be honest ...
