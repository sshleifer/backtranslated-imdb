If you feel that Reshammiya as a singer is too painful to watch on TV, try watching it in the movie for 2 hours at a time. His face is bland throughout the film, and it is very comical to see him play challenging and intense scenes. This is far from a true love story (Take the right spelling, Reshammiya - it's not luv or reeal), and it's complete with him doing a Mithun da dance, rickshaw scenes, Himesh being imprisoned , Himesh accused of murder, escapes from prison etc ... If you want a good laugh, there is nothing like this, especially the scenes in which he screams to Mehbooba. If you despise nasal nasal passages and want to know by curiosity what two hours of Reshammiya can do for you, then don't miss this movie. <br /> <br /> I couldn't stop laughing from the beginning to the very end. The only redeeming feature of this film is cinematography, places and a couple of songs. Even then, as long as you're not a Reshammiya fan, avoid this movie at all costs.
