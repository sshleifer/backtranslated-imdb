If you want a big April Fool joke, then please show someone this movie with everyone. However, it is important not to criticize the film, but rather to talk about what an artistic triumph it is and how "they don't make great films like this anymore". While your victim looks at many disconnected and senseless scenes (like a cute dog being bitten without apparent reason, a cow standing on the bed, a woman licking the feet of a statue or Jesus apparently raping a woman), she makes many comments using words as "brilliance", "juxtaposed" or "transcendent" - while acting as if the film really made sense and was not a complete waste of an hour of your life. Also make sure you keep your face serious and pretend shock when (and if) they say they didn't understand it or that you had all the artistry of a cow pie. Then, to further mess them up, show them all the comments on IMDb, since almost all (except for some creators of problems like almagz and rooprect) speak brilliantly of what genius and talent this movie is! When you are done with this little charade, they will most likely think that they are idiots and will make an appointment with a psychologist. <br /> <br /> This, for me, is the ONLY reason for looking at this horrendous movie mess !!! This, or you could show it to the Guantanamo prisoners to make them talk! <br /> <br /> If you ask me, the famous painting of dogs playing poker or an Elvis velvet are artistically superior.
