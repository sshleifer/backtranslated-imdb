I really wanted this movie so much. The previews looked marginally fun, but I thought they put most of the fun stuff in the previews. In this case, not only did they do it, but they distorted the clips so that they looked a lot more fun than they did in the real movie. I like John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Vince Vaughn, The Rock, Cedric the Entertainer, etc. So I wanted this film to appeal to me but it never seemed to do anything. <br /> <br /> I saw Get Shorty and we don't particularly care. Too slow and not fun for me. This film is certainly not better and, if anything, it is worse. There have been many opportunities for some good comic moments but none of them took. <br /> <br /> The acting went well, but even John Travolta seemed to be subdued. Cedric was ok but he was too ruled to be really funny. Vince Vaughn and the Rock were good enough and ready to be funny, but they let everything pass them. I wish they had had the chance to follow the fun things they created, but instead kept coming back to the same old thing and going back to setting Vaughn and Rock up to be fun (even if it was never possible to punchline or comedy) . <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a very disappointing film and I'm glad I only saw it on video. At least it was cheaper than the theater.
