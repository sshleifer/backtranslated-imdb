This is the third movie in a month that I saw that did not go as I expected. The first two are The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, none of which gave new ideas about who committed the crimes. <br /> <br /> I have always had a fascination with UFOs and was so excited to see a new film on the UFO investigation subject that was not a comedy. But after about 30 minutes, everything went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> I could have resisted the acting, the corners of the camera, the stereotypes if only there was a good story about UFO tracking, but none here. I'm not saying there was anything wrong with the subject, but Netflix pushed this film like a UFO skeptic and a UFO believer who investigates multiple seats. <br /> <br /> I stopped looking around halfway. I can't believe I wasted so much time with this. Please don't make the same mistake I made.
