A university professor is working on creating zombies and, you wouldn't know it, things go terribly wrong. The next thing you know, the entire campus is flooded. Thank God there are a couple of uber-commandos trained for such a situation. Too bad they have to be accompanied by a group of moron-commandos, led by a rapper (he doesn't even bother trying to play a soldier, he simply responds to his superiors as if he were a rapper 'wit' from homies in a hood). The highest point of this part of the film is the dressing room scene. The male and female moron-commandos share the same dressing room, and apparently military regulations require all women to wear black bras and panties. Hey, if you can't make a good movie, at least you can have women in underwear. My hat goes to the directors. <br /> <br /> So, after much discussion about how these phantom commandos are ready for work (Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq), they are all killed in a fairly short order. Their biggest downfall seems to be that it never happens to them to turn on the lights. A typical meeting makes them enter a room and see someone at the end. Human or zombie? Can't tell you Turn on the lights? No, the idion-commando protocol requires them to approach the person, making sure to hold the gun so that it can easily be severed by their hand, and well, you know the drill. Sergeant Major Sticky Fingaz's disappearance is particularly fun - my favorite scene involving a rapper in any movie I've ever seen. Fortunately (and again, the directors' hats), the hottest of the deficient commandos manages to survive. She and the uber-commando female both end up in tight shirts for the rest of the film. Now this is how a military operation must be performed! There is a bit of a run around, punctuated my humorous stuff like the uber-commandos not being able to overcome a simple lattice of the fan (it is obviously a thin piece of aluminum that one could easily move the fist). This requires a plan to rub all the guts of the zombies and even if we have not seen anything in the film to indicate that the zombies locate their prey with the smell, they are good enough to immediately start sniffing the guts of the zombies and let the our heroes. <br /> <br /> Some other fun pieces: the Paris Hilton gag, the "Can you hear me now?" gag, and the fact that even if the zombies immediately bite secondary characters, the main characters are able to make their way through dozens of them without being nibbled. Another giggle is provided by Mr. Fingaz, who does not seem to pronounce the word "tourniquet" (toe-no-kit?). <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a little fun. I could have used some more interesting characters, but for a Sci-Fi Channel original, I was pleasantly impressed.
