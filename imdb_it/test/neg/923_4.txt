As a recent convert to Curb Your Enthusiasm, which prompted me to see all the episodes of the season, I expected more, much more from Jeff's efforts. <br /> <br /> When I watch a movie that offers a slice of a mid-life "Joe" I need reasons to be interested, to worry, to hear and believe. And with Jeff Garlin at the helm I was also expecting a bevy of brilliant comic moments. This film has failed me over and over again. <br /> <br /> Jeff enjoys living with his mother, a sad and sad lot that is a social disaster. He has had no relationship, real or even casual, for many years. He seems to be mostly unemployed and, as is known, shacks with his dearer mother. Can things get worse? Sure. In a short time he is fired from all those around him, including Silverman, Second City (his comedy lab) and his agent. Everyone strengthens his "loser" status. Silverman's 'fat' experiment was as cruel as it was absurd. His obsession with the role of "Marty", as a means to the salvation of his career, also affects a great blind alley. <br /> <br /> While the final moments of the film offer a glimpse of the best things for the cinematographic journey, "although with occasional glimmers of gold, it was sadly missing.
