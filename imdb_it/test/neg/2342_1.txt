For me this film is just a very disgusting teen movie, with all the normal clich√©s and boring stereotyped characters (Nerds, Jocks, popular girls, stylish kids, etc.) But with a basic anti-drug / alcohol theme. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the unfortunate chance of seeing this movie, keep an eye on all the references to responsibility and keep it real (I don't know how else to say it) I guess the only thing that makes this movie fantastic , it would be if the TV on it was on fire. That, or DVD had exploded ... <br /> <br /> 1 in 10000 - Watch Animal House instead.
