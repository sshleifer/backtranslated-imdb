Sometimes, things should not be done. And while the set-up seemed pretty good, it only proceeds to keep the audience speechless with horror. But the problem is that it's not another Saw movie. It is a pity that you want to receive punishment from Jason Voorhees. <br /> <br /> I lost track of how many sports movies and parodies have been incorporated into the film. And generally, he flopped in his attempts. Of course, telling his team that every person should fail to be a real player at the beginning was a bit strange, but it was hard to watch. This is the joke on "Radio" and "IPod". <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't stand to watch this movie again. Trantasia is also worth more than this. "D-"
