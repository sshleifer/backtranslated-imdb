I absolutely hated this movie. Even though the film wanted to convey a sort of social message, it was done in such a cruel and melodramatic way as a Mexican soap opera. <br /> <br /> Even the acting was terrible, especially Charityn and her son. This is one of the problems with Dominican films, they use celebrities who can't even act just to attract the masses. <br /> <br /> I am even more ashamed of the positive reviews here, which sadly means that the Dominicans are simply complying with what is being done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry to rely on quality .
