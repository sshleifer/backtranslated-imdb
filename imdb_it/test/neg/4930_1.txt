This is as stupid as it is. <br /> <br /> A classic case of two-dimensional characters that always act exactly contrary to what a sane person would do in the same situation. It reminds me of a scene in "Scary Movie" in which Carmen Electra escapes from the killer. There are two signs, one marked "for security", the other "for sure death" (I am reciting from memory). <br /> <br /> And just like in Scary Movie, the characters always run in the direction marked "Sure Death". <br /> <br /> Why oh, why did the girl light the fire in the door of the door and KEPT THE DOOR? Did he prefer to die in the fire instead of being killed by the boy? Why oh, why, after cutting and overpowering the driver, did they sit on the seat and show him to the injured instead of shooting him or at least throw him out? Was he investing their friend and killing him a minute earlier, yet they have scruples? Because oh, because a hundred more things ... <br /> <br /> If this film were a road, you couldn't drive a single yard because of holes. Everything is so far-fetched, sometimes it's starting to hurt physically. <br /> <br /> Add "actors" and a small budget to that without exaggerating and that's what you get. Looking at the evaluation and the comments, I have the feeling that those people are watching a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is really missing is the infamous "While She was out" red toolbox - a film about unrealistic plot and stupid character behavior.
