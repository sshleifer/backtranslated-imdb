I'm tired of several attempts to sit down and watch this "Gilmore Girls" program. It baffled me because I couldn't understand what it meant. Was it a young woman who had a young child in life and never grew up? Does it concern that the daughter is more responsible than the mother? Was it a rich rebel girl and her unruly daughter? What the hell is this show? Finally, I didn't care. The cast makes me want to scream. Writing is neither "intelligent" nor "intelligent", it is syrupy and boring. <br /> <br /> So why did I look? Because I've heard so many positive things about this and I'm not one to express an opinion until I've seen it. Knee reactions are usually wrong, so I looked a couple of times. The first time I saw him, I saw his mother running like she was 12 and her daughter behaved as if she were 40 years old. Maybe that's what didn't attract me. I never liked any of the "Freaky Friday" movies, not to say that it is, but there are some similarities. <br /> <br /> I also have a friend who watches this show every week. So I asked her, "What is this show about?" A very bright young woman, usually articulate, could never give me a direct answer. So I asked others who excite them - they don't even know it. <br /> <br /> Gilmore Girls is proving to be a television program similar to an "art house film". Many of us don't understand it, but those who go desperately try to find a meaning where there isn't one, just to be "fashionable". Yes, I find Lorelai annoying by Lauren Graham - whining, whining, nasal WHINE. A whole hour of that. Wow. And the rest of the cast is just as memorable as yesterday's cheese sandwich. The city is disgusting, men are magicians, grandparents are boring, and unfortunately I don't find anything of salvation on any of these characters or I care what they do. It's like looking at the dry paint on the wall.
