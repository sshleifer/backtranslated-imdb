First of all, let me say that I am not at all denying the importance of the subject, indeed. I am Polish and have been aware of the Katyn massacre for a long time (in fact, two of my family died there), so I couldn't wait to see this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem lies in the script, which includes too many subplots and characters, none of which is properly developed. The characters are painfully one-dimensional; their stories are intertwined, but lack an overall meaning. In my opinion, the cast doesn't really have the chance to show off their skills. The exception is Andrzej Chyra, who portrays Jerzy - the only interesting character. I wish the story was more focused on him. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film lacks emotion. Before seeing him I thought I was moved, even if only for sentimental reasons - but in fact I was looking at him with a strange sense of detachment everywhere, except for the final execution scene. It is done well and its location is interesting and provides a culminating ending, although the idea that the Lord's Prayer is played in unison by the executed officers seems a bit far-fetched. <br /> <br /> To conclude, I suppose the film can have an educational value for those who are not familiar with historical events portrayed, but in my opinion it fails as a work of cinema.
