Imagine if you do: four teenage students are tasked with spending the night in a haunted house in St. Francisville, Louisiana, to verify the existence of the paranormal. If you look at it in the dark and late at night; it is likely that the hair on the back of the neck will lift up a couple of times. Otherwise this fake documentary is a real robbery of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. What must be the dialogue is very lame and the actors are quite pleasant, but they seem to lack genuine personality. It seems like it will take forever before something truly ghostly happens. This film is excellent for "sleepers" when you have both eyes open and everyone is laughing and snacking.
