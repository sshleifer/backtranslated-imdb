This is a road movie. At least the movie is in yellow and I think it suggests a road movie (?). I can't say very positive about The Delivery. It's a bad acting, certainly their English. The camera seems to be made by a child, there is a bomb with a counter, and suddenly a Beetle is falling from the sky. Since it was so cliche, we actually thought all the time - and it was the most fun in the movie. This film should be released in America, but I'm not sure you should go because this might suggest that it's the quality we produce. The explosions seem boring. Basically everything is exaggerated. Everything is just too much: the yellow quality, the sound, the child, etc. Find all the clich√©s in other movies, put them together and you have The Delivery.
