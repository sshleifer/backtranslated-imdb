All the boys seem to be sexually excited by Mandy Lane. All the girls seem to be jealous of Mandy Lane. But nothing seems to be out of it and this viewer wonders why? Mandy is beautiful and a magnet for every guy she meets, but we never know Mandy or any of the characters in the movie. Mandy accepts an invitation from her student friends to go to a secluded ranch. Three boys and three girls drink and take drugs. In the film, teenagers drink alcohol like his water and take drugs to experience a psychedelic journey. And there's absolutely no sex. Meanwhile, teenagers disappear one by one. But the others are all drunk and high. No one, including those who watch the film, is worried or worried. No one, including the public, seems to care. Emmet, a fellow student, is the instigator of the whole event. There is a security guard, Garth (captivatingly and beautifully interpreted by Anson Mount), who protects and protects the ranch. In the middle of the film, the killer is revealed, the tension is suddenly released like the air left out of a balloon. The events are completely predictable and the film completely runs out. Mandy meets her game, but we never know why - and, at the end of the film, there is still no sex. Does Mandy hypnotize kids or just bore all the boys and girls to death? This absolutely confused viewer can only conclude that Mandy wants to get rid of the female and male competition - killing manipulative girls and bad boys. <br /> <br /> Does Mandy deserve all the attention? The director (Jonathan Levine) seems to think so, but this viewer does not. The able director of photography (Darren Genet) offers some extraordinary images, but in fact his focus seems to be on Garth, which is rather the pivot. Not all boys love Mandy, or not? If you want to be bored enough to find out how this film ends, my advice is to sleep in the middle of the film, until you see the temptation of Mandy and Garth the bloated horse. But don't wait for something to happen. Yes, you guessed it. Mandy remains a virgin and there is no sex yet. I classify this film as 3 out of 10, but not because of Mandy. Why? Because all the girls love Garth, and all the voyeuristic eyes seem to be on Garth in a compromising position. But unfortunately, girls and boys, this film never seems to go beyond a disappointed and incomplete sexual fantasy. Mandy goes to a secluded ranch and nothing sexual ever happens. The public is brought to a horror ranch - and can't help, but wondering why?
