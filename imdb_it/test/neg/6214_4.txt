The film is not bad in itself ... until you see the original film Hitch (2005) with Will Smith. The film is a straight copy with even the dialogues for most of the film simply translated from English to Hindi! The plot in the original is well executed. The Hindi version fails to keep viewers interested. The exaggerated type of comedy of David Dhawan seems to have exaggerated with Govinda who screams hysterically at all times ... sometimes it takes longer to understand the reason for what the plot. :) <br /> <br /> If you know English, which I assume you know as you are reading this, look at the Hollywood original. At least look at "Hitch" if you looked at Partners to be able to compare. This is the least we can do to support the creative geniuses whose work, I'm sad to say, is shamelessly raised by "inspired" people like David Dhawan.
