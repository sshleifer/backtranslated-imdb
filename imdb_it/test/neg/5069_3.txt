I realized looking at this type of film that I don't like very much. Caged Women is yet another film of "women in prison", and like most of the rest of the genre; the plot is completely abandoned in favor of simply showing naked women. Now don't get me wrong; I love naked women, but I also like that there is a kind of plot to go with nudity, and since this film has only the basic theme of "women are in prison" going through it (besides the essential escape, of course ), I got a little bored before the end. The film is good because there is just a moment when women wear clothes, but this is the only positive element. Director (and writer, ha ha) Erwin C. Dietrich delights in showing close-ups of the naked female body, but it is never very erotic. The director was the producer of numerous trash films, including some directed by Jess Franco. In my opinion, he should limit himself to producing how his writing talents are non-existent, and he doesn't seem to know how to film a sex scene. This type of material is quite dry for a long time, but I think Franco could have made more of it. Overall, this could be enough for people who are really into this kind of thing; but I can't say I enjoyed it.
