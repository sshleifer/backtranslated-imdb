I was stuck in traffic (I live in Sicily) on the way to the theater (in a military base) to see Superman Returns, it was 15 minutes late, and the only other movie that I played was "See No Evil", there it was no poster for this, and only a brief description of the film about the program ... but my girlfriend and I decided to take a look ... As soon as I saw that it was produced by WWE, I only knew it would be terrible. The few people in the theater were laughing most of the time, and it was the first film that I honestly considered released, and I saw "The Ringer" ... ok, I was gonna get out of that, but I was too busy sleeping. The villain's death was pretty good in the end, but other than that, he was just stupid.
