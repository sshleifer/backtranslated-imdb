1980 was certainly a year for bad backwoods movies. "Friday The 13th" and "The Burning" may have been the best but there were always a couple of stinkers not far behind like "Do not Go Into The Woods Alone" and this one. But in all honesty, "The Prey" is nowhere near as bad as "Do not Go Into The Woods", but it's also not great. One thing is that it is boring and acting is not very good but much better than "DGITW" and in reality this film has attractive looking women, all three female derivations were sensational. One thing that happens with all that nonsensical wildlife footage seemed useless and it seemed that the director used that to use it to fill some space. <br /> <br /> So what was there to appreciate this movie? Well, there were some cheesy laughs - I couldn't hold a giggle attack when the last girl did a bizarre kind of backward walk to get away from the kille and there were some killing scenes - my the favorite being the girl who suffocated to death with a sleeping bag; and the nosy. <br /> <br /> All in all The Prey is stupid, boring and the killer that I didn't find scary at all, this movie could have been much better.
