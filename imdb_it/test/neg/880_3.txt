Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was a bit awkward to see Lane and Gere in this film, because it's BAD. The acting was bad, the dialogues were extremely superficial and insincere. It was well shot, but again, it's a big-budget film. It was too predictable, even for a chicken shot. I knew from the beginning that he would eventually die, the only thing I didn't know was how. Too politically correct. Very disappointing. The only thing that was really worth looking at was the scenery and the house, because it's beautiful. But, if you want, look at the national geography. I love Lane, but I've never seen it in such a bad movie. As for Gere, he's a good actor, but he has movies like this, so I'm not surprised. An hour and a half I wish I could go back.
