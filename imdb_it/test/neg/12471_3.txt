"Tart" is a good illustration of old Yogi Berra who says, "If you don't know where you're going, you'll probably end up somewhere else." Writer / director Christina Waye (in her first feature film) managed to make a $ 3 million movie that ends up elsewhere. "Tart" is either an aging story without characters with which a rational person can connect, a black comedy without humor, or a sexploitation film without anything particularly sexy. <br /> <br /> Unlike the standard Swain film, "Tart" actually employed a competent and experienced set designer. Good enough to provide two beautiful shots: the scene of Swain and Barton taking a bubble bath together and the Swain scene in the park - with a beautiful montage of the sculpture "Alice in Wonderland". The symbolism embedded in these elements supports the possibility that Waye (despite the absence of a linear logic or unity of tone) actually has some visionary talent and aspirations to make a quality film. <br /> <br /> It is also possible that Waye tried to merge the somewhat expressionist "Metropolitan" and the classic "Cruel Intentions" field that also deal with the upper class of Manhattan. There are many camera shots framed by windows and doors but a few close-ups of faces and eyes. The first technique that alludes to symbolism and the second to intentional detachment from the characters and their motivations. "Tart" seemed on the verge of turning towards the territory of the camp at least twice and it would have been good to advise you to go ahead in that direction. First there was the scene where they tried to unload Swain, apparently dead, in the trash chute. Then there is the whole fact that his father is Jewish (interpreted in the same way that Joel Gray dances with the Jewish guerrilla in "Cabaret"). <br /> <br /> In his other films, Swain's acting technique is to overwhelm every scene in which he appears (inserting a scenario that chews here) but in "Crostata" actually shows an ability to hold back. This is the best interpretation of his career. It also provides some clues about its super cute cute physical deterioration in "Girl" to the gigantic face of "Pumpkin". This transformation was almost complete for half the time it produced "Crostata"; so go to the ravages of time. <br /> <br /> Mischa Barton ("Sixth Sense", "I feel better girl") and Lacey Chabet are excellent in supporting roles. The rest of the cast is simply horrible, although some of the responsibilities for this should go to Waye's script and direction.
