Loki, the Norwegian god of evil, creates a mask that gives the wearer cartoon-like powers. At the command of his father, Odin, he spends the rest of the film searching for the mask so that he cannot cause further pain to humanity. Meanwhile, the mask's owner conceives a child who inherits the powers of the mask. Etc. Etc. If this sounds like a rather thin plot, it is. Add to that the fact that the film is run inept from beginning to end, and the result is very, very bad. You can find worse movies, but you will have to actively search for them. <br /> <br /> For the most part, Son of the Mask is presented at the intellectual level of a pre-schoolboy, but in the light of scenes like the child of the mask urinating copiously in six different directions, including on his father , this premise seems unlikely. I asked my son who he thought could be the film's target audience, and he replied "convicted criminals", apparently forgetting for the moment that the Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. <br /> <br /> But just making a bad movie is not a sin, or hell would be overflowing. What makes it a shame is that $ 72 million was spent on this piece of junk. To put things in perspective, the next day we saw Son of the Mask, my son and I saw "Good Night and Good Luck", a film that received six Academy Award nominations (including the best photo), and it is was raised to $ 7 million. Quite right. Only one tenth of the amount spent on Son of the Mask. This, then, is the sin: to find a good price down the sewers, when it could have been better used to make watchable films, or to feed hungry children, or at least for almost any other purpose. Producers should be ashamed of themselves.
