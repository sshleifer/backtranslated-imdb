The most frightening thing about this horror movie is that the end alludes to a sequel. 'The Cave' is really a disappointing action movie. A team of cave and submarine researchers goes to Romania (one of these cheap places to make a film, at least for now) and following a destroyed church enters a cave that turns out to be a kingdom of underground monsters. Or are they demons? The film never decides if it wants to be action, science fiction or horror, it's a mix of everything without salt or entertainment, and played in a wooden way. The best thing about the film is the cinematography, but even the dark landscape of the cave soon becomes boring, because the film lacks rhythm and the characters are simply not interesting. Waste of time.
