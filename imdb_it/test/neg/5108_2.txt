Man bites this thing! I'm sorry I never sat and watched it! Friedkin was crazy for making a film in an attempt to win the sympathy of the spectators for this madman. If it depended on me, I would have made the public hate that low life instead of having all eyes veiled over him! He killed people! Pretty grizzly I could add too! And Friedkin wants you to feel sorry for him because he has no "reason"! I say that Friedkin can forget it! I hate the guy that this movie is based in part and I hope they did the essay and gave him his unpleasant ass !!! In a nutshell, don't waste your time! He is sick and perverse!
