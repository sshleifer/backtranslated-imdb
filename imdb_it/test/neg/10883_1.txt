Seriously, folks ... I was getting ready to really write the Razzie Council and recommend this movie as Razzie Champ for 2007 ... until I switched to IMDb.com and realized its copyright date in 2006 and not in 2007. Seriously, though, this film could easily have been a Razzie champion. This movie has been sucked! As in the world this piece of shit was neglected even for a nomination Razzie in 2006 is beyond me, because he could easily compete with Basically, It Stinks, Too for the Razzie 2006 championship. <br /> <br /> I rented this film on the advice of a neighbor of mine who told me, "Oh my God, after watching this movie, it will take a long, long time before I ever stop at a rest stop!" I couldn't believe how scary and terrible this movie was! Possible spoilers below, not that you'll miss anything. <br /> <br /> OK, first of all ... the problem ... the rest stops. Obviously the director of this piece of shit doesn't know the first thing about women. The toilets at that stopping point were at the same level as that of the Trainspotting movie. I don't pretend to know everything there is to know about women, but one thing I do know is that women, for the most part, are totally safe and hygienic. Given the choice between taking a crap on one of those toilets and possibly taking something or squatting in the woods, a woman is about to opt for squatting in the woods. I know, because I've already gone camping with them and they have no problem squatting in the woods. So right there ... hole in the biggest plot and lie. <br /> <br /> Secondly ... she gets out of the parking stop, and her boyfriend who drove the car is nowhere to be found, not him or her car. He just left. He starts screaming his name, wondering where he is. Ummm ... hello? Are you standing on wet mud ... did it ever occur to you to look for traces of tires? I mean, her car left ... she just didn't get up and flew away. And indeed, this makes me think ... I was actually looking at his feet, and there were no signs of footprints in the mud. How ... exactly ... did it happen? <br /> <br /> Third ... the Bible that beats the family of mobile homes with the bizarre dwarf in the back taking pictures Polaroid ... Wtf!?!?!? ? They made absolutely no sense, and it's as if the director had just thrown them in to be weird for the sake of being weird. They made no sense and had no place in the film. <br /> <br /> Fourth ... Oh my God, this ... I mean, finally ... towards the end of the film. ... finally sees the escape hatch on the ceiling inside the stopping point. I'm like, "You ... stupid ... bi ** You've been locked up this whole time ... and you alone ... now ... you see ... the security door on the ceiling?" I mean ... it's as if they had thrown it just because the killer was throwing gas on the floor through the window and he was preparing to light a match. So he needs to get to higher ground to avoid being burned, and ... oh, look! A perfect reason for her to reach the top! An escape hatch on the ceiling! It's like ... Why didn't you pass it before? Most people in that situation would have seen it from the moment they were stuck at that stopping point and had taken the f ** k from Dodge. When they showed that the escape hatch at the end of the movie, I was like, "You're kidding me." <br /> <br /> Fifth ... what was the agreement with all the people he met continuing to disappear? The girl in the broom closet at the staging point? The stupid cop? You at the end of the film when it ended up in the same broom? It has never been explained. Personally, when they did this, I thought to myself, "Oh, Christ on a cracker, it's her. She is the killer. Wonderful. She killed all those people, I don't remember doing it, and the writers of this movie just snatched a certain French horror film that I can't mention on IMDb.com or I'll be blacklisted to give away the ending (that movie also sucked, folks) ". But it wasn't. He was not the murderer, and the whole agreement with the disappearance of the dead was never, ever explained. Oh, for God's sake, folks, stay away from this movie! This movie sucked the balls, and now I have a serious bone to choose from with my neighbor. It's on 2 for $ 1 rack on Family Video, don't rent it even if someone offers it to you for free!
