This film was terrible. It is not something that people should pay to see. It seems that a Christian group has managed to convert people. I don't understand why it was distributed in cinemas and not on TV. <br /> <br /> It started as an old science fiction movie B in the 1950s, but it changed quickly. About 30 minutes into the film the characters start talking about "God" and "Do you believe in Jesus?" It moves quickly in pure religious territory. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going to a science fiction movie. The film has poor acting; bad shooting angles and it's amateur. <br /> <br /> AVOID IT!
