First of all, I want to clarify a common misunderstanding: it is not unrealistic that Zoey's school goes to give students laptops. In my school, those in grade 7 and above must have an Apple Macbook (this is paid for the admission ticket). To move on. This show is very annoying. It has boring, predictable plots and bad acting. Often in the show he brings "the power of the girl" to a new high, with the girls who beat the boys in everything they seek. But it's not the worst. The worst is that the girls are still portrayed as focusing on their personal appearances and screaming whenever they are happy. Except the only intelligent girl, who is portrayed as a maniac obsessed with ugly boys and science. However, this show is very exciting. I don't know why, but it is. Although, the most recent season has been so terrible, bringing stereotypes, boring storylines and bad acting to extremes that I never thought were achievable, so I'm no longer dependent, thankfully.
