I'm shocked that all the "hated" ratings are six and seven, still above average. For me, this seems like a case of "the emperor has no clothes". I understand that this film was produced on a very low budget in the early 1970s ... However, it has become a struggle to sit and watch. The DVD I saw has some subtitles, but about 75% of the speech is not subtitled. Some are difficult to understand. The Jamaican patois was nice to hear, but after a while you can't "tune in". Some of the shots were nice and the realism was there, although some of the shows weren't great (Jimmy Cliff did a good job). The plot is not bad, but rather predictable. In the movie 1:43, the highlights are Jimmy Cliff (Ivan) singing for a scene, and a couple of shootings and a fight. Probably 15 minutes or so. The rest is pretty boring. By the way, at the beginning of the film, there are some strange cuts with Ivan's character that seem like a montage error, which made me laugh for a while. One reviewer said that this film has been cut so many times, that there are few copies of the original 1972 theatrical version. The ending was quite interesting, showing how media from an early age influences people, it could also be a comment General on the influence of the white man / colonialism on Jamaica. Other main themes are poverty, corruption, church, ambition ... In closing, the soundtrack is certainly worthwhile, the film much less.
