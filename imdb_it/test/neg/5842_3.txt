Oddly boring, absolutely predictable and ultimately simply ridiculous. This summarizes the disaster that is an indecent proposal. Starting from a decent premise, the whole thing comes undone and becomes a complete disaster. Basically the story comes down to the question: "would you let your wife sleep with another man for a million dollars?" Here obviously the answer is yes, because otherwise we wouldn't have a movie. Frankly, we would have been better off if we didn't have a movie. <br /> <br /> The married (and financially upset) couple is played by Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. They go to Las Vegas to get rich. Yes, it will work. However, a billionaire, played by Robert Redford, takes a liking to his wife and makes the million-dollar offer. For a night with his wife he will give them financial security. The consequences of that night are the features of the film. Unfortunately nothing at that time is the least fun. The script is so predictable that you can tell the lines of the characters before them. The performances leave a lot to be desired. Harrelson would be better off sticking to comedies as this attempt at serious acting completely misses the mark. Anxiety is not something that seems able to portray. And it's pretty safe to say that Demi Moore will never have to free up space in her home for any Academy Awards. Why is he a movie star again? In a part that should be full of emotions, it does not transmit any. Only Redford mostly runs away unharmed. He is visibly slimy but sweet and clearly the best actor in the group. But he can't save this movie. Horrible script, bad acting, unbearable rhythm, zero entertainment ... The indecent proposal is very horrible.
