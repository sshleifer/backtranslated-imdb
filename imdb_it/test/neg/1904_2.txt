If you need a clue as to whether Playmaker is decent or not, look at his star, Colin Firth, who in an interview refers to it as "absolute junk - I sincerely hope no one ever sees him" <br /> <br /> The script and the plot are ridiculous, the female lead doesn't convince. The only thing that is worthwhile is Colin Firth, and he seems a little embarrassed about everything. <br /> <br /> Only for Firth Firth fans - the shower scene alone is worth the $ 3.99 you might have to shell out if you find it in a video crop bin like the one I made. <br /> <br /> I am happy for Mr. Firth that his project days like this are over!
