When I first saw the cover of this film, it seemed that my friends and I could have looked forward to a memorable 82 minutes. And it certainly was memorable. Puckoon was the kind of movie where you keep wondering how it was possible. How can it be released on DVD? Of all the movies available in the video rental store that night ... we may have chosen the worst. And yes, they had Tomb Raiders. Absolutely nothing in this film amused me even slightly. Who got the idea that it would be fun if the narrator could change the story with the main character's suggestions? Of all the stupid things you can completely ruin a movie with, this is now my favorite. The character Foggerty, the village idiot, played by Nickolas Grace is the most annoying character since they started making color films. If there's only one movie that you definitely shouldn't see this year, please let it be Puckoon, because I don't think it could be worse. I still wonder if this could have been the worst way I spent my money, and believe me, I've made a lot of lousy purchases over the years.
