Unfortunately, I went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information I had seen on Fandango. Since I'm a fan of science fiction, the notion of a UFO movie interested me. <br /> <br /> Instead, this film quickly turned out to be a Christian evangelical propaganda film. Appropriate for an audience of people with similar mentality but very little Christian, such as exploiting the cinema scene and preaching to an unsuspecting public, especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions. Shame on you! At least the Da Vinci Code has not held back its crazy madness. <br /> <br /> So, this production of B films (and I am kind) will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs, probably shown to the youth groups on Wednesday and Sunday nights. But if you are a principal Christian or a non-Christian you will not feel at ease.
