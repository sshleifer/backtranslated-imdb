The St. Francisville experiment states "this is not a walk in the woods", a direct slap in the face to Blair Witch. Where Blair Witch has proved to be a film that has overloaded the viewer's imagination by simple suggestion, The St. Francisville Experiement dominates the viewer's patience. It must be said, however, that this is intended to be a classic of the field. <br /> <br /> Attention: Spoiler is imminent !! <br /> <br /> I saw this film in a local theater where the "paranormal consultant" of the film, Troy Taylor, talked about the making of the film. If anyone wants to see this movie without knowing the upcoming information, stop reading here. For those of you who can't resist, read about my friends and all that needs to be said. <br /> <br /> Mr. Taylor, a writer of rather non-invincible ghost stories he claims are all true, informed the public of this video projection that The St. Francisville Experiment was not a documentary. Shock! Amazing! As if we didn't know ... He informed us that all the frightening discoveries made by the participants were all staged and prepared by the film's producers. In fact, he informed us that the last 15 minutes had not even been shot in Louisiana, but rather in California. All four participants were real actors (I didn't say well ...). One of the participants is actually a special effects technician on ER. <br /> <br /> What infuriates me about this film is that it proclaims that everything is true. He weakly tries to get past the Blair Witch Project by claiming it's true while Blair Witch was a hoax. The surprising thing is that nobody could have believed this movie for a moment. Filled with terrible acting and hilarious jokes like "surrounded by white light" and "I love ghosts", the St. Francisville experiment belongs to midnight movies around the world, so the crowd can really cackle, whistle, mock and sing "I love ghosts!" <br /> <br /> It's about false advertising. The real stories are not shot with special effects staged that seem as if the troop of boy scouts in the neighborhood had set up a haunted house. From the insect in the sandwich (ooh ... scary ...) to the annoying Madison, from the "seance" which is nothing but the quartet playing on a table by Oujia to the two mice that are under a bed, The St Francisville Experiement is an embarrassing joke of a movie. Lion's Gate would be wise to download this thing to the nearest trash compactor or advertise it as it should be: <br /> <br /> "The St. Francisville experiment: a comical look at how not to make a movie".
