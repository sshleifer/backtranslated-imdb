what the hell was the point of this boring movie? at first it seemed pretty interesting but quickly fell to the surface. it should be based on a true story, but there are no writers left in Hollywood to shout loudly? I've seen these guys in some of the best movies ever made, Defoe can play anything and when I see it's in a movie I have no problem renting it, but I'm starting to wonder. even the great actor is slipping; maybe their hard or just fainting. the dialogue was long and terribly heavy, especially at home with the family. I wonder if the actors thought they would have a success by going here? maybe ... uh..an Oscar?
