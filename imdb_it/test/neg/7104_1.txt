This film does not know what it means: is it making fun of action films in general? Is it satirical? Should it be a black comedy? This is truly one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Lori Petty is annoying. Here, I said what others think. It's bad enough that she's such a terrible actress (Route 666, Bates Motel), but she's not even a mediocre actress. His shrill voice, his strange mannerisms and his poor comic timing punctuate this film from beginning to end, until you just want to put your head in a vise and end the pain. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs. You'll be glad you did.
