This movie is worse than terrible! It took a good plot to tell and transform it into a schizophrenic cinema. Photography is EXTREMELY amateurish. . . it looks like a 5th grade home movie project shot with malfunctioning 8 mm cameras for children. . . the editing seems to have been done by someone who has psychotic flashbacks (while taking drugs and drinking alcohol), with short cut scenes, followed by other unrelated scenes, then chopped up segments of pasted scenes. . . totally useless and free nudity. . . missing scenes. . . daytime scenes that inexplicably turn into night scenes, and then suddenly return to the day. . . obviously no continuity. Tom Skerritt, Wendy Hughes and James Mason have good acting skills, as well as the talents of the "key" supporting cast - (forget the villain and Anderson's women - very amateur acting). This film is a good candidate for a remake, also with Skerritt and Hughes. . . do it only professionally this time
