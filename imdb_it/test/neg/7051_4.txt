This is a case of taking a fairy tale too far. The Enchanted Cottage delivers Dorothy McGuire as a "terrible ugly" spinster and Robert Young as a disfigured pilot. To make it short: Scarface marries Spinster, after which their love transforms them, miraculously (lighting, cosmetics and removing fake scars), into wonderful people ?? a magical change that gives the enchantment of living in a seaside cottage that has been the home of honeymooners for generations. <br /> <br /> If the story had stopped there, fine; it would be a fairy tale with a proverbial message: beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But it moves forward, reaching reality. When Mr and Mrs Scarface greet their audience, it is a painful shock to them that they are still home. See, they just look beautiful to each other ?? a situation where the public is well prepared because all the secondary characters have sermonized that disadvantaged people really need to lower their expectations and find other ways to be happy. You know. Take hobbies The old lady makes woodcuts, for example. Scarface considers the wood collection. <br /> <br /> The original playwright (Arthur Wing Pinero) and the filmmakers do not trust human nature. Their message is: either you are ugly or cute, and no cute person could ever love a bad one. What's worse, ugly people obviously need to imagine their lover so beautiful. Reality simply will not. <br /> <br /> One wonders what Elaine Mason saw every day when she looked at her husband, Stephen Hawking.
