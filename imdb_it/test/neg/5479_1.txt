This may have been the best game ever !! But the creators of the game messed up after 3 murders and the ending !! This is a combination of Prince of Persia, Hit-man, GTA and Age Of Empires II (Saladin). <br /> <br /> Yes, these four games mentioned above are considered one of the greatest games ever made. br /> <br /> Join the four and get this game !! It has all the positive aspects of the four games like acrobatic skills, invisible murders, the open world and HISTORY !! For the first 3 murders, you think this game is the best !! But after the third, things seem to be so repetitive, that you only hope for the game of FINE. <br /> <br /> I played this on a PC and the PC version is horrible with glitches and the stupid side missions are meaningless. <br /> <br /> My advice to everyone This is a good game, but take it for XBOX360 or PS3 as well. I do NOT understand for the PC. <br /> <br /> Finally, this game came from the creators of Prince of Persia. Surely the producer is hot, but the game is not hot and is NOT better than the four games mentioned above !!
