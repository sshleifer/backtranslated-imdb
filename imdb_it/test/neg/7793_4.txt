This seems to be one of Noel Coward's lesser-known films, and it's easy to see why. Taken by face value is not a bad movie, but there is nothing terribly good. Nothing much happens during the film, it is simply the story of the unfortunate affair of Chris and Leonora, and Barbara's reaction to it. The only thing that makes the film interesting is the fact that we already know that it will end badly for one reason or another due to the first scene. Strangely, there are many perfect opportunities in history for the conflict, yet none of them are used. For example, it would have been much more interesting and credible if Barbara had fallen with Leonora, but instead the two remained on good terms throughout the film. The idea that Barbara had been betrayed by her friend was not explored at all - in fact she didn't even seem to feel betrayed by her husband; even encourages him to go on vacation with Leonora. Similarly, Chris's two secretaries in his practice, Susan Birch and Tim Verney, who are also close friends of both Chris and Barbara, are never forced to take sides. In fact, Tim moves away from the conflict by telling Chris that he is very fond of him and Barbara. Despite the strange lack of conflict, the film's biggest flaw is the fact that we don't care if Chris ends up with Leonora or Barbara. The personalities of the two women are however indistinguishable, so we do not know which one is more suitable for being with Chris, and furthermore, Barbara's permissiveness gives the impression that she is barely concerned about the matter anyway. Also, I found the relationship between Chris and Leonora somewhat unconvincing. I can overlook the ridiculously short period of time in which they fall in love with each other because it is so common in films of this era, but even then the relationship seemed superficial. Coward's character was too austere and cynical to be the object of Leonora's affections. It reminds me of the socially inept genius Sir Earnest Pease from the "Very Important Person" movie - I'm sure the two would have behaved well. Chris's coldness and austerity made his love for Leonora seem insincere. I think Coward should have put that aside and given his share to a younger man - as it is, I was constantly wondering what this young beauty saw in a bleak middle-aged man, mostly emotionless and bald. Despite all my criticisms, the film still manages to be interesting - simply not terribly convincing. The fact that none of the characters is particularly well developed gives them an enigmatic nature, which is quite intriguing. The Astonished Heart certainly deserves to be seen, but it is a piece of imperfect cinema.
