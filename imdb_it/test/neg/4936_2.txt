SPOILER PERHAPS !! Well, I saw it at the Cologne film festival and I have to say it's ridiculous ... sorry the author and the writer and ... anything, but it's the worst proof of making a good movie I've ever seen. .. if you have 5000 times the chance to run away from your enemy and you don't do it .... it's getting boring ... there are szen in the movie that give you the impression that they are forgotten for example a szene in front of a camera security, they are asking for help and someone sees it and calls the police ... there is a cut and ... NOTHING ?? !!! ... the killer takes a blow to the head and after 50 seconds he behaves as if nothing had happened ... it's not his zombie movie ... and finally the ending ... the GREAT END that was promised to us ... hmmmm, let's say take a little guy who always wanted to give the world one of the best endings in history so badly that everything goes wrong ... I'm not going to vote "1" because the actress is beautiful ...;)
