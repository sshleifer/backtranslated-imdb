Now I suffered from Parts, The Clonus Horror. <br /> <br /> To have the word horror in the title of this film is an insult to real horror. <br /> <br /> The story was about cloning-central owned by "The man" Clones grow for organ harvesting from clones later for the original humans who need transplants. A clone flees, the government gets angry and kills everyone involved, but the story will somehow leak out anyway. <br /> <br /> It's really shameful how a film with potential is destroyed by amateurs like Fiveson. The only thing he really managed to do was weave the concept of human rights and the very philosophical aspect, what makes a human being human and would it be right to grow clones for organic harvesting? Unfortunately, mediocre actors have been chosen and the plot has left the city, until the end when a pathetic attempt is made to summarize. <br /> <br /> But !! What upset me most was the introduction of new characters with no real relevance to the plot. Despite this, Fiveson feels the need to kill them in a bad explosion that only Sir Coleman Francis would be proud of. <br /> <br /> The setting was interesting. Like Fiveson he thought that pulling out plastic sheets and running water over them would make a river credible outside of me, but I imagine that if you were to compare the setting with the gray oatmeal of a Coleman Francis environment , this movie would win. <br /> <br /> Maybe Coleman changed what the bad movies are for me. 3/10
