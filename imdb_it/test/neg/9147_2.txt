This version of "The Magic Flute" is not only the worst production of Mozart's great work I've ever seen, but it's also the worst video production I've seen of any work. <br /> <br /> big fan of the opera and I have more works on DVD than films. The sets are cheap and made of cheese. Papageno doesn't even have a bird costume. He's just dressed like a boy. The sound is in mono. The color is really bad. It is saturated in orange. Most DVDs of this period have the color restored digitally, but they didn't bother about it. Furthermore, the language was changed to Swedish rather than original German. <br /> <br /> This is not a film version of "The Magic Flute". It's a filmed performance and it's not a good performance and it hasn't been shot very well. You can choose any other DVD available from this work and I guarantee you it will be better than this. My preference is for the version led by James Levine with set by David Hockney.
