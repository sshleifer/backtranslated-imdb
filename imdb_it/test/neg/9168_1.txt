Hell's Angels came out defeated in this movie. Sonny told the director that NO ONE does this to Angli and gets along. His version was that the two guys had to be shot to death, but his suggestion was ignored. They had been forced to appear, much less be "technical advisers" in a smelly bomb of a film like this. Hell's Angles on JAP bikes? Come on, come on! (although in Sonny's autobiography he says "F $ # K Harley Davidson!" and that if they were intelligent, they will ride Hondas. (ST1100) Read his car ... HATE Harley. their Jap motorcycle with the sound of a sewing machine? Not too intimidating, they would have laughed out of town.
