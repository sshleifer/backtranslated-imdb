... which separate good and memorable films from films like this. It's not funny, moving, fun, interesting and sometimes feels a bit sub-human. Headmasters behave as if they were otherworldly, in the worst way, when they should be related to each other and to the public. <br /> <br /> Start conventionally enough. The rich guy gets a new car for the degree, but the principal says he can't have the car until after the ceremony. It still goes to joy, and stops in the restaurant on the wrong side of the tracks for a quick discussion with the local kids. Wise-asses the waitress / girlfriend of the boss yokel. Incredibly, they play the chicken until they accidentally burn the dinner they left three minutes earlier (aren't all the diners five feet from the gas station?). They said they have to pay the price in court, so the only reason to get this 'fish out of the water' to stay in the city is to come up with the scenario that both boys have to watch the restaurant rebuild. Worse still, the rich boy staying with the family of the not-rich child ... in the room above the penthouse. That "room above the penthouse" has saved many people who need a bed. <br /> <br /> The rich child is inexplicably treated well by the girl, who never tells him that he almost killed her. This does not promise anything good, of course, with her boyfriend, and is never fully explained. You don't know why Sam (Leelee Sobieski) falls in love with Kelley (Chris Klein), or why Jasper (Josh Hartnett) allows it. <br /> <br /> Chris Klein is tolerable, Leelee completely intolerable, and Josh doesn't record much of an impression. The character with the most life is the judge who condemns Kelley and Jasper to help rebuild the restaurant. It emits at least one funny phrase, which is more than anyone else. Everyone is so stupid and lacking in a sense of humor that you will feel a little too hard if you even think of smiling while the movie is on. <br /> <br /> The ending is a way to end the piece, not the most original, but at least it's finished. I don't like ruining a movie that a little girl somewhere in the world can really love, but since I'm not one, I have to do it. The best thing I can say about this film is that it is not mean, and although I cannot force it, its innocence and its homemade dialogues, from a beautiful place. 4/10.
