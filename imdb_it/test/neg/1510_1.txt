I got this from usenet, so I wasn't prepared for the heavy religious theme (and I mean EXCEPTIONALLY heavy). Not that I'm one of Satan's disciples or something, but it was very heavy. <br /> <br /> In addition, the brat of acting. It could be because they had to do good guys to make bad kids, but it didn't work. <br /> <br /> There have been some rather interesting directors, so any director style fan might want to check them out, but be ready with the fast forward buttons. <br /> <br /> There have been some editing changes. In particular, a black Mustang (probably a representation of Satan?) Quadra against a white 240Z. The wheels turn, the cameras change and what he knows, that white 240Z is transformed into a white Civic. I gave up soon, so I can't guarantee its moral impact. But I would like to emphasize that this type of film preaches totally to the choir. If the director / writer / producer was trying to bring religion to the unwashed streetracing masses, they got it all wrong. I think I'd rather watch a diaper commercial for adults than listen to a whisper of a bible star that Jesus died for us. Yawn. <br /> <br />
