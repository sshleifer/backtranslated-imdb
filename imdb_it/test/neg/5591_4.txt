This is another one of those movies that I knew I would hate, but in the end it wasn't as bad as you'd expect. <br /> <br /> It has a lot of T & A and even the DVD menu is locked full of female breasts. The first scenes of the film have a lot of sex and nudity and I was beginning to think that there would be no story simply by exploiting nudity to earn money from a popular 8MM prequel. <br /> <br /> As I kept looking there were only more sex and nudity and main characters that I would have cared less about, but then the story started to unfold and I started to see a point about everything, and it was a little better. > <br /> It's about a man whose fianc√© is the daughter of an Ambasador and everyone has a promising future until photos of a menage to a sexual act are shown and the blackmail is in the senders' papers. The man and his boyfriend must now understand who sent the photos and how to close them. <br /> <br /> The film has nothing to do with part 1, it doesn't even have anything to do with 8MM, it's a sex video, so I can see the similarities, however small can be. <br /> <br /> Acting is neither good nor bad. The value of film production is at the center of the road and its pure drama yawns. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed going ahead for the race to the end of the blackmailers' reasons. I was anticipating answers that are much more than I could say for the first one that I consider garbage. This film also has some nice twists that are always welcome. <br /> <br /> It's not great, and it started very slowly, but in the end it's fun. I wasn't on the edge of my seat and I don't want to tell my friends that this is a must see, but hey if you watch a lot of movies and always look for something new, this could keep you entertained for 90 minutes.
