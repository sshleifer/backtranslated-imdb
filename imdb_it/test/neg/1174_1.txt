I wouldn't want anyone to watch this movie "inspired by a true story" and draw conclusions about the real event. Few things that have been right have been obscured by things that were not true. Ed Gein never dragged anyone behind a car, never met anyone in the cemetery and killed them, no evidence returned parts of the body to the cemetery. The things he did were pretty horrible, why try to make things worse? <br /> <br /> This film is among my 10 worst wastes of eyestrain. "In the Light of the Moon" is a much better film on the subject, it's more real and the acting is higher than this.
