I had expectations from this movie because 1. It was a production of Yash raj 2. When the songs were first shown on TV, they seemed catchy 3. The cast of the stars (??!) It was new. Well, I have to tell you that I couldn't sit in this movie. Uday, (with his red lips - what did the make-up think ???) strives to look cool but fails miserably. I won't even start his acting (if you can call it that). The "queen of the décolleté" Tanisha with all her screams and screaming and delirious makes you want to pull your hair out of frustration. I think Uday was slightly more tolerable than her! He seriously needs to take acting lessons from his sister. The story is pathetic ... the same old formula tested. Absolutely no originality. There is nothing worth watching in this film. I wonder why it was created in the first place!
