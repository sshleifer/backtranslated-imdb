This film presents cockroaches as carnivorous assassins. This may have been the first film in which cockroaches were the main killers, though not the first film in which cockroaches are murderers. "Damnation Alley" featured a scene with assassin cockroaches and "Creepshow" had a story that had them. In this I am the star. Not as good as it could have been this doesn't have all those kills in them. I could be wrong on this point, however, because I haven't seen this in quite some time. Cockroaches have become murderers and this strange research lady is in town to study them. Yes, it's rather strange because at one point she has her hand in a box on the murdering cockroaches and she's like "They are biting my hand", and she says it almost in a state of ecstasy. There is also a very large cockroach near the end of this, as in so many insect films. It's not a great film, but it's worth a try on a night when you're bored to death.
