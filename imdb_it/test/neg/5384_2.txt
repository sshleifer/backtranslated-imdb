From an artistic point of view, the film fails to entertain or provide any moral resolution. The plot is difficult to follow, if there is one. Acting is hard to bear. The dialogue is clich√© and clearly written by someone who does not know English. In this film it was worth looking only at the cinematography, even if the picture still shows defects. <br /> <br /> As an Asian-American woman, the film made me angry because it showed how narrow-minded people can be. Politically speaking, putting Asian women in such shameful roles should be banned. Perpetuating the stereotypes of Asian prostitutes is not only negative for the self-esteem of Asian women but also for the country as a whole. I feel for the leading actress who played Maya and the exploitation she must have faced in playing such a role. <br /> <br /> As an American, please avoid this movie. Art should be used to develop our tolerance and mutual respect, not to hold it.
