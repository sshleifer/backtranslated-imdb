anyone who thought they had Iron Eagle sequels must be shot. In this case it was once enough. Iron Eagle was a good movie to watch. Although it's not realistic, it's still fun. Iron Eagle II has a senseless texture and can be used as a cure for insomnia. I didn't even bother looking at Iron Eagle III, but looking at the R rating, I assume it's more violent than the last 2 films. Well, Iron Eagle IV is probably the most inane sequel. Lou Gossett Jr. returns as always delicious "Chappy" Sinclair. Another Jason returns to play the role of Doug Masters (the Canadian Jason Cadieux, who looks like Jason Gedrick of the first Iron Eagle). But wait (a possible spoiler arrives) ..... Wasn't Doug killed on Iron Eagle II? The writers must have been disheartened for a story, so they revived Doug Masters by saying he was a prisoner of the Russians. This film was the cheapest of all Iron Eagle movies. Why do film producers consider it necessary to make sequels of unattractive films? (Ex. Film of the Police Academy). I have always enjoyed Gossett Jr.'s work in these films. He was the only one holding this turkey together. We hope this was the last of the Iron Eagle sequels. let rest in peace.
