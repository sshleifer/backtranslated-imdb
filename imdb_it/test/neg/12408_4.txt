While I sit after watching Wong Kar-wai's 1994 movie Ashes of Time ?? more precisely 2008 re-edit and re-release with the word "Redux" slapped at the end of the title ?? I wonder what went wrong. I wonder why the film didn't work at all. I wonder why the film failed to score important points in my book. In particular, what did you think of the film that dragged him, and made it the worst film of the director of his career? <br /> <br /> Well, it's not too hard to really understand. Let me say that it is really a pity that Kar-wai has gone so abruptly into this hell of mediocrity and poverty on the move, especially considering the fact that in the same year he released Chungking Express, one of his lasting legacies and an absolutely sublime film. So ?? What went wrong? It would be appropriate to consider Ashes of Time as an experimental film. Our director essentially places his inimitable style of film production and places it in a completely different environment, atmosphere and atmosphere; what results is a catastrophic film that is everywhere and just doesn't work. Thus, it would be even wiser to call a failed experiment Ashes of Time. Bold, bold and innovative, but still a failure. <br /> <br /> Let me process. Those who have seen Mr. Kar-wai's films, a Hong Kong film author who has left their mark on the art world since its debut in the late 1980s, will know that there is a dominant aesthetic that binds all of his films together; essentially and frankly, they are all colorful, provocative, lovable, subtly humorous and meaningful evocations of life, love and loss. The same formula is transposed into Ashes of time; however, the regular site of Hong Kong is ridden, and in its place we are located in the setting of ancient China, and the land of legendary martial arts warriors and clans. <br /> <br /> Intertwined in this quasi-adventure / historic caper is the typical love story of Kar-wai, this time involving an elegiac killer who moved into the middle of the desert and is performing contractual murders. However, I have to stop there; the description of the characters is a useless thing to do. Why? Because neither a single character in Ashes of Time nor anything is worth mentioning. What a sloppy cast, and what a waste of talent (the case of Ashes of Time contains almost all of Kar-wai's regular collaborators). <br /> <br /> Not only that, but the film is essentially endlessly incessantly inconceivable in a horrible, almost non-existent narrative structure. One of the main reasons why the detractors of Ashes of Time reproach is because it seems to have no plot, not to mention an appearance or an indication of a. You can surely see what they are getting, even from the first two, three minutes, perhaps less, of the movie. Perhaps it is only the atypical setting of ancient China that is not accustomed and inappropriate for the typical cinematographic style of Kar-wai. I like to think, as unfortunate as it may be, that Mr. Kar-wai has just made a lot of money here. <br /> <br /> One thing that a reviewer can really compliment with Ashes of Time, even if the compliment is cruel isolated, is it another registered trademark? wonderful, colorful and blissful aesthetics. What a joyful color is composed on the screen, which glorious textures are painted for us and which landscapes and breathtaking images are captured for us throughout the film. We can at least take this as a sign that Wong Kar-wai is still there in the heart, and it is only the film that is so atypical, and hides its usually commendable nuance. Even if the graphics are not enough for us to fully fulfill Kar-wai for this disastrous undertaking, are they enough to make the film worthy of note ?? and at least we will not leave the film in a completely and totally irascible state of mind, now that there is something we can think well about. <br /> <br /> The film is essentially a "wuxia art" film, which follows in the style, for example, of the legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. However, one thing sets Kar-wai's film apart from Kurosawa's best, and this is the one in the Japanese director's films that all gels and just works. In Ashes of Time, nothing seems to work. Kar-wai's attempt to create a real wuxia film, not to mention an intellectual and provocative film in general terms, is a useless effort. Kar-wai claims that making Ashes of Time ran out, and he needed time to clear his head. Must have certainly been a strenuous effort for him, given that his efforts are embodied in the film and transferred directly to us ?? I mean, just watching the movie is a grueling effort, and now I need time to clear up my head about this unpleasant cinematic experience.
