As other commentators have commented this was a very bad film (keep it child friendly) FX was low class, should spend $ 1 on a coke. As is typical of these D films, most of the victims die and leave a mystery except for a lucky soul and of course for the initiative. I hope the money is worth for Boxleitner, really a big step down from Babylon 5. It's nice to see what happened to Buck Rogers, but damn for him was low for him too. "It was so ugly and even the older actors might have seemed to think it was bad too. Do not Watch. <br /> <br /> ***** Warning spoiler under **** <br /> <br /> This thing chased everyone they were looking for, yet Boxlietner escaped ... that was pure BS. And the ending? How the hell did the kids end up right there with him?
