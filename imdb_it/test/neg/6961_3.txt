To describe what's seriously wrong with this movie, it must contain some * spoilers * so if you see it and expect to be surprised, don't read this! <br /> <br /> I liked everything about this movie except the plot; and in a thriller like this credible storyline is essential. It is well acted, if a little slow in motion, and the camera works and the Portland scenes are exquisite for an economical and unpretentious picture. The dialogue is very good. <br /> <br /> Mason is a serious young man who works in a telemarketing company that sells insurance. His high school friend, Berkeley, is his employer and takes care of him as a brother despite the fact that Mason is rather mentally ill. Mason has nightmares that send him panting and fumbling for his inhaler. His visions and nightmares suggest he has had serious problems with good-looking women in his past, and the film seems to suggest he could be a serial killer of women. He meets a lively and pretty girl named Amber and squirts her in his notebook. She takes a liking to him and poses for him so he can paint his portrait. He sees more of her and begins to wake up from his withdrawn state, becoming almost halfway. So something goes wrong. Amber finds sketchbooks with drawings of other girls and begins to wonder. She gets scared and walks away. We are wondering if his sudden coldness will push him over the edge. His behavior becomes more irregular. <br /> <br /> This is the configuration for the revelation. To explain how this film is horribly wrong I have to explain what happens. * Another warning for the spoiler! * For this story to work, we believe that Amber, a very outgoing girl, will encounter a seriously emotionally disturbed young man who, at least at the beginning of their friendship, has a free look and can only speak in monosyllables or not speak at all. It is well beyond nerd, it seems on the verge of total catatonia. Yes, I know, girls can be attracted to all kinds of weirdos, but they are usually Charles Manson or punk rockers, guys with a sort of maniacal evil energy. The mason is practically a zombie, there is none at all. Any lively young girl would cross the street to avoid it. It is not credible that this girl is attracted to him. Furthermore there is no credible reason for Berkeley to indulge in the crazy Mason, which is not even credible. <br /> <br /> But wait, there's a revelation. Amber fails to show up at Berkeley's home for the Christmas dinner where Mason is waiting for her and Berkeley, his old friend, has to tell him that Amber and all her other ex-girlfriends, the ones she drew on her many albums of splashes, they don't exist at all! She and all the others are simply the result of her twisted imagination: she dreamed them. <br /> <br /> Well, that explains why a normal pretty Amber would go for Mason, it's just a figment of his imagination. This may have been the final revelation of the film with the correct preparation and setting, but unfortunately it is not. At this point Mason returns to his apartment and finds Amber there ... he is furious, he kills her. But now we are given to understand that Amber was real, not the imaginary girl of Mason. <br /> <br /> Finally, after receiving proof that Amber really exists and that Mason killed her, Berkeley must admit that he is wrong, that he misjudged Mason. This would work if Mason had been half sane from the start, but since the public always suspected him of being totally unbalanced and possibly a killer of women, it came as no surprise to us. We suspected what it had always been and I don't understand why Berkeley can't see it. But then we are once again asking ourselves: if it were real, why would Amber be attracted to the catatonic Mason? <br /> <br /> To make the ending worse, are we ever able to tell if all of Mason's other friends, those in sketchbooks, were real or Amber was the first real one? And if the others were real, did he kill them too? What did he do with the bodies? <br /> <br /> The problem is that the filmmakers didn't really know what to do with the material. Perhaps there could have been a way to straighten it out and tell a story of credible suspense, but this film is not that.
