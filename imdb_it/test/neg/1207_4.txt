I rarely laughed so hard in a movie. Note that I laughed with AT Iron Eagle, not WITH, because this is probably the stupidest film I've ever seen (with the obvious exception of the CyberTracker science fiction monstrosity). You should also remember that this movie is not a comedy! <br /> <br /> Although it overlooks the absurd plot (the idea that a 16-year-old could enter a US Air Force base, steal an F-16, fly to the Middle East and kill about a thousand people without that nobody notices it is incredible), the film is full of ridiculous action scenes that have little or no sense. For example, at various points, Doug Masters uses a machine gun on his plane to shoot a steel beam, a control tower and a tent. All these things explode in a massive fireball. Why? Even the enemy plane explodes in a strange way that resembles a paper airplane blown up with a firework. <br /> <br /> The positive side is that I really enjoyed this movie. Obviously not in the way the producers probably wanted it to be appreciated, but at the same time I laughed and later bought the DVD. It is also enhanced by the impressive presence of David Suchet as the evil terrorist leader (perhaps you will remember him as the mustachioed Belgian detective Poirot?) Overall, therefore, the film is a laugh and a carefree alternative to the more serious fighter film like Top Gun. Although he is just as subtly homoerotic (look at the man hug between Doug and Chappy. Something is happening between them!)
