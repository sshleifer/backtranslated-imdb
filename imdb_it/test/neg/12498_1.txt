Oh dear! This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's incredibly repetitive; every scene seems to consist of people who are killed by gunshots, who run screaming, or are kicked in the face, which quickly becomes very boring. I wouldn't mind if the fight was even good, but it's not; the main character Phillips pushes the various goons with ridiculous ease, and no matter how often he is in full view of the Tracker, he is never hit, although extras and minor characters are shot and blown up all around him . I have rarely seen a cast of worse actors (especially Don Wilson, if you can even call him an "actor") but it's not really surprising, given the dialogue they have to work with (example line: "Computers killed my brother!") . The plot is a sub-par repudiation of the excellent Terminator; special effects are ridiculous. Overall, this film is simply terrible. And why does everything explode?
