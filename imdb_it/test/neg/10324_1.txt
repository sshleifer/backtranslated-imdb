I joined Blockbuster, itchin 'to see some good old fashion action movies. So I looked through the action section until this film caught my attention because the cover had SANDRA BULLOCK in the large bold letter. An action movie with Sandra Bullock in it and is rated R!? YAY! Although I admit that I prefer it in a comedy, but if this is something like "Speed", then I was sold. Unfortunately Sandra is not really in this film, her role is less: "The girl kidnapped by panic" (she is in fifth place on the list of Jeebus shakes actors!) Apparently this was her first film role (and after seeing this film, I understood a lot) Sandra is the only human living in this film, anyone else could even be a Zombie in a B-Horror Flick. This film deceived me by saying that Sandra was the protagonist. . . I fell in love with it as Biff of "Back to the Future" when Marty screams "WHAT IS ... !!!" God, I'd like to see it instead of this. <br /> <br /> Sandra is the only positive side of this film, every time she is in front of the camera it is as if she were picking up the pads and screaming "CLEAR!" to get this movie going, but flat lines, no matter how hard we try. More on Sandra later. . . <br /> <br /> The film is boring. Very boring. Think of the most boring moment in your life, so imagine living that moment for 110 minutes (for me, it's this movie). This film, although somehow makes the effects of the time of Gun Fights and Bullet boring, so boring that the tranquilizers of the elephants are shameful. And the idea of ​​Bullet Time in this film is a close-up of a slow-motion AK that teases you while the hoods that come out represent every second of your life as it slowly flows away. And I knew I was watching a bad movie because I found myself advancing quickly "THROUGH-THE-ACTION!" The plot? . . . was there a plot? Music? . . . even in the 80s the muck standards are negative, but at least it's the only thing that kept me awake. To act? Sandra Bullock was good and. . . ummm. . . to move on. Okay since it is classified R? No, unless R is for Ridicules-snooze-fest. <br /> <br /> And it's really a cliché of the 80s when a movie opens with a top view of a city (rock guitar licking or power ballet) and ends with a gun fighting in a gloomy factory complete with steel gangways and assorted tubes. Both of these films satisfy. At least this film states what it was from where it was useless since Sandra's hair screamed "1980s !!!!" And a movie gets really crazy when you watch a stripper kill a nerd in the bathroom and stick her body into a box, which you respond sadly by saying, "this is probably the most action the poor sap has ever had." Another moment of Hammy is at the beginning when a Agent-Secret closes a crowd of people and apparently this film thinks that people jump in the air and fall to the ground when they die. The whole required scene was Mario's death ditty or perhaps the Contra sound effects but Nintendo may have sued. <br /> <br /> And it's sad when the main hero of this movie rips off the other BETTER movie icons. Before the big gun scene, the hero Da is in a ring ('Rocky' anyone?), Showing off a leather fedora (not 'Indiana Jones') with a threatening spotlight behind him (Terminator the 2nd before owning the T-1000 What is really REALLY sad is that people on Youtube or Dailymotion can film videos of better quality (with a disgusting webcam no less), then this movie, I'm serious, most of Rant's videos recorded with shoddy audio and blurry images are more fun than this movie, I can't even call this movie for his name since it's the name itself that brings back horrible memories of this cruel and unusual punishment (a violent violation of human rights!) bright spot in this dark abyss is Sandra's career that started to take off thanks to this movie. But oh Sandra ... why did you have to be in such a nightmare? The salary was better was worth it. with a small story about Sandra's past, seen as she is the only one in this film that ends up being a name to keep at home. Which explains why this film uses its name as a bait for unsuspecting cinephiles, Crafty Little Critter. <br /> <br /> I don't have much experience with bad movies but I know BAD when I see it. I could recover from 'Mazes and Monsters' with a good old campy Bruce Willis Comedy. But not even Bruce could cheer me up after this movie. I have yet to see any Ed Wood or Uwe Boll, but I think I'm ready for them now. Because I can't even imagine a film worse than it was then. . . "GAG". . . "Hangmen". . .
