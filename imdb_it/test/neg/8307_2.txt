What a terrible movie! The acting in this film is about the quality of a high school work or a pornographic film based on history. This is not pornography in this movie, but surely there is a lot of free nudity! This is one of the only saving qualities of the film, one of the few things that saved her from receiving a star rating. Also there are a million policemen who die in this movie. Hardly offensive, even if the violence is so unrealistic that we can only laugh. But the breasts jump out and are exposed in the most surprising and fun moments, if you like really bad movies, take a look at it. This is a story about Bonnie and Clyde, in which a mother and her two daughters are out for revenge. This movie also features a sex scene with two of the oldest people I've ever seen walking around naked!
