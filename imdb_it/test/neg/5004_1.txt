This film was a total cheese. It stank. The only good thing was acting. Apart from that, nothing worthy of note. <br /> <br /> Big Spoilers coming! Don't read any more if you haven't seen it! <br /> <br /> This film focuses on a family whose happy and wonderful lives have been destroyed because of their youngest child and later when they discover their oldest child they were harassed by their nursery providers. Even if they are called liars in court and the defense lawyer is a real mess, the jury judges them guilty and condemns them. <br /> <br /> In the end, all I can say to the director is, "Next time I want to make a film like this, do it differently."
