11:11 a.k.a. Hell's Gate (2004) is another bad horror film that tries too hard to be something it is not. A girl has an imaginary playmate. One day, while you are in the fields playing with his friends, a couple of fugitives visit his parents and kill them for no apparent reason. The girl runs away and hides from the bad guys. Years later, the girl grows into a woman with problems. The losers of his school (who seem repressed homosexuals) flaunt their manhood in front of her when she rejects one of them. Girls hate her and life in general is miserable for her. A secret from his past returns to visit it. Who or what is it? Why does everyone hate her? What is your Guardian's problem with you? To find out you will need to see Hell's Gate. <br /> <br /> The new title makes absolutely no sense. I don't know why people are given money to make such bad films. This movie is not even good enough to tease. It is a mess that causes confusion that confuses anyone who tries to make sense of all this. It's not worth your time. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
