This takes place in the 1920s in Harlem. A black-owned nightclub has to do with corrupt gangsters and policemen. <br /> <br /> Terrible vanity project for Eddie Murphy. Try to mix comedy and drama and fail in both. Comedy is simply not fun and drama is boring and misinterpreted. You think a movie with three legends of comedy - Eddie Murphy, Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor - would be great but it isn't. There is a continuous oath and the OPENING scene has a young boy who shoots a man to death (this is shown as OK). We also have the beautiful Della Reese degraded in the role of a lady. One of the highlights of the "comedian" has a long, unpleasant and terribly vicious struggle between her and Murphy. A boring, offensive and stupid disaster. It's not the worst Murphy movie but rather close. A 1 all the way.
