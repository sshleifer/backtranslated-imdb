I'm a big fan of British films in general, but especially of gangster movies. Unfortunately this film was incredibly bad. I think it's pretty depressing that this movie gets good customer reviews. The idea that this film is gritty and realistic is ridiculous. I have read and heard a lot about real life events shown in this film and almost all have been glorified with the utmost violence etc. The only far truthful life event in the whole film was the Range Rover murders in which some exaggerated bouncers were canceled for messing with people they couldn't handle. This film is a shame for British cinema! It has no decent plot and acting and is based only on being violent (gritty and realistic as some like it). The kind of people who made this film should not be allowed close to a budget or a camera, just like the kind of people this movie talks about should not be given the opportunity to tell this pathetic violent story without consequences.
