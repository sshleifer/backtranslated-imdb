I just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other fierce comments, but I found some high marks. <br /> <br /> WHAT ??? This was probably the worst Asian horror movie I saw. <br /> <br /> * spoiler * There have been so many fundamental problems with the story. A lot of Asian horror has the twist of the spirits it tries to help but it just seems scary (with notable exceptions: ringu and Ju-on). This is the case here except that they are not scary. A rather Asian woman who looks a little pale is not at all scary. The character of the "monk" at the top explains everything as a perfectly natural life cycle; nothing scary there either. But the woman just doesn't understand, she'd rather kill herself and her baby, so let this poor ghost reincarnate. My friend and I were laughing when she jumped off the building twice and the ghost waits until after the second time to tell her why he followed her. That information would have been nice to know before starting to jump, but whatever. <br /> <br /> * Having said that, I liked a couple of parts in between. First she rides a taxi with a ghost (do ghosts drive taxis?) Which has a lot of extra hair that is inexplicably disturbing. Immediately afterwards at the bus stop, well, you have to see it because it's pretty messy. <br /> <br /> All in all this film is a total bomb, I gave an extra point just for those two scenes above. This is a very bad quality Asian horror that manages to make ghosts flying in the female uterus almost in beauty as they try to scare you with the same images.
