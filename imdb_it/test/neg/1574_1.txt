this "thriller" attempt would have no substance! Some might say that this film "has it all?" Autism, arson, robbery, lost love, a lot of money, cut throats, murders, blood, a crooked nose revolver, moaning teeth, boobs (various definitions can be used), big flashlights, tribal people, a brother duo that tries to portray "stupid and more stupid", white wolves, fight scenes that look like "happy slaps", snowmobiles, a large tracked vehicle and a motel under renovation? All this, with an "Enyanesque" melody towards the end ... <br /> <br /> Maybe my assessment is a bit harsh, but a vision will certainly be enough for the healthy cinemaphile with nothing else to do. <br /> <br /> Yeowza!
