Bad script? Check. Terrible effects? Check. Horrible actors? Check. Direction lame? Check. <br /> <br /> After watching the DVD box in great video and being a fan of the horror genre, I put my $ 4.28 on the line and rented this "movie". My girlfriend was out of town and I was bored so on a Tuesday night I decided that this would be a perfect time for me to watch, what seemed to be (based on the cover of the box) a horror movie. What I got was the worst movie ever made. Until that moment I had always declared "Slumber Party Massacre 3" the worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> If you're the guy who wants to see a movie because you've heard how bad it is, this is for you. If you don't want to lose $ 4.00 and an irreplaceable 80 minutes of your life, avoid this garbage. <br /> <br /> An added note: I noticed some of the "actors" coming here and posting comments on the bulletin board. How can you brag about being in this movie? You were all horrible. I mean really bad. If there were an American idol for actors, it would be ridiculous in the first episodes. <br /> <br /> Peace. <br /> <br /> Sutter Cain
