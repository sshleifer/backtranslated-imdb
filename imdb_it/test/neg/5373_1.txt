For a while I was fond of shows like Ghost Hunters and Destination Truth and stuff like that, although I thought they were full of shit I found them interesting and fun, and that's why we watch entertainment TV. It's fun to turn off your brain and believe that every shadow captured by the camera is not just a shadow, but a tormented prisoner spirit of a kindergarten detainee or something, as long as you can return to the real world later. <br /> <br /> Having said this, the enjoyment of the paranormal state requires more than simply turning off the brain, requires taking lead regularly in massive doses during one's childhood, then undergoing repeated head trauma, then absorbing the annoying paint during 'adolescence. So you have to stand tall / drunk and watch. <br /> <br /> Paranormal State is beyond pseudoscience (which I can appreciate with some degree of critical thinking) that you will find on Ghost Hunters (which I still find to be a reasonably interesting and entertaining program), it's pseudo ... all. <br /> <br /> The show follows the adventures of a group of students from Penn State University (not to be confused with the University of Pennsylvania) led by Ryan Buell as they take upon themselves the exorcism of demons and spirits using ceremonies of any religion seems more dramatic at that time (ranging from Catholic exorcisms performed by university students to Wiccan spells cast by socially embarrassing goths, to purification rituals of Native Americans. credit, these are performed by Native Americans). If you believe in Wicca or you are a Catholic or a follower of a tradition of Native American religions, I think you would like their purification rituals performed by someone who ... is not a maladjusted university student with some free time. I don't remember the scene of the exorcist in which the priests raised their hands and said "it's useless! Call a club after the state college school, that's too much for us, they probably read the Wikipedia article on exorcisms." The show is frankly insulting to the viewer's intelligence. The opening title sequence of the show saw Ryan talk about PRS (the Paranormal Research Society), saying that when he arrived at Penn State (note that you don't see shows where the host says the same thing, but instead of Penn State says "When I arrived at MIT" or "After graduating in theoretical physics ..." he found other people with the same interest in the paranormal. He says that sometimes they are "warriors". I remember pretending to be a warrior and fighting ghosts. I was six years old. Then Ryan, emotionless, brings out the flaming and nasty Chip Coffey, who pretends to go into a trance and be possessed by curses against the cast. Awesome. I thought people had learned a little of how ridiculous the idea of ​​medium and medium is after "Crossing Over" went on the air. The show takes itself too seriously, as this small group of society's misfits pretends to fight against an ancient and cosmic evil. The production values ​​are low, the stories are boring and, unlike the Ghost Hunters, who sometimes catch something anomalous (though probably explainable, but still interesting) about their equipment, PS requires you to believe that the noises and squeaks who feel they are proof of demons, ghouls and perhaps leprechauns. The only thing that is frightening about this show is that there are people out there who take it seriously. The only paranormal thing about it is that the people on it are able to do every episode while keeping a straight face. <br /> <br /> Call me exhausted, but I feel like the great mysteries of the universe and the afterlife are too good to be solved in a half-hour television program conducted by a journalist in a public school. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I highly recommend everyone to see this show at least once, if for no other reason than pure entertainment derived from watching a really terrible movie or TV show. Or you can make a game of drinking out of it. I think the latter would be preferable.
