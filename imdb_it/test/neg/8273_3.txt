I couldn't help laughing when I saw what the public could do to think it was e-mail in 1996. Apparently the e-mail is an interactive discussion (similar to a chat) with a limping vocal synthesis that reads every comment out loud. And some of the other "technological" aspects are also fun and entertaining. I swear on the "high tech" communication center that actually has some Commodore 64 monitors. Almost like watching the movie Hackers nowadays, I guess. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that for most of the film the lead actress has the illusion of being disabled, the final part of the film has an inexplicable use of her legs that somehow I can't ignore . I mean, why include something so stupid? <br /> <br /> However, to summarize: the plot is quite predictable, the acting bad, the killer quite likely. But it can be fun in a type of Mystery Science Theater 3000, I think.
