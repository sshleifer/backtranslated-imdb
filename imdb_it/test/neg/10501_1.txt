So this is the worst movie you'll probably see. It's up there with "Crossbones" and "Southern Comfort", but if you're a fan of bad cinema like me, this atrocity of a movie will be the most fun you've had in years. WHY does the camera make kung fu noises from the old school when it zooms in? WHY does that boy randomly put a commemorative plaque in his bag? And who is he anyway? WHY do vampires shoot lightning after death? What is this? Highlander? Dracula McCloud? Who cares! Laugh at it This film has no continuity, no plot, nothing at all, really. Ron Hall's range of emotions is always turned off. He looks happy when he should be sad, angry when he should be confused. The rest of the cast failed to get out of a paper bag. Special effects ("Shortbus" kinda special) are randomly positioned and never needed. Most of the scenes are lit by a table lamp, if they are lit. Mel Novak has the AUDACITY to look out of the camera for his line, and it's not even modified. They continue to film. In fact, half of this film is not even on the film. It's 1/2 movie, 1/2 Sony hand-cam. For most of the film, they seem to have left their microphone boom at home. This film has not only a few holes in the plot, it is a minefield of confusion and mental pain! But OH I love it! Thank you Ron Hall, for this cinematic abomination. I went out and bought it, because it's damn funny. ($ 1.99 on Amazon, and I was in a hurry delivered!) <br /> <br /> "I have weapons! I have weapons! I have ARMS!"
