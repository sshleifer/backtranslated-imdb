I can not see the point. It is ponderous. Animated people are creepy (look at the eerie valley). The scenes go on and on and on for very little purpose. The plot is skeletal and must be completed with lots of dramatic and screaming roller coaster rides, as if Disney or Spielberg were planning a trip to a movie-based amusement park. Most of the characters are annoying and unpredictable. Some of them continue to present themselves as having something important to add to a climate scene. They don't. They simply vanish without any lasting impact. Someone summarized as "if you don't believe in Santa Claus, you will be abducted on a train on Christmas Eve." This basically sums it up.
