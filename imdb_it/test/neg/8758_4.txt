Oh, the horror! I've seen a lot of gore movies in my day, but this makes me gag rather than repulsion. This is definitely a crazy movie and has a very low budget, I might add, but if you can look past the cheap audio, the horrible dialogues, the ugly girls, the obviously cheetah scenes and the film's cheek, then you might find some of this movie to be quite funny. The story is about a copy of a killer cat that goes around killing every "fifth day, fifth month, fifth year" (wow, how original), and it's up to two detectives (one of whom gave a great effort in an attempt to make good dialogue good) to stop the bloody fury of the murderer. Killing scenes (which are made with a plastic toy knife) are quite brutal (which is a good thing), but very annoying due to the constant repetition of a obviously recorded scream (which is very ear piercing). As for the blood, there is plenty of it but it seems very false; especially the blood - friend, come on, purple blood? But if you're a fan of video gores, like me, then you'll find something in this video to love like I did (the crap detective ... it's the best thing for this movie). In addition to this, all you will find is a pile of mindless nudity (which is also a good thing, but too bad the girls are OOOGLY) and a very idiotic necrophilic hippy serial killer. Sorry, but this sucks.
