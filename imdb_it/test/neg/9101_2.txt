This film strives a lot to be an "action" movie, but fails miserably. <br /> <br /> Steve Guttenberg plays the head of an elite anti-terrorist team that fails (?) in an attempt to keep a mysterious group from stealing a deadly nervous agent. <br /> <br /> The story ... the acting ... the special effects ... ALL THE FLAT FALL !!! <br /> <br /> Definitely MUST AVOID! !!!
