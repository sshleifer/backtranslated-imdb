You know that the movie could have been much better when the animal - in this case a little dog - is the best actor on the screen! The acting in this film is so ugly, so amateurish, by the dog that he was embarrassed to look at it. He ("Rusty", our Golden Retreiver) could have done a better job than the people in here. <br /> <br /> Now it's almost a trivial story: the child finds the animal, the pet is not liked or sought after by one of the parents but the "pet" ends up saving one of the children and is now a hero and an official member of the family. Does it sound familiar? <br /> <br /> I remember that this film was a great success, but I never managed to see it until the mid-90s on VHS. I was shocked at how bad it was. Why so much fuss about a movie? Perhaps because at the beginning of the 70s there was so much disgust that a good family film stood out in the crowd? Possibly. In the decade of the 70s there was not a lot of healthy fun, and a lot of people are crazy about animal stories. Who could resist this cute little dog? Not me. But the film I can resist: it's a Grade B plot with horrible acting. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for lovers of small animals and I mean "lovers" because even the average owner of a pet falls asleep trying to watch this movie this day.
