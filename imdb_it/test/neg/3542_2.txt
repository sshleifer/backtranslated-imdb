This is horrible even for a TV movie. I can't believe it took three people to write this movie. I am not familiar with the novel on which this film was based, but it must be better than this. I'd rather watch a "Full House" marathon than this stupid movie. I gave 2 out of 10 stars just because it was made better by advertisements.
