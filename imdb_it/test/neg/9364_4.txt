The film of tonight's film course was The Legend of the Suram Fortress and during its 87 minutes of running it managed to quickly enter my five most difficult films of all time. It's hard to watch; movies so different from anything you're seeing something completely alien. A brief synopsis would be: a group of Georgians is trying to build a fortress to defend themselves from invaders, but whenever they are about to give the final touch, for readily apparent reasons, it collapses. So they go to see a fortune teller who informs them that if they want the fortress to remain standing, they need to find a young man, a blue-eyed blond boy to be buried in one of the walls during the construction and his presence will ensure that construction work will be completed smoothly. And indeed, in those moments of closure, he is happy to be smeared with cement and eggs, giggling while he is buried alive, with only his mother crying. <br /> <br /> It is actually a fairly simple story. But the director, Sergo Paradjanov, who works in Soviet Georgia in 1984, not too long after leaving a sentence of fifteen years in prison, does not follow any of the rules for making films we are used to. There are very few close-ups. Very often the action we have to follow is hidden in the lower left corner of a horizontal shot, usually easy to miss. There are very few close-ups and sometimes it is difficult to tell who is doing what to whom and why. Occasionally the film develops on digressions that have no relevance to the main plot and generally serve to confuse the viewer. The music is completely crazy, with found sounds, screen instruments and church organ dropped at random. Sometimes, when nothing seems to be happening, someone will enter a jig, almost playing until the next scene arrives. But behind it all there is an obvious cinematic voice, so you are forced to try to understand the message whatever it is. One of those times when your eyes are glued to the screen simply because you can't believe what you're seeing.
