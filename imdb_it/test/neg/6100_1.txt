This short subject is a remake of the 1942 Three Stooges movie "What's the Matador?", On the children's journey to Mexico and their bullfighting adventures. Although the original short film was made during the Stooges peak period, it is not memorable and I think it is one of the most mediocre films with Curly Howard. <br /> <br /> Having established this, I believe "Sappy Bullfighters" is pathetically terrible, like all the other short films with Joe Besser. Moe and Larry should never have hired Besser, because his whining, almost feminine, character was completely wrong with the Stooges' violent comedy. His 16 films with Moe and Larry marked the nadir for the team, and those shorts are embarrassing to watch. This short was published in 1959 and was the swan song of the team with Columbia. Maybe Besser was a good guy, but everyone was wrong as the third stooge. <br /> <br /> I will not see any more Besser short films, because I would always give the same decidedly negative review. Do yourself a big favor and don't watch it. Instead, try capturing "In the Sweet Pie and Pie" or "Hoi Polloi".
