This movie had a couple of fun parts, but for the most part, it made me want to go ahead and change DVD's and watch "Malibu's" instead, which I had in my collection. At least I want to know that something fun was happening and it gave me something to look forward to. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this very low budget movie. And I don't judge a film by its budget. It simply lacked originality and was too predictable. I wouldn't want to rent or even watch this movie again, and I'm usually a film recurrent. The actors were forgettable. The story was half thought, and left me with an insatiable desire to make me laugh. I ended up with Jamie Kennedy's White Boy Gone Gangsta to make me scratch the comedy's itch.
