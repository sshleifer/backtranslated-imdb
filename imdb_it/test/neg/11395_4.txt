After watching this movie, I thought to myself, they really overlooked the life of Errol Flynn! The film is really beautiful for the eyes. They really had the atmosphere of the 30s and 40s of Hollywood in the right way. The costumes were fantastic. All the women looked fascinating and all the men were beautiful and cool. <br /> <br /> Is it a serious film about the life of Errol Flynn? Nah! It's a funny movie based on all the scandalous things you've done in your life. <br /> <br /> Why am I criticizing this film? This is a film that had many promises but failed to deliver. Duncan Reagher was really as good as Errol Flynn. It wasn't as good as the original, but it made you believe that Flynn was not just a handsome playboy who didn't take himself seriously, but like a man who, though gifted, was rather disturbed and unhappy. Flynn's love life was a disaster, considering he had had so many failed marriages. He also lost many good friends during his life. He also suffered from unrequited love for the elegant Olivia DeHavilland. The last scene of the film showed that Errol asked Olivia to stay with him and instead leaves. He is shown in his tuxedo, looks really empty and walks slowly around the pool while pouring his drink in the pool. It was a sad way to finish the film, but a bit of adaptation, because by now everyone knows that in the end he fell apart from his alcoholism and his dissipated lifestyle. <br /> <br /> This film could have had a lot more depth, it could have been better written well. They certainly showed all the scandals but they never showed the human center of Errol Flynn. Surprisingly, Duncan Reagher was able to put some emotional depth into the Errol Flynn character even though the film's script didn't really put us in depth. <br /> <br /> I will probably never see this movie again, but I can still remember having seen this movie, "Damn, this could have been a lot more .....!" I give this film a D +.
