In this film, there is a loose storyline of a man (Bardem) who wants to get funding for his construction company, and marries a woman who doesn't love (Maria de Medieros with wide eyes) in the process. He maintains his passionate relationship with his first and true love, and eventually gets caught up in his own romantic network. He never gives up his juggling act until the three main characters meet face to face. The film is boring, with a lot of free sex (well, both girls are really good), all the reactions in the film are absurd, inconsistent and, of course, too stupid. None of the characters is credible, which makes the movie a little annoying. However, acting is surprisingly good for a bad film so direct, which makes it a little interesting, but if you can, watch another movie please!
