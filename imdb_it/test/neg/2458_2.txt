What came to me after seeing this film was a guilty conscience. The film itself has a rather intriguing and premeditated plot, but unfortunately it is a film that cannot be watched without being bombarded by pornography. If you're going to see this and have a moral problem with the degradation of the marital act for the pleasure of viewing an audience, then you're making a big mistake. This is not the kind of movie with the sex token scene that you can jump on your DVD player. At the beginning of the film, Baldwin's character is the video that records his sexual exploits without the knowledge of his partner. This tape and others like it continue to appear throughout the film at unpredictable moments. It seems that the film is trying to make a statement on the dignity of women. Ironically, they turned many women into prostitutes. I gave a 2 instead of a 1 because they had better managed Baldwin's promiscuity, it would have been an interesting film.
