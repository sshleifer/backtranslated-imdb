This begins in Pennsylvania in 1913. A group of kids is killed in the explosion of a mine that was blown up by the mine owner. Cut to 2006. The recently widowed Karen (Lori Heuring), teenage daughter Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and little Emma (Chloe Moretz) move to a remote house located near this mine. What they don't know is that the ghosts of the kids infest the woods and kill anyone who turns in the dark. <br /> <br /> Slow and boring horror film. The premise is obvious and has already been made to death. Furthermore there are huge gaps in the logic of history. It is never clarified why these kids kill anyone or why they eat the bodies later (Yes - it is shown). Already dead - why do they need food? And why didn't they have the main villain in the story much earlier? He was around the area. Why choose this time to attack it? Even the characters are no less funny. Sarah meets the worst. It has few savings thanks. The location is beautiful and mysterious at the same time, some of the murders were VERY bloody and brutal and the children themselves seemed to be spectrally silent walking through the woods at night. But all in all, I was bored and struggled to stay awake. You can skip this.
