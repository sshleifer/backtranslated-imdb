A CBS radio program entitled "We the People" helps find an American home for Vienna refugee Charles Coburn (named Karl Braun), a skilled surgeon and dealer. She arrives with her beautiful daughter Sigrid Gurie (like Leni), who is "studying" to become a nurse. Moved to a small and dusty Midwestern village, they are greeted at the station by burly John Wayne (like John Phillips) and his uncle Spencer Charters (like "Nunk" Atterbury), a veterinarian. Mrs Gurie is unhappy in the basin and wants to leave. Immediately. But the prospect of friendship with Mr. Wayne could change his mind ... <br /> <br /> God answers the numerous prayers of the citizens for the rain, but it may not be enough to save the agricultural city. The whole city is advised to move to Oregon. Wayne wants to stay and hard outside. Coburn receives an invitation to work in a high-level clinic. And, Gurie discovers that his allegedly dead boyfriend will come to claim her as his wife. He feels obliged to accept; but, he has a dark secret ... This movie does not flatter Wayne, who seems to have come out of his element. Being paired with Gurie, promoted as another Garbo, does not help. They have a cute scene in Wayne's car ("Jalopy, an Italian car"). <br /> <br /> **** Three Faces West (7/3/40) Bernard Vorhaus ~ John Wayne, Sigrid Gurie, Charles Coburn, Spencer Charters
