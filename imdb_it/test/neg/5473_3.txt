Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing joined in a horror film; always seems like a terrific plan. Two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation, who previously had already acted together in formidable genre speeches such as "The Flesh and the Fiends" and "From Beyond the Grave", alongside in a satanic exploitation film in the middle of the years 70. How can this go wrong? Well, unfortunately, he can. To my great regret, "Land of the Minotaur" cannot even be called mediocre, and despite the cast, the exotic setting, the catchy title and the potentially grandiose premise. In a remote area of ​​Greece, particularly near an archaeological site, many tourists disappear because Baron Peter Cushing and his docile followers continue to feed them to a statue of the Minotaur that spits fire. Cushing, who never seemed bored and uninterested in any role he played in the past, owns a gigantic medieval castle and apparently in Greek means you also have complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caves. This is obviously quite useful if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists. When even three of his young friends mysteriously disappear in the same area, Father Roch - the priest of a couple of cities before - decides to investigate. "The land of the Minotaur" is a horrendous boring and extremely slow effort that never undertakes great attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and does not bother to elaborate all the potentially fascinating elements and the details of pagan banalities. The titular Minotaur, for example, is an intriguing creature from Greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person, but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens the meaning. Instead, the film focuses on boring and overly talkative sequences and inappropriate loud music altered by experimental noises. The only reason why even considering giving this film a huge disappointment is due to Donald Pleasance. His portrait of a rough, overbearing and old-fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is as powerful and reliable as ever.
