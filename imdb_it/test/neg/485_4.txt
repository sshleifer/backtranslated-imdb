This is better than Cronenberg's early horror films, but nothing but your fundamental and true story. The videogame theme has also been said before. Nothing original remains except the strange atmosphere of Cronenberg (which is not so strong here) with funny sexual references and the dark score of Shore. History never attracts your attention. Simply slides forward event after event with boring rhythm. Evaluation 4/10.
