Anyone who complains that Peter Jackson makes films too long should participate in this CBS "event". There are about 45 minutes of history filled with 2 hours of useless subplots, with bland theatrical film clich√©s. Bad science is a staple for catastrophic bad weather films, so I'm not complaining about this. Silly science can be fun to watch if it is performed in a fun way. What kills this film is that there are 10 subplots ... all things that could be eliminated without destroying what should be the central plot. The character that is fun to watch in category 6 is Tornado Tommy, despite being a very annoying stereotype. <br /> <br /> Note that I didn't even bother to comment on the special effects. Their quality should not be surprising. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
