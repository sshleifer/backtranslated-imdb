As a major Canadian historian, my first thing to say: HISTORICAL FACTS ARE NOT ACCURATE! How can a manufacturer do it? The deportation of Acadic did not happen in 1759 when we see Franklin in London, but in 1755! How can you pass this into the movie? Even the Londo scenes were useless. Then for the story of anyone who has read "Les Anciens Canadians", you have the plot right there. It is the story of La Coriveau, that "witch". Also add a love story and a tragic relationship between mother and daughter. Of course, it brought tears to my eyes. But it is so. Then there is the fact that it is apparently installed in Quebec City, but it is mostly shot at the Forteresse de Louisbourg. Sure, it's a historic site and it's accurate at the moment, but it was obvious that the scenes weren't all set in Quebec City. Overall, if you're looking for a documentary on New France, go get Candad: A People's History, a real documentary on the history of Canda and New France. If you want a love story that will bring you tears, a story set in a wonderful forest, look at New France.
