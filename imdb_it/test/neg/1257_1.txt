An insult to poker and cinema, this film manages to make the figure more dynamic, brilliant and fascinating in the history of poker in a nuisance. Still a funny movie to make jokes about, from the clich√©s of the lame gangster film of the first half to the incomprehensible nonsense of that second hour. Hilarious, Stu Ungar wins all three of his World Series titles without playing a single hand on the screen. Your notorious abuse of dealers? 1 scene. His cocaine habit? 1 scene. His incredible memory? 0 scenes. They couldn't even get real poker players. What did they cover? A lot of shots from the top of a house in the suburbs. Oh, and a montage of Stu who wakes up every day and buys meat that doesn't get anywhere near a sense. Why do I care so much about this little summer camp in Sopranos trying to cash in on the poker craze? Because I think there's still a nice film about Stu Ungar waiting for someone to do it right.
