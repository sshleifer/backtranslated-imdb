Among the many awards here for this production, there was an individual whose comments asked if he / she was the only one (who wasn't so fascinated by it) - that is, giving this movie 3 stars. However, the comment continued to indicate a general appreciation of the story and other productions of the same. Well, this person is not the "only", who did not like this production (include me!) But I also separate from him / her there. If you put a gun to my head and ask me to make a choice between the fact that you shot me or looked at this movie again, I would certainly watch it - but I'd probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it. I'd much rather be locked up in isolation, or having to look at dry painting on a wall, though. Also, I wouldn't want to see this story again, anytime, anywhere, or in an alternative presentation. Sometimes you feel like comedian George Gobel's "brown pair of shoes when the rest of the world is a tuxedo," and that's one of those for me. I liked Angela Lansbury in a favorite movie of mine, "Long Hot Summer ", and although I wasn't a big fan of the show, I had fun with" Murder, She Wrote. "But HERE - not only did I not care about the story or other aspects, but I found that Angela screamed, screamed, sang and every another thing about her exaggerated performance, perhaps the MOST PRETTY presence in any movie (or presentation in other media) I've ever seen It was like an endless continuation of Audrey Hepburn's ridiculously "bold" Cockney to Rex Harrison - in the first parts of "My Fair Lady". But that was an accident to the plot, presented for light, comic effect and (mercifully) short.Unmercifully, this was anything but brief, and to me it seemed like it went on for about 10 hours (the explanation of the "relativity" of a layman of Einstein at work). If I had not been with friends, with the need to stay, My vision would have been brief. But I laughed at the "Seinfeld" episode in which Elaine pisses everyone off because she tells them how much she didn't like "The English Patient". My friends somehow looked at me the same way when I interrupted their waxing for this movie. Give me noisily dragging nails on a blackboard at any time.
