about 5 minutes from the movie, the first fight scene I was watching could only help reduce the lack of tension in the scene that the cameras that ran back and forth really showed that he had no idea what he was doing, but actually the soundtrack shows that the best is not a low budget film and you will not get the best 40 songs, but at least you will get music that accompanies the scene that is not really so hard, well if you saw it I would be happy to inform you. the script was written so badly now it would surprise me a little about the director who wrote this piece of beep, I will give the person a 10/10 and this was for the DVD cover because if I actually saw "before watching this" in a shop and it was like 10 15 dollars that I would have bought, because if you look at the title page this is actually well done you turn over on the back and see that it has actually won prizes. this is a very misleading thing because even in a small film festival I would never have believed in my life that this would have won all I can say is "wow if this were the best I wouldn't want to know what shit in the film festival was like" /> <br /> films that are so bad have only good use and this is for an aspiring director to use as inspirational films like this are better tools than good movies, because with good movies that you know almost immediately, c 'It's a good chance that you don't make such a beautiful film, but if you use a film like this you can look at all the things that the director or writer did wrong, so you won't make the same mistakes, and you have the added bonus of watching this movie and tell if a piece of beep like this can be done, then there is hope of someone out there
