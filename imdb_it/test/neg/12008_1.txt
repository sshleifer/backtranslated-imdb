What a horrible movie. Full of clich√©s, perplexed scenes, bad acting and atrocious script. It is hard to believe that the same guys who wrote The People vs. Larry Flint and Man on the Moon have written this garbage. Dude, this is my list of the 10 worst movies of all time. Hasn't this guy, this director, said it if he realized that the first Problem Child was bad enough? Not to mention making a sequel for this !! ?? Amazing that piece of trash film like this can be shown to children much less be released! 1 on 10 * 's
