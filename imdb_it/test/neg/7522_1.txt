After reading the novel that talks about an hour of reading, watching this film has become a sad disappointing experience. Just like he did in the Prince of Egypt, Simon Wells somehow managed to direct a script that took away all the drama and mystery from his original material and turned it into this homogeneous absurdity. Now I am a fan of cheese and the field but this film makes absolutely no sense. There was no joy in any of the performances or any humor. There were no chills and that fake bookend with the Filby Addy character throwing his hat in the air was the last drop of engraving. I felt very violated when the film ended and I still refuse to believe that only 90 minutes have passed. I was wondering how the studio and the director could have made such a horrible script, but then my friend introduced me to the film exactly as it was and I said it's great but what happened to the film.
