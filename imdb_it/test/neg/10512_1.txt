I rented this movie expecting to suck, and it didn't disappoint me. I rented it with some friends as a joke. But what we got was worse than anyone could ever imagine. <br /> <br /> Start sucking before you even take it out of the box. It looks like a Blade rip-off and the guy on the cover isn't anywhere in the movie. It's called the Assassin vampire, but isn't someone a killer killing for hire? Well, this guy kills his own will, so that doesn't make him a murderer. <br /> <br /> So when you actually put the disc in, it gets worse. First of all the menu animation is lame. But when the film actually begins, everything from the set design to lighting (or lack of it) is terrible. You know a movie hurts when the opening credits suck. The acting is ridiculous. The action is childish. Writing is elementary. And the director is the worst>
