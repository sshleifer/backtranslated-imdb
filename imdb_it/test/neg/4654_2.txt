Pretty bad. This film is about a grizzled (and frankly stupid) old prospector and his dog 'Shep', Lassie, and a nagging child whose name I can't remember at the moment. At the beginning of the film, the old prospector was DELIBERATELY buried in the sand so that the poor dog had to dig it. Why? Did he hate the dog? Anyhoo, one way or another this idiot managed to hit the gold and go to his partner. But the man is dead and his squalid other partner is happy to help old Jonathan dig gold. The old man who tries to leave is a dog with the son of the deceased, but even the retarded retard wants to stay with this boy. There is a bizarre old preacher (for a strange, smelly reading), and the greasy has finished the old (surprise, surprise) and tries to steal all the gold. Furthermore, he poisons the dog and tries to kill the baby as well. So I suppose it's okay for a Lassie..err ... diabolical and crazy ... SHEP does it in the end, even if it's pretty scary in what's basically a children's movie. There are extremely stereotyped (to the point of racist insults) 'Native Americans' who speak without using verbs (as in the speech of type Me Make Camp Fire). And this is more or less the extent of the cast, because apparently Lassie's salary was too big to be able to hire someone else. A bit 'boring. not very interesting, and a little too dark. It is not a great film in any way.
