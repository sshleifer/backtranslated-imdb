Well, I saw Wrath of the Ninja. <br /> <br /> It is not something I would recommend to people who are not seriously involved in Japanese combat films. This is a kind of Japanese ninja combat film, with a complex plot. These are these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 "swords of witchcraft". I saw the subtitled version (NOT recommended, it's easy to lose something) and I didn't really keep up with everything. He had some good difficult scenes, but in general, it wasn't much to my liking.
