Why does Guy work for Buddy? Probably because Ari wasn't in 1995. Why does Dawn want to be with Guy? For access to Buddy. Why is she with Guy? I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There are many things about this film that I'm not sure about. But, is Kevin Spacey an excellent verbal tsunami like Buddy Ackerman? and totally credible because he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> Frank Whaley's boyfriend is certainly out of his element of work for Buddy ?? he wants to write and make meaningful films, not to be a gofer who is verbally abused to get Equal instead of Sweet & Low. <br /> <br /> The dawn of Michelle Forbes, who also wants to make significant films, seems to have come out of Guy's league. <br /> <br /> The finish leaves a lot to be desired.
