First of all, I have nothing against Christianity. I believe that every person has the right to believe in what he or she chooses. But I can't imagine how stupid a person must be to believe it! What a waste of believers' money. They'd better use it to feed some hungry families in third world countries. I don't want to talk about acting talk or plot of this "movie" because I couldn't find any of those in this. The story is simple: two reporters, one (A) is an atheist, the other (B) has abandoned religion for a while. B regains his trust in religion and teaches A lesson: believe in Christ or go to hell. This message appears after about ten minutes and continues to repeat itself until the end of the film. People do not believe in the evaluation of this "film", they read the reviews first. I didn't do it and I lost an hour of my life :( PS: Why is it classified as science fiction? Because of those few strange sounds and some bright light from the sky? PPS: UFO = Satan's evil actions ? new :)
