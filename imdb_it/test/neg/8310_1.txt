Bay Area residents probably remember Paul from the Diamond Center, a strenuous nighttime navigator who whipped easy credit and shoddy stones for late-night television in the 1980s and early 1990s. I mention it only because there is an actor in Death Machines who seems to be HE who plays the owner of an Italian restaurant. He appears in the best scene of this truly terrifying and almost unwatchable criminal drama on a Dragon Lady (Mari Honjo, who wisely hung up acting spurs after completing this film) that controls the local union. Our hero (let's call him Not Paul From the Diamond Center) plays the restaurateur with all the subtlety of Luigi dei Simpson ("you lika da spaghetti?") And seems indifferent when one of his clients complains about the food. No, there is no fly in the soup or hair in the sauce: there is a red Buddha in the dough, the visiting card of the murderous criminal boss, who sends a statuette to each of his potential victims. The death machines are bad, and rather boring, which is an even worse crime.
