Esther Williams plays a romantically ski mountaineer secretary who wants to stop "walking on water" and become a man's wife; Van Johnson and Tony Martin are his potential choices for a husband. Despite the beautiful aquatic sequences filmed at Florida's Cypress Gardens, this romantic comedy is terribly stale. As directed by director Charles Walters, everything here is made to seem intentionally harmless, which does not give the picture much strength. Even the great moments of Esther in the water are not up to the hypnotic jumps of her other natatory means, although they are preferable to the antipodes of men, both colorless. Carroll Baker, in his debut film as Martin's former girlfriend, is the liveliest in the group. Brittle stuff, really. * 1/2 from ****
