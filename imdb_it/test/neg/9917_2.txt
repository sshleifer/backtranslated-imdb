I was sitting at home and flicking through channels when I came across what looked like an interesting movie. I like Destruction movies and decided to watch it. I don't know why, but I ended up watching it for the whole 2 hours. We have seen this type of film that I don't know how many times. <br /> <br /> In 1998 - 2000 there were a dozen films that dealt with global destruction of some kind. The best on my list so far is Deep Impact which was more credible than this. Here are my problems with this movie: 1) cheap special effects, like something out of the old computer. 2) no basic information or explanation on meteorological models. If you're planning on making a film about time, at least have some decency to entertain the viewer with technical details. 3) Why do only 2 or 3 people understand that the storm is converging on Chicago ... there are no more experts in the field? 4) where are some interesting characters? I really don't care about anyone except maybe the pregnant woman. I felt there was no character development. 5) no moment that stimulates reflection on a subject so never and really wrong. And this is only the first part of the film. I bet the conclusion will show us a few scenes of destruction and a search and rescue operation, just as it has been done many times in the past. And judging by the special effects in the first part of the film, I can only imagine what we expect. Of course, in the end, the main characters will survive and life will go on ... as original
