Steven Segal's film career is a tribute to horrible cinema. I was tragically bored by each of them as soon as I realized that they were even more unrealistic than those of Jean Claude VanDamme. Has anyone else ever noticed that he is never hit? I mean, give me something to uproot for ... a tough battle fought with a scary villain. TWENTY YEARS and is still shooting the same fight scenes. Fighting the scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero can't act. The boring choreography of a film by Segal highlights his painful lack of acting ability. Worse, it's terribly out of shape. Just what we need, a fat corpulent who thinks he's an important man. There is not a hint of redemption of the cinematographic value in all these films, about ninety minutes. DO NOT watch it unless you want to throw away an hour and a half of your life.
