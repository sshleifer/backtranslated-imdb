This film was strange especially because the plot was so inconsistent. The title refers to a vicious wind that makes the earth's surface almost uninhabitable when it blows, but this seemed to have nothing to do with what was happening. The film seems to be a terrible cheat of Bladerunner, that is a clever android chased by a bounty hunter (or a ruthless policeman in this). Luke Skywalker turns into a surprisingly good performance like a fake cop. Nothing seems to be solved at the end of the film, we never discover anything of any substance about the android or what its intentions are. There is a bewildering scene in which Bill Paxton (who kidnapped the android) plays a particular song in his cardboard airplane for no particular reason (the song is called "Shape of things", by The Yardbirds). This happens again in a later scene where the same song is played for no apparent reason. Does this song have any relevance to the film? Don't think so.
