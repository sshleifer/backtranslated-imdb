This was a terrible and boring film, even for a documentary. Sometimes, he provided insight into life and even had humorous moments, but overall it was not worth seeing. Whenever I began to feel sympathy for Mark and began to hope that he would succeed, I would be disappointed by his lack of responsibility and drug and alcohol abuse.
