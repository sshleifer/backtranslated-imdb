What the hell is this !? This was my first reaction to this film (actually, my first reaction contained more curses). This is not Star Wars! Star Wars is space battles, this film has none. Star Wars is strength, this movie has only one witch delayed with a magic ring. Star Wars is a lightsaber battle, this film has no battle to mention. Star Wars is humorous, this film is not. Star Wars is a galaxy far, far away, this movie has HORSES !!! On top of that, how Lucas had the crazy idea of ​​having a five-year-old take the lead role! Big, big disappointment. Do you like Star Wars? Don't watch this! 1 in 10
