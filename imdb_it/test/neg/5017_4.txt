Bobcat Goldthwait should be praised for trying to do something different with this surprisingly sincere film, a warning about the pitfalls of being honest about everything. Melinda Hamilton plays Amy, a girl who has had an oral relationship with a dog in the past with a lark. Fight with her boyfriend, John. Obviously the truth is in contrast to his ugly bristly head. The film is about the fallout of this adventure. The film is well played by everyone, except perhaps Jack Plotnick in the role of Dougie, who never really felt like he was well mixed with the image. And the film, quite solid, seems to lack its brand a few times. Every single person in the film struggles with massive hypocrisy and all ours a little difficult to relate to. Bobcat should be praised for doing something different, as I said before, but several are not always the same and this is never so light for Goldthwaits' directorial debut, the misunderstood criminal "Shakes the Clown" <br /> br /> My vote: C-
