Well, first of all, the twins are exactly the same. there is no one is girly and one is tomboy (Ashley is taller than Mary-Kate) and their boyfriends are not even French, so it's bad because they're pretending accents. Lamo. It's not so bad, it's not the best. I'm a big fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley, don't get me wrong. the plot is OK and it's fun to watch. it's not the kind of movie you watch over and over again. But hey, when they made this film, they were still new as a whole, building their own movie scene. The girls behave as if they were older than 13, but if you are a young spectator this is a good movie. It's not good if you are over 13 unless you are a parent watching a movie with your kids. OK then. Good luck MK + A with your future movies!
