What the hell is this movie talking about? Well, if I didn't know that "son of the Mask" is classified as a comedy, I would never have had the slightest idea! A comedy? A tragedy, this is the right kind for this yet - another so-called sequel. <br /> <br /> Yes, I looked at "Dumb and Dumber" but I never thought anyone would ever make the real title in Hollywood. Yes, look at "Son of the Mask" and think .. 5 minutes - Fool ... 10 minutes - More stupid ... 15 - minutes More stupid ... And then, after 16 minutes there's only one thing to say : / I'm out of here ... <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I'm my candidate for Comedy Crap of the Year 2005.
