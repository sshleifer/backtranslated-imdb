"Scientists at a remote laboratory experiment on (insert a scaly creature here) and create monsters out of control. Meanwhile, a crisis-stricken military squad / the scientist's bank thieves find their way to the remote place and are threatened from the giant creatures. One by one they are eaten, during an "exciting" race to avoid being blown up by the forces that initially created the monsters ... "The sad thing is that it looks like a dozen films appeared on the Sci - Fi Channel. I have to ask myself what's going on? Of course ... I like bimbos and Hollywood-hunk aspirants to be eaten by the creatures of CGI as much as the next person ... but where's the plot or originality? Of course, there are times when the Sci-Fi channel shines. Battlestar Galactica, if a little dark, can be very good. The writers have continued to pump life into the various Stargate offerings and the latest import of Doctor Who on the BBC is surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> Even in the various films of "giant animals" on Sci-Fi, the animation seems to get better all the time Compare the kommodo of this film with the rather awkward version of the first giant kommodo film on Sci-Fi . <br /> <br /> But goodness ... how about a different plot? Perhaps some - different - critical giant? On a whim, I started searching on the internet. Among the rubbish I found some interesting stories that could attract science fiction fans and Russian CGI animators at once. I offer http://www.macrophile.com/~arilin/archive/metamorphosis-day to the net with a suggestion that they contact the author for the rights of history. (The plot contains violent images generally similar to those of the various Sci-Fi channel offerings). <br /> <br /> The plot has subplots, ethical and moral comments on the nature of humanity and ends not on one of these horrible "did they really kill all the monsters ???" moments, but rather lets you guess completely and in a completely different mentality. <br /> <br /> What is generally what science fiction should do, isn't it?
