A woman as rich as insecure has a history of alcoholism and nervous breakdowns, helped no doubt by a warm gigolo husband who betrays her openly. Of course nobody believes her when she claims to have been approached by a giant man who came out of a giant satellite. To her husband's delight, this could be the incident that eventually puts her away forever. <br /> <br /> From the opening scenes, with its ridiculous news and its ridiculous satellite encounter, you will probably be convinced that the only saving value of this film is that it is so ugly that it is fun. Although not too far from the brand, this is absolutely not true. <br /> <br /> Unlike most films of this genre, this is not really a science fiction or horror movie, but actually a serious drama that intelligently incorporates a science fiction scenario into the plot. It's not a good drama or even a mediocre one, but it will exceed your expectations if you didn't expect any legitimate drama. Acting is surprisingly good for such a low budget effort and, more importantly, it is well taken care of and has an excellent pace. It is never boring and can generate more than a little interest in seeing what comes next. However, this is still a movie strictly for those who can't miss the chance to watch a 1950s movie with a title like "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"!
