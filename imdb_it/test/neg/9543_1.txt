A terrific story with all the tired clich√©s. I was shocked that the horrible script became a movie! What a waste! How many ORIGINAL scripts are spread around without being produced? <br /> <br /> At the height I could predict what will happen in every single shot. <br /> <br /> Oh, and don't even let me start talking about the idiotic sexual tension between the magnificent cop and the paralyzed cop who can barely move a finger. YEAH, FOR SURE. I CAN BUY THIS. What will happen? Porn fingers?
