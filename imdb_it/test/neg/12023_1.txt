This is one of the strangest things on TV. It sits in a bizarre superb Midlands called Leatherbridge which seems to be the most boring place in the country. It has a bar with no staff or visible customers, a university without students, a police station without criminals and a doctor's office with more doctors than patients. The stories are terrible - every episode revolves around a bizarre medical problem, interpreted by a series of extras that can never really act, and for some reason the doctor always ends up at home to solve their problem. Funny enough for its purely comedy value, but I can't believe this thing actually masquerades as a serious drama. Out of mind.
