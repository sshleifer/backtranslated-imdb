This is one of those movies that you watch with a group of people. You will have the best time. It's really, really bad, like the bad Showgirls but without the quality of Showgirls. <br /> <br /> You have the best mix of bad actors, bad directors and bad writers here. Anything that can be wrong can make for a fun evening, you have it here. The first is the tag line is "a group of teenagers ..." These people are as much "teenagers" as my grandmother. <br /> <br /> The director has zero sense of suspense or tension. The "teenagers" of 30 are standing and the "monster" comes out and attacks and this happens more or less during the movie when the monsters are revealed. There is no suspense to develop this or surprise or anything. It's more like when you were a kid pretending to be chased by monsters and just some sort of stuff made up as you went. And when I use the word "monsters" I exaggerate. More like a couple of guys in Halloween masks bought at the .99 cent store. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that this script was spun off in a couple of days, no rewriting and I can only imagine how bad and badly formatted it looked on the page because it was clearly written by an amateur with no clue . It's another example of one of the bad things about this day and age: anyone can make a movie. <br /> <br /> But of course the worst thing about this movie is acting. It's as ugly as it can get. There is not a person in this who has the least ability to act and lead is the worst of all. He delivers every line in this monotonous way without any expression and you have to ask yourself how someone so ugly can play a part in any movie, no matter who he knows. When she had to "cry" when her girlfriend was killed, it was one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Watching these people play some of the terrible dialogues is a lot of fun. But when the black said "tell her ... tell her ... I love her ..." before her death scene, there was a big laugh among our group. Fun and funny things. <br /> <br /> My only hope is that this movie becomes bad enough to take its place to which it belongs: in IMDb. We can do it, people! <br /> <br /> PS. It is a surprise that the only "big" comment of this film was from someone in Virginia (who has a comment, only on this film and nothing else). And guess where the film was made? Virginia. I've said it before and I'll say it again: the people working on the film shouldn't be able to comment.
