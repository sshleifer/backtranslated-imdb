I assume that the enthusiastic reviews on this page come from people who have never read the book - Unfortunately for those of us who love the text, Hollywood has surpassed itself for destroying this. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure where the woman comes from love, except that she replaced the cat, and why our Rogue Male bought a useful family in Blighty - Actually the vast majority of the book was Cropped and replaced with your standard love and raw food story. The ambiguity about which world leader was in his viewfinder was completely removed and our Rogue was given a name (none of these appeared until the second book). I gave a 2 rather than a 1 simply because of the wonderfully bad cockney accents. Joan Bennett overtakes Dick Van Dyke to Mary Poppins of miles and this is a small way to save him. <br /> <br /> Ah well - The British should probably avoid it. Trust me :)
