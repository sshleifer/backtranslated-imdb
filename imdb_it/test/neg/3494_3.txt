Ok, it was very nice ... but the best image? Please, not even close. Monaco was better, Capote was much better, Good Night and Good Luck was much better ... Brokeback Mountain - well, he should have won! The Academy's voters seem to behave like modern-day democrats - just a little bit of everyone, but don't dare to take concrete positions. That's why we have a complete moron in the United States. <br /> <br /> This was the worst presentation of AA ... and we forget 1987 ... from before. Hollywood is so scared of its budget that it cannot be set up "straight". Apparently, many voters haven't even seen Brokeback Mountain. Become real and have fun. <br /> <br /> This has been the most pathetic year since I looked in the mid-1960s and I only had two. <br /> <br /> Wake up, whoever you are we are. Hollywood IS mainstream, and that's what happened at the Box Office in 2005. King Kong, the latest Star Wars movie, another Batman movie, a remake or anything else from Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, and much more in 2006. <br /> <br /> At least there were the best original photos, namely Monaco, but I heard one earlier, Capote - fantastic; Katherine Keener should have won, even though we now know that Reese can sing as Cash / Carter, etc., Syriana was a much better picture than Crash. Has that film been made since the early 1960s and should we make this the best film? What a horrible Oscar night and a horrible year to finish in 2005 and another boring year in 2006. At least the BAFTA for the best photo went to Brokeback, and what about the horrible song that won? Pathetic. I think there are only 20 years left as America or the United States, before someone comes in and changes things a bit. Perhaps it will be China since they own so much of this country ... or India, because they all have high-tech jobs and are the largest democratic country in the world. <br /> <br /> America has become the land of fat, pathetic and stupid. Waste can be found in most places in Florida, western Virginia, South Dakota, and central west. <br /> <br /> Drive through a local McDonald's or Burger King for God's sake. Order whatever you want until you have a heart attack. Get out of your misery.
