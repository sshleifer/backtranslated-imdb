How bad Well, compared to this film, Cannibal Holocaust is Citizen Kane. There is acting at three hundred and sixty degrees, the atrocious dialogue, the half-cooked plot and like his complement piece too in terms of animal slaughter on the screen that was actually made. Unlike the Holocaust, Ferox is a direct film. It does not claim to be a pseudo documentary. In a sense, this helps production because the film is very sharp and clear compared to the holocaust grain. Unfortunately, once again we are given a group of people who are morally reprehensible. They torture the natives and practically carry everything they take on themselves. There is really nothing worthwhile in this film. I was quite lenient with my Holocaust review due to an actual attempt at affirmation and style, but in Ferox's case there is no reason to look at this unless you just drop blood and blood.
