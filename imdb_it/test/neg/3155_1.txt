Barney and friends ... the Dora the explorer of the 90s. <br /> <br /> OK, I admit it. as a child, Barney was my last hero. I had my plush barney and I always watched the same barney episodes on videotape. perhaps because it was so covered in sugar and numb. <br /> <br /> However, when I turned 7, I started to hate Barney. Everyone at school would be Dis barney, and I went ahead with it (mainly because it was fun) and that's what kids do. but a few years later, I discovered something else about Barney that I will never forget. <br /> <br /> a person known in the Anonymous like Angel_meiru did an essay for the school, explaining the dangers of looking at Barney, and he or he posted it on message boards. many of these dangers made sense. <br /> <br /> Barney is a dinosaur that can magically come to life during a day at school. it's supposedly educational, or so Sheryl Leach (Barney's creator) says, but really, all I can remember has taught me, is that magic can solve anything, which is not true. <br /> <br /> to finish commenting, I'd like to tell you a little story. Once upon a time there was a guy watching a particular episode of Barney. one day, he was alone, when a stranger pulled him into his car and drove away with him. I do not know the result (but it is certain that the child is dead) but why was he abducted in the first place? because he saw the Barney episode and the friends entitled "A stranger is a friend you haven't met yet". <br /> <br /> 0/10
