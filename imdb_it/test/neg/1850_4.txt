Mario Racocevic from Europe is the only user who has published a comment so far and covers the highlights of the film. Yet another difficult movie to buy in the UK. I had to go through "Midnight Video" which has a Swedish branch. I went to the post office and bought by mail this and a title similar to SKR30 only a title. <br /> <br /> This film goes under many "aka" depending on when and where it is marketed. I had previously purchased "The Bloodsucker leads the Dance" (which you will find if you search on Imdb under "people" and fits "Krista Nell"). The actor who plays the Count on his private island in this last film had his words nicknamed by an Italian in English of an actor with a voice with an unmistakably sad and rather tired sound. I smiled when I heard the same voice dubbed into the English soundtrack like the police inspector who is investigating the murder of the prostitute killed in the spot in the subject film. My choice, of course, was to see another release from the elusive Krista Nell. <br /> <br /> There are some rather insignificant subtitles in the film that involve blackmail / extortion, squalid relationships with girls' mothers, a motorcycling hunt that translates into a gangland coup, a gangrape of a friend of the "customer" biker, shabby photograph, disguised as a transvestite etc. that give a taste to this film summarized in one word - SLEAZE, (but artistic sleaze). The aforementioned collaborator liked this film but the low grade suggests that other Imdb fans did it without explaining their "where and why". Personally I thought that there were too many subplots and not enough inserted in the main story and in the relationship of these characters subordinated to the central plot and to the development of their characters on the screen. Even a professional film editor was absolutely necessary as some of the scenes seemed to last too long, having taken stock, so that the film seemed to drag itself into places; for example. the scene of the dancing transvestite. Krista Nell appears in a fruitful scene with a client but even this is just a vignette and I was left more wanting from her, from the director and from the script. <br /> <br /> I love the political inaccuracy shown in older films (this is 30 years from its realization) such as smoking in offices and the way some characters react to each other in the office! I would suggest 4/10 as a more realistic assessment and I rewarded it as such.
