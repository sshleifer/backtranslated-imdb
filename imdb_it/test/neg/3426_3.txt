A very elaborate, mushy, angular reinterpretation. <br /> <br /> They fell into "because it is modern, it must be exaggerated, polished, etc." trap. <br /> <br /> "Romeo and Juliet" has completed this idea with much more success, but I really think it's time to go beyond the two extremes (period films and avant-garde films). <br /> <br /> Just because this is a "modern" review, it doesn't mean that the film should look like a magazine advertisement, or have something to do with drugs or guns. <br /> <br /> If the trappings were as thin as the honeyed words, Macbeth would be a much more powerful film. As it is, read your Shakespeare. Read it out loud. Ask your Oxford dictionary a few questions. Skip the movie. Or no, but you've been warned. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the super long review. IMDb made me do this.
