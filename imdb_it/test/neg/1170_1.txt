The title tells everything - Ed Gein, the Plainfield butcher. <br /> <br /> It is not an action-packed slasher film made for teenagers with energy drinks. This would fit into a well-established genre, the kind that some people find funny, something along the lines of "Halloween" or "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre". <br /> <br /> This is dark, slow, full of shredded and silently evil corpses. There are some cuts of shock, no point of view of the monster, no sound score. I don't know who they are targeting - ghouls, maybe. <br /> <br /> Under the credits we can already see photos of skulls, hanging carcasses, draped skins on the back of the chairs, that sort of thing. And they're pretty disgusting that I can't help but think that this movie would have been better enough to make up for this Grand Guignol opening. <br /> <br /> Alas, it is not. The acting is uniformly terrible, like in a school play. The script does its best to sink under the vulgarity. Ed Gein, who killed only two middle-aged women and perhaps his brother, chases a screaming and bleeding young woman through Weir's forest, and wears only a modern bra and bikini, rather than a vintage underwear. Gein also beheads a night watchman, who has never done it in any historical sense. <br /> <br /> The direction? You could do a better job. In the first few minutes, law enforcement officers discovered an abandoned car with blood splattered on the windshield. There is nobody. The handsome young sheriff turns to his boss and suggests looking for the victim, who may still be nearby and live. The sheriff, devoid of any motivation, shouts to him: "Now you forget about this! I don't want you to go via HALF COCKED on anything!" It should be nothing more than an exchange of business opinions. Why does the director have such an angry sheriff? Characters of various kinds listen to radio programs or records that reproduce old jazzy pop songs - "Is not Misbehaving" by Louis Armstrong, for example. This is - what - rural WISCONSIN in the 50s? And the characters insist on the music that would appeal to clients of the Harlem Cotton Club in the 1930s, or to New York intellectuals like Woody Allen. No. The radio would play "Wheel of Fortune" by Kitty Kallen or Theresa Brewer or, just as probably, Lefty Frizell. Not that the dysfunction between music and events adds something to our understanding of what happens under the images. Someone involved in the production liked the old jazzy pop songs, that's all. <br /> <br /> Obviously there is so much you can do on a low budget, but it may be light years ahead of this butcher shop. See "Ed Gein", with Steven Railsback for an example of a much more sophisticated way of dealing with this madman and his weakness for corpses, and with a budget that could not have far exceeded this. <br /> <br /> These comments are all based on the first twenty minutes of the film. This is as far as possible. If someone finds that this story is well executed and fascinating in any way, it should try to find some ideas about its tastes. It's below mine - and I consider myself somewhat deformed.
