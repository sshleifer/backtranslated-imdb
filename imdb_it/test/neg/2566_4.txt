I discovered "The Patriot" in a DVD store and thought it could be a real action thriller. No, it's a low-budget movie with a ridiculous story. It is without doubt a film on cable and not one for the theater. Fortunately, after 90 minutes the movie stops, otherwise the public should have taken an anti-virus against sleep. One thing came: it was the beautiful country where the film was shot. You can really feel the American air, but that's all. I hope for Steven Seagal to finally succeed in a great success. It is absolutely not to be seen because my wife and I voted on average 4/10.
