My 15 year old daughter asked me to watch this movie with her on cable TV. As someone who saw Revenge of The Nerd in a movie theater, I found this film as an extremely predictable remake. The Nerds were simply replaced by Dorks. I made her mad by being able to accurately predict what would happen in every scene. The cast was nice, especially Amanda Bynes. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Chad Creasey should be ashamed to write such an obvious remake of a 1980s movie. The title should have been simply "Revenge of The Dorks". Perhaps the sequel will be Revenge of the Dorks 2.
