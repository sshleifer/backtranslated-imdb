I was wondering what the organizers of the Victoria Film Festival had to include this film in their program. I guess they have to agree with the others who reviewed this film. I, on the other hand, consider it the worst movie I've ever seen. It starts with an evil script, full of holes and dialogues so improbable that it's embarrassing. Ideas are introduced, therefore abandoned without development. The acting left me totally cold and uninvolved. The decoration of the set was appropriate for the time, but a decorator's nightmare. The only way characters could love this house is if their previous homes were horrible. The penthouse looked as if the objects had been thrown into the scene without the attempt to create the appearance of a real attic that filled with garbage over the years. The photograph was leaden and devoid of variety. Save your money for something worthwhile.
