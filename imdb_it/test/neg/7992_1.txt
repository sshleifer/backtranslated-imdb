This film is recommended only for the sleepless: it will lighten them by putting them to sleep. Even five-year-olds could have fun. But for anyone else (including fans of the genre), how boring! The "ancient" plot is reminiscent of "Return Of The Dragon", and this film is just as inept, but Nero is not Bruce Lee, so "Enter the Ninja" is an even worse film. So far, this is the second (the offensive "comedy" Bachelor Party "was the first) movie I gave 1/10 to.
