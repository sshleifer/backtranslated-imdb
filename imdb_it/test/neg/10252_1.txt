Is it possible that a film gets worse than that? Is there a herd of monkeys wandering around, muttering b ******, acting apparently silly and we should laugh? There is no plot here to get you going first. Even when women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most anticipated things happen and when the film is over, you may be fast asleep. Attention: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is rubbish! I can't believe there's a follow-up to this! <br /> <br /> 1
