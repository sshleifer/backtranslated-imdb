I was a big fan of the original Robocop. <br /> <br /> But to say that I was disappointed by this first sequel would be an understatement. <br /> <br /> The problems are many. <br /> <br /> Shiny even though the film may look like there are a lot of bloopers on the screen for everyone to see, wires, cameramen etc., something that I find completely unacceptable to someone from Irvin Kreshner's pedigree. <br /> <br /> Robocop has become a robot. There is no spark of humanity in the character here. A real disappointment when one considers that his "soul" had returned to the end of the first film. Here his attitude shows no human side and makes it difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> Caine is a bad villain. OK, I know that Boddiker from the first movie was better than average, mainly thanks to Kurtwood Smith's performance, but the usual solid Tom Noonan creates a character that you don't care about any less. <br /> <br /> What happened to the Old man ????. I appreciate the fact that he failed to reach the point where he is "cute", but the change in his character here is nothing short of shocking. In the first film it is clear that he despises Dick Jone's tactics and attitude and yet he is no better here than Jones. It does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Dr. Faxx is a poor substitute for the charismatic, if not unpleasant, resident genius of Bob Morton. <br /> <br /> Action sequences save the sequence in which Murphy is stuck to the side of Caine's truck, they are rough and nasty and repel each other rather than entertaining. <br /> <br /> And finally. What is musical score? Don't tell me Poledouris couldn't have done it simply because he was working on Total Recall at the time. A series soundtrack (TV or film) is part of his personality. Part of his character. When you remove it, it damages the familiarity of the characters we're looking at. So it's bad enough, but shame on Leonard Rosenman. Its soundtrack is filthy, it stands out and is definitely lowered. <br /> <br /> History has its moments to be honest. There is a lot of originality here. But try to do too many new things with a movie. Hob is a well-made villain and the only real "villian" on the move, Thumbs up to Gabriel Damon. <br /> <br /> The final showdown between Robocop and Robocop 2 is also fun. <Br /> <br /> But for the vast majority of its excessive duration it is a real disappointment.
