Eric Idle, Robbie Coltraine, Janet Suzman - it would have been almost impossible to go wrong. It certainly has some funny moments - the showers scene when Robbie Coltraine echoes the werewolf line "I can't help myself" by Lon Chaney Jr is hilarious. But in the end the plot, the script and the direction are flat like a pancake and tired like a nun of 90 years after 180 "Ave Maria". When I was a child, the Carry On films slightly filled this niche, which is a very sad accusation of a film with such a promising cast.
