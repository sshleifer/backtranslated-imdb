A 40-foot giant squid with five tentacles, razor teeth and the ability to reproduce its cells terrifies a small town in Florida. Several biologists, doctors and marine policemen plan to kill him. Meanwhile, a human monster named Miller offends the people who discover the "Devilfish" is a man-made creation used for the greedy benefit of some evil doctors! Miller attacks a researcher, strangles her, drowns her in the bathtub, throws herself into a hair dryer, then tears her panties from her corpse! <br /> <br /> Many false alarms are set when our heroes Peter, Stella, Janet and Bob jumped into a high-tech (high-tech boat for 1984) "Seaquarium" to capture the creature, which is often seen in close-up movies or over-discounted to look more threatening. And only fire can destroy it, which leads to a mighty one armed with flamethrowers against the end of aquatic beasts. <br /> <br /> This cashing of the JAWS is rather meek (apart from a legless corpse and a beheading) but watchable and takes advantage of an excellent score by Antony Barrymore and a decent monster design (again, for 1984). Luigi Cozzi and Sergio Martino wrote the original story. <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
