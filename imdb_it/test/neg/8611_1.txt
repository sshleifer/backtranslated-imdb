This movie is really bad. The hero cannot play. You see too much that he learned his moves by foot. And believe me, walk a lot. For 45 minutes, nothing happens. He walks only for places and exits ..... As if the story was so short that he had to extend it adding useless and boring scenes of "looks-like-a-suspens". <br /> <br /> The dialogues are very poor. I counted a lot of "hi" and a few "hanging" on the first part. <br /> <br /> Blood is orange like Mercurochrome that you put on children's bladders. And the scenes don't follow themselves. A bloody neck in a scene, a clean neck on what follows. <br /> <br /> The story could have been improved. Yes, I mean what the hell is the story? <br /> <br /> Martial arts? Where is it? Are those martial arts? See how hesitant and slow the moves are !!!!! If kicking and getting punched is called martial arts, then I'm Bruce Lee !!!! <br /> <br /> The only good thing I found is in the fighting scenes: they don't play with zoom and fast switching scenes that give you headaches in most action movies. <br /> <br /> There are many low budget movies that are fantastic. That was just for making money. Nothing else.
