I have to start by saying that this is one of the most annoying movies I've seen in my life! Annoying factor number one: never see the face of "child" (for the entire film). And the infinitely more annoying factor: that phone that rings unceasingly ... nothing, but listening to the phone ring again and again, again and again, again and again, again and again, again and again and again and again ... get my point . The old man had been harassed but also the VIEWER! At the beginning the film was interesting for me, but it deteriorated VERY quickly. The film may have been as good as a short, but it wasn't enough to keep something approaching the length of the film. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the message about racism (which finally had an appearance during the last two scenes of the film) is secondary to this old man being harassed. Who cares to sit and watch what is nothing but an old man who sucks at someone who calls him? If you've never seen a movie that gets under your skin and pushes you CRAZY ... take a look at it!
