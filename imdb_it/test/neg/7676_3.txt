The real protagonist of the last film of the airport is the great supersonic company created by the French, The Concorde. If you keep in mind that the entire movie is dedicated to showing what that needle-nosed plane could do in the sky, the whole movie makes sense. <br /> <br /> But if you expect some serious drama here, that by all means take part in the evasive action that the Concorde shows here when some bad people try to bring it down. <br /> <br /> Susan Blakely plays a television journalist who is also the lover of military industrial magnate Robert Wagner. One of Wagner's assistants brings information about some of Wagner's dirty business, selling weapons to unfriendly people in the United States. When the source, Macon McCalman, is killed in front of her and she is almost teased by a killer who manages to escape, obviously she confronts Wagner with information. And he obviously denies it. But just before Blakely gets on The Concorde, McCalman's widow, Kathleen Maguire, hands her the necessary documents. <br /> <br /> But on the way to Moscow with a stop in Paris, Wagner and his henchmen try to put the bird down. But the fearless crew of Alain Delon, David Warner and George Kennedy has all it takes. It is a full bag as you will see if you want to see the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are an aviation enthusiast, you will not be interested in the plot at all. It's like the film Le Mans with Steve McQueen who has a legion of motor racing fans who have made it a cult object. Perhaps Le Mans is better because they never bothered with any kind of story. <br /> <br /> Among the passengers there is a smoker saxophonist played by Jimmie Walker, a distraught mother who accompanies a new heart for her child, played by Cicely Tyson and Martha Raye, a woman with a weak bladder who spends the entire trip from Washington to Paris in the bathroom. It's actually the best here. Robert Wagner must have been psychic, because I'm sure that thanks to the strength of this film he got the number two part of the Doctor Evil in the Austin Powers series. <Br /> <br /> I'm sure everyone interested got a great payday from this movie, but it seems to have killed the Airport movie saga.
