I saw Winnie's Heffalump a couple of days ago. A beautiful story based on famous people created by A.A.Milne. Although Winnie, Piglet, Tigger and Rabbit are all present in this animated feature, this time the main character is Roo. He befriends the disturbing Heffalump which proves not to be scary at all and shows everyone that friendship knows no boundaries and everyone wants and deserves to be happy. I love this movie and would love it even more if I was 10 or 15 years younger. Alas, I would like to become a kid again to enjoy this Heffalump story much more but all I have left is a sense of sadness at the loss of a kind of childishness and innocence that this film is full of ?? I was pleased to hear Carly Simon sing, Joel McNeely gave a great score.
