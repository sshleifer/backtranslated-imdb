A woman finds herself involved in a seemingly inexplicable eruption of suicides. Then again, are these really suicidal? There seems to be a ghost in freedom. Guess what? The ghost has long black hair that hides his face, and moves with his head or arms twisted that way or that, creating a very strange specter. Recurring theme music is reproduced from unexpected places to announce the arrival of the ghost and bizarre sound effects - which resemble the sound of small twigs being broken - always accompany this unfortunate spirit. Does any of this sound familiar? Well, if you've seen some Asian horror movies in the last 10 years, it should. Borrowing heavily and brazenly from "The Ring", "One Last Call" and some other recent horror hits, this film tries to bring an uninteresting and worn-out storyline to the climax, but we've seen it before. Avoid it unless you are desperate or have not seen any other Asian horror films in the last 10 years.
