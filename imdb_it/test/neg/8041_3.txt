I would think that this was one of those films whose director had not read the book on which it was based, if it were not for the fact that they are only slightly similar. It is certainly possible that a great film is very loosely based on a book and this was certainly the second but not the first. <br /> <br /> There were a number of defects. One was that he tried to be too similar to the children of the railways, probably because the adults would have expected this, being of the same author. Another is that he also tried to be too similar to Harry Potter, up to the music and to emphasize the setting. I have nothing against J K Rowling or the movies but the book does not resemble those of Harry Potter. I thought that Psammead, although very well expressed by Eddie Izzard and also by the character, was almost free in a totally inappropriate environment. I might have missed something here, as comments made on one of the characters' books may have been a reference to the inaccuracy of adaptation. No extra characters were needed, and today's special effects could easily be used to tell the story as it was written, but they weren't. <br /> <br /> I saw this film with my two sons, one of whom knows the book and the other doesn't. Who knows, he thought it was all right, but he wasn't as enthusiastic as the one who doesn't. I'm not sure what that means.
