As a fan of the old series I must say that this is at best a parody of a much loved series. First the old series would at least try to follow a military structure. I know this in P.C. world is not the thing to do, but hey does not turn it into care bears. In the old series, Beachead was a tough soldier, now a teenage mutant turtle. Another thing is the flying tank, ok, it flies out of the cobra base and bounces off the helicopter and they are both ok ???? Let's face it if the next one is not better, this could mean the end of G.I.joe.
