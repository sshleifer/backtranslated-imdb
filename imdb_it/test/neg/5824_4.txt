I think Purvis starts making a gay "Gone with the wind" If so, I'm sorry, Tag, it didn't happen. It also didn't happen as a gay "sexploitation" movie. I guess I'm confused; what are we trying to do here? As much as I'd like, I simply can't figure out where I'm interested in these characters. This film is effective in capturing a taste of decadence that lives in the South; it does nothing to explain, illuminate or advance my understanding of a gay relationship, or the conflict with which the protagonist seems to be struggling.
