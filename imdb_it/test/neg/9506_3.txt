I'm partially a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say "in part" because most of his films are divided into two categories: brilliant and boring. Unfortunately this film falls into the next category. <br /> <br /> This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazaki's recent film "Howl's Moving Castle". An intriguing premise is set, but then immediately reduced to little more than a background for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than to explain it. <br /> <br /> The first third of the film reveals the post The apocalyptic world in which the story is set, and in reality it seems a very interesting story is about to unfold. From that moment on, things go down the hill. The central part of the film is mainly composed of veiled veiled echo-propaganda, and the ending is strongly marked by the dependence on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism that ruins a large number of Japanese animated films. <br /> <br /> On the whole, the film looks like someone tears every other page out of the script before transmitting it to the animators. What remains is something that is visually stunning (although unfortunately the version I saw was a copy of the N-generation, with poor colors - which gives rise to the common myth that Nausicaa shows her bare back when she flies), but that she has little sense and eventually left me confused.
