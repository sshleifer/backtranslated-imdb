Just read the other comments here, and was a little surprised to find that no one had said anything about acting or the plot. <br /> <br /> Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy can both offer a stand up comedy show. Great actors are not. I've had enough. <br /> <br /> What about the plot? Oh God. Every time the film tries to "deceive you" by making it believe that the good guys will lose, you know those scenes: "What? Good boys lose? Oh .. I understand, it was just a trick", it's so terribly ugly, you can see it a mile away. <br /> <br /> He had 2 or 3 funny moments, but not enough to save the day. <br /> <br /> It is a bit silly that these comments must be 10 lines now. A lot of people will fill it with shit, to be eligible. Being short is an art.
