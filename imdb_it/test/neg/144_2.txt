Somehow I managed to get past this whole movie, but I was banned from the total lack of entertainment transmitted. My friends and I are fans of the Hong Kong movie, but WOW. This film has it all, and by no means I mean everything a movie shouldn't have. Underdeveloped and stereotyped characters, exaggerated over-the-top, special cheese effects, talking robots, no less than 20 double-footed jumpkicks, impossible situations, unhealthy "gags" and "jokes", elementary school premises, senseless schooling - prolonged execution time for the material. He thinks the Gen-X Cops were a decent movie and this movie becomes even more difficult to bear. Quite simply, if you're entertaining the idea of ​​watching this movie ... don't do it.
