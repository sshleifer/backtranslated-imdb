Final Draft - A screenwriter (James Van Der Beek) hangs in his apartment and gives in to psychosis in an attempt to write a horror script. Not a terrible premise, but the execution is terrible. This seems like a first year of direction and work, and it probably is. The director skips hell from everything. It aims to disorient. What it is is annoying. So much so that small fragments of films are inconsistent. Writing is predictable and does not use most of the ideas it offers (bag of oranges). It is as if they had run out of time and the slap had rushed together for the Toronto Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This movie does not leave anyone speechless "oh my god is so ugly it is beautiful" bad. It's boring and it irritates you a long time later. James Van Der Beek is not a terrible actor and barely holds the ship above water. But it's too normal for the kind of psychosis the film tries to offer. He is simply an alien boy who one day sees people and hallucinates things, so he decides to behave in a slightly unbalanced way. The cause follows the effect. Maybe there's something in the water. Now Darryn Lucio, who plays his "friend", is a terrible actor. He shares the appearance of Chris O'Donald and is even more boring, a superhuman result. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere that the film offers is good (dull and dark gray), but since it is the only thing the film achieves it means nothing. This film wants to be Jacob's Ladder or The Machinist. It's not even the secret window. It's the preppy girl in class who decides to turn into a goth. <br /> <br /> Not terribly terrible, but the sheer stupidity of it will reflect you. I've already thought more about this criticism than the filmmakers of this film. <br /> <br /> D
