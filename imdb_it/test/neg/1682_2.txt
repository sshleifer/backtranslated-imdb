I offer a six-piece show because the fact that the show was actually a platform for Damon Wayans since the Cosby Show was for Bill Cosby, he faced a lot of problems with humor and I felt he was actually suited to get a laugh instead to let the lines come from the character. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle An interesting patriarch and a witty person. It is PHENOMENAL in the movies, but on the show it was there for the joke and even though I liked it, I felt that laughter was more important than plausibility. Jay Kyle I loved it from House Party and enjoyed it at School Daze and Martin, this was an important role for her and she made a great choice in selecting this sitcom for the role of co-star. I also feel that Jay and Michael were more like equals on the show but Jay was more like the woman who fed his crazy husbands the lines and followed his unorthodox discipline because he may have heard it worked. <br /> Jr Simply stupid, his character should have been well developed and even if he has his moments of greatness, we returned to stupidity as if he had not learned anything, which drives me crazy !!!!!!!! Not to mention that most situations (in the episodes I've seen) seem to center around him. <br /> <br /> Clair The attractive sister who attended a Christian, I found the character of her boyfriend more interesting than her (it would be better if she kept to the films, the writers would have had to do more to show her intelligence, but it's not quite stereotyped). <br /> <br /> Kady Lovable and the youngest daughter. I think the writers set up his character more on the show than his parents and Franklin <br /> Franklin I LOVE this character and I think they got it from Smart Guy (TJ Mowry) which lasted only one season . They did a great job of casting for this little genius (the effort would have been made if Jr would have been the smartest but also showed the downsides) <br /> <br /> All in all, this sitcom is wonderful and it is a tribute to the Cosby Show is well done, I love the show and I wish it had stayed longer than that. I can't wait to see the series finale
