Maybe it gets better. I wouldn't know I did it through the first twenty minutes or so before interrupting it and entering a period of mourning. It was obvious that the plot itself was familiar. A man, Paul LeMatt, professor of entymology at Columbia, leads his dog to a small Ohio town in search of his ex-wife, Diana Scarwid. There he meets people who ignore him or are hostile. Oh, they can smile, but there's something below. <br /> <br /> This type of arrangement is the home ground for film producers and viewers, and is full of possibilities. You can get a well-designed commercial success like "Bad Day at Black Rock". Or he would have done, and probably done, an episode of "Twilight Zone". <br /> <br /> The cast also includes some experienced artists, as well as some previously famous names. Kenneth Toby, a science fiction veteran, is the superficially amiable manager of the motel. Diana Scarwid can give an impressive performance, as she did in, for example, "Silkwood". For some of the others, their range is limited. <br /> <br /> But it's badly written and badly written. <br /> <br /> Example of poor management. That dog from LeMatt's is not appreciated by Kenneth Toby, at first sight. So when LeMatt comes out on the street, Toby sneaks up to his room window, peeks at the dog, and something strikes. Cut to LeMatt for the road. He hears his dog howling. Then a POV shot of presumably the dog hurtling towards LeMatt and then overtaking it as the wind blows and LeMatt stares at the camera. Cut on an identical shot - coming from the other direction! Whatever the camera represents, whatever LeMatt is staring at, it is never shown. Maybe it was nothing, because suddenly the wind stops and LeMatt is just in the street, a little perplexed. "You should never have brought that dog in the first place," notes Toby smiling from the porch. Question: what the hell is that scene? <br /> <br /> Example of bad writing. Well, TWO examples. (1) If you were to sit down and write a stereotypical waitress in a restaurant in a small town, without the exercise of any trade, you would think of an inexpressive girl with her hair tied up over her head, chewing gum, walking among the tables. Right. (2) Anything that looks like credibility is thrown out of the window in favor of special effects. LeMatt's car stops, then explodes as it waits to be repaired in the garage. Chugging to a halt: credible. Exploding: supernatural. Not even Edgar Allan Poe would support such an event. <br /> <br /> And the same invaders? Think of a modest masterpiece like "Invasion of the Body Snatchers". Something is wrong with the small town of Dr. Kevin McCarthy, and it takes half the movie to clear the mystery, and all the time the suspense is building and the doubt is growing. Here, twenty minutes into the film, a stranger enters a motel room and rips off his plastic face, revealing a pulsating brain that emits light and naked. The pregnancy was interrupted. <br /> <br /> I won't tell you the ending because I don't know what it is, nor do I care. I suppose it had something to do with insects, because otherwise Paul LeMatt would have been an entymologist? (By the way, who is managing his lessons?) But I'm not even sure if any bugs were involved. It is entirely possible that the error business is adventitious. Writers may have made him a specialist in insects and then forgotten everything. It wouldn't surprise me.
