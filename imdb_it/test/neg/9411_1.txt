Very mediocre script and acting. I was very surprised that the director managed to convince his cast with his empty story that tells us nothing new. Everything is in the clich√© of the "mentor" and the "talented immature student". The characters are not even interesting or funny. Artistically it is empty and insignificant. The colors are very impersonal and light. Only the poster can be attractive. Al Pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character without success. Too bad because sports bets can be a really interesting topic that many could refer to. But I can't have a complete comment on this film in any way, as I left the theater 20 minutes before the end. Everything was so predictable that it was a waistline of time ...
