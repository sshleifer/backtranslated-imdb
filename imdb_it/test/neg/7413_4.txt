An airplane with the daughter of a rich scientist descends into a dense forest. He assembles a group to visit her and the others, but the rescue team soon suspects that something is haunting them. Then further reasons for the shipment are revealed and this only adds to the existing tension. <br /> <br /> The film is a decent idea and a grip on the popular Sasquatch legend was destined to end up on the film sooner or later. However, the direction of the film breaks a fundamental rule of horror / thriller direction and this is showing too soon. Obviously the public knows that there is something that chases the characters, just read the title! But show what should have been the kicker of the film that soon spoils most of the suspense and, as a direct result, much of the fun. The film also lacks a good atmosphere and there are almost no landscape shots that show the expanse of wild nature, but there are many monster-point-of-view shots that add nothing to nothing. In fact, they have put 'Predator' out of place without shame. The low-budget horror film 'Wendigo' has done what this film tries to do much better. <br /> <br /> Some of the character tensions and a non-clich√© ending manage to compensate for this increase over the lousy pile, but it is still poor and given the premise and the potential, very disappointing. --- 4/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R for some violence and obscenity, but it's quite docile compared to most R-rated horror films.
