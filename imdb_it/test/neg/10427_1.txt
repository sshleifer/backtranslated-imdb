and I've seen a lot of movies. I saw him in the theater in 1989 and to this day I remember the disgusting impulse to go out. If you like John Belushi, respect his talent, or even the sanctity of cinema, this film has nothing to offer you. It is above all a pathetic showcase for the writer of the biography of Belushi, Bob Woodward. As we see the progression of Belushi's life pass on the screen, Woodward appears in the film as a ghost character. The most offensive scene occurs when Belushi is dying, looks up from his deathbed to see the author standing over him and saying faintly "Breathe for me, Woodward". There are too many terrible things to mention all of them, the last of which is the opening that took Belushi out of his body bag to the morgue and get into a taxi driven by a guy called "Angel". I'll leave it to this.
