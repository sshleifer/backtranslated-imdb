This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and takes the price of the rotten 2007 movie (which was made by me), however this movie lacks all the ingredients of a good movie, I mean bad actors from the performance, the story is just shit. I'm really sorry that they could have done better things than this piece of junk. I just lost time and money in this movie. I wish the production company could return my money. Anyway, I would have had high expectations on this film, and I was disappointed. I don't recommend anyone to watch this. so if you want to waste money on something do it on something other than this piece of junk.
