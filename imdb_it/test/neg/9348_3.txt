Wow. The plot of this was simply incredibly stupid. I realize that this film should have been of a comic genre. But anyway, even nonsense should make at least a vague sense. <br /> <br /> Has water become an incredibly rare substance? <br /> <br /> Well, it's strange, considering that hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the most abundant substances in the universe. And easy enough to do. Glomp together hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and voila, water. <br /> <br /> Instead of water, the rarity of dilithium crystals or something similar should have been used as a weft device like something that pirates would go after. Water as a plot tool was just stupid, stupid, stupid. <br /> <br /> The "comedy" seemed tiring, forced and forced. The TV series comedy "Red Dwarf" was tiring, forced and forced, but actually it was fun. Here instead, I felt like saying: "Ha ha, it was so funny, I forgot to laugh ..." Sigh ... all that money put in sets, costumes, actors ... what a waste ... <br /> <br /> Rather than complaining and complaining about its weakness, my suggestions for making it better: 1) Use a credible plot device. 2) Get rid of the "comedy". None of the actors was really good at it. The film would work better as a "serious" action adventure. <br /> <br /> The obvious intention of the writers was to make a reckless comedy, but they did not get away with it. It is not likely that I will ever look at it again. It's a total hacking job too.
