I really don't know why so many people love this movie: maybe it's fun, OK, but it totally ruined one of the best novels ever written. As the author himself said, this film betrayed the book: not only is the plot violently reduced to about 1/3, but all the symbols, all the complexity, everything is lost in a very fashionable fantasy / adventure film 80s. Today we have effects, directors, a new focus on books: I hope that someone (Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, Hayao Miyazaki ...) will one day direct the true story of Neverending. A great dead writer, a wonderful book and many lovers of literature deserve it.
