The cast of "All That" returns in good spirits in the "Good Burger", a place similar to an old-fashioned fast food restaurant. Comedy is fantastic, fun is continuous, and even if clich√©, it is a passer-by for comedy for children and families. <br /> <br /> A film for all ages, this film is designed to have fun, laugh and enjoy a very lazy movie for a rainy day, because that's what I'd like to save this movie for, a rainy day. The US broadcast it today, and since I know the cast of "All That" is in it, I thought it might be a bit of a giggle, but in good fun, like Keenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell (probably one of the the best young duets of that time) were fantastic together, the pieces came together, and everything worked, and made it a good family fun along with a few days of lazy work to get out of the bad day. <br /> <br /> Can I take your order?
