This is just the same old crap that is thrown up by amateur idiots who have no idea how to make a movie - maybe that's why it's a movie that wants to be directed at the video! <br /> <br /> I guess it's my fault for spending money to see it (one of the worst decisions I've ever made). What a waste. I usually like B movies, some are actually pretty good - but this is just too ridiculous and stupid to even be funny. <br /> <br /> The losers who made this junk deserve to be taken out of the market to waste everyone's time and money, making a film that obviously doesn't even deserve to be filmed! These so-called filmmakers have absolutely no talent! <br /> <br /> Stupid plot, horrible acting (especially the drag queens - what sicko could actually find so sexy?!), lame writing (if there was even a script - it looks like the type of bull * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * What is surprising about this film is the complete lack of something well done. <br /> <br /> How much attention to the Would it take details to ensure that every frame of a film would be so below every reasonable standard? I don't think it would be possible to make such a bad film intentionally, and it is inconceivable that pure misfortune can produce results so terribly bad. > <br /> Anyway, avoid this stinking bomb at all costs! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
