Having sat down and watched this movie, I can't help wondering why I created the film. This was undoubtedly one of the worst films I have ever seen and had no saving characteristics. <br /> <br /> If it had to be fun, it could have been a very weak comedy, but as an action thriller it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Slow, no plot, no real action, nothing comes close to a good dialogue and I have no idea of ​​the characters. What else can I say. To avoid.
