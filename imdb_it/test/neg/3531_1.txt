I saw this movie at Temple University. I can't imagine that anyone will ever see this movie in a theater (projected on film). The acting is similar to Saved By The Bell (The TV Show). The plot is simple and without imagination. The sound recorder likes the sound of the wind and the DP needs a light meter. Vampires, Vampires, Vampires. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money.
