Chili Palmer is tired of making movies and knows he wants to make some success in music. Being a mafioso, half expert negotiator, he wants to grow in the music market. However, know that everyone is like him and making sure that the good singer Linda Moon will record a success will be more difficult than expected. The first part is fun and full of irony, this falls into easy lines and has many less beautiful moments. Only the two women (Uma and Milian) are decent on their side. Much of the film is made with a histrionic character, excessively exaggerated (a bit is OK, too much is disgusting) and the only one that can be saved is the gay bodyguard, who, at least is consistent, the rest is too idiotic. The most surprising thing is that the film is not boring, everything happens so fast and there are so many things that happen that you don't have time to get bored, if you want to follow the movie. It can insult your intelligence (a lot!), And the movie is ugly (yes!), But, well, it's not boring.
