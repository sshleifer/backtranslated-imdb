A blind man could have made this film better ... seriously! The director is clearly a novice. It must be Dennis Hopper's coke or something to convince him to participate in this movie. I felt so embarrassed for Dennis. <br /> <br /> For John, the director ... PLEASE withdraw from directing. Your contribution is neither necessary nor wanted. The medium of the film is stronger without you. You are terrible in directing. Stick to shopping bags or something. <br /> <br /> This film was supposed to get around it "directly to the video" and become "packed up". I'm a stupid person for watching this movie. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM IF YOU RESPECT AND RESPECT THE ART OF THE FILM!
