Detective Burt Williams has been on the trail of the notorious Poe killer for almost three years. The daughter Kris Williams, the mother of a murder for the FBI along with her partner Sean Michaels, takes over. Burt reluctantly leaves the case and retires. the next seven months the "Poe Killer" continues its murderous fury until Kris discovers that the killer uses chat rooms to seduce his prey. Log in as Annabel Lee and is quickly captured by Poe's killer. It's time for Burt to find the sadist and free his daughter before it's too late. An amateur horror film and supremely courageous, without suspense and a little horror. The acting is hilariously terrible, the characters are painfully stupid and the killer is not threatening. Or have I seen very few indie horror films .3 out of 10.
