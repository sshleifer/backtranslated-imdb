GAME .... Eh ... game. I'm not even sure that the damn guests of that particular reality game know what "GAME" means, let alone the bloody PLAYERS in the game! <br /> <br /> An aspiring PUA would look at him and think ... Hmmmmm ... that the flying FORK was that useless excuse for a demonstration of seductive women? I saw my DOG neighbors seduce women with more verve than that! And it's a bloody UGLY dog! And his main approach tactic is to frantically throw his legs! <br /> <br /> I challenge the frustrated chump guests of that show at SHOW-down; a demonstration of their so-called resilience ... Can they deliver? If one is to see that piece of non-reality-drivel, then you realize, No, this huge, mentally-masturbating, succh-me-dear-boyfriend, want to be a guest of Queer Eye or something similar (not that there is something wrong with that ...), I'm not able to dismantle their penises long enough to provide a demo of a real pickup. <br /> <br /> As amiable North Americans they say "... 'Nuff Said! ..." <br /> <br /> A message from Down Under ... with Love ....
