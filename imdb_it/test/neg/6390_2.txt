This film has just arrived in Mexico and since I read good reviews here I decided to go see it with my friends and my girlfriend, but I was very disappointed, I don't understand how people can vote for it 10/10 I mean the script and the direction was beautiful, but a great film as a whole needs a good story that was missing entirely from this film. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed several Asian and European dramas but they had a good story, watch this movie at your own risk if you are not Eastern or Orthodox I don't think you'll like it. <br /> <br /> Half the people in the theater left including my 4 friends who had been waiting outside since they were really bored so it was me but I always wait until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it was extremely slow, with a lot of time wasted scenes, the total length of the story could have been shown in no more than 40 minutes, but made it longer having the scenes of the monk take the charcoal which is like 15 minutes of the total film plus panoramic views and so on, until a full-length movie became boring. <br /> <br /> I recommend you listen to me if you watch him come back and vote this comment as useful after the departments to help people avoid this waste of money.
