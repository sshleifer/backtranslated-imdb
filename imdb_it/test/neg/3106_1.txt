Yes, that's right. If I had to ask my friends this question: "What is the worst movie you've ever seen?" They could answer something like "Armageddon" (can you dig the hole?!?), "Shriek", "Plan nine from outer space", "The medallion", "Scooby Doo", etc ... No - Don't get offended by this thinking they saw something that could be in the same human fertilizer department that was naturally produced in this film. If the worst movie you can think of is, let's say so badly it really pisses you off; then you don't know anything my friend. <br /> <br /> Crazy Six ... I remember the day when a friend and I went to the local video store to rent a movie. Both of us had already been through most of the movies, and in the "new movies", we see it with us. "Wow, there are some good actors here, saying something about the mafia, let it go and get out of here". This was undoubtedly the film's worst mistake in my love life. It was also the worst mistake for everyone else: a lover of movies or not. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as fun as watching a glass of ice water (or iced tea ...) until it reaches room temperature. Watching this movie will make you dream of an eternal dream of death, if death is just darkening light and nothing, and then you realize that you are simply staring at your TV monitor. Not staring. In reality you are paying all the attention that is humanly possible. This is not a joke. <br /> <br /> This film is the perfection of making a bad movie. It's not the kind of evil you can watch, bet and laugh, it's the kind of movie that is so ugly that you really can't get out of your memory. Unless you use electric shock therapy to clear the brain. .... ... (hey, it could be something like how I remember myself and my friend after watching it ....) <br /> <br /> My best regards from me to you Albert Pyun. <br /> <br /> -Joergen
