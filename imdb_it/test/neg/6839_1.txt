Resolutely terrible. You might think that all the famous actors involved in this film make it at least credible, but they don't - this is a stinker. <br /> <br /> The characters run around without having a good reason to know where they are going, or if they are standing making constipated faces when they should run to save their lives. <br /> <br /> Check your superior brain function on the door if you're going to try watching this movie. Or put together a group of your most intelligent friends and give them the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" treatment. This is what I was doing in the second part of this turkey. <br /> <br /> PLEASE do not confuse this with the excellent movie "Day of the Jackal", a thriller far superior than 30 years ago.
