If you are looking for a movie with beautiful shots of Mount Everest, then you can enjoy this movie. Simply jump to the viewpoint of the mountain. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Alert) However, if you, like me, believe that lives are precious and do not go to waste, this film will leave a bad taste in your mouth. 6 people died, 5 sherpas and one member of the Japanese party just because a man could try skiing on Everest. <br /> <br /> The question is raised in the film as to whether the continuation of the expedition could meet his personal goal was still worth the cost of lives and responds with an emphatic "Yes". <br /> <br /> The skiing part is in the last 15 minutes. Ski for a short time, then fall for the rest of the way until it stops on the snow.
