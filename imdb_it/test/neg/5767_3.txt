Let me start by saying I LOVE horror movies. Big budget, low budget, big name actors, no name actors, it doesn't matter. And when it comes to judging movies, I'm very forgiving. This film, however, is rather ugly. <br /> <br /> The actors show little or no emotion when they say their lines and the acting is worse than many lower-budget horror films I've seen. If the actors were killed, you could care less. There is very little blood (I have no idea what movie the other reviewers saw when they say there's good blood in this, because it's not there) and the special effects are below average. They steal so much from so many better horror films (Jeepers Creepers, Friday 13, Leprachaun) and it still doesn't help. <br /> <br /> Luckily I saw this on Showtime and didn't really have to pay any other money to see it or waste a place in my Netflix queue on it. There are so many better horror movies out there and I suggest you see those instead of this big disappointment.
