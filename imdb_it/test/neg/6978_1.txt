This film is an abomination of everything that is worthy of making films. The main actor surprises his audience by not acting at all. We have to look at almost two hours of his dull and soulless face. The jokes are all lame I never laughed once it was Saturday night we were 5 to drink a beer to laugh and then we put this and you could hear all the heat and color that was discharged from the room. The film ended and the atmosphere was ruined, so we all went in separate ways, ruined the night! OK then pros and cons. Great Hawaiian setting, looks good on bluray. The worst actors will ever act; you can say that all those interested are just thinking about payday. Predictable unpredictable plot Development of the character zero. Forced beats that fall flat. Many strokes of the penis guys that to be fair acts better than him and has more charisma. Let all the creators of this film hang their heads in shame and keep their flabby manhood cheap.
