Developing films based on real events involving cryptozoology or the supernatural has always been a challenge for directors and screenwriters. You mainly need to reconcile the testimonies reported, the sources of conflicting information and the creativity of Hollywood to produce something in which the public can enter. Unfortunately, for SASQUATCH, none of these things seem to take place. <br /> <br /> The film begins in the typical film noir when a research group crashes somewhere in the Falls by air. From there the research group disappears and, despite attempts by the police and local aid, they remain missing for some time. While one of the passengers is walking, infrared images (a Predator) appear on the screen, subtly suggesting that the legendary Sasquatch is the cause of the passengers' fate. <br /> <br /> Cue Harlan Knowles (Henriksen), CEO of BioComp Industries and father of one of the accident victims. Knowles brings together his search and rescue team with the explicit mission of finding his daughter and the rest of the research team, along with the valuable technology lost during the incident. <br /> <br /> Bespoke rescue of After Knowles team is put together, the entire film crosses the path of colorless characters, dizzying cinematography, and a totally unoriginal line plot. I literally had to avoid falling asleep during this movie while trying to scare me from my wits. The only member of the cast who held his was Henriksen, who does not compensate for the lack of depth presented in all the other characters. Even the excessive sound effects were annoying; after all, I didn't know if I was watching a movie about Bigfoot or grizzly. <br /> <br /> Nor was the plot so beautiful. It was too underdeveloped as the viewer is mainly subject to the typical scary music found in something similar to the genre. Obviously you didn't have to be a genius to figure out who would take out all their clothes in the middle of the movie, or who would be the first unlucky soul to be taken by Mr. Sasquatch. As for the positive points, there are none, so I gave this film a 2 out of 10.
