I can't believe I wasted even a NetFlix rental on this complete piece of CRAP. How long did it take to make this film? 15 minutes? With a budget of what? Fifteen dollars? I can spend a few hours with my Sony camera and find something better than this treacherous piece of bile, and it's also available on DVD !? !! A very sad thing to think that classics like The Stepfather have not been released on DVD but this piece of steaming dung makes it in the format. Here is hoping that my evaluation of ONE ONE ONE makes the overall rating (already) pathetic of 2.5 going down.
