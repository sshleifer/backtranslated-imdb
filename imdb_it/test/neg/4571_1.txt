I saw Cheats a few years ago with my friend. He started it as a great funny movie that is one of the best comedies ever. I think it was on the crack or something. Recently I learned that this film was not released in cinemas, I can understand why perfectly. <br /> <br /> The basic plot involves a group of guys who practically cheat all their school assignments to get good grades. This is the main problem of this film: the moral is all bad. There are other teen comedy films in which students do bad things, but it's more often than not stuff that doesn't take place in school. So I think the concept of having a whole movie that basically has kids that betray everything is pretty ugly. <br /> <br /> I don't even like the characters in this movie. The main character is an arrogant and smug idiot who is not a good protagonist. Actually I'm not sure you can say that there is a protagonist because everyone is cheating at school that is wrong. The other supporting characters were not at all funny and basically the cast shots of this movie. <br /> <br /> This film has a bad message and, worse still, acting and characters. There are other films for teenagers that are much better than this movie. So you don't have to see this and that's a good thing because I absolutely don't recommend this movie.
