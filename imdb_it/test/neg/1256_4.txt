Well, the film wasn't terrible, but whoever created the script didn't do a good job even creating the essence of anger. This film was slightly below average and did not tell the story correctly about one of the most interesting people ever born. I suggest reading the book "one of a kind", the true story of anger. They left out huge parts of his life. Moreover, sometimes they did not understand the true chaser he was. The real facts of his life were sometimes out of order. And in the end they didn't really represent the true personality he had. So please don't watch the movie; read the book. By the way, I'm not just an asshole who feels he has to stay 100% in the real story, but they haven't even come close !!!
