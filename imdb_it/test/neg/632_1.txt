I did my best to see this two-hour fiasco. He combined the horrible special effects and the plot of the original "Blob", with an exalting exaltation of the "Runaway Train" (exceptional in the original script). The only explanation for this film is that someone needed to take a huge tax deduction and imagined they would combine it with a blow in hosting a launch couch. What an incredible stinker! Lou Diamond Phillips is anxious to show us why he will take any part, no matter how bad. Barry Corbin continues his career as a creep typecast, a US senator from Texas and interprets it well. He should then play the leading role in the story of Trent Lott or Jesse Helms. The women in this film seem to have gotten their roles as consolation prizes in the screaming Fay Wray Memorial contest. The special effects are incredibly bad. H.S. children in film class in North Dakota could have done a better job. The writers must have thrown a bank robbery clich√© to accumulate so many. I could no longer look without being forced to sit in the Arancia Meccanica chair. I have no idea how it ended, except of course, 119 minutes too late. Ugh! Caveat emptor.
