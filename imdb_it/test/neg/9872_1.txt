Of course, when I had the chance to see this horrible movie legend, my expectations were pretty low. They weren't low enough. Scholckmaster Roger Corman somehow became the owner of the production rights of the Marvel comics characters in the late 1980s or early 1990s, and handed it over to Oley Sassone, whose work as a director was largely in TV series like "Hercules" and "Vipera". With an estimated total budget of $ 1.5 million, it was produced, shot and briefly published on video and then sent to the wasteland of the forgotten film. There should be left. However, like a banana peel in an act of vaudeville, this "Fantastic Four" is found in the ether waiting to cause a fall for those rare unfortunate and foolish enough to trample it. <br /> <br /> If you've ever heard of these comic book characters, you know what to expect. The people who did this were very faithful to the original material, and that's the only thing they deserve credit for in this fiasco. This presents the origins of the heroic group that develops superhuman powers when the shielding on their experimental spacecraft fails to protect them from cosmic radiation. Reed Richards (Alex Hyde-White) develops the ability to stretch his body and becomes "Mr. Fantastic". His girlfriend, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab) can become invisible, and his brother, Johnny (Jay Underwood) can spontaneously cause the fire bursting from his body Finally, Ben Grimm ("credited" by both Michael Bailey-Smith and Carl Ciafarlio) receives superhuman strength when his skin turns into a rock similar to a hyde and is therefore referred to as The Thing: There is a prologue that constitutes a former classmate of Reed, Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) to become their enemy, Dr. Doom, who orchestrates the sabotage of space flight of the Fantastic Four as an act of revenge for the wounds he blames on Reed. There is the set-up, then the discovery of the powers, the revelation of the villain and ultimately a climate struggle.There are more details for the poorly written script, but they are negligible. <br / > <br /> This is a simple movie because the creators (I use it in the technical sense of the term. t a lot of creative imagination at work here.) had legal rights to do so. The plot will undoubtedly be reflected in the long-awaited set of long-term budgets directed by Tim Story in 2005, but facing a massive project of special effects like this without a comparable budget or qualified actors qualifies as an act of cinematic madness. What special effects exist mostly hand-drawn or simple photographic tricks that have existed since the days of the original "The Great Train Robbery". When half the climate struggle returns to full animation, you're almost relieved to watch a cartoon instead of the poor actors who found themselves damned in this project. There is also little consistency of style in this casino. Most of the scenes are either flat in available light or wild primary colors, and the only scenes dressed are obvious science fiction pieces. There is work with the camera, but it is above all by keeping the characters centered on the screen and the minimum information flowing to the public. The change includes the possibility of leaving additional lines and using obvious wipes (at some point there is also a transition using the center of a number 4). Editing effects are also used to integrate poor special effects when The Thing transforms. The only scene where morphing technology was put into practice was shocking just because it was such a positive leap in quality. <br /> <br /> Working with the limited video camera is not unforgivable. In 'Clerks' only the simplest camera movements are used and there is almost no style. It worked for that film because it was about people whose lives had no style, and it was consistent. Kevin Smith has never allowed his reach to overcome his grip. "The Blair Witch Project" caused some viewers to suffer from car sickness due to the bad jokes they put together this pseudo-documentary. When all was said and done, it was an effective work on the terror of getting lost and being consumed by a frightening situation. There is no sense of history or theme here on both a spoken and a visual level. With this "Fantastic Four", you never get more than an accidental laugh due to the fact that directors and artists actually seem trying to rival other comic films with this cheap item. <br /> <br /> Each film takes a lot of time and work. It's so sad that so much of both has been poured into a project like this. If you are one of the people involved in this, it has probably been made as a springboard to the path of a (hopefully improved) film career. Everyone knows how to take jobs to make the most of what appears to be an opportunity. For those who are curious to see this film, my advice is to do it only with a group of friends (so you can all say "you looked too") who have been advised of the experience (so no one gets hurt by the shock ), and maybe you can invent an alcohol game to relieve the pain of accidental laughter. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10
