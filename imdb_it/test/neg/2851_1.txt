First of all I must say that I really love Udo Kier and I have always had respect for Armand Assante, but nothing could save this train of a film. Udo doesn't even appear much later in the film and Tutti's acting is simply terrible. The script is everywhere, the dialogue is wooden, the action is laughable and the plot can be summarized on a dirty napkin. I really wanted to find something redeemed in this film, but I found myself with my hands over my eyes, shaking my head and repeating endlessly "Oh Udo ..... why ??? .... Why ????" ? .. ". If you are a fan of Udo or Armand, please do not watch this movie. It will only make you sad for them.
