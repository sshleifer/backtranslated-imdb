This is what they came up with for the first feature film by comedian Carrot Top. <br /> <br /> A stupid surfer (carrot dude) inherits a research and development firm from an old kahuna (Jack Warden). Things are less than swimming, but they get much worse when the company is threatened by a hostile takeover attempt by corrupt raiders. The most unlikely thing about this movie is that the smart girl Courtney Thorne-Smith would find this kid with a charming red head in the slightest (but then, he just inherited millions). The "classic" moments include the comedian Larry Miller who drinks sweat from a plastic cup. <br /> <br /> Funny comedy? Try the humor of UN-funny toilets, and this is exactly where this is located - in the bathroom ... rinse twice.
