Ivan The Terrible is more a theater show than a "big screen". Citizen Kane - a similar job in many ways - is exactly the opposite (in the way we expect such a rate) as it has a lot of location shooting for example. <br /> <br /> The act is designed to convey the motivations of the character and the way of thinking about the public; if he can make you understand the character, what does it matter HOW it was done? And considering the low amount of action, how else can events that influence history be expressed, and consequently the machinations and decisions of characters other than "exaggerated movements"? <br /> <br /> Furthermore, there is a historical level because the style of acting should not be surprising. The rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany and the Soviet Union has forced filmmakers to stay behind to make films as they knew. Not being able to access more modern works that showed the evolution and techniques of cinema, they only used what they knew. <br /> <br /> The control of the Nazi government in Germany destroyed the great German film industry of the 1920s, due to their total control over that film industry. And propaganda films can only "entertain" too many German troops; hence the need for popular German silent films of the 1920s, for example. So many of the techniques in Ivan The Terrible's film would have come from German films so captivated provided to the film crew (as mentioned in other comments). <br /> <br /> There has been no confusion anywhere and although it has been found personally over-hyped, it is not at all a bad cinematic experience - and it is definitely NOT among the worst movies ever. Acting is fine, and part of the cinematography is excellent (even by today's standards, below). Definitely not a popcorn movie; you can't leave your brain out of this door. Dated maybe and very symbolic - it's worth watching on the big screen if you can't watch movies with lights turned off at home, because many of the movie elements will be lost in the B & W experience, mainly of these films. Everything depends on what expectations you have with ... <br /> <br /> ATTENTION - SPOILERS: Do not read the following comments, if they affect your personal vision of the film (s). <br /> <br /> ... and if we are not interested in the obvious communist propaganda (as opposed to capitalist propaganda). For Ivan it is how Stalin saw himself - obvious in his influence on the direction of the film (see other comments) - and anyone with a worldwide historical awareness outside the US perspective will surely understand it. Perhaps Ivan was a previous incarnation of Stalin, or maybe not; this is more of a diatribe on Stalin and his motivations, decisions, loneliness, lackey promotions, etc. - using the character of Ivan - of every real historical record of Ivan. Also note the obvious use of particular colors in the sequel: Red (for the USSR) in the banquet scene. And maybe blue (for the USA) during certain blows when the usurper wears the crown? <br /> <br /> But it has many excellent images like the profound use of shadows, or the external blow of the population that comes to beg The return of Ivan to Moscow.
