It is important to keep in mind the true meaning of the expression "Inspired by a true story" when looking at Pride. It's a bit like "You can save up to 50%", which can literally be translated into "You can't save more than 50%". It all sounds fantastic until you realize that the bottom of "up to" is "zero". Similarly, "inspired by a true story" means that someone has heard a story and made them think of it. The only certainty is that the real story and what you are about to see are not the same thing. <br /> <br /> There's a real Jim Ellis who started training the swim team at the Philadelphia Recreation Department in the early 1970s, but I have a feeling that the real Jim Ellis shouldn't be He was able to hide some feelings of disappointment at the way the film came out. Clearly, it takes wild liberties with the story of his life, and I just imagine him responding to the strange looks of his friends who wonder why the film is so different from the man they know. <br /> <br /> A Anyway, one thing he'll certainly be proud of is that he's played by Terrence Howard, one of our best actors, who starred alongside Bernie Mac who, despite the lack of an original story and powerful, it still gives a sincere and moving feeling performance. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the Philadelphia of the 70s, a time and place where racism was the norm, not the exception, and Jim Ellis, educated and professional, who is also a skilled swimmer, has difficulty finding a worth teaching position, until he is relegated to a crumbling recreation center, which is assigned the task of cleaning up before his demolition. We can certainly understand his feeling of belittling. <br /> <br /> When we first meet Elston, the maintainer (Bernie Mac), it is a wretched misfortune that sits in his office surrounded by heaps of rubbish that touch the ceiling and watch the daytime TV on an old dusty TV set. Needless to say, when Jim shows up to start cleaning up and freeing him, Elston isn't exactly friendly with him. He knew his recreation center was closed, and all his anger about it moved smoothly over Jim. <br /> <br /> Considering his past as a university swimmer, Jim is mainly interested in the swimming pool, which cleans and fills and takes maximum form. A group of black teenagers playing basketball just outside the recreation center are interested in the pool when their basketball board is taken away and the heat remains stifling, and soon the group will have a team of swimmers on the move, which will enter the whole city ​​swim meeting. To call them losers, of course, would be a sort of euphemism. They are disorganized, unprofessional, inadequately trained and have no idea how to behave during a swim. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter, of course. The film is your standard sports underdog story, so the first athletic release is totally irrelevant as something other than a learning experience, a catalyst to guide their training much harder and more focused that will lead to the last athletic exit , what matters. By now, the only thing that a sports film has intention is that the protagonists should not win at the peak of the film, we just have to understand the meaning and meaning of their effort. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film has all the character development of an old Seagal movie. The good guys are the good guys because they should be, and the bad guys are the bad white swimmers who laugh and taunt and make racist jokes in our team. Oh, and there's a scene where one of the white guys kicks one of the black guys underwater while he's in the middle of a race. I didn't know it was really possible to kick someone underwater like that, but you have the idea of ​​how deep the character development is. <br /> <br /> We understand that this is the group of kids that Jim Ellis has transformed from the children going through the streets doing nothing with their lives and into an organized and competitive team of swimmers, but other than that they don't we really know nothing about who they are. <br /> <br /> But the biggest problem is that the only real claims of the film are that effort and organization lead to success and racism is bad. Both are so obvious that when a film is made only with them it ends up feeling empty and useless. Racism was much more powerful in the United States in the 1970s than it seems a huge loss that the film dealt directly with that problem, but did not really talk about it. It's kind of a good movie, but when it's over and you realize how much it should have said it's much bigger than what he said, the feeling of well-being turns into a sad disappointment.
