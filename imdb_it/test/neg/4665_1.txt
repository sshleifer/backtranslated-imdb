This film has bad writing and bad editing. It's hard to follow what's happening because nothing the characters do make much sense. Some serious disasters occur every 30 seconds. As a result, none of the "action" sequences is at all interesting. The film has two hours of "throw away" scenes that are simply linked by the fact that they share common actors. This film doesn't even have enough sense of humor to be a good "bad" movie.
