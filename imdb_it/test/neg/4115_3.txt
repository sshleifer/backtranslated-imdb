In a future where an industrious travel agency uses time travel technology to send wealthy clients back in time for explorations into the dinosaur era, the future is inexplicably changed when one of their customers breaks the cardinal rule of not moving away from the path. In an attempt to correct the damage, an expert scout (Edward Burns) collaborates with the inventor of technology (Catherine McCormack). <br /> <br /> The premise is quite good and engaging. It may have some flaws but it could still make an interesting movie. Unfortunately, A Sound of Thunder fails to attract public attention. He suffers from a series of problems and takes himself too seriously, so it's really hard to have fun watching the movie. Personally, I thought the script was the biggest problem in the film. They were more holes in the plot than expected and the film was rather lazy in explaining things. I was hoping for a closer look at the "butterfly effect", but the film was more fun than anything else. Okay with me since 90 minutes of unreasonable fun is still a nice way to spend an evening. However, all the fun offered by this film was involuntary and lame. There were some scenes that entertained me but I was rather bored. <br /> <br /> Acting is not much better as most of them seem more interested in a salary than anything else. The only person who performed well was Ben Kingsley. He kept the first half of the film enjoyable and seemed to have enjoyed it more. Edwards Burns was rather pale and insipid. I don't think he has what it takes to be a leading man. However, he could become a decent support actor. Catherine McCormack was really annoying and not very credible. I haven't really seen her in anything else, but she could have potential. The other actors also give bad performances, even though most of them are relatively unknown, so it shouldn't affect their careers too much. <br /> <br /> Looking at the message boards, most people complain about special effects. There is no way to coat them with sugar and they are terrible. All dinosaurs look really bad. Gibbon lizards (part ape, part dino), while a creative idea, become stale after a while and are more likely to encourage laughter rather than fear. Green screen work looks horrible and unprofessional. I was really wondering which director Peter Hyams was trying to make here. It fails to provide suspense, action and chills and makes this movie a long sit. For the most part though, the film is quite harmless and is far from the worst movie of 2005. We hope we will remake this film in the future. There is potential in this project but for now this is the best we have. In the end, unless curiosity gets the better of you, there's no reason to see A Sound of Thunder. Evaluation 4/10
