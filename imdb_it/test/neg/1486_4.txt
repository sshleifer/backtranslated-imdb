There was a good accumulation of suspense everywhere. Photography was surprisingly good considering such a small budget. We are witnessing occasional good acting spells, however, this is quickly deflated by some fairly rough lines. Understandably there wouldn't be much intellectual conversation sitting in the trees while a crocodile is chasing you. Silence would have been golden here. There might have been a bigger game of suspense than to say vaguely: "I sat in the cupboard for fear of my brother ..." Something tells me that there is a slight difference in getting a beating from your brother rather than being eaten by a mighty 15-foot croc. . You decide. In the whole film I cannot find a connection or, for this reason, sympathy with the characters, perhaps because they do not develop one for the whole film, a character that is. There are some occasional beautiful scares when the crocodile creeps into the characters, again overshadowed by some questionable scenes. In one case we should be terrified by an ear floating in the water, but then we sit next to a decapitated corpse and without limbs and we only care about a broken finger. A definite roller coaster of a film when it comes to logic.
