I can't find anything good in this miniseries. Why the hell did you banish chocolate when you could ban something much more practical like smoking or alcohol? Even the fact that it's an Australian program and everything is set in England and everyone pretends British accents is stupid. Overall I think this show is unrealistic and cheap.
