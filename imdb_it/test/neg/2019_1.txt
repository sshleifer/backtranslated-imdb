Being a big fan of the horror film, one of the most difficult things to consider considering the lack of abundance of good films in the genre, and having seen hundreds of them in my life, I must say that Dracula 3000 is by far the most banal, piece of lame and badly made garbage I had the misfortune to see. YOU ARE AWAY FROM THIS FILM! It's so ugly that it's not even ridiculous. The special effects (I said "special"?) They were probably reached by spending a couple of dollars, the acting was terrible and the script should have ended up in the trash after the first reading from the studio that decided to tackle this miserable project. The entire film was literally filmed in a warehouse. Also, for you guys out there who love nudity in your movies, don't be fooled by the R rating. If you're thinking about having the chance to see Erika Eleniak even half naked, you're wrong. She is completely dressed during the entire movie. And the cover is completely misleading! There is no scene anywhere in the film that looks marginally like the fantastic cover they put on the box to draw unsuspecting horror fans. <br /> <br /> Too bad the rating is only 1 to 10. I would give this film a -10. Be warned Don't waste your money or your time with this.
