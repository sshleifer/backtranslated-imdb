Robin Williams is excellent in this film and it is a pity that the material is not enough for him. This can work if you buy in "U-S-A! Number One!" mentality but the plot doesn't happen much. Really a shame because the film is really trying to say something, and it says it sincerely. It doesn't have enough emotional punch.
