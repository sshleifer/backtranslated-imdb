MacBeth, I always thought, is the most accessible of Shakespeare's "Great Period" comedies. Compact, concentrated, with a lot of violence, it should have been the most open game for screen adaptations. However, I am not aware of a really good rendition of the story: the best result is the vigorous version of Orson Welles. To the list of MacBotches we have to add the effort Connery / Baxendale. <br /> <br /> (It seems that it was not a "film adaptation" at all, but a television version which was given a theatrical release, post Luhrman's Romeo + Juliet and Branagh's Hamlet. This could explain some of its flaws , but don't excuse them.) <br /> <br /> It starts well, with an exuberant battle sequence with pleasantly looking witches. The poor old Gray Malkin and Paddock are cut from the opening scene, but they haven't been alone for a long time. In a quick order they are joined by the bloody Sargent and his account of the battle, by the betrayal of the Thane of Cawdor, by the unfaithful master of the Tiger, even by MacBeth's encounter with Duncan when he is run over as Cawdor's thane. They all had virtues that prayed like angels playing their tongues against the dark damnation of their sending, but they were expelled. These aren't the only cuts, either. This is MacBeth in a hurry. <br /> <br /> From the opening battle we are directly involved in the meeting of MacBeth with the witches, which is well done. Curiously, Brian Blessed directed the witch sequences, and he has a lot of fun with the special effects of MacBeth and Banquo told of their fate. Jason Connery as MacBeth is embarrassing, obviously unsure of what to do with the verse. Graham MacTavish as Banquo, on the other hand, is capable, making his lines natural and easy. Within minutes of Connery's grumbling, the viewer is struck by the urge to see the roles reversed and MacTavish in the lead role. No wonder MacBeth felt the need to kill him. <br /> <br /> These first minutes mark the highest point in the film. From there we move on to Helen Baxendale receiving the news of her husband. She is lost like Connery and has denied the beard she hides behind. His invocation of evil "Unsex me here" is embarrassing, not disturbing. There are some reasonably intelligent touches - "We'll talk further" about MacBeth is not a sign of his hesitation in the face of his wife's evil ambition, but his attempt to silence her while throwing her on the bed. <br /> <br /> Acting leads is the biggest disappointment. Connery's method consists of staring at the screen while mumbling his monologues through the voiceover. Baxendale seems pinched and neurotic. An attempt to do something interesting with "This is a dagger" - the fantastic dagger is a shadow cast by a cross on an altar - it falls to the ground due to the poor delivery and the neglected direction of Connery, which blows up the whole production. We accompany Lady MacBeth into the crime chamber, where she comes to stab the Duncan revival, but the effect is comic, not dramatic. <br /> <br /> Big scenes are messed up - Banquo's appearance at the party is made incomprehensible through attempts to mix the subjective rendering of MacBeth's illusion with what he sees or does not see. The second encounter with witches is even less consistent, and prophetic visions are confused. Timing seems to be a problem here - Banquo's banquet is the central point of the drama, but the film moves quickly towards the conclusion after it, giving it an unbalanced and aimless sense for the complexity of the riddles in which MacBeth is captured for be appreciated, or because his descent into madness is convincing. Another crucial cut is the scene in which Malcolm tests MacDuff and MacDuff to discover the murder of his family. This steals his vengeance from most of his emotional strength - and the character of much of the time on the screen. He is a virtual stranger when he shows up to kill MacBeth. <br /> <br /> A point to try. MacTavish's Banquo gains another. The first few minutes make another one. But that's all. From that moment on it is sound and fury bla bla bla.
