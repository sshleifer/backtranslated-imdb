This is pure CRAP, and probably the worst biblical film of all time ... Absolutely inaccurate, I mean, they put Sodom and Gomora BEFORE the great flood. They described Lot as a friend of Noah even though he lived after Noah. To make matters worse, after Lot became a pirate and attacks Noah's Ark during the flood !!! ??? And what happens to the merchant who comes on a boat that is moved on the water with a bicycle mechanism ??? And exchange alcohol for food and water, and then Noah is portrayed as an alcoholic! Scherno and continuous curses one after the other, and goes on and on, and ... The director and all the participants have surely secured the first row in hell with this garbage ... <br /> Please stay away this shit, because it will save you almost three hours of your life.
