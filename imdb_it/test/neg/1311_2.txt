Topical? Certainly. Fun? Probably - but only on the removal of every shred of the spectator's common sense. Reality? Only in so much that it was created on this planet. <br /> <br /> As it was supposed that thousands of people had died due to a water wall of 5 meters in a city strewn with buildings in excess of 25 meters in height are above me. Carlyle's line of "how could someone survive?" when shooting shows forests of buildings with different floors above the water it is completely ridiculous. Furthermore, if someone engages in an area (underwater) where an air cylinder is not sufficient (ie they are about to die), why not use the simple expedient of taking more than one cylinder? Clearly, the writer thinks that people in stressful situations cannot count beyond a (a cylinder, a plan). <br /> <br /> Rather than looking at this tripe, you would be more knowledgeable and entertained by throwing away the DVD and reading the pricing information on the outer cellophane wrap. <br /> <br /> Merciful, truly pitiful and a terrible waste of talent on the screen. <br /> <br /> As for the sexist propaganda that suggests that only women can see through problems to illuminate the solutions that must be carried out by expendable men: even more PC 'tosh'. No wonder that First Blood, Delta Force, Navy Seals and other films of little or no value always have a sequel while this clearly politically motivated sentinel is doomed.
