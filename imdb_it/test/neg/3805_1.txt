Being stuck in bed with the flu and feeling too hard to get up to look for the remote, I really watched this abomination from beginning to end (how many people can say this? And for anyone who can ... what's your excuse? ). My God, has there ever been, EVER been a total disaster released by a large studio? There is no second of real tension in an alleged "thriller"; the script is inept and ridiculous; the sets seem to be leftovers from a low-budget TV movie; and the cast ... WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN THINKING? !!! Sally Field gives what is undoubtedly the worst and embarrassing performance of any Oscar winner in history. His irritating nasal whining and stupidly vivacious behavior in what should be a life-threatening situation are really donkey. It is surprising that he has not used all his future earnings to buy and destroy every print of this turkey. Michael Caine, who is now pontificated to infinity on the art of film acting - even performing master classes for aspiring actors - should be removed and shot (preferably by one of Telly Savalas's henchmen). Angela Cartwright, an actress who I usually like (and whose name is not even in the opening credits, poor soul), is ten years too old for her role, and her horrible yellow matroneum matron dress must obsess the his nightmares to date. After all, it's Karl Malden and Shirley Knight - hopefully they've picked up a big pay package to placate their involvement. The whole film is a series of ugly scenes, but what strikes me in particular is the explosion that results in the "ceiling" (if the bridge of an upturned boat can be defined as such) that collapses and a load of boxes empty cardboard falling through! Ooh, what a scare! Really, really, terrible.
