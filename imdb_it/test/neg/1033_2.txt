I love documentaries. Andy Goldsworthy's doc was fantastic. I was looking forward to it, but I was very disappointed. I knew Kahn and was intrigued by the idea of ​​his solitary death in a men's room in Penn Station. There must be a story here, I mistakenly believed. The only story here is of sadly disappointed women who have had relationships with an ugly and famous married man. In the absence of an explanation for this boy's horrible behavior, we are given endlessly repeated Kahn clips that run and painfully long - presumably contemplative - shots of his soulless buildings. In fact, some of the buildings are interesting but the thrust of the film asks us to think of himself. The overwrought soundtrack refers to an emotional jerk that is completely absent from the film. Kahn's apparent gifts do not justify his behavior or martyr his lovers. This film seems to want to give Kahn the free pass for the great artist and make the director and his mother's funny figures - I don't buy it.
