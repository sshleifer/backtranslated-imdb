I rarely give votes less than 5, but in this case I have to weigh. Elmore Leonard is a great writer with many wonderful and complex books, original characters, sparkling dialogues, invigorating twists. The films based on his books date back to Hombre (Paul Newman), Majestyk (Bronson) and Out of Sight (Clooney / Lopez) among others. Even when done that way, movies have at least some measure of the essence of the story. This is not simply a worthy addition to the catalog. <br /> <br /> Acting is bad (I don't know why, because there are very capable people here) and the story is handled with stupidity. The characters are reorganized, chemistry is missing, actors and actresses are misinterpreted. <br /> <br /> Since Elmore Leonard is a truly exceptional storyteller, I hope that anyone who does not know his work would be dissuaded from reading his books because they have seen this disappointing version of one of his stories. <br /> <br /> History is a sequel to Get Shorty. If you haven't seen that movie, don't watch it. If you've seen Get Shorty, don't proceed with this. <br /> <br /> I saw Be Cool a few years ago, and tonight I revisited the video. The first time he must not have had such a negative impression because I had forgotten how depressing this sequel was. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I don't think less of those who appeared in this movie for doing it. They probably expected something more. Get Shorty was original and very funny. I almost always like Travolta, but it's much better in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and in the previous Get Shorty. He was clearly unable to enjoy what was happening here. <br /> <br /> And I feel that Freaky Deaky, another Elmore Leonard book, is in pre-production for the 2008 release. I hope they can do it. <br /> <br /> Read the books. They are almost all fantastic.
