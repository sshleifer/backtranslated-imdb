Heaven, Mary and all the Saints above! A young man has a super sperm, is a miracle of bejesus, calls the Pope, all women desperately trying to get prayers, line up the door and leave the most beautiful signs and sparks! A comedy of retro-receptive comedies, which tries to bring you some of the Irish charm. It has an effect like placing two fingers in your own throat, voamitus maximus! One in ten!
