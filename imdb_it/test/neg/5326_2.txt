One of the most stupid films in the history of cinema. Wait, I take it back, this film cannot be included in any category related to "cinema"; belongs to categories such as "waste", bullshit or similar categories. Ironically, they are also two of the guardians. The film is "Men At Work", a light criminal comedy starring the Estevez brothers (Sheen) since 1990. Setting aside the line asinine and implausible plot, bad acting, bad dialogue, poorly executed acrobatics and slapstick, errors of continuity and high rate of no-name actors ever seen, all in all it was still a rather ugly film (deep down, I mean). It was the kind of movie that could be good for one thing: you can watch it about 200 times, learn every line, and campy in a way, repeating it back and forth in public with your * wasted * friends, thus securing your status as the greatest idiots of your tenth class class. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I actually submitted an IMDb article on IMDb (along with this negative review) to the film's IMDb page, if only because I noticed a stupid punk joke that apparently no one else has seen yet (on the Butthole Surfer statue). I'm so in conflict about why I should also * waste * my time by submitting what seems like a note of encouragement, when I want to do is blow up Emilio's acting career (no, wait, he already did same friend!) I am so happy to have * wasted only this time, not real money. After all, can I have at least a tenth of their budget? Anyone other than this director (Emilio) could have made two or three much better films with what they had spent by blowing up cars, carefully arranging bimbos in bikinis and tearing apart the useless cronies (henchmen) in pinafore dresses. I will quote the written credit of Emilio, but it would be a sudden to call this script "written" - it is more like ideas of comic books scribbled in pastel. And Charlie Sheen, if you're reading this, I assume M.A.W. It must have been done during the part of your career where you were a Hollywood kid who loved prostitution and hadn't grown up yet. (Oops! Sorry, I guess part of your life is not over yet. Get well soon, you're "half man." Such a promising talent, so * wasted * ?? oh look, there's that word again.)
