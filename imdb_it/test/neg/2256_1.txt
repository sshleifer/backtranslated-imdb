I'll start with some quotes from other reviewers who describe it better. <br /> <br /> "This is easily one of the most overrated movies of the year and probably the worst movie Tarantino ever made." "The ONLY good thing in this film was Mr. Waltz's performance." <br /> <br /> "So I was really disappointed and seeing this movie on the # 40 spot of the best movies of all time is the only thing on this, that leaves me with my mouth open" Now for more details go to read "hate" reviews. <br /> <br /> One thing I hate about a movie is when it treats the audience like a bunch of stupid people. (Spoiler ahead). Now I know that Tarantino's style is based on fantastic and imaginative fantasies, but come on, Adolf Hitler and 200 top Nazi officers will be present at a premiere of the film in occupied France and you only have two guards in the whole theater and around? Where even an African-American walks freely with steel tubes, closing the doors and setting fire. These 2 guards are then executed in a few seconds by opening the door for our 2 "heroes" to kill Hitler point-blank with about 100 shots ... very stupid. At least, challenge our intelligence and create a smarter storyline to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time (go look at Valkyrie). Furthermore, Mike Myers' imitation of a British general is more realistic and authentic than the guy Hitler is doing, but imagine that. <br /> <br /> What has ruined him further, is that the only intelligent and powerful character who nailed all the film, with his psychological and disturbing interrogations, ends up being effortlessly deceived by the most senseless character of the film. <br /> <br /> After seeing the film, I was in solidarity with the Nazis, who were portrayed to have more courage and humanity than our bastards !!! Imagine. <br /> <br /> My advice, if you have insomnia, 2 hours and 33 minutes to lose or want to give your mind a break, go see this movie.
