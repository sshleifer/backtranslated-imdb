This film has perhaps the worst title for a short film I have ever imagined. Quite suitable, given the actual fifteen minute content. <br /> <br /> I can do without the "Shemp A.D." stuff, but I'll admit to having some LOL moments from the two-man comedy offered by Moe and Larry in some of the new movies (and congratulations to those guys for trying to do their best, considering the position they were forced into even making these dogs ). <br /> <br /> Another highlight of this and the latest debacle of the "Commotion on the Ocean" AD is the lack of screen time for Joe Palma and the back of his head. No attempt to make him talk or bang his arms like a chicken (see "Hot Stuff"), can be worth an extra score. <br /> <br /> 2/10
