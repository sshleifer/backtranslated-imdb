As the previous commentator of this film, I too found myself in tears sometimes during this film. Sometimes one wonders how a film of such terrible horror can be born. From the first moment our protagonist wakes up in his New York apartment from a dream of subway trains connecting with galloping horses (what the Irish emigrant didn't have), it's clear that we're in trouble. And it's not going much better. <br /> <br /> Revived in 1950s Ireland, we enter a world where everyone speaks without intonation, and exclusively on the subject of the Irish civil war. Schoolchildren go to school to learn about the civil war. Pub drinkers are divided according to their Civil War alliances. Memories are performed for those who died in the civil war. The city is divided between those who believe that we should remember and those who want to forget ... the civil war. Every look and conversation is dripping with meaning dating back to the Civil War. <br /> <br /> The video of the Broken Harvest video clip suggests that the film is a parable of problems in modern Ireland. The only parallel that strikes me is that in today's conversation in Dublin it is in fact dominated by a single subject: house prices. If his intention is to offer a kind of intuition about Ireland's obsession with his past, he fails miserably. It is striking that few Irish films have faced the Irish civil war and its legacies. However it will take a much more subtle and intelligent film than this to tell us something about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the nation's psyche. <br /> <br /> For those American spectators who suggested the film, it evokes the atmosphere of 1950s Ireland: it is not. The 1950s Ireland was a horrible, poor well of sexual repression and misery from which young people fled. However, there was more than one topic of conversation.
