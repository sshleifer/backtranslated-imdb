This film examines the infamous Wannsee conference where the Nazis gathered to discuss the organization and implementation of the "final solution". First of all, I want to say that I was amazed to see Kenneth Branagh playing a Nazi. With his matted blond hair, he certainly looked the part but didn't play the part well. There was no threat and cruelty and eventually, he came out like a smiling cheerleader, keeping the meeting going. The real Heydrich wouldn't let the conference get out of control like in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best performance of all was undoubtedly Colin Firth who played Dr William Stuckart, the man who wrote the 1935 Nuremberg Breed Laws and who gave "legal respectability" to everything that the Nazis did. Firth's performance was staggering, the main vocal opponent to what Heydrich was proposing. The best part of it all was when he was verbally embellishing one of the Nazi thugs. The thug murmured "I'll remember you" and Firth replies "you should! I'm very well known !!" The film is historically accurate but let's reduce it to what it really is - 90 minutes of a group of men around a table discussing, shouting and boasting. There is no excitement, no real conflict (except the brief discussion). It's just 90 minutes of conversation! Same room, same table, same people. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure the DVD is worth it. I was the first to feel changed in a short time.
