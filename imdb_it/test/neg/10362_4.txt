This film was extremely disappointing, I thought it would be another "comedy about marijuana", but don't be misleading, it's not at all. There are a few weed-related jokes that come to mind, I don't even think they smoke weed in this movie. The marijuana field is simply a plot device. <br /> <br /> My impression after seeing this film was that four friends were bored in a summer and decided to write a script full of witty movie dialogues. The product is a bland dialogue supported by mediocre acting, to say that this film has no 'hook' is a huge euphemism. Don't waste time and money.
