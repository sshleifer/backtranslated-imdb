ARMY AND DANGEROUS is not one of John Candy's greats. This film about a fired policeman who ends up working for a small crowd-run security system is very weak and not very comedy. There are some moments that I liked, like watching Candy with a racing suit, but it doesn't seem to matter much. ARMED AND DANGEROUS it is still a dangerously disappointing disgrace brought by the director of the homonymous stupid commando COMMANDO. What a sad excuse for a play! <br /> <br /> 1 in 5
