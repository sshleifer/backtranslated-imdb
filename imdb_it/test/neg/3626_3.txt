Okay, I have to agree with the reviews of almost everyone else here. Characters. We are. Stupid. They are ALL stereotyped, yet they have nice clothes and are always thin. <br /> <br /> I haven't even started as Jamie Lynn as a ZOEY. Zoey is a young blonde teenager, pretty, popular, that everyone loves! He has a "rebellious" personality, great, that everyone agrees, no matter how stupid or extreme. The most annoying of all: his voice is so damn bubbly and hateful. "OMG!" <br /> <br /> Let's take the first episode as an example. As he enters the huge PCA campus, everyone seems to love it. The guys want to ask her out, the girls want to be her friends, etc. Thinking that this is all, the episode takes place with Zoey who is always the center of attention; she is the so-called best player on the unofficial girls' basketball team, confident, and she's all worth it to her when she's weakly hit in the face. Oh boo-hoo. <br /> <br /> My favorite character by far is the entire series is a girl who appears much later in the show, Lauren or something, who is the only person ever introduced to the show to hate Zoey . <br /> <br /> And Zoey doesn't even seem to be very loyal to her friends sometimes. In one of the episodes he even calls his friend a person without NEVER apologizing and shows not the slightest regret in doing so. <br /> <br /> Zoey is ALWAYS the best: <br /> <br /> -Desiging T-shirts and professional backpacks (which become a great success) <br /> - with VERY elaborate schemes BY THEMSELVES to teach a single person a lesson. <br /> <br /> - The impeccable degrees <br /> <br /> - Pass the blame for things that weren't even related to her just so everyone else could be happy. <br /> <br /> - Coming with a commercial that was so beautiful it was put on TV. The list could continue ... <br /> <br /> Ugh. You have no acting talent. He is always the perfect person. It behaves brat and rebellious and preppy and ... UGH! I can not stand her. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but everyone in the show always has nice clothes. ALSO THE NERD! His wardrobe is better than mine, and mine is definitely crazy. <br /> <br /> Nobody cares if everyone at the PCA loves you, Zoey, and they would do anything for you, even if it meant giving their right arm. <br /> <br /> BUT regardless of these cardboard characters, the plots are creative. Not everyday things. They are interesting and fun. Humor is usually good-natured and fun, but the characters are so flat that it's hard to enjoy them. <br /> <br /> This show would be really nice if Dan Schnieder had a little more time thinking about the kind of characters he wanted, because they are so typical, so boring that it's lousy and stupid. <br /> <br /> Point: no one is overweight, everyone has elegant clothes, Zoey is Mary-Sue's definition, narrative lines are well thought out and humor is ridiculous. But again, I want to emphasize that the characters contaminate the show. Watch the show if you have to, but don't say I didn't warn you if your eyes start bleeding.
