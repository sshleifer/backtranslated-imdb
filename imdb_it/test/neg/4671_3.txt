spoiler <br /> <br /> This movie is not full of action; it's slow and boring. It's not funny or exciting, it's predictable and plays on economic sentimentality and vague patriotism. The special effects are not imaginative or impressive. They are noisy and uninspired. <br /> <br /> Acting talent is wasted on irreverent nonsense and clich√©s. These came from characters who should be called simply "black giant gentleman", "eccentric genius about to collapse", "hero with a square jaw who comes of age", "cowardly from the book", "unlucky gambler who lives according to an honor code, "impulsive princess" and so on. <br /> <br /> And writing! How many non-dramatic countdowns thought they could fit this thing? A scene where people have to defuse a bomb by cutting "one or the other thread is a fiction? The drama of the last 15 minutes of the film depends on the audience who cares if some idiot can put aside his personal differences with Ben Affleck and say bye-bye to Liv Tyler in time to SAVE THE LAND: All the work is done, we just have to wait a couple of seconds for Harry Stamper, the asshole, to unwrap a few lines of cotton candy, I know that Bruce Willis is a generally charismatic guy, but his p Harry Stamper's character is an unpleasant boredom. I thought he earned the Golden Razzy he was assigned for this role. <br /> <br /> Given that the film is so long, the plot so obvious, and the dialogue so disposable, one cannot help but notice the inaccuracies. , inconsistencies and holes in the plot. 800 feet in something the size of TX is less than a pinprick. Try walking 800 feet in TX and see how close you are to the center. After all the discussion about the artificial gravity of the Russian station, it seems to be arbitrary once inside. In reality, gravity comes and goes throughout the film. Does it make sense that someone besides Michael Bay gives these idiots a couple of shuttles and sends them to blow up an asteroid that threatens the earth? <br /> <br /> Sentimental editing of the phone / insurance / commercial style was revolting. <br /> <br /> I like action movies. Really. This is boring, stupid and really stuck on itself. It deserves hatred and contempt because that's all that Hollywood's most expensive efforts have become: a bunch of economic cliches ranging from one expensive explosion to another. Oh yes, everything is permeated by a conservative view of Neanderthals on sex, politics and so on.
