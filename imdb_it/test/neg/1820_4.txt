It is not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS (not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this rather obscure film to my collection of films by Alan Rickman. <br /> <br /> Can't understand how the talented Mr. Rickman enters these mediocre films? Judas Kiss boasts several wonderful actors, an interesting storyline and twists, but his strange visual wanderings and sharp editing have ruined what could have been a great criminal drama. Many scenes seem to lack vital information to explain the character's actions: why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses? Why did he distrust the detective he replaced? There were times when I honestly couldn't understand if the director meant that Judas Kiss was a legitimate legal crime or a parody of the field. Why else would he jump into a topless / alien / lesbian porn scene in the first two minutes (did that little surprise make me climb for the remote as my kids were playing nearby!)? Had he purposefully instructed his two distinguished British actors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use the horrible New Orleans accents? Like Alan Freak, I confess that I still thought Mr. Rickman was sexy: in a way, tired, "take-a-home-and-tuck-him-in". <br /> <br /> Judas Kiss is not a great film, but it has some interesting moments, but I don't recommend it unless I'm trying to dive into Alan Rickman.
