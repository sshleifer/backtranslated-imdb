I am rarely motivated to write a review unless I am inspired by the quality of the film. In the case of Comanche Moon I was so uninspired that I felt the need to warn others how bad this TV series is. Here are some thoughts. <br /> <br /> The Indians: they came across a Saturday Night Live Skit, making fun of the way the Indians talk. When McMurtry writes dialogue in his novels, it reads so interesting; I'm not sure how they ended up with what they got. <br /> <br /> Gus McCrae: It looks like Festus from the old Gunsmoke series. Acting is OK and the mannerism of Robert Duvall's McCrae is perfect, but the look is pure comedy cowboy. <br /> <br/> Clara: Maybe you could use some dirt or sweat on her next time. Have you ever been to Austin in the summer before air conditioning? I assure you that women did not seem that way. Do you think they never saw episodes of Dearwood? <br /> <br /> Gov. Elisha Pease: Once again, when I'm in the Governor's office, it looks like a Saturday Night Live Skit, and the skit is a bombardment. <br /> <br /> Woodrow Call: Call is the most reasonable character, of course he talks so little how can you ruin it? But hey, what about that hat? <br /> <br /> Blue Duck: See above and include the fact that it's not even a little scary. They had to have Javier Bardem to play the part. <br /> <br /> The Rangers: Right from "O Brother, Where Art Thou" I expected George Cloony to ride and let them break into a song. <br /> <br /> Maybe I am premature because the miniseries is not completed, but I doubt that I will look more in any way. <br /> <br /> I don't expect anyone to duplicate the compelling feeling of Lonesome Dove, but I look at this and it seems they have no feeling with the old west.
