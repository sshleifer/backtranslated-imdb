Perhaps the target audience of this Disney Channel TV movie will be satisfied, but if some parents are watching together with the young people, they will clearly see that "cranked" is written on all this production. Obviously it was not anyone's dream of making this film, but rather, this was invented in a meeting room somewhere, then produced with cold efficiency. There is talent in the cast, but actors like Dabney Coleman and Jay Thomas don't have much chance to show off their talent. The incredibly cute Elisabeth Harnois is as addictive as the First Daughter, but Will Friedle is stuck once again playing another stupid character, even though he is not as morally and annoying as in his role as "Boy Meets World". The background of this film is Washington, D.C. and the White House, but there is no real "presidential" feeling for the film and the secret service turns out to be little better than the Keystone Kops when it comes to doing one's duty. Disney Channel presents many original TV movies and many of them are better than this.
