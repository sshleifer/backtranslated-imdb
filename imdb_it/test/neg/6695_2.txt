<br /> <br /> I tuned into this film not because I'm a fan of US High School basketball (in fact I rarely watch NBA games), but rather because I'm a fan of Gene Hackman, who usually succeeds to bring an impressive depth to his performances. In this case, however, I was very disappointed. This was not one of the brilliant stars of Hackman's career. <br /> <br /> In all honesty with him, he didn't have much to work with. Like Norman Dale, the new coach of a small high school basketball team in Indiana, he wasn't called to act much. Basically his performance consisted of walking up and down the basketball courts railing against the referees. I didn't find it particularly credible in the role of being honest. I, too, was not impressed by the love story needed between Dale and Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey). Quite honestly there was absolutely no chemistry between Hackman and Hershey. The love story never caught my attention, and neither did the basketball action, which was completely predictable. <br /> <br /> There have been too many problems with this movie to make it useful. I never understood the depth of the pure hatred that so many inhabitants of the city had for Dale, almost before it arrived. The character development was poor and the story itself was poorly developed. Too much basketball and not enough human interaction, in my opinion. How many shots of children shooting baskets we need to see to understand that this is a basketball movie? There was no suspense: is it even possible to doubt that Hickory will win the big one? I realize this is based on a true story, but I suppose you show that not all real stories should be a movie. Frankly, it wasn't a very interesting film. Definitely a film that Gene Hackman would like to forget. <br /> <br /> It's not better than a 2/10 in my opinion.
