This film fails on all fronts. To begin with it is pretentious, striving to be "meaningful" and failing miserably. The script was trivial to the extreme, no one has ever said anything remotely interesting. It was impossible to worry about any of the characters. Knightly was a waste of time for himself while Sienna Miller was just a waste of time. The soldier's piece that went to war was a cliché even before the movie Atonement used it. The use of the Second World War as a backdrop was in itself a cliché ... the bombs, the shelter in the subway stations, etc., Employee to import a bit of drama as necessary. Because someone thought for a moment that this film was worth doing is beyond my comprehension. It was yet another case of "let's make the costumes look authentic, no matter the story, the script or the acting!"
