Wesley Snipes' latest direct film is a twisted chaos, which horribly resembles Steven Seagal's latest works. The script is horribly written and does not take into account the low budget it is and tries to be too smart for its own good. Sadly, Snipes has fallen into the trap of having a double ADR voice making much of his dialogue, and an entire narrative that occasionally comes through the points of the film. It is sad to see a boy of the talented Wesley Snipes making garbage like this film, and produce a tired and clearly bored performance, barely worried about producing his own dialogue. It has become a bit of a joke with Steven Seagal, the fact that he doesn't do his own dialogue, but it's not something I would have expected from Snipes. Perhaps it's due to the producer, Andrew Stevens who has previously worked with Seagal previously, or director Po-Chi Leong, responsible for Seagal's epic villain Out of Reach. <br /> <br /> The plot involves shady government officials, terrorists and teams of football coaches, records with incriminating evidence and a large chuck of missing money. Oh and biological weapons. Now, as they are connected, I don't know, but what I can tell you is that the diabolical script is pretty hard to understand and like many of these DTV movies, they like to include an extra touch. The plot is also told in an uninteresting way, playing with cards with people who have shadows in the offices and dark alleys, etc. It's all a bit "let's take a break and throw down some points of the plot for the sad bastards who watch this movie!" The rhythm of the film as such suffers because, despite the dullness of the performances and the plot, the film has some nice action scenes. As an example of how a DTV film has successfully crossed a tortuous plot, I give you the directorial debut of Dolph Lundgren, the Defender. That film has had its share of twists and complexity, but the film has a last hour of almost entirely action, with Dolph under siege terrorists. The plot points are told in the context of the action, in motion, avoiding death. The film does not stop to tell us what is happening, it does not break the rhythm. As such, even if the plot was a bit twisted, it was more forgivable because the action never stopped. The detonator like many of these films, stops everything to give us a twisted walk between those who are bad and those who are not, before inevitably changing that turn in the part pulled from the rear end. These films can often suffer from pacing problems. <br /> <br /> Snipes itself as I said is rather bland here. At the beginning he is wearing a field character while he is under cover with some arms traffickers. Initially it seemed like he was enjoying himself, but unfortunately the rest of the film sees him and his occasional voice doubly sleepwalking in the role. Lightning strikes come to life only when they are called to kick ass. There is however a nice action here, with some quick and crunchy martial arts and some nice pungent shooters. The film also features a decent car chase. Silvia Colloca is co-star and is not an actress, but she is beautiful, with a costume that screams "look at my cleavage!" The rest of the cast comes and goes with clich√©s and uninteresting roles. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Snipes are planning better projects from now. He has another team with Mario Van Peebles, called Hard Luck, then Chasing The Dragon, directed by Chris Nahon, who made the Jet Li Kiss of The Dragon movie. Finally, apparently, Snipes is doing Toussaint, a biographical drama, directed by Danny Glover. The future suddenly appears brighter for Snipes, but he remembers that he was receiving a great reward for his DTV movies, about 7 million dollars for a film, maybe more. It's also fun to consider that Dolph Lundgren, god of all these DTVs, is making the best films, directing himself, with the likeable Defender and the extraordinarily violent and well-made Russian Specialist, and moreover he's doing them with a fraction of the budget of these diabolical offers from Wesley and Steven Seagal are producing. * 1/2
