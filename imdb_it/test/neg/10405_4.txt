It is another variant of the often told tale of two people getting married and sharing their child's daughter. YOU GET THAT EGG ROLL is directed by Howard Morris (from television) and shows, because it's the kind of story that sounds like a half-hour comedy set for a feature film - but with a shortage of laughter, or to put it differently, just number of laughter that would have been possible within half an hour of a television program. <br /> <br /> DORIS DAY has decided to retire after this movie - and it's pretty easy to see why. Even the presence of quite reliable actors in the cast does not help. BRIAN KEITH, BARBARA HERSHEY, PAT CARROLL and ALICE GHOSTLEY do their best, but the script is the real problem and should have been left untouched for the big screen. <br /> <br /> Not much can be said for this. Jump and watch Miss Day in all her most noteworthy films.
