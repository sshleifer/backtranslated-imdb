An art student in Rome is possessed ... or something like that. He dreams of being nailed to the cross and Satan himself rapes her. He owns it (I think) and turns it into a sex addict. That's all I could take and I turned it off. <br /> <br /> A useless "exorcist" rip-off. I took it on cable in the 80s and I was horrified ... and not in a positive sense! This film should be a horror movie, but turns into nothing more than a porn movie disguised as a horror movie. There are tons of useless female nudity and the leading actress must degrade herself more than once. We see her raped by Satan (a captivating looking guy), masturbating, approaching her father ... I have to give her points for courage. Add to that ugly dubbing, editing (the rape scene seems to have been cut a bit), bad acting and a story that no longer makes sense. The only disturbing sequence (its being nailed to the cross) ALMOST works, but the bad "special" effects ruin it. This is one of the few horror movies that was so bad that I stopped watching. Salta.
