After the disaster of 1988, the films of GJS Amitabh lost the quality they had previously <br /> <br /> Barring MAIN AZAAD HOON released in 1989 which was a great film. All the films were craps mainly except HUM (1991), later in 1991 <br /> This is another of Amitabh's shitty films rejected in the early 1990s <br /> <br /> The film made a sign of friendship to Shashi Kapoor who directed the film and did not take a penny The film also had Rishi and Dimple (again not paired with each other after RANBHOOMI) <br /> <br /> The film arrived in 1991 when Bachchan had 4 versions and 3 flop between them INDRAJEET, AKAYLA, AJOOBA <br /> <br /> Ajooba came 2 years later TOOFAN and JAADUGAR both supernatural films that were rejected This is another kind of crap Bachchan wears a Krissh type mask and suit and performs the magic by changing 1 person in a donkey.etc Obviously, since 1991 you can excuse the specia effects there but the film is too bad to be watched <br /> <br /> Shashi Kapoor's direction is not good Musi c is bad <br /> <br /> Amitabh had become too old among the actors in 1991 and it seemed tired, his acting is ok but not on par with his best Rishi is ok Dimple is fine, the rest is forgettable
