Another sequel! Why do they continue to make them? This must be the weakest "franchise" ever, yet it is still in the process of financing and sequels. SCARECROW GONE WILD - which I only saw in order to officially trash the entire series - reports the evil straw man who, again, slaughtered some college boys ... This is basically. Acting sucks (as usual), death scenes are more pathetic, and don't be fooled by the title, this thing has no more nudity than you might think. A pair of pretty topless girls, but nothing more than pants tighten up. Let me conclude my continuous insult (or review) on this film by saying: if I find a SCARECROW IN SPACE or a FREDDY VS SCARECROW on the shelves of video stores, I will be in absolute amazement ...
