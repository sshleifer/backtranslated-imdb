I only saw the first part of this and I concluded that I would not have missed anything if I had not watched the second episode. Cinematography was fine, but other than that, the plot was just like commonorgarden and run-of-the-mill like any other war story. Actors and actresses play their characters without any passion, and the trick is really bad (Heiner Lauterbach with his white hair and Kai Wiesinger respectively, as if some dyed white hair could give them more dignity and common sense). I mean, if you've watched more than two or three WWII movies (like most of us), you'd only think of seeing a third or a fourth if it promises new insights or plot twists. But Roland Suso Richter seems to be afraid to do so, you can almost smell his fear of not living up to the bourgeois and jejune expectations of the conservative ZDF television channel while watching this movie. Millions of euros have been spent to perpetuate the boring and unimaginative German film production. These millions of dollars could have been spent on making three or four independent films, but no, let's give a director who will make a film that tells people that war can be explained by rational means. My advice: read Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut instead. They will tell you what war is like! Or give me a million euros and make a better film than this load of BS! And another thing: why can German films be nominated for an Oscar only when the film is about World War II or the Holocaust? Probably because this is the only thing that German film production is good. And this should make us think, shouldn't it?
