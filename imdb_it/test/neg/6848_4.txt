Three young cinema employees have the task of reopening an old and long-closed theater, in which many years before there was a shocking series of murders committed. It seems that many other murders have happened since then, but all this remains unknown to these three arrogant young employees who hope to finally succeed in making it on their own. As they approach the big re-opening night, things continue to get weird and more disturbing with objects that suddenly start moving on their own without any help seen and a terrifying old man seems to haunt the locals. <br /> <br /> Oh, this is really horrible. In fact, if it were not for the character of Mary Woronov secretary to be an energetically frank and authoritarian young woman who steals practically every scene she appears in and the incredibly sexy girl who played the incredibly squalid and totally sexy Selina, this would be a total loss. The only other positive thing I have to say about this film is that some of the cinema murders are done in a really inventive way, even if not overly bloody (a preference for me but not necessarily for others), fashion. The rest moves only in a constant sleaze (so extreme the rare few can actually find humor in it) and cross the predictable slasher killing off the annoying characters one after another.
