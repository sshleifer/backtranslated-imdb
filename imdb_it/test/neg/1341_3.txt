The 2008 update by director / writer Diane English of George Cukor's 1939 MGM classic comedy unfortunately shows more mothballs than its predecessor. Based on the careful 1936 observation of Clare Booth Luce on the relationships that evolve between a strictly female group of pampered Manhattan socialites, the story would seem ripe for a contemporary remake. Instead, due to the thematic diffusion of English, production appears as an extended therapy session with a lack of spirit. Furthermore, the different lifestyles of today's women have been reduced to stereotypes at the sitcom level in this film, and the central idea of ​​the game of eliminating men from the plot seems even more elaborate given the openly pansexual evolution that has occurred verified between men and women since the 1930s. To add insult to injury, HBO's recent big-screen adaptation of "Sex and the City" has made this kind of sorority-style work much better and with much sharper canines. <br /> <br /> The skeleton of the original game remains as the story is based on the rich Mary Haines, who gave up his promising career in clothing design to become the devoted wife of a Wall Street financial wizard. Like "Sex and the City", she is surrounded by three best friends: Sylvie Fowler, a successful and unscrupulous editor like Maze Priestly in "The Devil Wears Prada" (yet another film that echoes); Edie Cohen perennially pregnant who represents his wife to stay at home; and Alex Fisher, a lesbian author who seems to represent every repressed group generally excluded from such an exclusive clique. Through a maniac of the lips, they discover that Mary's husband is having an affair with the man-eater Crystal Allen, a perfumed Saks girl more than willing to break a marriage while struggling to become an actress. The rest of the plot does not matter much since it becomes a series of scenes centered on fraternal ties and fights, none of which is very illuminating and without the satirical zing that promoted the 1939 film. <br /> <br /> Looking strangely Young at 47, Meg Ryan seems to play Mary in a way that seeks to revive the good will she generated in the 1990s with "When Harry Met Sally" and "Sleepless in Seattle". It's not that it's not age-appropriate here, but its familiar familiarity seems to be at odds with the passive nature of the character. Annette Bening performs a bit better in the scene by stealing the role of Sylvie's Rosalind Russell because she proved to be skilled at conveying hardness by masking the vulnerability, but her character undergoes such a trivial transformation that severely undermines the actress's performance. Poor Eva Mendes has to interpret Crystal as a transparent and superficial order compared to the intelligent cookie and the hard edges that Joan Crawford has been able to interpret. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith went at a disadvantage respectively as Edie and Alex. Much better are Candice Bergen as Mary's and Cloris Leachman's expert and supportive mother as a non-absurd ruler. <br /> <br /> Probably reflecting the poor box office response to the release of the film, the 2008 DVD does not have a robust set of extras. There are two deleted scenes - one with Crystal and her friends who have a night-in for the girls in contrast to Mary's elaborate garden party, and the other an extension of Bette Midler's cameo as a Hollywood agent multiparty that advises Mary during a late night in a yoga camp. Two featurettes complete the "" The Women: The Legacy "extras on the film's history from the 1936 theatrical work, and" The Women Behind the Women "which has the cast and crew talking incessantly about women's self-empowerment and self - The irony is that this version of "The Women", directed and scripted by a woman, has a condescending look on women.
