This is the worst kind of movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the characters are unrealistic stereotypes that never seem to believe on their own. Are whites such monsters who will continue to call two white child rapists in their "good boys" of the 1920s and must be convinced that this could be a cause for provocation? Are black people universally inspired? Is the Ku Klux Klan really out of courtrooms by shooting lawyers without anyone intervening? Do the judges really think that a fair trial can be conducted when the jury can hear a crowd outside shouting "Kill it"? Do the black people really stand side by side with the Klan waiting to hear the verdict? Do wives really take several months to realize that their husband could defend an unjust hanged man because he knew he could do the same thing? Do juries really murder people because they feel sorry for them? Do lawyers really use a defense of sanity to persuade people that their client is temporarily insane? <br /> <br /> Worse, all the principles of this high-level film have been lost to the completely exploitative and free use of sex crime to titillate the public. Was he subjected to rape, not to mention rape of a group of children, really in competent hands here? Is it really a topic that belongs to the hands of Hollywood? And if so, why is Sandra Bullock's abduction and stripping completely free? And the useless act of rape against one of the witnesses? It seems that the director did not feel so strongly about sexual crime. <br /> <br /> This was the excellent plot of To Kill at Mockingbird and the creation of a gross and insignificant money spinner. Let them be ashamed.
