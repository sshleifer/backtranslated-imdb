The beginning of this film made me doubt that it would be little more than a typical science fiction movie B. But, as it progressed, I began to get interested and saw it all through. The premise is interesting, original and has the qualities to make a classic. Alas, it ended up instead in a mediocre film, made with the usual factors that turn a potentially good movie into a bad movie (bad acting, low budget etc.). I'm interested to see how it would end up if it had been redone with good actors and a big Hollywood budget.
