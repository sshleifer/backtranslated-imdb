Walt was particularly passionate about quality. So how come the Disney producers would have distributed such a terribly modified mess, battered (even for the family!) Of a movie? THE BIG GREEN had a good concept. And, since it's Disney, you know what the movie will be like, of course. But THE BIG GREEN is horrible. The jokes are lame. And Steve Guttenburg, still alive, pulls another terrible performance on his resume. <br /> <br /> Children with too much time in the small town of Elma have the opportunity to play soccer with their new teacher. The children don't know one thing though. And as for us, we can see Steve Guttenburg trying to hit the teacher from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Accelerating camera work doesn't work. THE BIG GREEN is full of accelerating the pace of the characters to move the film along. Children are not idiots. They will take care of you if you give them enough of a suggestion without showing all that garbage. Guttenburg, for once in his life, should have turned down an offer to join this film. Even the beautiful Olivia d'Abo should have called this one too. THE BIG GREEN can be known as "The Big Bomb".
