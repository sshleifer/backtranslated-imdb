I couldn't believe it. This film was a total waste of time from my life. The title is appropriate. Love didn't beat me, this movie did. I kept watching, watching, waiting, waiting and hoping for something, whatever happened. And nothing ever happened! Anything!! Terrence Howard couldn't even save this lame piece called a movie. It was dark and confusing and I didn't understand who killed the girl at the end. The tone and rhythm of the film were supposed to be building up in a dramatic ending. This only served to confuse the public because the film is simply passed without going where. If you want pure torture, watch this movie.
