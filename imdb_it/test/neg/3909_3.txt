If you are one of those people who don't like science fiction because of their sometimes unbelievable ideas and surreal world perspectives, it's best to stay away from Stuart Gordon's Space Truckers as far as possible! It is truly an absurd space adventure, full of eccentric characters, colorful kitsch and ridiculous twists. In all honesty, I probably never would have dealt with this movie, if it wasn't for Gordon's name in the credits. This guy is very close to being a genius of the horror genre, with undeniable goals like "From Beyond" and "Re-Animator" in his resume. Apparently, Stuart Gordon likes his humor as twisted as possible! He had already gone over the top of the comedy once (with Re-Animator) but, with the slight difference that the bizarre humor was effective there. Something that is not really the case with Space Truckers, most gags do not lead anywhere and the completely exaggerated atmosphere only works in small doses. In the end, all that remains is an occasionally funny but completely useless mess. Dennis Hopper and Charles Dance (or at least a Charles Dance seed) are always a joy to watch and the beautiful Barbara Crampton has a small role near the end of the film. Crampton was the regular heroine of Stuart Gordon in previous horror films. The story of Space Truckers is as stupid as they come. Dennis Hopper plays the self-taught loner who is fed up with his job. Who wouldn't be when you transport pigs through the galaxy for a company called Interpork? He sees his change of escape as he brings his muse to the earth. They float in space pirates and discover that their cargo is destined to wipe out half of the universe! Stuart Gordon wisely returned to horror again after this little escapade. Since Space Truckers has already made the sublime "King of the Ants" and the absolutely brilliant "Dagon"
