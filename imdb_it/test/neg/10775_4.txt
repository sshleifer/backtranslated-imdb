As we all know, films are not designed to directly incorporate the story, but it is a disgrace when a film is made that has an absolutely minimal or non-existent correlation. I would like the director and / or screenwriter to have done his research on this topic. All this film does is create a forum for hatred between people, causing a split that should not be there. This film portrays Sikhs and Muslims in a very negative manor, while making the third (Hindu) group appear as if it did not exist in the brutal killings of the people of both nations. The inaccuracies, along with the sear disinterest in one's faith as interpreted by "Gian Singh" was a disgrace to the higher format. Although on a more positive note, the actors did a great job performing in their roles. Both Kristen K and Neve C exceptionally played their shots. I hope that those who watch this film do not see it or use it as a model for the real historical event.
