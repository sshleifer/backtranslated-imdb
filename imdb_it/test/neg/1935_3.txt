I saw this when it was released in theaters in 1996. I remember that I was already familiar with Elijah Wood's work (yes, he did things before "The Lord of the Rings"!) And the merchandising attacks for the film were cute abundant ("Flipper" water pistols were still in circulation). <br /> <br /> The adults were reminded of the old movies and TV series and for the sake of nostalgia they brought their children to see it, they were enthusiastic because it was a movie about a dolphin and a fool. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it was not what they expected and became seriously ill. You know a movie is in trouble when a boy swims away from a hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean, and a pack of dolphins scares the shark, and the child - instead of getting out of the water in a boat - floats in the water to five minutes thanking his dolphin for saving him ... apparently he didn't take into consideration that the shark is still out there, maybe even under him. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Paul Hogan. It looks old, crunchy and tired of recycling its makeup with Croc Dundee. By now, no one even remembered "Crocodile Dundee" and much less Hogan, and I almost expected him to suddenly start pretending he didn't know what a hair dryer was for the taste of laughter outside the water / social satire. <br /> <br /> All in all this is a really poor "family" movie, which is amateur and almost hard to watch sometimes. I hated it when I saw it in theaters in '96 and now I hate it more.
