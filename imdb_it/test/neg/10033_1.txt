Thank God I didn't buy this movie myself! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of pure curiosity and, obviously, after seeing it, it should be repaid! This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I realize that they could not have had a limited budget, but I swear I could make a better film than this by watching my pets! The acting was horrible, as well as editing, dialogue, EVERYTHING! He was so ugly that he was making me seriously angry as I watched him! I can't wait for the REAL movie to come on this story that will be released soon so that curious people don't have to stoop to watch this joke!
