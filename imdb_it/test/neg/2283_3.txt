I bought a tape of this movie based on the recommendation of other IMDb users and I must say I was very disappointed. I am a university professor and I showed this film to my class; they voted unanimously that it is a terrible film. I guess if you like the old Dark Shadows series, then maybe you'll like it. (I liked Dark Shadows when I was a kid in the 70s, but now I think it's just awful). The first half hour or at least has the merit of a certain fidelity to Wilde's novel. After that, the story changes dramatically, at least compared to the 1945 MGM version (which won two Oscars). Nigel Davenport in the role of Lord Henry is really the only thing that can be watched in all production. Much of the acting is bad, the music is melodramatic and the film's appearance is terrible. Actually, it's not a movie at all - it was obviously shot on video and has a typically claustrophobic aspect of the BBC. The opening scenes are particularly dimly lit, women's costumes are terrible (men seem okay), and many of the characters - including Dorian - seem to have the 70s rather than Victorian hairstyles. The film does well to include a lot of dialogues from Wilde, but the narrative voice in Dorian's voice contains a lot of garbage that directly contradicts Wilde's character. I'm a big fan of Oscar Wilde, and I'm afraid he had to roll violently into the grave when this monstrosity was created. His only improvement over the 1945 version is that the homosexual subtext is decidedly more evident, without being heavy. I haven't seen any of the latest versions, but if one is interested in seeing the story well told, I should recommend the 1945 MGM in black and white on this.
