I saw Roger Moore making him snort in the scenes that required running or exercise. He was a James Bond who would have been the most comfortable sitting in a bar telling stories with his British colleagues. Nothing to do with the elderly in age-appropriate roles, but how realistic it is for a frail-looking 58-year-old man to fight with the wings of planes, hang out on a train side, swim in a swamp with crocodiles, etc. . ? Apart from the fact that OCTOPUSSY was incredibly foolish, silly and idiotic, the fact that a frail old man had engaged in many death-defying stunts made it much easier to laugh than James Bond. In 1983 Roger Moore was clearly looking at his age, and had spent a lot of time when he seemed to be able to fight with younger men. I saw this movie in the theater and the laughter was many and very often. Any credibility that James Bond had accumulated had passed after OCTOPUSSY. <br /> <br /> The only thing missing from OCTOPUSSY was Benny Hill and his supporting cast. Another low point was that the incredibly lame Louis Jordan was one half of the Axis of Evil. Jordan has helped make the whole concept even more ridiculous. And the Russian general was completely false. OCTOPUSSY works best as a comedy similar to SPIES LIKE US. <br /> <br /> Even the train fighting scene was just a bad copy of the same train scenes made in many other movies by better actors. Take EMPEROR OF THE NORTH (1972) in which Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine fought at the top and bottom of the train and made it look exciting and real. <br /> <br /> Roger Moore had a thin and fragile body in 1983 and yet his stand-in was clearly a younger, taller, more athletic and muscular man. Even the hair color did not match. This made his fighting scenes more comical. Moore's stunts resembled those old cheap Chop-Socky Kung-Fu movies, especially with bad editing. The director seemed to be trying to make bad acting and bad stunts better by providing different views of the same feat. This has only accentuated the differences between Moore and his stand-in. The fact that the train scenes with Moore were shot in a studio could be noticed by the lighting when Moore was shot against the external blows of the stand-in on a real train. Although many of the Bond Movies must be the worst ever when it comes to mounting their stunts. You can usually clearly see that the Bond actor is not fighting. Overall, OCTOPUSSY must rank as one of the worst films ever made, and easily the worst of the worst James Bond films.
