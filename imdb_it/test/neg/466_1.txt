I had great hopes of seeing him, since I always like Paul Bettany's performances. I thought he was as good as Darwin, and he did his best considering the terrible material he had to work with. <br /> <br /> Darwin's book on the origin of species was one of the most innovative, controversial and innovative publications of all time, yet you would never think of it based on this boring film. It's like a two-hour episode of a soap opera in a Victorian context. There is practically nothing of Darwin's five-year Beagle journey to the Galapagos Islands, for example, certainly of supreme importance to history, as was his investigations into wildlife on which he began to form his theory of evolution. br /> <br /> This is just a long, sad, domestic drama, with Darwin portrayed as a slightly foggy eccentric, seeing visions of his dead daughter everywhere and getting the cold shoulder from his emotionally constipated wife. The representation of Emma Darwin by Jennifer Connelly is inconvenient to say the least and has little relationship with the historical descriptions of the real Emma. There may have been an opportunity here to present the creationist interpretation of life on earth, from Emma or the local priest, as played by Jeremy Northam (a part of blink-and-you-miss-it which is a complete waste of a talented actor) to counterbalance Darwin's views, but was not taken into consideration. <br /> <br /> The story has focused too much on the infinite sentiment sweetened about Darwin's pain for his daughter Annie, and too much time has been wasted in Darwin wondering whether or not to write his book. In the end I was so bored that it was difficult to cure. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a bit like shooting a movie about Picasso and spending two hours concentrating on him arguing with his girlfriend and not bothering to say he was an artist.
