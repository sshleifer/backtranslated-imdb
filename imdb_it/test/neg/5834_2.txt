It's a space movie, or at least I think it is. you have half-naked prisoners in a space prison and a monster on a space station that uses a virus to infect humanity through sexy encounters. Its hilarious exhilarating. The acting is so bad that the space nuts looks like an Emmy-winning movie. The story is simple. The prisoner of space has the opportunity to reduce his sentence by investigating a space station that has lost contact with humanity. Find a doctor who "experiments" with women and an angry with an alien. He fights them, and so on and so forth. It is a film that is worth seeing just to wet the pants with a laugh. If you like real science fiction movies, it's a no-no but it's a great mood mood for the amateur director because I can guarantee that their film is better than this.
