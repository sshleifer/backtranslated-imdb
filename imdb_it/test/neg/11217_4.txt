This is the first porn I've ever tried to review. It requires a different approach than usual, since allegory will not reward dissection. "I'm American, I'm a demure virgin." "We are Europeans, we are cultured and crazy about sex". "It's nice when we get to each other." Much to talk about! Well, in fact, in any case, it is actually related to the average number of topless volleyballs of the 60s. And the unnerving "class" patina offers at least clean and detailed compositions. But what the hell is that about a porn? OK then: the only scene in which I (rhetorically) turned up was the first time Brigitte Maier intervened. There are efforts to launch into a good variety of race and age while not leaving two men close to each other; the black boy suffers a premature attack of interrupted coitus. And more or less taken, an act perhaps unpublished on IMDb is as if it were partially simulated by a surgical tube. Still, I stayed awake, and it was eight in the morning ... but what does the last shot mean ?!
