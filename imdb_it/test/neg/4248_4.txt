Although normally my preference is not for romantic dramas, seeing this movie has left me a little short. <br /> <br /> He would have promised, the characters and the relationships could have been explored much more deeply than them, however the story seemed not to understand the direction he wanted to take. <br /> <br /> Comparisons and parallels within the story, especially the three generations of women in the family, had great potential, but somehow did not extend completely. It could have made the film much easier to relate to and stick to what is the purpose of every film about lost love and regained life. <br /> <br /> IMHO, I think the film suffered from a lack of direction in the script, although Harry Connick Jnr and Sandra Bullock tried desperately to give some life to the contours of the otherwise flat character. <br /> <br /> It's not that this is a bad movie, some parts let you understand the reasons for various developments of the plot, it's just that this film is subdued and a bit flat overall.
