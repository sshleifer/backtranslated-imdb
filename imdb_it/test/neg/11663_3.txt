"Disappointment" is what you feel when you watch this movie and then you think you've seen something useful. This film, which tells of a trio of semi-psychopathic travelers who have no use anywhere in the CA desert, is amateur and simply stupid. The film suffers from a horrible story, a horrible script and a terrible direction just to mention some of the deficits. If the film has nothing to do, it is also the performance of the B-movie diva Rubin. Don't waste time with this turkey. (D)
