This film consists of 3 stories put together that revolve around 3 separate individuals. One of the worst films available and even better if it's not available. <br /> <br /> The Good: 2 cute lesbian actress 1 true and moving story of Theresa Chan <br /> <br /> The Bad: The main story revolving around the blind and dear woman Theresa Chan does not need to be told in a film format and more appropriate in a documentary format. No connection between the 3 lines of history. DIALOGO minimum in the film, replaced by SMS and CHAT programs on PC. No cultural vision of the film and it makes you forget even before leaving the cinema.
