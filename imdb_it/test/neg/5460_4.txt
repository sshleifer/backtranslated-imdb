I was also disappointed with this movie. For beginners, the things that happen to them don't seem too terrible to me (I'm sorry, male chauvinist PoV). As one expressly says from one of the kidnapping women: "Most men would like to _paid_ to be in your position". To which he replies "But this is not my choice". OK, OK, that's right, so how bad has it really been? Let us know. But now the kicker: don't let _anyone_ know, until after the end of the film (unseen). He is not his girlfriend, he is not the mentor, not the police, not anyone. Instead, every girl he knows comes out with the brilliant plan of f * ck * ng so that he can recognize the tattoo (or something) of one of his captors. Did I think he had just had enough unpleasant sex during the 12 days of his imprisonment? Isn't it time to take a break from all this? For me, his, to use a euphemism, reckless actions have broken the "suspension of disbelief" of the film. I pulled out a book as I looked at the last half hour from the corner of my eye.
