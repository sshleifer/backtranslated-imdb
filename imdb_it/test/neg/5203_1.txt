Being a big fan of the original Delta Force Operation, I thought I would choose this movie. I thought it couldn't be too bad. However, here is a list of things I learned from observing Operation Delta Force 4: Deep Fault. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force, despite being the elite of the American armed forces, is mostly composed of slightly overweight men in the 30s and early 40s. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force, despite being the elite of the US military, carries standard police or AK-47 guns in their most important missions. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force, despite being the elite of the American armed forces, has not learned that during stealth missions, wearing bright red jump jerseys and running in open spaces will not exactly make you disappear from the view. <br /> <br /> - When you drop a Molotov cocktail in a tank, it explodes outside like a grenade. <br /> <br /> - When you are hit by a fire, you can escape, even if the smoke may be less difficult to breathe. <br /> <br /> - You can die from a standard gunshot, but you can also live despite being hit several times by a sniper rifle, and a few times by an AK-47. <br /> <br /> - In melee combat, members of the Delta Force, despite being the elite of the US military, are regularly beaten by railroad workers. > <br /> - If the bad guys are approaching you while you're on a slowly moving train, there's nothing to worry about - among the 4 of them, they can't figure out how to automatically fire an automatic weapon, much less hit anyone from 5 meters (16 feet) with at least 50 attempts between them. <br /> <br /> - If you run out of actors, just recycle them - the Operation Delta Force 1 villain plays the good guy called Mac in the Delta Force 4 operation, and the guy who played with Mac in the Delta Force 3 operation now plays Skip Lang, another good guy. <br /> <br /> - It is not right for The Delta Force to shoot an unarmed terrorist, even if he is trying to reload his weapon to kill you. <br /> <br /> - Grenades explode on impact with the ground when thrown by Delta Force members. When launched by non-Delta Force personnel, they explode exactly at the point where Delta Force members threw grenades at the villains. <br /> <br /> - Tanks can drive faster than standard trucks. <Br /> <br /> - The militias and personal armies use the exact same chopper used by the UN in the Delta Force 1 operation. <br /> <br /> - When a helicopter arrives, a villain in that helicopter can't see you if you lie face down. <br /> <br /> - Shooting someone multiple times in the chest will cause minor damage. The detention of that person in the knee will kill them within 5 seconds. <br /> <br /> - Delta Force steals cars from the elderly to move when they are in foreign countries, because the US military does not provide them with any transportation. This could also explain why they took public transport. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is not really the best time to make films, but it's good for a laugh.
