I loved the first movie, the second one was ok, disappointed John Cleese was no longer a jean bob like my favorite character. But the third ... what happened to the animation ??? looks like a low budget like a morning matt cartoon! except for the flashback that was taken from the first movie. They should really stop after the number 2, this makes the rest look ugly !! Derek's voice has changed, but it's not as recognizable as a jean bob ... Players seem very strange. Also, I don't understand where Rothbart comes from. I thought he was dead! This film made me want to turn it off, as much as I love the first, I was very disappointed with this episode. They will never beat the original! :)
