The Man (Gaston Modot) and The Young Girl (Lya Lys) cross the film consumed by passion for one another. They want to be together but their moments together are constantly interrupted. The film is littered with images and stops after an hour ......... lovers find happiness ....? .. <br /> <br /> The film begins in an interesting way with the scorpion footage but you soon realize that it's all a pretentious piece of nonsense. It is made like a silent film with occasional dialogues and has a non-stop soundtrack that at one point is so irritating that it lowers the volume and wants to look like a silent movie. The continuous rolls of drums must have made the cinema public go crazy. There are some really fun moments, for example, when the man kicks a dog and when he hits a blind man. Unfortunately, this humor takes place in the name of art, so it's just a pseudo nonsense. The film is crap.
