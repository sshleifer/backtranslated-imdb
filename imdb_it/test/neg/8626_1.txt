I can't believe this movie has 6 stars on IMDb. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen that wasn't an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The plot is predictable. I couldn't think of any of the characters. The dialogue is poor. Several moments in the film made me really moan (including Kiefer Southerland's close fool and the incredibly lame joke that ends the film). Jeff Bridges' accent is stupid: I can't tell which country it comes from. It must be one of the least thrilling thrillers I've ever seen ... after the character of Sandra Bullock disappears, absolutely nothing happens to advance the story for a full 45 minutes. If I could, I'd give this movie a negative amount of stars.
