Shirley Temple films for Twentieth Century Fox are not negligible because they are badly made (Darryl F. Zanuck supervised most of them, after all); they do not retain much of the "classic" stature among movie fans, especially since they are weighed down by the syrupy optimism of the Hollywood Depression era. The public of the 1930s was appeased by the pleasure of seeing a solar girl, often an orphan, who made adults look stupid by comparison (they shook and shook hands while dancing her problems away). Seen these years later, Temple vehicles have barely made history (always helped by musical sequences to reinforce the content), and its timing (always too perfect) and exaggerated reactions could leave the most modern spectators rolling their eyes. No one could be blamed for their exasperation at Temple's performance here (screaming at the top of his lungs) or at the perversity of his dance moves, sashaying with a crowd of sailors at "Al Codfish Ball". And yet, the fantastic aspect of this particular story, previously filmed in 1924 by Laura E. Richard's book, is enough to capture those with the proper mushy spirit. It appears that Shirl was pulled from a shipwreck by a government-appointed lighthouse keeper, but when a state council officer discovers that the tyke is not in school, he threatens to take him away. It doesn't matter if the official with the prone face has a point where the Temple is not bred correctly (the woman turns almost into a proverbial village); one can immediately see that the Temple can stand up to itself, taking care of itself and its old guardian in the pact (as well as the local widow who has her hooks for the Captain). The temple is not the only one excessively tried; The month of January of Guy Kibbee is destined to reactions with wide eyes, so often you wonder if maybe he didn't film them all in one day. The dialogue is full of metaphors on the waterfront ("You can't run a trout!" ... "Well, don't give up the ship!), And something about the whole business seems oddly pixelated." *** *
