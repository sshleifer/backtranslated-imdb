Odious Chuck Norris decided to put one last nail in the coffin <br /> <br /> containing his film career before going to the safe world of CBS <br /> <br /> Saturday night carnage with this ugly hysterical supernatural <br /> <br /> actioner. <br /> <br /> For such a stupid movie this thing is sure. Norris is the Chicago policeman <br /> <br /> Frank Shatter. First of all, what kind of surname is "Shatter"? <br /> <br /> Have you ever met Shatters? Genforum.com does not have a list for <br /> <br /> the surname Shatter, which opens any clever viewer to <br /> <br /> replacing "a" in Shatter with an "i". He and his partner, Calvin <br /> Jackson, do the same old cop routine you've seen before <br /> <br />: have fun with the pimps and drive their captain crazy. /> <br /> Jackson, who resembles the theoretical love son of Whoopi Goldberg <br /> and Rick James, quickly wears on his nerves with his constant whining <br /> and Eddie Murphy - patented facial expressions. <br /> <br /> Shatter and Calvin are involved in a Satan emissary, <br /> <br /> with which we are introduced to the too long opening scenes. <br /> <br /> Prosatano is a demon who is locked up in a crypt by King Richard the <br /> <br /> Lionhearted. The scepter of the demon, from which it gains its power, is busted in nine pieces and hidden by nine men in nine different parts of the world. <br /> <br /> In 1951, some grave robbers left Accidentally outside <br /> <br /> and he began to collect the nine pieces. He disguises himself as a professor of antiquities named Lockley and <br /> <br /> always holds a lecture where a holy man is killed <br /> <br /> and a piece of the scepter is taken. <br /> <br /> Norris brings in his "Walker: Texas Blunder" cohort Sheree Wilson, <br /> <br /> who plays Lockley's assistant. Help Norris with his investigations <br />, make eyes on each other and our intrepid investigators travel to Israel after a rabbi died in <br /> Chicago. While in Israel, Calvin is given even more to complain about: the heat, lack of accommodation in restaurants, bad drivers <br /> and the fact that he misses the Chicago Bulls Playoff Games <br /> <br />. Norris even manages to make a nice Israeli guy work in this nightmare <br /> <br />. Bezi steals Calvin's wallet, and hangs around the men, <br /> <br /> taking them around Israel and raising no suspicion of any sort. <br /> <br /> In the end, Lockley (Prosatano) assembles all the scepter pieces <br /> <br />, but needs the blood of royalty to complete the ceremony <br /> <br /> and call the devil. Where to find royal blood? Well, Sheree's father <br /> <br /> is a duke! It has an American accent but it is the convenient method of the writers to force this monstrosity towards its inevitable conclusion. Of course, this follower of Satan could have killed millions of people over the years, but how will he make a nice old-fashioned American football? <Br /> <br /> After Prosatano was defeated, killed by his own scepter (I envied him <br /> <br />, he didn't have to watch Bezi steal Calvin's wallet again <br /> <br />), we are treated to a terrible queue involving a bearded man <br /> <br /> who looked at Shutter, I mean Shatter, and Calvin on <br /> <br /> their search. See, it was predicted ... somewhere ... that two warriors from the west would defeat Prosatano. The silent <br /> <br /> bearded man who watched over the couple was none other than <br /> <br /> Jesus ... no kidding. It is listed as "Prophet" in the credits, <br /> <br /> but you and your pets will recognize the subtle Christian reference <br /> <br /> that the directors are trying to expose here. <br /> <br /> As in "I Use a Walker: Texas Ranger", Norris is aging and can no longer <br /> <br /> enter his fight scenes. He kicks a lot, and <br /> <br /> people fly over the furniture in slow motion, and then Norris gives all his line readings in that monotonous voice of his. Oh, what a true director <br /> <br /> might be able to show off from him! His brother Aaron, <br /> <br /> who also directed him in other films, has no sense of history <br /> or momentum. The scenes are cast for the ego, not for entertaining. The scenes in which the dynamic duo meets Bezi drag <br /> to infinity, and then Bezi is not that important for the rest of the movie <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in Israel, which means that the Americans could insult Israelis in person. Here there is no nice Israeli character <br /> <br />. The captain of the Israeli police is an idiot. <br /> <br /> The police driver does not know English, and Calvin convinces him <br /> <br /> that the word "sh * tty" is a compliment. Nothing could be more fun than <br /> <br /> which mocks those stupid foreigners on their territory, especially <br /> <br /> when all this racist humor comes from an American minority <br /> <br /> which would like I was more than offended if the tables were turned <br /> <br /> and the Israeli cop was mocking the African American policeman on <br /> <br /> Chicago. <br /> <br /> This film is poorly written, badly performed and poorly directed. It doesn't work like action, cop drama or even horror. It just shows that <br /> <br /> the now-defunct Cannon Studios was willing to throw his money into anything, no matter how badly planned. "Hellbound" is certainly a more appropriate title. I didn't like this movie intensely. <br /> <br /> This is assessed (R) for physical violence, armed violence, strident words, some sexual references and some adult situations. <Br /> <br />
