This movie is bad. Not so bad it's good. Very bad. It's still hilariously bad. I looked at it out of a morbid curiosity and I never intend to watch it again any other Chuck Norris movie. If you have to choose between this movie and death, you should happily choose this movie, however, since it is a terrible film master (hence the hilarity). <br /> <br /> It is a constant depression for me, while I grind up my desk work, some people get involved in making films and decide to produce things like this. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10. Even better than "Starship Troopers" "though.
