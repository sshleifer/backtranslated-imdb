Sighing, the stupid government once again attempted to create an inexhaustible and indestructible soldier, and of course the experiments were terribly wrong, charging us with half a man - half a mutant who vomits very much and squeaks like a little girl every time he's angry. Lance Henriksen plays the honest scientist who immediately abandoned the experiment after hearing that it was a military project, but he returns (taking the whole family with him) when he discovers that his beloved guinea pig has been reveling. "Mind Ripper" is certainly a watchable horror film, but it is very unoriginal and has practically all the clich√©s of which it is impossible to do without (including the alien / rebellious father secondary son of the plot ... yawn). The characters are like wooden puppets, the most stupid things are said and done and there is a sequence of dreams completely useless ... coming from the monster !!! There are a handful of interesting gory scenes to enjoy and some of the isolated places in the desert are actually disturbing. Lance Henriksen is as adequate as ever, although this is yet another lower production, and Giovanni Ribisi certainly deserved a better film for his debut. For some reason, this anonymous thriller from the 1990s is also known as "The Hills Have Eyes" part 3 ". Is it because they are members of the same family terrified in the desert? It's because Wes Craven was once again involved, like "Producer this time? Or maybe it's because the monster gets bald towards the end like the bizarre Michael Berryman in the original 1977? Who knows ... who cares? Probably Wes Craven funded this project because his son co-wrote the script and is always moving to find out that your children are equally lacking in talent like you, not recommended!
