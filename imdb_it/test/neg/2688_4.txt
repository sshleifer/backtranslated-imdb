This film is truly amazing, over the years I have acquired a taste for Japanese Monster films and I am well aware that the first examples of this kind can be poor. However this reaches a new low, as follows the adventures of Johnny Sokko (?), A young boy who controls a Giant Robot, and his fight against the evil Gargoyle Gang, which seems to have an endless supply of hideous giant monsters at their disposal .
