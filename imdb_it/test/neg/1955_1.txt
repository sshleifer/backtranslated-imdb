Jack Frost 2. THE worst "horror movie" I've ever seen. Why? 1) The premise is GOOD beyond ridicule 2) The damn thing doesn't even have the legs to go on! 3) It escapes AFTER being completely submerged in Anti-Freeze (first film) 4) Take this ... Cross an ocean of SALT WATER towards a TROPICAL island to take revenge on the sheriff who did it in the first movie. 5) "Killer Snowballs". I have yet to be drunk enough to see "Ginger Dead Man" as well as writing this, Jack Frost 2 holds the distinction of being the most stupid "horror" movie ever. Even overcoming the madness of his predecessor (if you can believe it!).
