The novel by Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness is a dark, deep and lasting novel that portrays the futility and irony taking place in Africa. If you are looking for a good book to read over the weekend, this is not the book for you. Conrad has nothing against it when he describes nineteenth-century imperialism, but the novel makes no sense without giving it the thought and consideration it deserves. If I read this novel in search of a great adventure, I would say that I lost time, but looking at the perspective of explaining the futility of nineteenth-century civilization, I would say that this is one of the most significant novels I have ever read. Since I read this novel during my English course, and analyzed each page, I think I enjoyed the book more than anyone would read for entertainment. I'm not going to lie, this book was difficult and challenges the reader to dig deep into this novel to find the true meaning. The film, on the other hand, seemed boring and boring to me. The film, "Heart of Darkness", is not close to giving justice to the book. The film has left out many key parts that I consider important for getting the true message of history. If you have difficulty understanding and visualizing the novel, the film could be a good recourse, but I would not recommend seeing the film as an alternative to the novel or even to a different perspective.
