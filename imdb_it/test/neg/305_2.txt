The premise of the film was very promising, a kind of gay film of the Napoleon Dynamite type. And to be honest, there were some funny moments and funny lines, but in general it wasn't very good. The script and dialogue seemed to be a local sketch production, full of clich√©s and predictable scenes. <br /> <br /> However, there was enough that it was fun, that I stopped to see how it was finished, since there were suggests that something special happens at the end. But it seems that the film has run out of money or that the writer has run out of ideas because the ending is extremely rough, almost jumping directly from what appeared to be the key conflict in the film to the end credits. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was very disappointing but not entirely unwatchable ...
