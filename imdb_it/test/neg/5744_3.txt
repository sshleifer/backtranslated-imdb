These are some vampires (who can run around in the sunlight), which are causing some problems in South America. Casper Van Dien is sent with his commando team to investigate. The film opens with Van Dien & Co. walking in the jungle, and there is this huge black man who absolutely can't act. He talks all his lines as if he were reading them from the sticks for the first time. Even his voice is so low that, well, it's positively exhilarating. Great way to start the movie! In any case, they meet some of our vampires, shoot them (this makes them seem to die for about 20 seconds), and then, of course, come back to life. Van Dien notes that one of them was impaled on a tree branch and shouts to his friends to kill them with wood. The work of the stunts must be seen to be believed - vampires are on wires that pull them up trees, which should make them look like they can climb easily, but it makes them look like they're hopping on bungee cords or something gender. <br /> <br /> Yes ... however, later, the huge black guy is in South America with some guys (Van Dien not included), and they are attacked by other vampires. It's really a shame that these guys have never heard of a crossbow, because it would seem to be the perfect weapon for killing small bloodsuckers, but instead they use large old wooden stakes that try to impale vampires with their hands. The great black dude ends up being captured and eventually becomes a great and powerful vampire leader. Van Dien ends up beating him later. It doesn't help the whole movie, everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire, they are thrown out for 20 seconds or so, which would allow a person to stick a pole in them quite easily. They just try to attack the stakes in the middle of hand-to-hand combat. Yes, not really brilliant tactics. <br /> <br /> Is there a beautiful girl (remember Veronica from the TV show The Lost World? Yes, she is!) Who also finds herself walking in the middle of Vampire County for some sort of a research mission , and she also appears to be Van Dien's ex-wife. Hey, what are the odds? It is a pity that it is not much more in the film than you. Will his and Casper come back together in the end? Will Van Dien defeat the huge black guy who can't act? Will circus vampires make you laugh among all the action scenes? Will we hear the music of the three minions when someone does something funny? Has Lynn Carter even forgotten how to act in her little cameo (is it more convincing in her Sleep Number Bed commercials)? These questions and other answers will be answered until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> I don't know, it could score points so it's so good, but that's it. Eh, it's a lot of people running in the jungle, I guess it's fun.
