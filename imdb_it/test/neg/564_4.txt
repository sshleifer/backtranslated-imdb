Done in a fake-documentary style, the subversives of the late 1960s and the alleged detractors of the official government are arrested and given a choice. After having condemned their wrongdoing, there is a choice to go to prison for 7 years to life or spend three days and two nights in a Southern California desert at Punishment Park. In the 100 degree heat, prisoners must travel fifty odd miles to an American flag for their freedom. US and state law enforcement will follow the last two hours. If dissidents are caught it means prison. <br /> <br /> Appearing in this pseudo-documentary: Carmen Argenziano, Katherine Quittner, Mary Ellen Kleinhall, Stan Armsted, Scott Turner, Patrick Boland and Kent Foreman.
