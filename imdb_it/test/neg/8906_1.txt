I got this movie on DVD with the title Evil Never Sleeps, which gives the cover of the cover to Carrie Ann Moss, but plays a character so small that I didn't really notice it in the film. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid to consider it one of the worst purchases I've ever made. The dialogue was prodded and the delivery in wood, I found the acting to be disconnected from the plot. Graham's performance to me was of someone wondering if he had left the gas at home. <br /> <br /> All in all both my wife and I found this painful movie to watch, and it's not a valid addition to my collection, look at your own risk, but spending 90 minutes with nails pulled out would probably be a best way to spend time.
