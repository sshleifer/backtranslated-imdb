There was no need for this simple and simple film. The original, though hated by some, was something I found really funny, especially since it was before Jim Carrey really started to lose his touch, and Cameron Diaz was, well, "Smoooooookin!" Nuff said. So why create a sequel / prequel? Honestly? Knowing that Jim Carrey would not do it should have been a sufficient indication that he did not deserve to be created. But then they just make a mistake after the error. Jamie Kennedy. Why is this man still allowed to breathe? Writing and history: terrible. Why should I want to see a child wearing a mask? Also, why should I watch it fly? Never? HOW DID SOMEONE DID THAT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?! The acting is contemptible, in fact almost everything in this film is. I'm trying to stay calm, or probably IMDb won't let me post this. Bottom line: don't look at this piece of garbage. Collect the original, look at how Cameron Diaz looked and how Jim Carrey had a career, and laughed. Don't waste a single second of your time on this.
