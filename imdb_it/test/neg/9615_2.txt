Oh dear, like Alfred Hitchcock (North by Northwest, Spellbound, the 39 Steps) could be a hit. Don't worry about searching for hidden depths or deep meanings - there are none. This is just horrible, bleak and cheap. The only thing that redeems is the domestic life of the inspector who conducts the investigation - his wife imagines herself as a gastronomic cook and constantly serves her revolting culinary experiments to her poor husband. This is fun, and it pretty much saved me by putting the movie in "horrible" brackets, but the film as a whole is one of the most unpleasant I've ever seen. I think this was Hitchcock's penultimate film - maybe someone was trying to tell him something.
