"Hero and the Terror" is a rather boring thriller - a la: no real character substance, predictable plot and ... boring. For a thriller I found this film slow to work up to its pitiful climax, as it seemed to drag on until Chuck's wife's son was born ... and then drags from there to the end - something I hardly remember already if I saw the movie only 10 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 out of 10 - for the first 10-20 minutes.
