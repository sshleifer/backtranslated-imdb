Not long ago I bought a cheap VHS tape called "Just Rambling Along" that apparently starred with Laurel and Hardy. Being a little familiar with their release and not recognizing this title, I made the agonizing decision to separate myself from a whole dollar and buy it. After playing it, I identified the film as HOP TO IT. Of course, Mr. Laurel was not in the cast, making the packaging of this criminal product misleading. Even worse, the quality is terrible. It appears to have been tricked by an 8mm film source. He had a rather appropriate musical score. In reality, in all seriousness, the tape is worthwhile if you just want to get an idea of ​​what the film is like. In my opinion, it is a discreet but not exceptional short film. IMDb should add JUST RAMBLING ALONG as an alternative title for this film, which incidentally was the name of a 1918 Stan Laurel movie!
