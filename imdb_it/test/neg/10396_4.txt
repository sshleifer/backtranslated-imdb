Fan documentaries are always mishmash and not worth seeing, but I found this, created by some of the fans themselves, rather than enlightening. As a veteran of Tolkien's original craze, forty years ago, I had hoped for something more than obvious - which is not always true. If anyone lives who doesn't already know the nature of a fandom, a fandom, a fan or a known one, he won't find out here. Between irrelevance, banality (to which the actors of the films are particularly inclined) and acting (from the fans who do the maximum - if not the best - of their only shot of glory), I could catch little of the special charm of LOTR, the particular answers emotional that it evokes and the range of special creative forms that those answers can take. Moreover, the film is rather lazy: it obscures some facts that could have been tackled with little effort, eg. what was the exact legal loophole (the wording of a copyright notice) that allowed unauthorized publication of books in the United States (About: I take a strong exception for dismissing the covers of that edition as "irrelevant" and " psychedelic "" They were the work of Jack Gaughan, an illustrator sf of the very capable period, and some fans, including me, found them more suitable and more attractive than the covers of the rival set.)
