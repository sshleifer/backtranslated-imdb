Although Humphrey Bogart got a star on King Of The Underworld, I'm willing to bet he didn't thank Jack Warner for that. In reality this film was an empty crown. <br /> <br /> King of the Underworld was apparently a remake of the Paul Muni film, Dr. Socrates, but since Humphrey Bogart was in the cast, the character is written more like Duke Mantee in the petrified forest. He also has an English writer in the person of James Stephenson. <br /> <br /> Kay Francis and John Eldredge are a married couple of doctors and Eldredge does some surgery to one of Bogart's henchmen. Bogey is a man who appreciates the good work done on his behalf and gives Eldredge $ 500.00 and there's more to where he comes from if he plays his cards right. Eldredge that has a problem with gambling sees a good way to get an undeclared income. <br /> <br /> But when he is killed in a raid on the band's hideout, Francis is also believed to be involved in the law and the American Medical Association, no matter how his innocence protests. Not good and she and her aunt Jessie Busley move to a small town to get away from fame. Of course the notoriety and Bogart and a traveling writer like Leslie Howard at Stephenson all meet with her again. But Kay is brave and resourceful to say the least. <br /> <br /> The character of Bogart was ridiculous, no wonder the poor boy was screaming for better parts. He is a gangster who brings down people without mercy and gives his henchmen to the buggies only for laughter. He is concerned about his image and then kidnaps writer Stephenson to write his autobiography and, of course, confesses enough to burn it in all 48 states. And then Kay Francis completely overcame him, hard to believe he was the king of everything. Definitely one of the minor jobs for both stars.
