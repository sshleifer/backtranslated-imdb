To call this movie a decent or funny horror tribute is too optimistic. Heck, you can't even refer to it as a nice parody of the genre because it's far below average (it's funny, but not "haha-funny, you know.) But I'd still say to check it out. Just for the "huge amount of curiosity in it. By the way, all the people who complain about this movie here in their comments have only themselves to blame. When you see the DVD cover of this movie, you should already know that it won't be at same level as "The Piano", for example, so don't complain later ... <br /> <br /> Evil And it could have been something, but it was completely ruined. I suppose the main idea behind this film is the criticism of the growing horror cutting committee nowadays: it shows a publisher named Edward who is slowly (well, not too slowly) going crazy seeing all the violence and blood in the produced movies from his company. The big boss is called Sam Campbell ... Funny, isn't it? Personally, I was also expecting a character named Bruce Raimi, but with my company there wasn't. However, this guy became rich by making movies called "Loose Limbs". They present (and I'm not kidding!) Scenes in which a girl is raped by a BEAVER (?) And then she is hit in the head by a bazooka !!! Now, who says horror is no longer original? <br /> <br /> With all the blood and "free limbs", it's hard to believe, but it gets really boring very quickly. After a decent first 25 minutes, Evil Ed turns into a complete boredom and never recovers from that. The only thing left to do then (in addition to pressing the eject button, of course) is to look for the obvious amount of references to other much better horror films. I've seen scenes obviously stolen from The Evil Dead, Silence of the Lambs, Braindead and many others. And there's also a huge amount of classic horror posters on the walls to admire. <br /> <br /> Evil Ed originated in Sweden. I am convinced that there is a lot of talent there, far to the north (take the Danish "Nattevagten" as an example) ... but none of them took part in Evil Ed's cast or crew. Just to see if you're in the mood stupid and you don't want to use your brain at all.
