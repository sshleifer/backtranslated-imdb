A Time To Kill is based on John Grisham's first novel, the one he wrote before he became famous, and the one that did not lead to fame. (This would be done by "The Firm"). That is why this film was not made much later, after Grisham had stopped churning out meaningless books with fresh cinema dollar signs in his head. Unlike most of them, this book really talked about something. He had meat, he had weight, and he had a heart. <br /> <br /> But it also had a fatal flaw, and this fatal flaw is translated into the film. That is, "A Time To Kill" puts you up. <br /> <br /> Here we have a black man (Jackson), on trial for the murder of two white men who brutally raped and tortured his 10-year-old daughter. We have a disadvantaged lawyer (McConaughey) who fights the big bad system to save his client. And, by the way, the whole thing is set against the backdrop of racism in Mississippi, complete with KKK hooded men burning crosses. <br /> <br /> In other words, we should sympathize with Carl Lee Hailey. We should believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who rape her. We should feel the injustice of a system in which a completely white racist jury could judge a black man who was just trying to avenge a brutal crime. We should feel like we're next to the people who sing "Free Carl Lee". <br /> <br /> But the problem of racism is a smokescreen, and everything is designed. Carl Lee Hailey was a vigilante. Yes, there were extenuating circumstances for what he did, but the fact remains that he was not innocent. This would have been true no matter what the color of his skin, or the color of the skin of his daughter's attackers, the judge, the jury or anyone else. <br /> <br /> And what's so heavy about this film is that it paints anyone who believes that Carl Lee should have been convicted of being a racist. The message seems to be that if you believe that the law should not be taken into people's hands, then you could also burn crosses on a lawn somewhere wearing a hood. <br /> <br /> This is not the first time a heavy dose of sentimentalism is inserted into a story like this, and it won't be the last. As a film, A Time To Kill remains faithfully faithful to the book, and acting is not bad. But he played the hand that was dealt, really. Even a good cast cannot elevate wrong source material.
