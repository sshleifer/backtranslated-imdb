Terrible film Simply terrible The beginning of this film is like something out of a bad woman in a prison movie. Then it becomes a B version of Aliens. B-movie in this case means the addition of free sex scenes and women in lingerie. Oh, many of the shots are exactly the same as those used in two other films by the same company (including women in prison). The only thing that saves this movie from a 1/10 is that I've seen worse movies. Not many, and not much, but worse.
