Minor strippers <br /> <br /> First of all I must say how rare and fascinating it is to find a film with such elementary messages: nuclear war will inevitably destroy all civilization and women will do it. It is absolutely amazing how well laid out the plot to hit in these two points, like with a gold hammer. Basically, everything about this movie bothered me. Casual sexism, the character whose only trait came from Texas, the mysterious choice of dying Mars orange and, of course, the imperfect science of all this. Then the Martian woman who screams as if she had just noticed she was blind? What was that? However, I will give it credit. The fifties spit out some more stupid things. But not much...
