This film was one of the first, of the 70s, of the female film genre. This film was incredibly violent, with so much sadistic torture inflicted on inmates. The film takes place in the Philippines, which looks like a horribly ugly country. Undoubtedly, the producers took advantage of this factor to their advantage, to highlight the gruesome situation in which the prisoners were. Pam Grier, the queen of the Blaxploitation cinema, has the starring role in this film. Play Blossom, a renegade who is catapulted into the vile female prison, with invented accusations. Her fianc√©, played by Sid Haig, tries to save Blossom. He and Blossom are part of a political guerrilla faction, and Blossom's incarceration was orchestrated by the corrupt government of Phillipino. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier and Sid Haig stand out among the other cast actors. The film itself has placed too much emphasis on violence perpetrated against prisoners. Their captors used them only as objects of their sadism. This has become boring very quickly. This film could have used more interesting plot lines and subtlety. This is not one of the best photos of Roger Corman. The many films of women in prison that followed this film were much better all around. I would recommend The Big Bird Cage, only to Pam Grier fans.
