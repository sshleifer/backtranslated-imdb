Well, it's been ten years since this film was released and the sands of time haven't improved a bit, even here Australian filmmakers should have a little more drama than middle-class aussies who they ride beautiful places on bicycles with not much in the era of dialogue. the middle class is neither fun nor rich. there is also a mixture of casts. because a young woman will marry a man old enough to be his father, escapes me. It's a shame for this film, it looks like a wonderful place for the holidays. However, an hour and thirty minutes of my life I will never go back. life soon to watch this movie.
