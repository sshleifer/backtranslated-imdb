Amazing that something like this could find a way to be seen by the public. I knew it was from Uwe Boll, and I found it in the barter shop for $ 2 (still pretty steep, considering) but morbid curiosity led me to see this, and: <br /> <br /> 1) . I'm pretty sure this is a rip-off of Seven, Silence of the Lambs and American Psycho, all in one, with dialogues that may have been written by preteens. <br /> <br /> 2). Casper Van Dien plays the main character, and it's so utterly bizarre and disturbing that almost everyone would know that he must be the crazy serial killer. <br /> <br /> 3). Jennifer Rubin plays the "good cop" who invites a serial killer to her apartment for a home-cooked dinner, and what does she get for her trouble? I'll make you guess. <br /> <br /> 4). Michael Pare plays an "intense" cop who drives a VW Bug, a new style, that is, with a siren. A VW bug ... that will drive fear into the hearts of the criminal when they see it coming. <br /> <br /> 5). Van Dien breaks up with the boyfriend, but he still has a "non-engaged" party, complete with "not a wedding cake". Imagine that everyone's surprise comes (he was, of course, invited) and everyone shoots. <br /> <br /> 6). In reality, this should be the no. 1, really. The killer in this is known as "The Monkey Maker". This is, without a doubt, the dumbest killer name that someone could have invented in a million years. Presumably it has something to do with "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil", saying, complete with monkeys. It is possible that even the monkeys have something to do with the script. <br /> <br /> 7). Oh yes, and there's a club that Van Dien visits near the beginning of the film. Is there a bad disco music, I mean really ugly, and a chain-fenced cage with, uh, gang members fighting each other with baseball bats? This is what it looked like. And, of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg, the really interesting stuff (?!) Continue into the basement, where some questionable "actor" talks to a woman about signing a confession before she gets hit, this is, I guess , a movie snuff? I'm not sure how this fits into the rest of the film, and Boll probably wasn't either, so if he wasn't worried, then I wouldn't worry. <br /> <br /> An incredible piece of non-entertainment that will make you feel like you're watching something from a parallel universe. A parallel universe that is KIND similar to ours, but where things are just enough outside where they don't seem right. You have entered "The Boll Zone". Get out as quickly as possible and don't look back. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
