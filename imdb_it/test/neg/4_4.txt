Alas, another Costner movie that lasted an hour. Credible performances, but the script had nowhere to go and was in no hurry to get there. First we are offered a series of unrelated events, some of which deepen the story. Will the script focus on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? What about Fischer and Thomas? In the end, no real frontal story ever develops and the characters themselves are artificially supported by third-party monologues. The singer explains Randall, Randall explains Fischer, and so on. Finally, long after you don't care anymore, you'll learn something about scriptwriting encounters. Three finals were undoubtedly proffered and no one could make a decision. The final result? All three were used, one after the other, after another. If you can get past the 100th yawn, you will be able to spot them. Despite the transparent attempt to earn points with a dedication to the Coast Guard, this should have been washed on the first day.
