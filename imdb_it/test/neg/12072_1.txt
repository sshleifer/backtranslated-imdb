Well, I think I finally saw my last Woody Allen movie! I read the review in the newspaper and went to see this movie with the expectation of having a good experience with Woody Allen (as I have had many times before). Well, that wasn't the case. This film has nothing to offer. Even with the wonderful performance of the talented Sean Penn, this film failed. One of the characteristics of his other films is made up of several characters: variety, witty dialogue. This film basically consisted of one character, very one-dimensional. He almost didn't laugh. It probably looked good on paper! I think the only special thing was Samantha Morton's performance. Now I will look for his films in the future. So in conclusion, this film was a huge disappointment. >
