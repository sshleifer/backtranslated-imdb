FREDDY FORSYTH has developed a plot that fits the mood of the West's suspicions about Putin's Russia. Forsyth installs an ugly character like President Ruski who wants to return to the country - not so much for Stalin's communism but for Hitler's fascism. In fact, his political manifesto could have come directly from Mein Kampf rather than from Marx. And the lunatic has the latest weapons of biological destruction to reach the pogrom of ethnic cleansing of the Russian Federation. The American mercenaries connect with the Russian Prez to realize his fanatical and genocidal dream, but then they join Dirty Dancing's Pat Swayze ... and, yes, things get really bad. Jason Monk, a former drifter operating in the United States, is drafted by the British government to see what the Russians are doing. Like a sidebar, the character of Swayze who is not a Mystic (!) Generated a Russian beauty Elena (played by the beautiful Marta Kondova) in her previous missions in the former state of Communion. Hardman Swayze does an acceptable job trying to defeat the bad Russians. But the unknown young actress Marta Kondova steals the film as her 18-year-old Russian daughter, Elena, who helps Daddy uproot the terror that threatens his beloved Mother Russia.
