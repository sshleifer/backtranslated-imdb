What a pity. This could have been good. The main problems are the script and the star. The film cannot decide whether to be a slapstick comedy (of a very trivial and routine type) or whether to be an insightful satire on old East Germany and its customs. However, his attempts at the latter completely fail. The film does not hold up well and the finish is very artificial and incredible. All the stereotypes about German comedy are unfortunately strengthened. <br /> <br /> The characters are all stereotypes and the protagonist, played by Kim Frank, is colorless to the extreme. He can't bring the film and seems to have been chosen largely for his baby face. It may not be the fault of the whole actor (he is a pop singer), since the script does not give him much to work on. <br /> <br /> One more: the recreation of the "German" style of East Germany is good. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the film feels somewhat dishonest and humiliating. The film seems to have been churned out by people who weren't necessarily giving their best and just wanted to earn from a few economic laughs. (If they gave their best, it's really a sad case!) I watched it in the cinema with an audience from East Germany and felt sorry for them. The GDR regime was terrible in all respects, but those who lived through it deserve better.
