OK, yes, I know I am a Philistine, and I have no knowledge, nor love for the work. I readily admit that I could feel different in this film if I did. But not me. So for those of you like me, skip this unless you want to look at pretty girls (sometimes naked). For what it's worth, I thought the first segment with Theresa Russell (which I didn't recognize) was the best.
