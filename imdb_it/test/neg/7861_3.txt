During the 1990s, several attempts were made to revive the old Matsumoto series. Yoshinobu Nishizaki tried to revive the old Yamato saga in the form of a ridiculous "Yamato 2520", which was completely abandoned after only two episodes. Captain Harlock suffered from a confused and useless "Harlock Saga", while the Galaxy Express 999 suffered from having this movie of a film stapled to his name. <br /> <br /> If you saw "Queen Millennia", you will remember that it was a wonderful movie in its own way. Maetel Legend tries to tell a sequel to this already concluded chapter, finding also a way to suck it. <br /> <br /> This film takes all the annoying aspects of a generic science fiction movie pulp, mixes it up with the rhythm of the melodrama, and adds an insult to an injury, launches some of the most famous characters in the universe of Matsumoto. <br /> <br /> The only saving aspect of this film is a good work of art, but the rest is so incredibly bad that it cannot save this film from being a total loss. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed Queen Millennia or Galaxy Express, do yourself a favor and skip this trick of a movie. You will thank me.
