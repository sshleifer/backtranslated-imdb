This film is just another waste of time. The plot is ridiculous, the US drama forced. The characters were all very weak, especially the unmistakable Goya and the bad interpretation of Bardem, who was just fine in his classical interpretation when he acted as an ally. <br /> <br /> Just another lost chance of spending the money on a good movie. I guess it wasn't a low budget movie. Definitely not recommended. Perhaps the director should think a little bit about whether the film makes sense or not before wasting so much money. Maybe they don't care about making a profit before throwing it to the movies. <br /> <br /> No more hope in cinema ...
