A root canal without anesthesia is more fun. This film is disturbing and useless. There is absolutely nothing credible in any of these characters or in the plot. In the name of God, what did these people think when they agreed to act in this film? The acting in this film is so incredibly bad, even by actors who are usually pretty damn good. "The In-Laws" is a funny movie. "The Birdcage" is a funny movie. "The Big Lebowski" is a humorous film. This film is simply stupid. I can't even understand the kind of sick mind it takes to write the "novel" on which this film is based. I honestly can't even think of a nice thing to say about this movie. It makes no sense. People please - I beg you - don't see this movie. You will regret it for the rest of your life. This film is not the worst ever made, but it is certainly right at the top of the list.
