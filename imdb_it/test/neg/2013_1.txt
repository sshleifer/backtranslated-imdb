Imagine the worst thing that can ever be conceived by the human intellect. Now imagine something infinitely more obscure - I mean, worse than that. Then multiply it by the amount of suction your Star Wars Holiday Special has. This film is far worse than that. <br /> <br /> "Dracula 3000: Infinite Darkness", played by famous and reputable actors such as Coolio and Langley Kirkwood (as "the horrible antagonist" of the film, Count ORLOCK) is fair to eat their feces exclusively for all life, condensed in about an hour and twenty minutes. To be honest, there is no way to deal with a review of this cinematic tragedy - full of communist propaganda, promotion of drug use, futuristic anachronisms and perhaps the worst special effects from the "War of the Worlds" (original). <br /> <br /> The hammer and scythe of the Soviet Union can be seen with pride in all the squalid sets that dare to call a spaceship. Lenin can be observed on several posters throughout the "film". And, of course, religion has been abolished for two centuries since. So they don't know who this "God" is, even if they have no reservations about using his name in vain. But of course, in the Socialist Republic of space (chaired by interstellar president Baker), death pills are legalized and quite common. However, the mobility of handicaps seems even worse than today (they don't even have a wheelchair ramp). <br /> <br /> Racial tensions continue to party throughout the galaxy in a fairly familiar and predictable way. We get a great comment on the ethnic division through lines like "is it Dracula a brotha?", "We brothas we have to stay together" and "once you go black, don't go back". Speaking of symbolic black characters, one is played by Coolio. Playing a stereotype of stoner, Coolio becomes perhaps the most boring and ridiculous vampire ever. Oh wait, SECOND most ridiculous vampire ever. That valuable title goes to our friend COUNT ORLOCK, from PLANET TRANSYLVANIA, in the CARPATICO SYSTEM. These two make it quite a pair, among Coolio's attempts to paralyze a paraplegic, strange attempts to make sharp noises, a 1004-year-old hairstyle, and GIGANTIC traits of utterly useless dialogues; and Count Orlock's twenty-dollar Halloween-style vampire costume, coffins explosions, or a confusing and inanimate story. <br /> <br /> One wonders if they have simply given Coolio the opportunity to get "as tall as a kite in the space" without gravity ", let him interact with the other" actors ", and left there . <br /> <br /> The reasoning of Count Orlock is also somewhat questioned: does he want "infinite darkness", what would the subtitle of the film be like? Do you want to eat the crew, or do you want * Coolio * to "kill them all"? Or do you want to give disabled people a chance in such an inhospitable future? It doesn't matter, because no plot of this film makes sense anyway. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film is to be his end. More for the fact that it means that the film is over rather than for the ugly accident of a climax that calls before the credits, instead of facing Count Orlock in a sort of duel (the most close you get is an Orlock shot that shakes at breakneck speed in front of ours protagonist, who dies soon after), our heroes beat him by cutting off his arm in a normal door. Orlock then proceeds to collapse, screeching from the pain for a lesion completely banal but understandably painful. This is by far the most fun you will get from this movie. Watching the twisted face of a vampire while crying in pain will make you sit on the edge of your seat - with a laugh. It is almost worth four dollars for that alone. Of course, right after we are treated with one of the worst one-liners in the film, the mandatory allusion to sex, and perhaps the SCUSA plus ABRUPT FOR A TERM * EVER *. They are driving towards the sun and their ship literally explodes only before they come close to the impact. I think they just passed the Wachowski brothers. for the worst final ever. <br /> <br /> I can only sleep at night because we know a sequel is impossible. Confident in this, we can safely say that this is the worst film ever created, and that it will never be surpassed in low quality, lower budget and lower acting talent.
