"The Puffy Chair" was a supreme 84-minute waste of my life that cannot be recovered and spent in a more useful way (even "The Blair Witch Project" was a better use of life's precious moments). It must be called "The Puffy Chair" because only the "swollen" chairs could accommodate the extremely important "inflated brothers" who drooled for public consumption; and, of course, they are so full of themselves that they have assumed that the public would actually consume their smear. "The Puffy Chair" made "The Wooly Boys" look like a cinematic masterpiece! "Valley of the Dolls", "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls", "Pink Flamingos", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "The Night of the Living Dead", "Urban Cowboy", "The Blob" - all these would be use better than his time, compared to the display of "The Puffy Chair". The characters portrayed are too predictable or too lacking in normal emotional reflexes to get closer to being nice or credible. Also, at some point in the movie, while the characters are supposed to be in the same small town, if you look closely, you can see that part of the city is apparently in the southern United States, and the other half is in Maine . This is a city, eh?
