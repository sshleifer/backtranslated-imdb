What an absolute joke about a film. The case of this film makes you believe that both Duel meets Jeepers Creepers meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Three good films in their own right and one might think, using their project, MM could not go far wrong. Well, that's what I thought, and I was very wrong! <br /> <br /> We follow two university students who travel miles in the desert to reach a wedding. They pick up a girl (they don't take her clothes off), then they are chased by a copy of Leatherface in a Monster Truck, which they call F ** kface (AKA Monster Man). <br /> <br /> The Monster Truck that I will admit is a fantastic vehicle, but the less-than-suspicious tracking scenes ruin its potential. <br /> <br /> So MM decides to have a bit of a grudge against these guys and chases for a while, untie them for a while and stop in a bar full of amputees, then go to a motel where the main character Adam sleeps with the hitchhiker Sarah (although both wear underwear!). Then they are captured by MM, taken to his home where they escape death and try to kill MM, but fail, hence the set-up for the sequel. Apart from a small "breakthrough", it is so. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome the first 2 minutes ?? where Adam's friend, Harley, is hiding from the hideout in the back of Adam's car to try to scare him, without any explanation of how Harley ever arrived, how long ago or how Adam failed to realize? without thinking that you already hate it, then you could enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Monster Man has a bad cinematography and a direction that are immediately discouraging. This is the kind of movie that you can catch like one of those movies in a box set of 20 horror movies you've never heard of. <br /> <br /> What is so irritating is Blockbuster stock so many of these poor quality movies that are digitally filmed by some amateur film students, and that's exactly what MM is (although IMDb claims this particular director was born in 1961). <br /> <br /> Acting in all this the film is atrocious The script, which the writer obviously considered funny, is irritating and childish. You have the impression that only one draft was written before you started shooting. In fact, the script is very expensive and the film seems impromptu, full of those boring and unpleasant conversations that are fun or important only for the people involved. Imagine you filmed yourself and your friends who have a conversation, sure, the points are fun ?? FOR YOU, but above all it is rubbish. Here's how the script is written for MM. <br /> <br /> Don't even look at it for blood? it is quite minimal and there are much more good films out there (Bad Taste, Evil Dead and others ??) <br /> <br /> Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, even with their generosity and holes in the plot, are of great long superior to this film. Compare the introduction of Jeepers Creepers with the introduction of Monster Man and you will see what I mean.
