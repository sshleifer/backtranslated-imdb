Without a doubt, the biggest waste of films of the year. This film is poorly structured, sadistic, cruel and full of unlikely characters. Besides this, and perhaps the worst crime, it is not interesting and very predictable. As soon as the character of Bill Pullman scrawled on the photo changing the word from "proof" to "violence", I had the whole plot understood. There are no surprises and there are no valid reasons to look at this garbage. The only thing that redeems is that I saw this thing for free on my HDNet cable and I didn't waste money. I would be really angry if I paid to see him in a theater. <br /> <br /> Anyone who labels this thing as a thriller really needs to get out more. A terrible film, terrible in every way that counts.
