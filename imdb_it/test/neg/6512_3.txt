A not so good action thriller because unfortunately it tends to be the same water as the first Steven Seagal films because there is not a good set. Steven Seagal plays the same kind of character he played with Above the Law. In my opinion, Keenen Ivory Wayans' performance is wasted on such a mediocre film and belongs to a much better film. Bob Gunton is ok as the main heavyweight. The best acting of the entire film belongs to Brian Cox, who is very terrifying in the role of the murderer. My favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the Russian mafia. One of the reasons for the film to see The Glimmer Man (1996) is for the brief appearance of the beautiful and voluptupus Nikki Cox. It is a pity that there are no more scenes with her in them.
