A true Gothic Horror Trash Classic! <br /> <br /> Um, actually, it's a horrible movie. The best thing: the naked erect nipples of Rosalba Neri. Intensely sucking material. <br /> <br /> Oh sure, Rosalba Neri is a beautiful lady. I have never heard of her before this film, but she is a damn beautiful woman. But honestly, it was his nipples that did it for me, right in that last scene, before the movie ends abruptly, all naked and erect ... Totally dreamy nipples, man. Okay, sorry, I got a little dragged here ... <br /> <br /> Basically, I got what I expected from LADY FRANKENSTEIN: It's a horrible and horrible film with a big stupid Frankenstein monster and bad air and a pair of naked tits. And he has a castle inside. So I wasn't really disappointed or anything. He simply dragged too much in certain places (the first resurrection of the creature continued to work for years, with his father Frankenstein only experimenting, talking, trying others). There was a funny and foolish homage to the original Frankenstein: instead of throwing a little girl into a lake, Mongoloid Franky took a naked girl here and threw her into a river. He made me laugh. <br /> <br /> Some of my friends have been a bit too mad about this movie, though. I was expecting a little too much. But Rosalba's erect nipples were worth it ... (shit, I really need to stop talking about her nipples). I think I'll finish this user comment now.
