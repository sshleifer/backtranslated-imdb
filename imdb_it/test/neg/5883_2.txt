I expected this to be hilarious and at best mediocre, the only funny character is, believe it or not Andy Dick. The timing was just awful in almost every line and joke and the writing was bad, I mean I know it should be like blaxploitation but it worked. furthermore this whole genre has already been beaten to death, with all of Austin's powers and incognito brother movies, it just looks old, it also looks like an undercover brother (who wasn't even hysterical, but more fun than this) . Furthermore, for a comedy / action film the direction was rather bland. I don't know if it will be distributed in theaters, but it is certainly made for TV.
