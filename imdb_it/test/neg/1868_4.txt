Some things simply won't die. They just have to come back for more if we like it or not. I guess some people like to beat a dead horse. The first "Ghoulies" was a surprise success and his sequel was an even better film. The third film took a more comical approach and, at this point, the small buggers began to spend their welcome. I guess someone out there in Hollywood thought it was a brilliant idea to resurrect the franchise, but the result would probably disappoint fans of the previous rumors. <br /> <br /> Pros: Acting is actually pretty good for a movie like this. A silly but fun score. It moves at an appropriate pace. A little cheese for those who love it. Some pretty nice action sequences. It has a little more plot than the others and, unlike II and III, at least tries to connect with the original. <br /> <br /> Cons: It's not as fun as its predecessors. Although it has more plot than before, it's rather ridiculous. Poor effect. The original Ghoulies appear only in flashbacks and here they are replaced with two trolls that have no other purpose than to be comic reliefs. Speaking of comedy, all attempts at humor are lame. It's a direct sequel to the first film, but there are so many things to do. For example, did I think Jonathan ended up with black magic after what happened in the original? Not that it was spectacular in others, but the direction of this film is particularly bland. <br /> <br /> Final considerations: the first three "Ghoulies" films are a dream for lovers of bad films. This fourth, and so far the final (hopefully) follow-up, is a bit disappointing. Sure, there's some fun, but it's not the same. Others also have a low budget, but the people involved put a lot more into it. See if you are a suit or want to see beautiful women in skimpy outfits. Otherwise he remains alone with the other three. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
