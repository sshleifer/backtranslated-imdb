The Untold ... is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story seems really original, but it was badly conferred on the screen. Lance Henriksen, a good actor, ended up in this shit. But, he did a lot of low budget movies ... you have to pay the bills, you know? Making fun of. Lance is a great actor, but he ended up with this group of silly actors. Seriously, Andrea Roth was just there to have a nude scene, and other actors ... well they were there. There was constantly a fade out, and that makes me sick! This was the most horrible move that continues to come and really makes you angry. He was also very predictable, boring and slow. It has a bizarre time that just goes ... wrong. <br /> <br /> I can't say anything else ... don't rent or buy it. You can watch it, if on TV.
