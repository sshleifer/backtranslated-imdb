I'll talk about this film from two different perspectives here. The first is from the point of view if someone sees the film and never reads (and could never read) the book. The second is from someone who has. <br /> <br /> (Film without book) From the point of view of the film, it was an ok film. It's not even remotely as good as one of the Underworld but much better than UltraViolet. And I'm not even talking about plot. The visual effects were uncertain in many parts, although the transformation of the wolf was very beautiful. The characters have a very small development and Vivian doesn't even seem to really care that her "love" is killing what was left of her species. Some of the other characters could have had more time for the air, like the Five. The plot was similar to that of Underworld for my taste. <br /> <br /> (film with book) As many have claimed, in addition to the title, the names of the characters and some minor parts, the film and the book are nothing in the same way. In the film, Gabriel was much older and was Rafe's father (so Astrid was once his companion). In the book, Gab was about 24, he has never been paired with anyone since wolves mate for life (Astrid is trying to win his affection) and Astrid is Ulf's mother, not Rafe's. Another important thing is the location. The book took place in Riverview, Maryland. Also, the reason they moved from West Virginia is very different. The film is Vivian's fault and her entire family was killed because of it. In the book, the original leader of the Five, named Axel, killed a girl from their school. The hunters tracked down the wolves and killed many of them (including Viv's father), forcing them to move. Furthermore, Viv's mother, Esme was an important character. <br /> <br /> One thing about the book that would have made the film better would have been the "bitch dance". For those who do not know it, it is the ordeal in which all the females (the females of the pack) fight to see who is the only one to be the companion of the new leader (since before there was a struggle for males). Vivian won it, trying to save her mother from Astrid (who is a horrible and evil woman in the book) and therefore should have mated with Gab. There was no prophecy! However, if you read the book and liked the book, I highly recommend NOT to see this movie.
