Technically speaking, this movie sucks ... lol. However, it is also fun. Whether it's intentionally funny, I don't know. Horrible in every aspect, it's also the only film I know that has 1) a fat little boy played by a skinny actor in a (very obvious) fat suit, 2) an attractive 30-year-old actress who plays a character who should be in his later 60s, and 3) the most compliments for the plastic yard daisies ever. Don't take this movie seriously, just watch it for laughter ... a great holiday movie.
