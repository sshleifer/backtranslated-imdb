Power seemed promising, but soon it became boring and boring to watch. The plot is about an ancient Aztec doll that takes possession of its owner. The idea is "pretty decent" and this movie would have been pretty funny if it had been done better. However, after the first ten minutes, it soon becomes boring; we don't get good death scenes and we have to listen to a lot of talk. Eventually one of the possessed men meets his death by melting in front of two girls, but it is not very interesting and certainly not bloody. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend The Power to any horror or fan slasher because there is little to be gained from it.
