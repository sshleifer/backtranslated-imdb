I just came back from seeing "Comedian". It was all right. He made me look at the screen. It's not really the kind of thing I like to go and pay $ 7 to see. <br /> <br /> Now don't get me wrong, it would be a great HBO feature. If this was something I was watching on TV, I'd like to be directly involved. It gives a surprising look at what the comics go through before and after going on stage. It will interest anyone who loves watching comics. <br /> <br /> But when I go to the cinema, I like to be entertained. I'm not there to be polite. Now I know what happened to Jerry Seinfeld before he takes the stage ... fantastic. But honestly, I'd rather just laugh at his jokes than worry about it. <br /> <br /> Another thing: with the bad attitude that Onry Adams has; I expect to see him take my order from Burger King before seeing his special HBO. It was not funny. He's the kind of person you love to hate.
