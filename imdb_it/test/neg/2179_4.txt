Maybe this was * An important movie * and that's why people classify it so well, but honestly it's not very good. In hindsight it is easy to see that Chaplin (probably all of Hollywood) was incredibly naive about the magnitude of what was happening in the ghettos, so one cannot criticize too much for the disconnection that affects a modern viewer, but the disconnection remains. <br /> <br /> More disappointing, the film is just awkward; it's as if Chaplin had no idea that the films had progressed in a sophisticated way since the silent era. The scenic elements, those that involve both the Jewish Barber and the dictator, do not flow into one another; they are simply sitting there like discrete fragments of plot that progress in jerks, move in ANY PART but never reach resolution. Some are fun, others less so. <br /> <br /> What a fascination the film has in the person of Chaplin himself. His parodies of Hitler's speeches were the best part of everything, and it cannot be denied that he had a physical grace that was pleasant to look at. But practically everything he surrounded himself was GREETINGS. Hannah was TOO MUCH American DAMN. The Storm Troopers were TOO DAMN Americans. <br /> <br /> Oooh! Oooh! Another thing! I don't know for what purpose it was useful to have the garbage as a source of evil behind the throne. It almost seems that the film is saying that, if it hadn't been for evil influences like Garbage, Hynckle wouldn't have been a bad guy.
