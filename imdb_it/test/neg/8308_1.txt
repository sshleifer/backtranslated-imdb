I saw DEATH MACHINES as part of BCI Eclipse's Drive-in Cult Classics (with versions of Crown International Pictures) on DVD. While working my way through the multiple DVD sets, I'm growing to love many of Crown International's films - especially the terrifying, erotic and psychological thrillers! <br /> <br /> DEATH MACHINES is not one of these. <br /> <br /> After watching films like MALIBU BEACH, THE CREEPING TERROR and THE PINK ANGELS, it's hard to say that this is the worst movie ever made; but it doesn't have much to do. <br /> <br /> No plot; really no story to talk about. <br /> <br /> Is acting not obvious ?? only the actor responsible for the terribly played Tony (with the fake and fictitious Italian accent) made an attempt to "enter the character". <br /> <br /> The score is annoying and pedantic. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this film is why ... what prompted the filmmakers to make this film? <br /> <br /> They thought the story of: 1) three ninjas, 2) two competing crime bosses, 3) a secondary character of barman / karate school student; and 4) Was his compassionate nurse of love interests so irresistible that the world would not be complete without this film being made? <br /> <br /> This is a total waste of time and money, for you, me, the producers, the writers, the actors and the director.
