I saw this movie about thirty years ago and I was impressed on my mind so far. When I found it on DVD, I didn't hesitate too long, even more, because I have a fondness for Belmondo's first films. What a nasty surprise! Some films should be allowed to resign from the public exhibition, to keep a certain memory and not to upset the public. <br /> <br /> Widely hailed as one of Chabrol's rare cynical works, the only lasting impression I received from looking at him is ... boredom. Some movies don't age with style. But what about films that have no sense of style? <br /> <br /> The defects of the script, the uninspired acting - presumably due to lack of direction -, a sort of scenography, which does not deserve its name, less than a mediocre photography and, last but not least important, the worst editing job I've seen in a long time, makes this really hard to bear. <br /> <br /> My impression was that there was a group of people with too much money and equipment, but obviously no idea or skill. It is indeed a surprise that this has not abruptly interrupted Chabrol's career. Don't blame the general bad taste of the '70s, this is a shit in its own right and a worthy contender for the most useless waste of celluloid ever.
