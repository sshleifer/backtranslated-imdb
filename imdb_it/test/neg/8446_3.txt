"Two naturalist photographers are traveling through the Amazon basin for their last assignment: while they try to capture the wildlife in the area in a movie, our photographers cross paths with a game hunter, who is persecuting animals for a another reason: witnesses of his illegal activities, the hunter decides to ?? "according to the synopsis of the cover of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Beautiful guide Peter Brown (as Jim Pendrake) brings the beautiful blonde Ahna Capri (as Terry Greene) and his handsome brother Tom Simcox (as Art Greene) in the Venezuelan jungle to admire the view, and take pictures of wild animals After connecting to the big world hunter William Smith (like Caribe), the psychological drama emerges. <br /> <br /> A crucial scene, with Mr. Brown resting in the "Vee" of a tree and sharing a cigarette with Mr. Simcox, is well staged. The circular direction reappears in the next "fight" between Brown and Mr. Smith; and, it is effective. Simcox's first sex adds nothing to the story; could have been cut, to take advantage of what seems to be flirting between the characters Brown and Simcox. Even an attraction between Brown and Mrs. Capri could have been played. <br /> <br /> The music, including "Love All Things That Love The Sun" by Jim Stein, is fine; but the film must be traced, to cut the animals that do not appear on the screen. And there are too many unnecessary shots on display. "Piranha" is a case in which less would have been more.
