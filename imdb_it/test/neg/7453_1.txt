You know, I was very surprised watching this movie. It aired during the day when I was sick and having nothing else to do, I kept watching. This is by far the worst movie ever! But to my surprise I kept watching. I sat there saying, this is terrible, but I didn't change the channel because I was so amused by how bad it was. Maybe he was the guy who looked like Big Tom survivors or the terrible mustaches and mohawks these characters had, which kept me from looking. However, the girls were not badly hurt, but if that's what you want, there's a lot better. Oh, and there are "NINJAS" and "PAJAMA BOYS!" <br /> <br /> So if you like ninja dialogues, bad acting, hilarious (and terrible) and two twins five meters high and killing everything in their sight, then this movie is for you. It's so bad that it's fine. However, I had to give him a 1 out of ten. I couldn't have put a 10 with Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> ENJOY !!!!!!!!! :)
