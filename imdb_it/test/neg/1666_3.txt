This is probably my favorite episode. I've lived in Cape Girardeau for quite some time. I can tell you that there are no ocean boats or shrimp, fresh crab or scallops anywhere near Missouri. Cape Girardeau is the only inland head, it is on the Mississippi River. The plates looked like they were from the Mississippi, which could explain why there was so much racial tension. Missouri and Mississippi are two completely different states that do not touch each other. There are many roads in and out of town and none of them is Route 6 or Route 666. All this imprecision has distracted me a lot. Besides, Cassie didn't look like someone who wanted to wander around Dean if she was well educated. I didn't buy them as a couple and I didn't enjoy the long love scene. Jo was Dean's style more.
