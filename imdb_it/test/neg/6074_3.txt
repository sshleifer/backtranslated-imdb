This film is proof that a good actor is nothing without good direction. Ed Harris is horrible. How could you create an actor built like Rambo to play the "Maestro"? It shows no credibility and rips Beethoven's voice. Above all, long hair does not look good on its head. The main actress lacks all the subtleties necessary for her character. Camera shots are poor and too conventional. The lights must close the feelings of the characters. Poor casting and economic management. Sin! The only scene that the film is worth is when Beeth (I hope you don't mind calling him by his nickname?) He's turning the girl's song into a line. Anyway, I hope Harris can find the way back to the real movie where he can really show his hairless talent.
