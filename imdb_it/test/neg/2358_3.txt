If I had no expectations of this film, I could have received a 5 or 6. As it is, I give it a 3. The acting is poor, the accuracy of the facts of the drugs being talked about is lacking, and I didn't no empathy for the characters. <br /> <br /> I watched "Adam & Paul" immediately before watching this movie, and I laughed and cried on several occasions. This film didn't even hit a similar deal. The directors of 'Human Traffic' may have some experience of ecstasies out of the way, but here there is no demonstration of the real semantic knowledge of the drug. In fact, I find the conflict rather less offensive and counterproductive to make current drug laws less politically oriented. <br /> <br /> Watch "Requiem for a Dream" if what you are looking for is a touching and touching film on drugs
