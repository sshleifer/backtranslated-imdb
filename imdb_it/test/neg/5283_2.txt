Ugh, ugly, bad, bad, but I've seen worse and that's why I gave him a 2 instead of a 1. I just finished watching this movie and thought it was almost as rotten as the flesh on Dr. Chopper's face . The worst part of the film had to be "I like to introduce you to someone ... meet my interior" which consisted of the lonely survivor of the fantastic group 5 who threw a garbage can to Dr. Chopper and then the stage fell. Second worst line, "I'm the park ranger that will make you go up" What, this strange maniac isn't even a cop ????? Someone else has noticed how everyone dies instantly from the stab of gut magic (no one dies so fast from a stomach stab, I know this cause I often see them in the operating room) except the park super ranger. Friend had a bucket of poor blood from that wound, writhing on the floor, and then enters the end to take a crack at Dr. Chopper while the inside is curled up on the floor. And if they don't all fight, they don't even have the decency to die, like everyone else. Inner b * tch helps him to limp outside and proceeds to tell him not to die while he runs for help because it's as if his only friend had remained alive now. Since when did these two become friends? I don't think a frantic encounter in the woods where he tells you to head for the city qualifies as knowing your time, but whatever. <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie if there's nothing else and you have nothing else to do with your time.
