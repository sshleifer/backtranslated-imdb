How could they take such a wonderfully animated gem as that of Don Bluth All Dogs in Paradise and bastardize it with a charmless, picky and uninspired following? The haunting music and the delicious characters have disappeared, now replaced with a sticky animation and a fantasy-free plot. <br /> <br /> The professionals: Charlie Sheen is sometimes as funny as Charlie, but he lacks the charming tough attitude that led him to the life of Burt Reynolds. I particularly liked the songs "I'll always be with you" and "It's too heavenly here". <br /> <br /> I Cons: It seems that there is no connection between this and the original. At first Charlie is a friend with Carface, but wait a minute. Isn't this the same character who was responsible for Charlie's murder and kidnapped the sweet orphan he loved? I imagine that all the changes in Paradise, but why Anne-Marie is not even mentioned? If Itchy comes to Heaven, won't Flo and Killer do it too? What is the voice of the whippet with Annabelle? In the original it sounded feminine and charming and in the following looks like a whining parrot. The new characters are not that great (except Sasha). And the animation is better than a generic Saturday morning cartoon. The constant "comic" humor is flat and not funny and the "heart" does not work compared to the original, which has such a touching touch that it makes me cry every time. <br /> <br /> All Dogs going to heaven is one of my favorite movies of all time. How Don Bluth allowed this sequel to be realized is beyond me. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Not all sequels go to Heaven.
