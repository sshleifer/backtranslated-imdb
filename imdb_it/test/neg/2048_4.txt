I just saw this movie just because of Sarah and I'm also giving these 4 stars just for her, on the other side. This film was undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Theacting was horrible. The script was not inspired. This was a film that continued to contradict itself. The film was sloppy and not very original. it's not like I expected a good movie. Just something to give me a jump or two. This didn't even do this. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is this, the more I think about the general plot, the less reality is actually reality and the more holes we keep finding. Really a pity, since I'm pretty sure there was a good idea lurking somewhere ... <br /> <br /> I'm maybe a little harsh giving the film at 4/10 but given the actors involved and still SARA obvious talent in writing, this film really should have delivered much more. <br /> <br /> This movie is just crap, I can't say it differently. From the beginning we know that it will be crap. <br /> <br /> The plot, the dialogue, the acting, the special effects, the make-up, practically EVERYTHING sucks. I like vampire movies and I know they will never be Oscar winners, but it's not even worth seeing, I can't believe how anyone produced this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not even about vampires, it's more about a dream / reality. The development of the film is inconsistent, the motivation of the characters is ... It doesn't exist, everything seems like a big joke. Maybe that's what they tried to do, but I sincerely doubt it. I want to know what they tried to shoot but it just failed, it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen many bad movies, but nothing compared to this) Please, do yourself a favor and DON'T watch it. <br /> <br /> PS It's also full of clich√©s! Post scriptum 2 Bad Script, bad direction, bad cinematography. Post scriptum 3 I was concerned to comment on this as a favor for everyone.
