A few years ago, this film was scheduled for broadcast on TCM UK as part of a retrospective of Tod Browning ?? but what they actually showed was the 1937 remake! my brother had looked at him (and, in hindsight, he followed the original scene-for-scene practically up to the scenography) ?? although no classic, he said it was a much more satisfying viewing experience than the incredibly creaky previous version ?? <br /> <br /> Being the first collaboration between Browning and Bela Lugosi, I had high hopes for this ?? but these were canceled when it became evident after the first roll of boring conversation that the main concern of the film was to appease the still new sound technique, and consequently the result is swampy and extremely static. The thriller plot is not exactly exciting; even less appetizing is the apparent British-Indian setting (with accents influenced by the characters and superior class demeanor not to mention the excessive use of idiotic idiots more idiotic as "I say", "rather" and "now look here" making the 'laughable whole more than anything else! <br /> <br /> Besides this, there are some involuntary screaming: Margaret Wycherly (like a false medium) begs police inspector Lugosi (if anything, her undeniable presence it is already evident on the screen) to give her some time "solve" who is really the culprit of the double murder (the proofs indicate her daughter, played by Leila Hyams!) feels a pin and deludes herself into thinking that the world of spirits has really made contact with her ?? but then Lugosi enters the room and, with her unmistakable accent, clearly tells her "I knocked twice ?? you didn't hear me!", in which my brother and I almost fell on the floor in convulsions of laughter !!; even the assembly is really sloppy: during a high-angle shot of the main set, you see a microphone that is quickly extracted from the range of action of the camera ?? and even worse are a couple of cases in which a person walks off the screen, apparently in the next shot, in another part of the set, but each shot is kept on the other actors for an absurdly long time, so that seems to take forever this person to walk a few steps !! <br /> <br /> THE THIRTEENTH CHAIR marks the third non-horror Browning Talkie I've seen ?? although both this and MIRACLES FOR SALE (1939) deal with murder and occultism and could therefore still be linked to gender. Much has been said about the apparent slowing down of the director with the arrival of Sound: however, defective as they may be, the 4 straight horror films he made in the 1930s are infinitely better than the others ?? which I always found elegant and bizarre enough to suggest that Browning was not so much at sea during this time as was suggested ??
