A robbery film with Jean Reno, Matt Damon and Laurence Fishburne ... sounds great on paper? I suspect he must have done it when someone green lit up the production of this film, but the final product is terrible! <br /> <br /> The plot is boring, the action boring and, for a film that is only 88 minutes, it just seems to drag on. I could feel my life slipping away and I was sure there was something better that I should do ... any paint to keep dry somewhere, maybe? <br /> <br /> Sigh. I'm a big fan of Jean Reno, but what the hell was he thinking when he joined this? There are so many other great action movies around ... go see one of these and let this movie be better forgotten.
