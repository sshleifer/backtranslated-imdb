Bad movie! Bad! Go and stay in a discount magazine. Carrot Top should really stick to dimly lit cabaret clubs. These are films like this that make old Jerry Lewis movies like Shakespeare and John Agar look like John Barrymore. Coutney Thorne-Smith (a refined talent) is absolutely wasted. His purpose seems to seem mostly beautiful and unaware. <br /> <br /> The only fun things in the film are seeing Raquel Welch as Alexis Carrington, and Estelle Harris as harridan of a landlady. The only way I can imagine that someone thinks it would be a good idea to make this film (apart from the second film), is if the fourth-year producer could choose the script. Well, maybe his third grader. What this film really needs is to be massaged into the nose of its creators.
