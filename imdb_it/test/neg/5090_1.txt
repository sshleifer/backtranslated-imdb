This is by far the most boring movie I've ever seen! And if you don't believe me, go ahead and look at it yourself. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly, the plot makes absolutely no sense. The people who fight don't make any sense. I couldn't understand what they were talking about during the movie (in most cases I didn't even bother) It doesn't do anything to stop you from watching the movie, the only plus point would be photography. New Zealand is fantastic. Everything else simply sucks. <br /> <br /> Actors do their best to keep us awake, but unfortunately you will go to sleep instead. <br /> <br /> Do us all a favor, even if it goes up on "On Demand", don't watch it!
