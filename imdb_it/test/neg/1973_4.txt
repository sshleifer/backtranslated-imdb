A fairly transparent attempt to snatch money from the burgeoning British club scene, Sorted is a film that shows promise in certain departments, but does little else. A superfluous thriller plot (which is only there to put together the club sequences), a variable acting and a rather ridiculous script, all stopped Separated from being the showcase that the director Jovy obviously meant. <br /> <br /> However, even though Jovy is sometimes more forgiving (especially when he uses often inadequate dance music) that shows potential, and the lack of an anti-drug message is enormously refreshing. Overall, however, the film is a wasted opportunity and the prospects of a great club movie remain somewhere out there. However reachable.
