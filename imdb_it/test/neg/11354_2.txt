I was looking forward to this being based on the reviews on this and on the fairly good evaluation. This was a great disappointment. This does not hold up against the contemporary zombie films such as Shaun of the dead, the day of the dead, the land of the dead, etc. Horror movies sometimes take some time to move forward, you have to build the characters so when they smell them, you feel a little empathy, etc., but even so, there are 45 minutes to sit here before you even smell a corpse, up to that point, is like watching a bad soap opera, nothing of interest or relevance happens and if you are going to see this for the first time, you can honestly start looking after 45 minutes, you won't miss anything plot. When things start, it's all very subfamily. Some of the killings and make-up are well done, others are very bad, there is no coherence here and there are some really shocking continuity errors and some of the most recitative wooden ones I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> All this could be passable if one really believed that all this took place on a plane but with shotguns, incendiary bombs, no pilot in the cockpit in a violent storm but the plane remains in the air , come on, us Not all simpletons. <br /> <br /> Oh, and it really takes a full minute for a fighter jet missile to hit an airplane that is a few hundred meters away. I know it's a zombie movie and you have to lengthen things but this film, along with the other main flaws listed above, had zero credibility. One to lose.
