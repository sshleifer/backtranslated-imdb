I couldn't ruin this piece of shit if I wanted to. After seeing Dark Harvest 1, I thought "this was going to be the worst movie ever made", so I watched Dark Harvest 2 and it made me look a little better. Then I also saw Dark Harvest 3 or tried. The only thing I have to say is "when will this end?" Bad acting and really bad special effects, the only good thing about this film was the breast blow. Don't waste your time on cash with this piece of shit ... And now I have to write another 3 lines to get it presented. I was going to sing a song but I can't think of anyone right now. But in the end the film ended (although it had an ending that could mean they will do another one)
