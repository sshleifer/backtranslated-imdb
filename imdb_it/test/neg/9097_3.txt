This film has some pretty cool parts like a cum that comes off and other great bites. Castle Freak is a good monster. I would be scared to pieces if it came after me. However, the film has some silly parts about it. <br /> <br /> A husband goes drunk driving and kills his 3-year-old son and blinds his teenage daughter. I suppose death is more damage than blindness, but you would never know that parents feel really bad because their daughter is blind. They only care that "J.J. is dead!" While their teenage daughter goes around bumping into things and talks about how she will never be able to drive a car. Parents are like - "honey, stop walking without a guide, you know better than that", and then they cry and never stop being depressed because JJ is dead. It seems to me a favoritism. <br /> <br /> The lines of dialogue are not very realistic or well done. For example, when you hear a huge accident in the castle, everyone goes down to the basement to see what it is. It was a huge mirror that crashed to the ground and shattered. The husband runs to the broken mirror with horror and clearly says "The mirror broke". I don't know, I would say a little more if a giant mirror mysteriously crashed to the ground in my castle. <br /> <br /> The husband and wife have some important relationship issues and it's fun to see how stupid they are with each other. No one ever believes the blind girl. Tip: if a blind girl says she feels things, believe her and don't tell her to shut up. I think this is the moral of the story. Listen to people when they tell you things, otherwise you could end up killing yourself to prove your point. Finally, I thought the best character was the main police officer. He was the best actor and character. All the others (besides Castle Freak) were quite far from the mill. 3/10
