I haven't been able to last ten minutes on this terrible film. In the age of DV camcorders, it appears to have been shot on VHS without the aid of any color correction or microphone. <br /> <br /> As a director, I know the constraints of Indy's film production and, even keeping those things in mind, I'm amazed that the films can be made so badly. <br /> <br /> The only praise I can offer is that this film has been released because I have seen much better films still looking for modest internal or international releases. I imagine the box is the one that sold it ... it has good graphics, but everything goes down from there. <br /> <br /> Side note: It seems that the director has 11 friends since nobody on this planet would give this film a "10".
