Of course, this movie set in Eastern Europe is full of sexy, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the Nicholas Cage film "8mm" An ambassador's daughter and his girlfriend mingle with a local woman in a trio that ends up being registered. The tape is used for blackmail and the stakes get higher and higher as the couple tries to solve it by itself instead of going to the authorities. <br /> <br /> Sex comes and goes - and that would be the only reason for renting it, I guess you like this kind of thing - and it's pretty free in the middle when we surf the porn scene looking for "another woman". Surely I wonder how he got into Blockbuster even with a Youth Restricted sticker considering just how much a hint beyond the edge of the soft core is. (Oh, it's true, it's the double standard. Actual action films like "The Dreamers" and "Y Tu Mama Tambien" get castrated R versions, but Straight To DVD sucks like this to get the UNRATED banner proudly attached. br /> <br /> The acting is horrible, the plot is incredibly unoriginal, but in reality the worst offense is the idea that this is an 8mm sequel, I would give the movie a D for a vote and be nice , but considering that they tried to deceive me, he gets the F that he frankly deserves.
