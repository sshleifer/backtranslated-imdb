If you are a weirdo who thinks it is "romantic" and wonderful to have sex with a woman who is your mother's genetic equivalent, get her pregnant, and then have sex with her again once she has aborted And don't tell her that she's tied to you, so you would like this movie. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter that the boy is married and has a child at home - it makes it even more disgusting and regrettable that he is not aware of what he is doing. He cannot do well with his work, his family, O Maria. He is a loser. There is nothing romantic or positive about this film - it is vile and incestuous. <br /> <br /> It moves slowly and leads nowhere for over the first half of the film. I couldn't even finish looking at this pathetic excuse for a "romance". I'm glad we didn't waste our money on cinema. 0/10
