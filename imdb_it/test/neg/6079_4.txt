The great fictional piece played as if it were real. Tonight I was watching the Alcatraz Birdman. Robert Stoud was not a mild prisoner model and was in prison because he did prostitution and a client did not pay. Once in prison, he was so uncontrollable that he spent most of his time in solitary confinement or in the prison hospital. He also killed some people in prison. This film reminds me of the Birdman of Alcatraz, but even worse. Robert Stroud wrote books and somehow contributed to the company. And the BOA had some hints of the Stroud madness. But this guy, Henry Young, who Murder in the First should be, was a notorious bank robber who took hostages and beat them in more than a robbery. He was not a poor boy who stumbled into a grocery store that had just been a post office and took some money. This man was a tough criminal. He also killed a person 3 years before going to Alcatraz. He killed another person in prison not because of the solitary confinement that ended over a year before the murder. The true story of his life would have been more interesting. They didn't even understand the guardian thing. You can't be a guardian in 3 different prisons at the same time. And by all accounts, the director of the film was a good guy standing like the guardians. Also, if my math is right, the Warden played by Karl Malden in the BOA should be the same guardian in this film. Oh boy. Not only that, in this film we must think that poor Henry committed suicide. And he wrote the word Victory. It's not true ... he could be alive now. He was sent to Springfield where Robert Stroud was also a prison of Walla Walla medical center for another murder committed and then he was released and jumped on probation in 1972, never found. Maybe he's hanging around with that kind of Cooper Cooper who jumped off that plane in Washington state after committing a bank robbery. Now the acting was very good. Kevin Bacon is in that class of actors that include Jeff Bridges and Dennis Quaid, the very underestimated club of actors. Gary Oldman well, they could only invent the part of the guardian to be able to interpret it because it was fantastic. Christian Slater still sounds like Jack Nicholson, I'm not sure it's a good thing or not. Bacon's wife, Kyra Sedgwick, was in the film, I think only because she is his wife. I like it though, but not in this movie. For some reason, I felt that this film, when it first came out, had to be a special project for Kevin Bacon. I feel that it could take a person who is really a victim of the penal system, for sure there are enough and sheds light on their situation. Other then choose a psychopath to show as a victim.
