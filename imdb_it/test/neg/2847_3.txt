Worse than the mediocre thriller about an abused wife who goes on the run after being tied up on the occasion of the death of her husband and sister. Determined to prove that her husband is alive, she follows the trouble through the state, her danger increases with each stop. The traditional partners of "good cop" and "bad cop" chase it. One is convinced of his innocence, the other more interested in closing the case and returning home. This couple is often able to fool the suspect, but never enough to capture it. All the major players meet in a remote desert city and the truth begins to reveal itself with deadly consequences for some. <br /> <br /> Wow! This was a bad movie. The protagonist acted as if he were reassured, the policemen could not find a suspect if he or she is in the police station (this happens twice) and all the others are as one-dimensional as can be. Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br />
