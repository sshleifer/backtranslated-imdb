With No Dead Heroes you get stupid lines like this, since this sadly abysmal action movie has to be seen to be believed. William Sanders is saved by his friend Harry Cotter during a draw in Vietnam, but is captured by the enemy. Fast forward ten years and Harry is now a Russian operative brainwashed with a microchip of mind control implanted in his brain. His new Russian superior is Ivan played by the obscene grip of Nick Nicholson, which I could add not only to attempt once to speak with a Russian accent, but more like a Kentucky gas station with his stained teeth. What is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the dialogue coach for this film. William will soon be recruited again by the CIA to hunt down Harry. He allies himself with Barbara, a freedom fighter who infiltrated Ivan's El Salvador camp and soon they are blowing up half of South America. Some scenes are so horribly horrible that they are surprised that this film has no cult following. One of these scenes is the sudden making love in the jungle of William and Barbara accompanied by the most inappropriate background music that I have ever heard. Who strips completely naked in the middle of a South American jungle? There is a rape scene that also uses the final theme of Blood on Satan's claw. No Dead Heroes is the champion of magic bullets of all time as a single shot leads to multiple killings. In one scene Harry tears the rifle from behind a rock and kills seven men. I had to rewind it and count. Hard to find movie that recently got MGM Full HD treatment. Keep track of this movie and watch it for the sheer nonsense that follows.
