In the same way that Lamberto Bava was a poor facsimilie of his father, Mario (who was nevertheless an extremely overestimated director), Michele Soavi is a poor director in the Dario Argento stamp. "The Church" has at least one thing to recommend - the incredibly detailed art direction - but absolutely nothing else. The film is verbose, full of one-dimensional characters, and almost makes me fall asleep several times. There is a thin line between 'art' and 'pretentious disgust', and while "The Church" is not entirely useless, you would be better off looking at something else. <br /> <br /> 3/10
