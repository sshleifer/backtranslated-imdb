This show sucks. it was put on a roller coaster Friday, and while it has undoubtedly destroyed the recurring theme of Friday programming, I will judge it rationally ... I still think it sucks. It's really super weak. Zoey and her stupid friends are weak characters and the dish sucks and is really lame. <br /> <br /> The limping continuity and the pot suck and I think the dialogues and joes are weak. Weak humor and lousy sucking characters suck, and the whole show is frankly a disappointment that isn't worth watching. It sucks and it's really, really lame. It must really be one of the smallest shows on TV, really not worth watching. I mean how much can a lame weak and lousy get a show before it is cut?
