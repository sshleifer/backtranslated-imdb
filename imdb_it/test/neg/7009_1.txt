I'm just launching this review to prove I'm not crazy - I like a lot of Wynorski's work - Deathstalker 2, Chopping Mall, Against the Law are frantic and very funny - just to prove it I'm not blind, I have to mention this, along with some Shannon Tweed "Body Chemistry 3 or 4 or something," are the bad ones - I have nothing against sexual sequences pulled out, but Julie Strain's breasts are so unnatural looking you can't help staring at them - which could be the desired effect but I did not like to fix them - and many members of this cast seem depressed or disinterested - The "erotic thriller" was the worst thing about having low budget films, and thank God that their day is over more or less .
