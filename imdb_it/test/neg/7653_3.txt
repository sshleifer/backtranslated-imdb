I saw this movie with a group of friends during a Halloween party last night. I must say that the sarcastic comments never ended and I must say that they were well deserved. Although I felt that the direction was well done, the madness in their dialogue is just a little too much cheese. I think I have about an hour in this story, before I even realized what the point was, they were trying to get home. You realize that this whole family is quite extravagant and something is wrong with them, it's just a little too slow. This film could easily have been around 45 minutes and was much better. The only thing that made it bearable were the two bottles of wine that I threw down during the film. Give people slasher movies, because at least I know what to expect from them. This was not my thing, too much obscure humor, and the material subject to cannibalism was a bit explicit and gross. I have to say that Randy Quaid played the part as it could have been, and I'll give him props for that, as I usually see it as a drunken goofball or a washed-up fighter pilot who loves to kill aliens. > <br /> In conclusion, I give this horror / comedy film a generous 3 out of 10.
