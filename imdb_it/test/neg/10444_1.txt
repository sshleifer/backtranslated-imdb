this is one of the worst movies ever. There is a scene where they should be underwater and they are literally walking on the earth and have added bubbles! The shark is boring and it's just a silly computer generated slow thing. Antonio Sabato is horrible, I mean even worse than normal. How does this guy work? The director is the worst and there is nothing redeemable in all the films. I love shark movies and this disappoints me. I've seen these films in the studio before and everything they do has some stars doing a bad job. I'd rather see an unknown actor who cares about creating a good story.
