I never fell asleep during a movie. Never. This film has done the impossible. <br /> <br /> While many people claim the superiority of Japanese horror films over their American counterparts, this film was a lesson in abundance. As in, the film was 30 minutes too long. It would have been useful if the film had a little more movement in the plot and the camera worked, but instead, all we got were clumsy silences and a lot of slow movement. The acting was absolutely terrible, bordering on the bad student film levels, while everyone tried to advertise something called a "script". Did these people even get some direction? Were they convinced they were boring and boring? Or therory doesn't surprise me. <br /> <br /> What was even worse was the rather unfortunate trick involved with the creatures on the other side. In any case, they are all smelly. Don't watch this movie. This is all I can say (unless you are an insomniac).
