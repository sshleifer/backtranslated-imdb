Terence Stamp can do anything, but this is still a superficial one-dimensional film. It's nice to look at - like the actors - and if you like drag queens, I think you'll like them a lot, but the plot and characters are as thin as cardboard. It is one of those politically correct films that distort everything else to make a "minority lifestyle" look warm and tender. It's a lot of miles from the asshole dialogue, which is fun in this sanitized form, I guess. <br /> <br /> Ninety percent of the action parades in gaudy costumes in incongruous situations. The dramatic content is an appendix to the token - they hardly try to get you taken seriously.
