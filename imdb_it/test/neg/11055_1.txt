THE SCREAMING is a very low budget horror film filmed on video. It is characterized by passable acting, poor lighting, a weak story and some of the worst monster effects I've ever seen. The plot has a university student who is under pressure to join a cult by his attractive owner. The cult is a parody of Scientology with a book similar to Dianetics. This would have been a funny joke for that group if it hadn't been for a stupid script and for cheap production. The effects of monsters look horrible and the quality of the images makes it seem like you're watching a home video or a public service announcement. I think anyone who sees it will agree that movies should be shot on film.
