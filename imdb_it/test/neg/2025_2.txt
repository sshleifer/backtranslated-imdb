Screenwriter Steve Tesich's second-year effort (which follows the terribly distorted BREAKING AWAY) is a compendium of clich√©s, coincidences and dour melodrama. Maybe he lived a little of this; if so, I'm sorry to say that he was inexplicably unable to dramatize it convincingly. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, he is not helped much here by Arthur Penn, a talented director who has done a remarkable job in the past (BONNIE AND CLYDE, LITTLE BIG MAN), but fails to inject energy or verisimilitude in Tesich's narrative. <br /> <br /> The cast struggles in the best possible way, but is plagued by weak motivation and dialogue. The sympathies should be reserved in particular to Craig Wasson, whose silent performance foreshadows the imminent rapid fading of his leading career, as well as Jodi Thelen, embarrassingly unattached, miscastosa as the film's extremely unlikely "femme fatale". <br /> <br /> It all seems longer than it is, and every point made is heavy and obvious. See the previous Arthur Penn article on the 1960s theme, the funny and elegiac ALICE'S RESTAURANT; is all that is not.
