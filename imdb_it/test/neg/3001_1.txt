'Northfork' is what is wrong with independent films. For all their sharp comments and for the large studios they attack they will not, this is the sacrifice we make. For almost two hours I was subjected to the torture and pain of a movie that starts wandering like a blind man in a new place and ends without covering new land and fortunately dies. <br /> <br /> There are parallel stories that detail a dying city and a dying boy. Two men dressed in black (one of them James Woods) must force the remaining inhabitants of Northfork to leave before a dam opens and floods the city. The other story has a boy returned to the priest (Nick Nolte) who gave it to his parents. He is dying and is visited, I believe, by angels. These include Anthony Edwards with bizarre shows and Daryl Hannah in a bizarre costume that reminds me of Seinfeld's pirate shirt. <br /> <br /> Although this is the "plot", this is not what the film is about. The film is about nothing. It does nothing, says nothing, goes nowhere and has nothing interesting to show. Perhaps from design, more likely a secondary effect of the pretentious, surreal, aspiring David Lynch - we are an important artistic film, you can't see - the style of direction. The entire film is filtered through a gray and bleak background that, I suppose, fits into a film about death. Instead, it simply makes the movie much more difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a film about men in black, watch the films of "Men in Black", neither too impressive, but compared to "Northfork" they are revoked in the state 'Citizen Kane'. If you want to watch a film about a dying boy look at "Lorenzo's oil". If you want to see a movie that has the destruction of a city through water, look at 'Brother, where are you?' If you want to see a movie better than "Northfork", there are hundreds. If you want to watch a movie that is worse, there are only a handful. 0 * out ****
