Jonathan Demme is such a character-oriented director that, to see him do a Brian De Palma (which means Hitchcock), it's almost predictable when he can't create much suspense within this lukewarm mystery. Working from a screenplay by David Shaber, from the Murray novel Teigh Bloom, Demme attempts to strike a deal between Alan J. Pakula's paranoia dramas and Hitchcock's participatory thrillers. Roy Scheider plays a retired secret agent in mourning for the murder of his wife, who is now busy dodging the bad guys who want to kill him. He immediately removes himself, but the script is full of fragile threads and any excitement runs out quickly. There is a visually impressive climax at Niagara Falls, but Demme gets very little from its cast, much less from this concoction of a story. ** from ****
