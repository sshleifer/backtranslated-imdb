Like many people, I loved the original; "American Graffiti" was one of the great films of the 70s. The sequel, "More American Graffiti" is a horrible and depressing disaster for a movie. It was not funny, the characters with the wide open eyes became cynical and tired, and the stories were artificial (like the character of "Laurie" who had another brother because Richard Dreyfuss hadn't made the sequel and "Terry the Toad" and "Pharaoh Joe" somehow manages to serve together in Vietnam). They even have a police officer named "Falfa" (the character of Harrison Ford in the original) who makes a "cameo". Nor does it look like Harrison Ford, who was too big a star in 1979 to worry about this garbage. <br /> <br /> The key word here is "fun". This film is not even funny. Debbie (Candy Clark) is a stripper mixed with a group of hippies who talk about drugs and who try to free her boyfriend from prison; Steve and Laurie (Ron Howard and Cindy Williams), the lovebirds in the original, have two children and have become an annoying and quarrelsome couple; Adorable little tomboy Carol (MacKenzie Phillips) became "Rainbow", yet another hippie child. John Milner (Paul LeMat) is a racing car loser whose fortune was predicted at the end of the original. Even Wolfman Jack, whose voice was an integral part of the original, and gave him such a great flow, is heard only sporadically. <br /> <br /> Maybe they were different writers, a different director and the complete lack of a coherent plot that makes this film a sad failure. <br /> <br /> Episodic charm and genuine nostalgia for the original are nowhere to be found in the sequel. It was a film that did not need to be realized and its best only to remember what a great movie "American Graffiti" was and to avoid the film with "More" in the title.
