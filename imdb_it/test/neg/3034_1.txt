I went through less painful operations than I spent watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you try, you think it will be something in the vein of a Guy Ritchie movie ..... Think again! The production, the dialogue, the acting, the script, the film and the plot were the worst I've ever seen in a movie. My favorite part in all honesty was the credits. In the whole history of cinema there has never been a better excuse to turn off the TV and go out and do something better with your life. <br /> <br /> Do the work on the main channel rather than wasting time and money. This!
