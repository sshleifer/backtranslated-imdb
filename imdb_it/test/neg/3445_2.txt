OK watch this show is the worst show on nick @ night. I love so many shows at Nick @ Night and I love them. When this show came to nick @ night I was so annoyed. It's such a boring show and it's trivial. Among all the times I've seen, I've found a slightly strange episode. This show has some of the most stupid and stupid jokes of all time. This show sums up terrible. Giving props to Fresh Prince of Bel-air and George Lopez. This show is boring and not the least intelligent. This show should have been canceled much earlier. I don't think it deserves to be played at the nick @ night along with some great classic shows. This show lacks intelligence, good jokes and style.
