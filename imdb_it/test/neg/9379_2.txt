I'll be honest and say that I gave up looking at it somewhere halfway and then fast forward with some pause. then I came back here and read many of the reviews already made .... <br /> <br /> maybe it's just me, and I can't help it, but this cartoon for North American society seems to have a purpose "saves them by themselves "and iraq immediately comes to mind. it seems to me that this is a justification, or part of, for another invasion with "good intentions". <br /> <br /> the lady for me looks like a person who abandons herself and frankly I was annoyed by her portrait to try to arouse pity and "feel" for her. well in this case this could never happen because, just as a history teacher has already mentioned here, I need to know why his family was so rich above average, he will manage to keep it (both sides were playing maybe?) and send her to Paris !? now, if this had been done after the biography of a poor girl, I could see myself with certain emotions. but as it is + its release time is just a pure propaganda film; even worse, since his cartoon, too tears the "soft" side of things too well for his sake, to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> there are also those clich√©s about gays. well, a woman struggling to win her rights shouldn't at least have some compassion for the losers of society just like her ??? the message is obviously self-indulgent from the point of view of a member of the ruling class. <br /> <br /> I give him only 2 stars because his production and related things. a propaganda film obviously has interests in convincing-manipulating my thoughts and therefore it is generally well done by appealing to certain visual emotions that I cannot deny that I too have.
