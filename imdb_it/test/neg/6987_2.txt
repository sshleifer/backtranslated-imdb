This film must be the worst movie I've ever seen. I only watched about half an hour and I just turned it off. The cars in this film look like two front-ends of the geo-meter smashed together. This film is not even good for laughter. The only time I laughed was when Dante kept saying in a funny voice: "Nobody can beat Dante, Muhwa hwaa". I said holy god and turned it off. Bad, bad movie. 2/10
