I really wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't. It had the potential to be a trendy remake of a fantastic show, but that's where it fell to pieces. It was too trendy, too beautiful. First of all, all the fantastic lines and scenes were shown in the preview trailers, which I had seen many times. And the editing was very disjointed, so that the scenes didn't seem to run together and they all looked out of place. Claire Danes, whom I adore as an actress, failed to make her her turning point for acting outside of high school. The only bright spot was Giovanni Ribisi like Pete. His style was a bit stupid, but in reality clever, it was fun and refreshing. Overall, I would recommend looking at the previews instead of seeing the movie and wishing it was more.
