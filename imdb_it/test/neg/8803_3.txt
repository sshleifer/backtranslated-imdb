This film was not the best ... but it had some good actors. Isiaiah Washington was pretty good as a homeless guy, Guy Torrey was as good as his handicapped brother, Ice-T was as humorous as the landlord and surprisingly ... actress Tami Roman was as good as a judge in the film. I didn't even know it was you and I'm a passionate fan of Real World. It was totally credible. We hope that this film will not hinder the development of these actors. I know that Isiaiah left this film far behind with the success of Grey's Anatomy, Ice-T with his regular role in NYPD Special Unit and Tami Roman got a recurring role on Sex Love and Secrets (the new UPN soap opera). I wish the same for the other actors because a bad movie does NOT make a bad actor.
