"House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim" (2005) is the sequel, although you don't really need to see the first "house of the dead" to get this movie. That being said, the value of production is definitely here, with great zombie effects and has been modified quite well, with a very effective sound design. However, having said that, it's all right here. <br /> <br /> The story and the script are horrible. . . there are obvious holes in the plot everywhere. It's also fun how soldiers don't care if they have blood on their faces (unlike 28 days later, where blood in any part of the body will infect you). Even realistic as there is little order with the soldiers here unlike the usual US military discipline. <br /> <br /> A 4 out of 10.
