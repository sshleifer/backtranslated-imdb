Poorly recited, poorly written and poorly directed. The special effects are cheap. The best performance is by Yvette Napir, but it's not saying much. The story is a confusing mess about corporate greed that leads to the sabotage of a space station and an attempt to save those on board. <br /> <br /> There is little suspense and even less action. There's a car chase that's not bad, but the rest of the film is simply a waste of time for everyone.
