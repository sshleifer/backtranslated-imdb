First of all, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst director ever, Plan 9 From Outer Space does not hold water. Coleman Francis deserves this title. I present Exhibit B, Glen or Glenda. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film consists of a surprisingly reflective exploration of crossdressing, especially since it was made in 1953. Even the last 15 minutes of film are not bad as well. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the film has no problems. Bela Lugosi was a complete stranger, singing strange lines. Poor Bela also seemed not to be sure what was going on sometimes. The acting was of deciduous wood, though not worse than a period Universal B movie. The long sequence of dreams that constitutes the central part of the film was completely bizarre; more like a vaguely threatening male film than a dream sequence. The story of Alan / Ann, the alleged original focus of the film, has an incisive quality. <br /> <br /> No, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst director ever. He was able, at least for part of this film, to make a serious social statement. When Coleman Francis tried to do it in Night Train To Mundo Fine (aka Red Zone Cuba), he just ended up in chaos. Glen or Glenda is at least watchable without the help of Robot.
