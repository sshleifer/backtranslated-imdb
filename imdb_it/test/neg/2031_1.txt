Somewhere in the United States, young Clair manipulates her friends Mic, Billy and John, showing a letter that Bob will send to her and the group cowardly Bob and Mic kill him with a piece of wood in the forest. Mic feels pain and decides to tell his mother what he did, but John and Billy threaten him with tragic consequences. I think "The Wind" is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The horrible script is ridiculous, and it is almost impossible to write a summary, since there is no plot or plot, only sequences of disconnected scenes. Direction and amateur acting are incredibly poor and terrible. It's amazing how producers invest money in this junk, distributors release this shit all over the world and viewers like me buy this DVD. I waited until the last scene because I was curious to see how bad this film would have been and I was impressed, because it's worse than I imagined in my wildest expectations. In the end, I wonder why IMDb doesn't offer zero in the voting system, since the garbage really deserves this vote. My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Força Invisível" ("Invisible Force")
