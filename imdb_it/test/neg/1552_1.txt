I just rented this stink because of its relatively high ratings. He's totally sucked in! I can't imagine how anyone would think this is a good movie - even an OK movie. None of the characters had ANY redeeming qualities of any kind. At various levels they were all selfish and petty - or battered and damaged personalities who had no idea of ​​the spirit of Christmas (when that happens!) I know Canadians and I like them - but I can't think they think this is a good movie too. I'd rather have a sharp eye in the eye than watch this offensive movie again. A colossal waste of time and money. Don't believe the person who wrote the opinion that "it is worth looking at". Probably this person would like to have a dentist drill teeth without anesthesia. I don't want to be rude, but for my life I can't imagine what this person was thinking. Unless they had ulterior motives. Maybe it was the director or producer. If so, I would like to ask them to give me my money back. If your money is important to you - save it instead of renting this piece of drek - or rent something (anything!) Other. I'm running out of good reasons not to rent this movie. If I were Canadian, I would say that it should be a favorite Canadian film. If so, I would say that those who think like that definitely need large amounts of powerful drugs. YECK!
