The Cheerleader massacre was supposed to be the fourth installment of the Slumber Party Massacre series; if that's what they were doing (which is considering an actress with original returns in a small cameo role), they failed miserably and made, by far, the worst episode of the "quadrilogy". Cheerleader Massacre perfectly combines bad acting, a horrible plot, a stupid killer, boring and boring deaths, boring scenarios and horrible photographic works to make it one of the worst movies ever made. Did I mention how bad it was? Don't get me wrong: this deleterious and delayed excuse for a horror movie isn't even remotely worse than Napoleon Dynamite, but it's undeniably a horrible film. <br /> <br /> Cheerleader Massacre is an exact opposite of the original Slumber Party Massacre. Stay away from all means! This movie is absolute junk!
