This stinker is in a mysteriously frequent rotation on a canal here, and I found myself looking horrified again and again. The script is like something that could be done with friends for many drinks and the production values ​​are wonderfully combined. <br /> <br /> It is meant to be a film for children, but presents a grotesque (and poorly explained) scene rapture; the starry dog ​​has a lack of stellar quality matched only by the other actors; and in general it has the appearance of being filmed in someone's backyard (the highlight soccer game features no more than three dozen extras that sadly greet in the background). <br /> <br /> Also all wrapped up in a limited budget -out sequence of voice-over when the story, with a relief, simply stops. The high-raters here must be the producers - or most of the extras from the soccer game!
