An O'Neill work lasting four and a half hours is reduced to just under two, and much of that running time is dedicated to actors with frozen expressions on their faces as they read the thoughts of their characters in voice over . It may work on stage, but it seems a bit exaggerated in this adaptation of soap opera, which moves the bad behavior of its heroine and never explains why it has so fascinated so many men. Norma Shearer and Alexander Kirkland, exaggeratedly ridiculous, are outclassed by a naturalistic Clark Gable: it is the only one that makes the frozen face technique work. It gets even more fun when Shearer's son and Gable, a grumpy joker, shtick with a frozen face. There is also the brother of Frank Morgan, Ralph, as a failed suitor, given to soliloquiate "poor Charlie!" over and over again, and a young Robert Young and Maureen O'Sullivan. When they arrive, the voiceovers have largely been abandoned, and it sounds like a mature soap, with a sentimental fade that actually sounds like "Silver Threads Among the Gold" as background music. Robert Leonard's direction is heavy and shows little chance of controlling hyperactive actors. It's definitely fun - there's nothing else, unless you include Groucho's satirical parody in "Animal Crackers", or an old Mad Magazine satire that made the Shirley Booth sitcom "Hazel" a la "Strange Interlude ". But it's not good.
