This film had horrible lighting and terrible camera movements. This film is a snappy horror film with no meaning. The cuts are totally fake. It looks like a seventeen-year-old idiot wrote this movie and a 10-year-old kid shot it. With the worst acting you can ever find. People are tired of knives. At least switch to guns or fire. It has lines that are almost exact from "When A Stranger Calls". With gruesome murders, only the mad would appreciate this movie. It is obvious that the writer has no children or that he takes care of them. I mean to show some pity. To sum up, this film is a "B" movie and sucks. Just for your sake, don't even think about wasting your time watching this lousy movie.
