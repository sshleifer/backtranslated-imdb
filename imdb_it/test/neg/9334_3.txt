This film and many other films of the 50s with a religious tone, such as The Robe, Quo Vadis and Samson and Delilah, unfortunately represent all pagans or anyone who is not Jewish or Christian as depraved and morally decadent. The focus is only on biblical stories that ignore the world outside the Bible. As far as they are concerned, nothing good has come from pagan Egypt, from Greece or from Rome. <br /> <br /> Every film that preaches about the 'one true god' gives a brief shift to freedom of religion. The films ignore the fact that the ancient lack of religious freedom in Judea has made it a fertile ground for religious extremism. Most religious films of the 1950s also neglect the loss of freedom, which occurred after Christians assumed political power in the fourth century.
