I just watched this movie last night, and after reading all the reviews I was expecting a good, exciting sports movie. What I got was something clich√© and boring. Yes, I thought it was boring. I saw the all-star hurt a lot before the game. I thought maybe they would wait for it to collapse until, you know, the game before the "big one", but I guess the first game is good enough. <br /> <br /> Parental relationships were also very trivial, with the drunken father dominating (I will say that McGraw hit me, anyway), and the guy who wants to stay to help his mother (suffering?) I especially liked the random girls (Melissa and Maria) who were in the movie for the whole 5 minutes, and placed there simply to get the soccer boys out of the field. I thought "ok, now how does it work in the plot again?" Maybe I missed the point, beyond "Well they play soccer in a city that they love so girls throw themselves at their feet" point. <br /> <br /> The sporting action had some positive points, but most of it so hurried! I think the first game lasted longer than the assembly of all the playoffs! And I wasn't so sure of the continuity of the final clock in the finale. <br /> <br /> I think I could watch this movie win the ESPY as the best sports movie if it was the only one released. Honestly, I found it to be a boring movie full of people obsessed with pigskin obsession. For a better football movie, see Remember the Titans.
