This is a terrible 1957 science fiction / horror movie. In fact, despite Ed Wood, Jr. and his terrible films that get a lot of publicity, this turkey is as ugly as Wood's worst. Now the acting is a little better than the one you would find in Wood's films (like PLAN 9 and SPOSA DEL MONSTER), but the special effects were definitely worse than Wood's! However, bad movie fans will be happy to hear that it is so bad that it is still an excellent vision. Like a Wood movie, it's nice to watch this crap and laugh with your friends. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a scientist flying to do some tests in his jet. However, out of nowhere, a strip of UFOs and its relationship beyond the radio triggers a panic from the Air Force. However, later on they realized that the UFO did not appear on the radio and think that the scientist is a fool! But when these planes start to disappear everywhere, they understand that there must be something for its sighting. <br /> <br /> So far, the film is not exceptional but it is watchable. However, when the horrible flying monster appears, you know you're looking at a turkey. First, through the horrendous use of serial movies and lousy models, airplanes continue to change in mid-flight. Some may not be bothered by this, but with airplane lovers like me, seeing an F-80 turn into an F-86 on an F-102 fighter plane has driven me crazy, especially since the planes don't look like each other. Second, through "smart" cinematography, everything you see of the monster is a fuzz ball for half the movie! This is frustrating and you hope that when you finally see it clearly, it's worth it. Well, he's not so lucky !! The "monster" seems less realistic or scary than that of Groucho's television series "You Bet Your Life" !! In fact, it's significantly less realistic than all the giant Japanese monsters !! In fact, Big Bird from "Sesame Street" is also a little more scary and realistic !!! It is simply terrible in every respect and could only be the most stupid movie monster in history, worse (or worse) than the monsters of ROBOT MONSTER or TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE !!! The bottom line is that this is an absolutely terrible film that healthy people will not like. Fans of bad movies like me (who are a crazy group) will probably love it! All the others ... fear, .... be VERY scared !! <br /> <br /> FYI - You might notice that some clips in this movie come from other sci-fi movies !! I'm sure the scene of the Washington Monument crash was stolen by EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS but I also saw a couple of other scenes that I swear come from other films. What a hacking job!
