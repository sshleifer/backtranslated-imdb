Set in a post-apocalyptic future, the new highlander is a quirky little querin named Quentin MacLeod, who is guided by a new Ramirez while his little sister goes in search of fighting an evil immortal lord. To do this, Quentin must absorb all the knowledge of other immortals before this sovereign, Korton, does it. <br /> <br /> In short, this is pure shit, very similar to the Highlander sequels. Quentin is a fairly stupid character, constantly plaintive and plaintive and plaintive in a "trouble I am for being a reluctant hero", and does not realize that he is an immortal and cannot be killed, at least not easily. Ramirez would have done better to get rid of him and foil Korton himself.
