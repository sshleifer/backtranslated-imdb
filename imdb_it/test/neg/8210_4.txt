"Dungeon of Harrow" had a lot of things that could have made this horror movie good enough. A terrifying villa, a torture chamber, a paranoid guest, a henchman, a ghoul in the basement, etc. But unfortunately to say this was not done very well. <br /> <br /> A writer and a skipper wreck an island owned by a count in a castle, his slave and a dumb maid. The count becomes more and more suspicious that the two castaways are pirates (of all things) and become more inclined to turn them on and subject them, and to the dumb maid who befriends them, to torture and to prison. Sound not bad right? <br /> <br /> Well, not really. I called it one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but now I hesitate. Because it had so much potential that it cannot be called "one of the worst". However, seeing that all this potential is lost is really a great success against this film. All in all, it's not a great film. <br /> <br /> There is a scene of very gothic suspense when our hero is chained in dungeons and is confronted by the mad and leprous rotting bride, adorned in a sheared wedding dress. This was disturbing and disturbing the first time I saw the horror unfold in this scene. I wish this was a better movie! <br /> <br /> This film had all the credentials to make this moody chiller moody, but in the end it took all the wrong curves. I suggest someone to do this again.
