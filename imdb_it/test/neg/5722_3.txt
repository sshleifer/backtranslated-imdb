Ok, I admit that I like Brigitte Neilsen in an unhealthy way, I only have one thing for women 6 'tall with swords. There I said it. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the movie? Almost all the mistakes you can make have been made. Take a series of successful movies (Conan) and drag it into the mud with an evil script, a bad cast, bad effects and the worst of all ... put a nice guy in there for a comic relief. This kind of thing almost killed the Indiana Jones series you know. Nice kids are for Disney movies, not real movies. Neilsen at least took the film seriously, even though it seems that no one else did. The plot had Schwarzenegger who repeatedly pulled Red Sonja's fat out of the fire and greatly reduced his character. A warrior woman doesn't need a guy to get her out of trouble, this is her job! Not reusing the character of Conan in this film was a crime. Kalidor? Sheesh. The film never created the right atmosphere and its rhythm was rather bumpy and sloppy, unlike Conan the Barbarian who had more narrative lines that flowed gracefully. When it comes to fantasy movies, it's ok to have poor costumes, it's okay to have a harryhausen-style animation, it's ok to have silly exorbitant sets that don't make sense, but having a horrible script is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> This film could have been a classic, but the script seemed to be written by a twelve year old.
