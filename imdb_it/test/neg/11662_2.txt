Now I remember what "indie" filmmakers were robbing before Pulp Fiction. It was David Lynch, wasn't it? <br /> <br /> I hunted this thing to see Kyle Secor. What a waste of a perfectly good Bayliss. It was so painful to look at it, a bit like when someone you love is horribly sick and there's nothing you can do. <br /> <br /> Almost all the clich√©s of the book: the desert, the psychopath, the eccentric leader, the biker, Tracy Walker (who fortunately was only in one scene, but I kept expecting him to reappear and say something strange and profound like "If a man wants to know where he is going, he has to look where he has been," or some garbage made up like that). I have a theory about why so many indies are short of position in the desert. I think it's because they can save on lighting. <br /> <br /> If you like to feel pain, find this movie and watch it. If you're a fan of Kyle Secor, watch Homicide reruns on Court TV. If you want a good, bizarre street thriller, check out Wild At Heart. <br /> <br /> There's a reason why nobody has ever heard of Delusion! My God, what a waste of a good title.
