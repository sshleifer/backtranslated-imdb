A conversation about how Jan-Michael Vincent is a lustful girl led me to stupidly visit this DTV entry from the mid-90s. A boy is traumatized when he sees a frozen man shot in the 1950s and grows up to be an ice cream man (Clint Howard). Something happens and people disappear and end up in ice cream. Blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Director Norman Apstein (credited as Paul Norman) made a career in porn before this and returned to it soon after. This is what you get because all the murders happen off the screen. And for throwing a skinny little boy like a fat kid and wearing a fat suit. Just throw a fat guy! Furthermore, there is a scene in which Vincent reacts stoically to a group of crazy fugitives surrounding him. He was totally drunk and afraid for his life or did the directors capture his "I really sank so low?" shame completely. Despite being a low-cost junk, this has brought out some prominent names including David Naughton, Olivia Hussey, David Warner and Doug Llewelyn of THE PEOPLE COURT. How can you make a boring slasher with that cast is beyond me.
