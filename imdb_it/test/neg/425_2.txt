Oh, well, I thought it was a good deed, but it wasn't. Although Jeff Speakman has no stars, there is nothing to look at. Only two fights for almost an hour and a half, yaks. A lot of words and everything is so artificial that you can't believe it. The plot is clear from the beginning. If you want a good deed, don't rent this movie.
