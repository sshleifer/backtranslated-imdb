To call "Rocketship XM" a science fiction classic is due more to its release date (1950), to its ability to exploit the "Destination Moon" ad, and to the appearance of actors who would later play television as Sea Hunt's Mike Nelson, Rockford's father and Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> The film itself is bad enough to be a good fodder for MST3K and it is better to see it with comments from Joel and the robots. This is the most suitable type of film for adding MST3K character riffs; something of a preacher, at a slow pace, poorly written and full of painfully bad acting. While unintentionally funny things like "Plan 9 From Outer Space" don't lend themselves to satirical comments (because the film constantly puts the hosts on stage), really bad and boring movies like "Rocketship X-M" are ideal. So add some stars to the evaluation if you are looking at the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> The basic story is that the crew made an unplanned turn to the moon and ended up on Mars. What they find on that planet are the remains of a civilization similar to the man devastated by an atomic war. Only a Martian is shown in the foreground, a normal-looking woman who is blind or at least has no pupils in her eyes. The men resemble the "marauders" in the old Popeye cartoons, they run nimbly around the cliffs and throw boulders at the crew with incredible accuracy, especially if they are supposed to be blind. Obviously none of this is ever explained as it would require some sign of logical analysis by the authors of the script. <br /> <br /> The scenes on Mars are presented in something called "Sepia Color" to distinguish them from the rest of the film in black and white. If this makes you think of "Wizard of Oz" you will be disappointed because it is only black and white material with a slight brown tint added to the post-production print. <br /> <br /> In harmony with the film's Moorish sexism, the icy scientist discovers her fuel calculations, both coming and going. Her inability to compete with men brings out her feminine side and she and Mike Nelson soften each other gently as they face their destiny (insert the gag sound here). <br /> <br /> The real stars of the films are the reporters at the command center. So much so that MST3K was inspired to give a special greeting to these unnamed heroes. The intrepid team of "journalists" is present for the first 10 minutes of the film, then takes positions of around 12 inches behind the technicians and monitoring equipment in the command center. Then they are asked to ask the moral questions necessary for the mission director to expose the already too obvious message of the film. <br /> <br /> The DVD has an extremely low audio level, is not subtitled and is accompanied by a trailer. Although you'll be grateful it's only 77 minutes, it's still about 60 minutes in duration because every 30-minute episode of "The Twilight Zone" has more content than this entire movie. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
