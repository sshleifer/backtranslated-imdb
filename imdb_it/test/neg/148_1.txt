I came across this movie on the net by accident and was horrified by its content of violent violence scenes and torture scenes. it was a relief to know that it was not real after reading the comments. which dangerously sick animals of a person do something similar and for what purpose it goes beyond faith. I was even more shocked to see the people who rated the film in the comment section of this site. this is really a disturbing movie that could change your life forever. the people behind this should be bought in justice as soon as possible. today they showed a girl raped and slaughtered on the screen tomorrow could be a child. even his fake or not is really very disturbing, really nauseating.
