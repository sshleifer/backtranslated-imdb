While studying the differences between religion and worship in college, Mindy (Rachel Miner), who is the best student in the class, convinces her school friends Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk), Alex (Joel Michaely) and Morgan (Victoria Venegas) to research the massacre of Kwan Yin worshipers by their leader Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson) twenty years ago in California. Quinlin had found an ancient amulet in southern China that would give him enormous power after the sacrifice of human souls, but a woman resists and is destroyed. However, after the death of Morgan, who apparently committed suicide, the students discover that Quinlin is back and is chasing their souls with his amulet. <br /> <br /> The "Cult" plot is not completely negative. the script, the direction, the acting, the jokes, the camera, the CGI and the edition are horrible, I was completely bored and tried to use the FF button on the DVD, but I resisted and lost 90 minutes of my life watching this one endless shit on a Saturday night. My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Amuleto Secreto" ("The secret charm")
