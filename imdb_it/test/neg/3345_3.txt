I wish Depardieu had managed to finish his book and see it become a resounding success. At least he would have ended up with something. <br /> <br /> The film struck me as useless, rambling and very elegant, like some other recent French films. Don't knock. The most recent American films are useless, inconclusive and without style. We should be grateful, I suppose, for photography that evokes a European city in the midst of a continental winter blown by the wind, and for elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> But there can't be too much of a good thing Golubeva finds herself stumbling near the sea in the middle of the freezing night, continuing with a nasty accent on dreams and things like that. (There are some dream sequences that include things like swimming in a river of blood. You'll like it if you're Vlad the Impaler.) Many people die. Catherine Deneuve dies in a motorcycle suicide. I do not know why. Even Golubeva's girlfriend dies and I don't know why she dies. She is slapped in the face, falls on the pavement and dies. <br /> <br /> It is assumed that there is also an explicit sex scene. I will have to believe him on his word because, although he is elegantly photographed, he is elegantly photographed in almost complete darkness. Don't worry that children are shocked. They will probably fall asleep anyway right now. <br /> <br /> Depardieu is not a bad actor. While we see him degenerate from a handsome well-groomed young man - well, handsome, except that his nose can't get out of his way - to a limping, killer and hairy physical wreck, we're sorry for the boy. Golubeva has a beautiful pale face, with huge eyes halfway up his eyes and wide cheeks, like a doll. His next film should be a remake of Lewton's "I Walked With a Zombie". Then there's this mysterious guy who leads a band. I guess it's a band. As far as I could tell, the band is made up of a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars. Each viewer will find the resulting sound to be interesting but uncultivated listeners, lovers of "easy listening" who may not like it. If you don't like music, there is a reward in play because the sinister composer and boss is hit on the head with Depardieu's walking stick. <br /> <br /> I must say that I found that it was barely worth seeing. (And he is also a loner.) Sometimes it was like waiting in the car at an intersection while a long freight train slowly rolls, sometimes stopping completely. I wish I had some jokes.
