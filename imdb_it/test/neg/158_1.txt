I tried to watch this adaptation, but it was so terrible that I couldn't torture myself like that. The performances were quite partial, with the exception of Ariel. Fonda was definitely over the top in a role that should be managed with a little subtlety. I studied Shakespeare and saw many adaptations, and this is by far the worst I've ever seen. I have to ask myself why on earth someone made this film. Shakespeare can, and has been, beautifully adapted in many cases. This is not one of them. If you have to watch this movie, can I suggest a drinking game? Take a drink every time they leave the original idea and drink two drinks each time the Fonda exceeds the limit. You should be pretty drunk in no time.
