After completing this infernal piece of trash, a friend and I solemnly swore never to talk about how we just wiped out the last 90 minutes of our lives. This film is completely useless, a hero and two-dimensional heroine that we can't give a big cue to if they survive or not and some of the most insignificant villains to obscure the horror screen (or any other kind). To further demonstrate how absolutely useless this film was, I would have liked to add a synopsis to the plot, but I can't write fiction. All in all, the only reason I can think that anyone would ever want to see this movie is if they just killed their entire community and are looking for a self-asserting punishment that will haunt you for all the years to come!
