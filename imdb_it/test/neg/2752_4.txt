Shemp discovers he inherits a million dollars if he is married within 24 hours. Considering how awful his appearance and personality is, it is not surprising that he cannot get a buyer - that is, until an article appears in the document explaining his situation - at which point five mad women appear nowhere to ask for their new hubby (plus the money, of course). <br /> <br /> Although I don't hate the Three Stooges and I like to watch their shorts occasionally, they have never, even on their best day, approached the brilliant comedy of Buster Keaton. This is why I didn't like this film, as it was a repudiation of the plot from Keaton's masterpiece, SEVEN CHANCES. With the Stooges it was not uncommon for Columbia Pictures to steal old comedy plots or simply recycle Stooge's older shorts. So, from the beginning, this film is a pale imitation of an original. It is also obvious that this film does not have the charm and subtlety of the original and the gags generally seem very forced (in particular the phone booth scene). Cousin Basil bit, however, was quite nice and funny, though not too thin! However, the worst aspect of the film was the not particularly funny conclusion. In Keaton's version, hundreds of women seemed to marry and the action became very fast and furious - here, everything remained in a small room and there was no comic punch - which ended in a fiasco. <br /> <br /> Overall, a boring script. Also, before marking this "not useful" review, make sure you see SEVEN CHANCES FIRST to see what I'm talking about, so you decide.
