Rabbit Fever is one of those movie quirks. It's a pleasant 90 minutes, requires little to the viewer and offers so much and on any terrestrial television channel even in a first time bracket, I think that Rabbit Fever would be rather well received. Which makes me wonder why he was pushed into the theaters. <br /> <br /> The film is filmed in the style of a television documentary and introduces us to 6 women who are addicted to Rabbit Vibrator. The film is mainly focused on investigating an alleged quality of addiction to the famous sexual aid product. The texture is 100% tongue in the mouth. <br /> <br /> The plot is strong, an introduction to some well rounded and nice characters, some funny back-stories, peripheral characters and situations develop into a compelling story, and satisfying conclusions. Unfortunately there is nothing that feels smart or new. <br /> <br /> Rabbit Fever has some strong moments, some switches that suggest what writers are capable of, and all of them to their credit are not just 90 minutes of gags of knobs and allusions, I could probably watch it with my mother . But there is a laziness on some of the scenes that hold it, those moments are gone for you, when you want it to be outrageous, and all you get is a bunch of sitcoms. <br /> <br /> I chuckled, left the theater full of empathy for the characters, but I also left the bitter thought that someone had taken a 90-minute reel for TV, for light entertainment and tried to get it in in national cinema. <br /> <br /> I think that Rabbit Fever has gotten a bit of what it has decided to do, it is a bizarre subject, a rounded plot, a well presented cast and a good diversion for 90 minutes. But there is nothing in this that can justify the extravagance of a cinematic environment. On the contrary, some commercial interruptions would have given the spectator the chance to grab a breath of life that seems to be missing to Rabbit Fever.
