For a film I couldn't wait, I was very disappointed. I did not expect this to be another Amadeus, but I expected a more significant portrait of Beethovens in recent years. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris' performance was superb, but the plot was so weak that the film simply moved from one sad scene to the next without continuity. <br /> <br /> The only pleasant part of the film for me was the ninth performance, and from that moment on I could have happily gone out without finishing. <br /> <br /> I felt very dissatisfied and I still have the feeling that something important has been missing.
