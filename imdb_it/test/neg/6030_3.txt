I don't think this film had the effect on me that it was intentional: to see American soldiers shoot wounded soldiers on the other side, and injured fists to prisoners in their wounds to torture them by making them talk to me made the other party root . It certainly made American forces look like "the good guys". Should it be acceptable?
