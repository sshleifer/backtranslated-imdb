When I saw Alien vs. Predator a few years ago, I have to say that it was as stupid as a sequel, it was still a bit funny. Now, unfortunately there is a shortage of good movies on stage lately, so my boyfriend and I decided to go ahead and see what AVPR was: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem. So we saw it a couple of nights ago and I have to say that there was absolutely nothing exciting in this horror sequel. It took a completely different turn from the first AVP movie, it's not a bad idea that they took Alien and Predator and put them in the classy suburbs, but from the idea of ​​the first one explaining their reasons for existing, this was just a medium and predictable horror sequel. Not to mention a story that continues to introduce new characters into every scene where I wasn't sure who to keep in mind who the main character was and why, so I couldn't really keep up with the story. <br /> <br /> From what I have gathered, of course the Predator and the Alien are in space having to deal with the typical sit-in partners, they are just beating each other's lights and decide why not? Go ahead and take it out on some land. So they crash and Alien is taking over in the suburban utopia. But teenagers, including a tormented couple who looks like Ken and Barbie, a female navy and her daughter, among others, will make sure to kick a space, that is, if the predator doesn't arrive sooner. Because it's ticked at the Alien, I guess for starting the party without him, lol, I'm just kidding, actually to kill some of his friends. <br /> <br /> AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem is not the worst film of all standards, it is still quite nice with a lot of visual effects and the combat sequences between Alien and Predator are so beautiful to look at . As the first sequel to Alien vs. Predator, the cast is the thing that ruins the film and it seems that they were not well developed, I know it's horror, but the original films Alien and Predator had characters, that interested you and wanted to win. But it was a semi-decent sequel that I would say is worth a look, especially for Ken and Barbie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
