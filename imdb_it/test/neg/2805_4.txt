I was expecting a comedy on the NVA, but this is a parody. Show the East German national army in a light that is not appropriate, and certainly not true. <br /> <br /> You can do a comedy about everything, as long as the underlying facts have not changed. Even a comedy about the German KZ is possible, as Roberto Benigni demonstrated with "LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL". <br /> <br /> The NVA movie would be an "OK" comedy, because the lines contained in it are OK overall. Nothing special - not hilarious, but enough to live with. <br /> <br /> The point is that the film makes a farce and a parody of the NVA. A death machine ready to attack WESTERN EUROPE with his friend, the RED ARMY. An institution that used everything to get the most out of its soldiers. An army that marched into the CSPR in 1968 and was ready to march also in POLAND to destroy SOLIDARNOSC. Can't you make a movie without showing the smallest of evils, or would you parody a KZ, Guantanamo or September 11th ??? Showing Osama bin Laden as a funny and screwed boy? 90 minutes on a funny Osama in a Taliban Afghan camp, where he jokes and is training his soldiers would be comparable to what this movie is doing on the NVA!
