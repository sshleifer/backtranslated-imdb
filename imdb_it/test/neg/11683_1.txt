OK, this movie wasn't good at all. Video games are not what I would like to boast if I were over 15 years old. It's nice to play, but writing a comment on video game players may like this movie for what it is, it's weird. Just play a video game, don't invent an excuse to get caught in one. I use my cell phone, I hope I don't lose my girlfriend. Is fat the worst ever? OK, Grease has a very well thought out story besides being a musical. Even if you don't like musicals, anyone would say that Grease is good. My brother plays video games all the time and watched 30 minutes and left because it was so terrible. I feel asleep.
