Linda Arvidson (as Jennie) and Harry Solter (as Frank) are enjoying a romantic date when she walks with her father Charles Inslee; furious, he chases Mr. Solter out of the house. Undaunted, he goes to his balcony and begs her to escape. Mrs. Arvidson is pleasant and goes to pack. Then, the thief George Gebhardt arrives to steal the place. Even if he doesn't get much in terms of loot, does the thief Gebhardt manage to use Arvidson's trunk to escape from the police ?? <br /> <br /> A comedy contrived. Note, during the balcony scene, Solter goes off-screen, so the thief Gebhardt can enter the house without being noticed. And, Arvidson travels very lightly, since there seems to be nothing in his heavy trunk; maybe he just wanted to kill the Solter beau? Director D.W. Griffith, Robert Harron and Florence Lawrence are distinguished extras. <br /> <br /> ** To Calamitous Elopement (8/7/08) D.W. Griffith ~ George Gebhardt, Linda Arvidson, Harry Solter
