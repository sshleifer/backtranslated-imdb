Angels and Demons: 3 out of 10: Clearly something bad has happened to Ron Howard. I don't know exactly what, but something went wrong. <br /> <br /> Howard has always been a decent director. Although Cinderella Man and Apollo 13 will never be mistaken for an artistic savant, they were excellent films, Parenthood was pretty good and even Angels and Demons prequel / sequel The Da Vinci Code was a fun game. Moreover, none of his films was really horrible. (Note that I have seen neither How the Grinch stole Christmas nor his latest film Heidi Montag says No to plastic.) What else has managed to maintain this quality is such a fanciful genre as the stellar lure (A Beautiful Mind) , a drama in costume (Far and Away), star driven revenge fantasy (Ransom) and comedies on prostitution and mermaids (Night Shift, Splash). <br /> <br /> Angels and Demons is at the center of a poorly directed and shot film. The scenes are too dark, the corners of the camera are all wrong, the actors are blocking each other and the whole thing is often blurred. This makes the story of an already confused story even more confusing. <br /> <br /> Dan Brown is chosen often, but I found the Da Vinci Code a fun, legible fun (so please tell me). The movie version of the Da Vinci code has remained unchanged where they are going to the next book vibration and added an attractive cast and an attractive position. <br /> <br /> Angels and Demons still takes place in the claustrophobic confines of Vatican City and since Howard was not allowed to film in many of the real locations, we find ourselves running around with a lot in CGI. The whole film is like Rick Steves doing a Vatican City special and instead of actually visiting the Holy City and pointing his camera, Rick had to use Lego bricks and a second-hand art book with all the tits deleted. <br /> <br /> While the Da Vinci code had what I still think is an intriguing central mystery (again myself), the storyline of Demons and Angels consists of an Illuminati plot (draw your eyes now) to destroy the Vatican. Their idea was to take positions in schools for deaf people around the world and repeatedly rape every student in the ass. Oops my bad; apparently the Vatican does not need help on that. <br /> <br /> However their plan is to infiltrate the Large Hadron Collider in Europe, kill the chief priest and steal three vials of Anti-matter. This requires more than a few questions. Can the Hadron Collider create anti-matter? Can you capture the anti-matter once created? Why does the EU collect it? (Perhaps they fear a Godzilla attack?). Why does the head of Anti-matter bring a Vatican priest together? Now, once you get the anti-matter, will they use your incredible destructive power to conquer the world ?? No, I'm just kidding; unfortunately the Illuminati have not yet fully understood the level of sophistication of Pinky and Brain. Instead the current pope has just died and it is time to conclave. The head cardinals for the final tournament of four popes are all kidnapped and the Illuminati kill them one by one. They are good sportsmen, yet they are leaving clues to every murder as a Latin-themed Riddler. Oh and the last kidnapped cardinal has the anti-matter and if he won't be found in time Rick Steves will have to go straight to Venice next year to see decent frescoes. If only there was a Latin-themed Batman to save the day ??? Okay, the story is really horrible and it's being told wrong, but maybe this is one of those movies saved from great shows. A real study of the character ?? (Okay, you know where it's going). Tom Hanks gives an incredibly wooden performance and looks simply horrible (he's also old to play the character for about twenty years). His love interest Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer has no chemistry with Hanks or on screen. Ewan Macgregor plays the personal assistant / cabana of the Pope like an Irishman who seems to be about to break into a musical number at any time, provided that no one steals his Lucky Charms. <br /> <br /> On the positive side Stellan Skarsg√•rd makes a nice turn as head of Vatican security and as far as we know none of the deaf children have been raped during the making of this film that puts him in front of Vatican critics in at least one area.
