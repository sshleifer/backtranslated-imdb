Do you remember those terrible war movies that your grandmother forced you to watch about your old VHS recorder about 25 years ago? "The Fallen" is just a poorly executed remake of those movies! The story is terrible, the direction is terrible, the editing is terrible, the music is terrible and all together create an unbearable nightmare. <br /> <br /> It's also terribly slow! Very slow! I tried to sleep while watching him but I couldn't do it because I had nightmares. <br /> <br /> Please don't watch this movie! It's so bad! Ten lines are many so I don't know what else to say. <br /> <br /> Press the eject button NOW and you won't regret it!
