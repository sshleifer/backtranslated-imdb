"Witchery" could be the most inconsistent and sadly dramatized 1980s horror film, but, fortunately, it has some compensatory qualities like fantastic gore effects, a hilarious musical score and some fantastic casting choices. Honestly, the script doesn't have the slightest sense, but who cares when Linda Blair (with an exploded hairstyle) portrays another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof portrays a big photographer (who doesn't seem to have a fuck) in a film that constantly shows bloody voodoo, sewn lips, inverted crucifixions, vicious burns and an abused but genuinely creepy melody. Eight random people are gathered on a deserted island off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple is there to investigate the dark history of the place; the dysfunctional family (with Linda Blair pregnant, although no one seems to worry about who her father is or what her fate is), considers the hotel reopening and the appetizing female architect is limited to casual sex. Are they forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady ?? an aged actress or something that always dresses in black ?? start taking them out in various exciting ways. Everything is somehow connected to the introductory sequence that shows a woman accused of witchcraft jumping out of a window. However, the plot is decidedly less important in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial "The Evil Dead" spin-off. The atmosphere is sometimes disturbing and the effects of make-up are undoubtedly the most important element of the entire film. There is something supremely morbid and disturbing about staring at a helpless woman hanging upside down in a fireplace and waiting to be fried.
