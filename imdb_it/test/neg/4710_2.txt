I rented this movie because Elijah Wood did a good job and I thought this could be a neglected treasure. It wasn't a treasure. I don't know if this was directly to the video, but it should have been directed to the dump. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood fans will appreciate the fact that he appears without a shirt in a shower scene that is too short. But no sane person would like this script. Imagine Memento played by teenage actors, but ten times more confused and a hundred times less plausible. Case in point: Janeane Garofalo plays a thoughtful psychologist (apparently "keeping the chain of mediocrity alive"). <br /> <br /> As if false memories and mental medicine were not acute enough, the film is also based on one of those inexplicable psychic twin bonds that keep the plot in motion and the audience bewildered. This same double bond creates too many love scenes invented between the character of Wood and the girl from She's All That, who plays the holy sister of her angry friend victim of a cancer-victim of Wood. <br /> <br /> Adding to the banality of this script, Wood's other friends are a victim of mentally challenged cancer and Kidney, a young black boy with a mysterious kidney disease. Kidney's dying wish will come true when Dr. Garofalo gives him his Walkman. The hackneyed function of this character in the story is accompanied by his on-again and off-again relationship with walking. Usually tied to a wheelchair, Kidney has several inexplicable scenes that show that he pushes others around. <br /> <br /> Kindey's characterization may be a small detail, but it is indicative of many other defects in the film. The Bumblebee Flies Anyway is definitely bumbling, but it never flies.
