Makes the fourth release for the cinema (the one with which National Lampoon took its name from OFF) seems a comedy classic. A complete mistake and a sad attempt to capitalize on a once proud franchise. Painfully unfunny and unwatchable ... even for a TV movie! The character of Cousin Eddie became progressively less fun, from the original Vacation when he was fresh and unique, through the Christmas holidays when he was starting to wear a little thin, in Las Vegas Vacation, where it was actually annoying to see coming on screen ( but honestly, there were many things that were annoying to see coming on the screen in that movie!). But this attempt to bring the character into the leadership position is unfortunate to say the least. Vacation movies have met a nasty death in Las Vegas, and this hope of reviving even the thinnest line in the television series has been completely misled. Chevy Chase and the company put together a great trilogy when it was in its prime; now just pull the plug and let the title rest in peace. (A small note of interest: the original Audrey Griswold - Dana Barron, the first of four actresses to play the part, including Juliette Lewis - returns to the role 20 years later! One is left alone to wonder ... WHY? )
