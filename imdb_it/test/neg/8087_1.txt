Rare and auspicious are the moments in which the cinema stands out as a size for the rest of the sector to measure itself and to immerse itself in that glorious moment. <br /> <br /> Some stories transcend their time and aspire to the heights of a classic and legends. Test the refined skills of a cast of actors who are at the top of their game. <br /> <br /> "Where did the originality go?" It is here, like this story, and it is the sashay cast through a plot and a story that will not only educate, but also entertain the most expert connoisseurs of Shakespeare / action / love story. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine where the writers invented this extraordinary story. Where do genes get this kind of inspiration? Now I have hope for humanity, knowing that this kind of talent still exists makes me hope that we will do it to the stars and beyond, perhaps to the doors of paradise. <br /> <br /> I, like the others before me, dreamed of greatness. Although I didn't write this film, I saw it and, because of the noble grandeur of this film, I feel like I've been raised to a higher level of being, a higher level of spiritual integrity. <br /> <br /> No wonder that this kind of glory escapes most of us. What would become of our world if we could all reach this level of magnificence? We would probably be consumed in a white fire of supernova glory as we evolve into transdimensional spiritual beings capable of an all-powerful creative power. <br /> <br /> The most important thing to know, with all your heart and very essence of your being, is that "Tomcats" is not like the one I mentioned. "Tomcats" is the antithesis of everything I mentioned. It could very well destroy our world. Since some reviewers rate a film on a star system, namely 1 to 5 stars, or even zero stars, I will evaluate a "black hole" of "Tomcats". <br /> <br /> I am willing to donate money to a lawsuit that will put an end to this kind of atrocity that, at times, seems to be at a disadvantage at the box office. I'm not even opposed to using nuclear weapons. Must stop. How much more can we do before the aliens from space come here and blow up our planet because we have so many stupid, coarse, vulgar, unimaginative and degrading films that come out of Hollywood? I will not give dignity to this film by citing the name of anyone who interpreted it or produced it. I'm not going to waste my time describing the story, since we once saw bilionions, and all previous versions were at least once in a while better. <br /> <br /> From the way my head almost imploded during this movie, but with supreme altruistic effort and luck, I survived to warn the public. You have been warned.
