We gave this film a star for terrible, however, it really depends on how you look at it. At the moment we are watching this channel on Channel 5 at 3.30 am and we haven't stopped laughing, so maybe we could give it a 10, just for the entertainment value. From the beginning, with the comical "manic" thoughts of the stalker, we were laughing. It's me or that chick from Knott's Landing looks like one of the characters in the Dark Crystal. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to ruin it for you, however, you should be pretty stupid not to see it coming, I don't think it's smart enough for double bluffs. <br /> <br /> This must be the worst / best movie we've ever seen, if we had played the point on the clich√© by drinking game, so we'll be wasted by now.
