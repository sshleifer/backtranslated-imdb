One of the worst movies ever made ... If you can get past these films without falling asleep, then you're doing pretty well, considering no matter how hard it is to turn up the volume, you can't hear what the "actors" are (?) Saying and if you can see what's going on from the terrible movie (I mean hell if you can't find something that works better ... use a camara of home movies ... AT LEAST YOU CAN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT!) <br /> <br /> It's beyond my imagination how people get a movie like this to slip through the cracks and escape the video ... and more ... how people do this they don't know how terrible ... good god. .. (!) <br /> <br /> After what I just told you ... If you're waiting for me to give you a summary of this piece of trash movie, there's nothing to say. .. a group of campers on motorcycles get lost in the woods and a group of people terrifies them ... or something like that ... which is more an action film than a horror ... this 'film' (?) it is of no interest ... I like someone like this I literally feel for you .... <br /> <br /> Absolute Trash ... not even one of those funny funny movies to watch go to rent .. 'Piano 9 From Outerspace 'and have a ball
