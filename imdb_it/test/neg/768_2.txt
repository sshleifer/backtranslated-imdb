Tom & Jerry are visiting Africa and dressing up in "Amos-n-Andy" fashion. They also act and speak differently, with the standard degrading use of extremely poor grammar associated with the stereotypical image of blacks portrayed in many cartoons of the time. Apart from the offensive images, this comic is not very good. Why were they going to Africa in the first place? Apparently only to provide the public with another Amos-n-Andy and the cannibalistic portrait, also abused, of African natives. The only reason this got a 2 instead of a 1 is that there are a few decent seconds involving an octopus. <br /> <br /> It is worthwhile to see it, which will still let you shake your head wondering how ignorance might prevail ... <br /> <br /> (Note: I think some vignettes containing stereotyped images of this generally they are very good, it depends on whether there are good contents surrounding the cartoon or if the only reason for the existence of the cardboard is fun of the one who is represented incorrectly. "Poor grammar and the black face with images of giant lips is anything left? In the case of" Plane Dumb "there is none.)
