This failed exercise of satire or comment on the human condition has easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst films I have ever seen. I'm seriously thinking of buying a copy, if I can find a cheap dirt, to drive away the unwanted company. It's honestly so bad. I see it as a kind of anti-personal weapon. If you are the kind of person who only needs to see a shipwreck to witness the carnage, then this film is a gem. Just to be honest, the character of Kelsey Grammar has 1 line that works almost, but not quite. Apart from this, everything in this film strives to be insightful, but the target of about the distance between the earth and the nearest pair of colliding galaxies is missing. Usually I can appreciate a book or a film in which the protagonist suffers from a sort of existential anxiety, but the anguish presented here is so incredible and exaggerated, and the film does not even address the absurdities that it presents in some precious way. If you are familiar with the word "vomit of words", you could get some images of the cinematrocity. Oh, and the narrative structure is ill-conceived, pretentious and amateurish. He failed both in style and in substance. If you really hate someone, invite him to a double feature of this movie and "The Terror of Tiny Town", a western midget from the 1930s and put them in a cage with their eyes forced to open the "A Clockwork Orange" style. But this probably violates some provisions of the Geneva Conventions.
