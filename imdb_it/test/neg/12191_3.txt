ATTENTION: I recommend to all those who have not yet seen the film not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie my expectations were that it was a vampire movie, it would be great to consider how Rodriguez and Tarantino contributed to the making of the film. I started about 15 minutes and already my hopes for this movie were thrown down, which shocked me. First of all, the story he was going through was not at all attractive in every way possible, and simply flat, boring and unpleasant to the point where I simply wanted to turn it off. I felt more and more frustrated with this movie as it was being dragged, but I imagine I have hopes that it would improve ... then when it finally showed the vampires that BLEW MY MIND, in a VERY bad way. I thought, "Okay, this movie started with a horrible suction story on these two criminals, then VERY slowly it turned into a vampire movie that I thought would be from the beginning, like in the last 30 minutes?" To add this, they try to make the main characters fantastic and fantastic and mean towards the end when they are not; A rabbit would have been more intimidating than these characters! This movie is a horrible piece of shit !!! From sunset to dawn it dishonored me and left a terrible taste in my mouth, discouraging thoughts in my head, and I left my body unable to move from the horrible shock that I just wasted 108 minutes of my life in a horrendous movie. I don't understand how George Clooney, Quentin Tarintino, Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo, being all good and honorable actors, can take part in this useless filth. In my opinion, From Dusk Till Dawn is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Don't see it, you'll get a BIG favor ...
