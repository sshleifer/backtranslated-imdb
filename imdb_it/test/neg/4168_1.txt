An interesting concept that just can't do it. I watched the whole movie, but I had to read IMDb comments to find out what the 46 code meant. If / when it was explained in the movie, I must have been in a coma, or maybe brain dead by then. I only saw it for Tim Robbins. The fact that I didn't know any of the other actors should have been a tip. We all have to start somewhere, but this film shouldn't be like this. As for the "anti-empathy virus", Holy Utility Belt, Batman! Where were The Joker, The Riddler, etc? Also, why are women all so damn ugly? If I want to see stylized figures less than normal, I'll walk down the street. The best part of the film was the car crash. It was absolutely credible, and not as exaggerated as most of the movie crashes.
