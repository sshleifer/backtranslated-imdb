I saw this movie for the first time on NBC on Friday 11-29-02. It was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it would be the kind of Muppet movie that Jim Henson would do. I mean first of all, Pepe 'uses the word "sexy" from time to time, and Pepe who says "would it suck?" And I know that Jim Henson wouldn't let Kermit scream "I HAVE NOT DENIED ME BORN!" thirteen times per minute. This film is not exactly like a classic Muppet movie. Sure, I can understand Nicky Holiday stealing the baseball diamond from "The Great Muppet Caper", but a businesswoman who cheats the Muppets on a contract for their theater to turn it into a smoking club. If Jim Henson were here today, he will hate this movie!
