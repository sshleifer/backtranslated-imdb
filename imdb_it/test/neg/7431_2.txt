Robert Downey Jr. with a wig and a 17th century dress was enough to make me shudder, but I couldn't believe that a great actor like Sam Neill actually took part in this movie. The whole thing was incredible. I particularly like Merivel's "care" for the crazy. They dance ... and soon! everyone is happy and everyone is better! I guess I don't like the Merivel character too much. So, watching a whole movie about his alleged transition from a prostitute fool to a great doctor was exhausting. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I'm not entirely sure, but I didn't think the plague and the famous London fire had happened at the same time.
