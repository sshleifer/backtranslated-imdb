This is probably the only movie I've seen where IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. "The Stupids" is an atrocious and obscure film that has absolutely no artistic value, and is a denigration for a director like John Landis. And that's what makes it great. <br /> <br /> To appreciate "The Stupids", you have to keep in mind a little known but very true maxim, uttered by the director Abo Kyrou: "I urge you to learn to watch bad movies, they are so often sublime" . For a film to work, the film must establish and follow its own logic, and if it does so convincingly and sincerely, then it is actually possible for the film to work. For example, when you look at "Freddy Got Fingered" as a traditional gross comedy, it is a complete and total garbage; when you look at it with the knowledge that it's actually a neo-surrealist comedy, it's brilliant. <br /> <br /> It also works with good movies. If "Jaws" had not accepted the reality he had created, the explosion of the air tank would not have worked. But many people think that "Jaws" is enormously overrated for this kind of reason, and they are not wrong. But it has its strengths, doesn't it? The point is that a film like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective. Some people, like me, understand it right away, while others never will, no matter how many times it is explained. Jim Jarmusch made a compelling defense of "Showgirls" once, and even after that I still can't see him from his P.O.V. It doesn't mean I'm wrong. If you have the right frame of mind when you watch this movie (and NO I HAVE NOT MEANED STONED, I will put it to bed right now), you can enjoy the movie for the stupid, cheap, useless late slap. The farce of the 80s / early 90s that is. <br /> <br /> The defenders and haters of this film are right: it's STUPID, and that's the point. The film accepts the stupidity of the characters in the same way that "The Jerk" accepted the idiocy of Navin Johnson. And since he takes it and runs with it, the film focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and define the characters. A "bad" movie would really do it and fail to properly use that logic; bad movies are bad because they come up while they go on, while movies like "The Stupids" know where it's going, what it's doing and why from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I cannot defend the film from an artistic point of view, which is why I give it such a low rating. The acting is mostly bad, the jokes are very superficial and the quality of the live action probably ruins what would have worked like a cartoon. But I can't deny that it's funny in its own way, and that's why I defend it. I knew it right away, and I pity those who don't. <br /> <br /> I admit that I was attracted to this film because of the delicious cameo appearance of Christopher Lee (hearing him say "Release the bee!" would have been worth the rental price even though I hated this movie), but I was surprised to find that, apart from the TV segment Studio Applause Sign with Jenny McCarthy, I was never bored, and never disappointed. In fact, many of the jokes, due to their comic context, were hilarious (especially the explosion of cigarette airbags). They were stupid, but they were funny. And the film does not pretend to be anything else: a STUPID comedy about STUPID characters and instead of apologizing for it, it is fun. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly why it works.
