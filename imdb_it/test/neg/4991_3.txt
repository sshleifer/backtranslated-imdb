When I became a father for the first time about 5.5 years ago, I was prepared for many of the sacrifices I had to make. I knew I had to change diapers and take them to swimming lessons and participate in many of Santa's cold parades, but I wasn't ready for the kind of sacrifice I made last night. This, in my humble opinion, is a cruel and unusual punishment. <br /> <br /> The loser is bad. It's not bad Karate Dog at all, but it makes The Shaggy Dog like Pulp Fiction. If Underdog was a TV show, I would recommend browsing it. Not even Puddy's presence and Banky Edwards's voice can save him. Arco. Wow. <br /> <br /> They were also the best 80 minutes I've ever seen. James was sitting to the right of me and Michelle on the left, and I spent more time observing their reaction to this talking, beating a dog rather than looking at the screen. At 5 and 3 years, they were the target audience, and this movie nailed the target. There's a scene in which Underdog rumbles in another face dog and Michelle thought it was the most fun scene ever captured in the movie. When Underdog flew into space, James was literally on the edge of his seat, hypnotized. The boys loved Underdog, and that's why I was there. Here's what it meant last night. <br /> <br /> Unless you accompany someone under ten, you have nothing to lose a second of your life watching this brutal movie. But if you're trying to kill 80 minutes with your four-year-old, I won't judge. I had a lot of fun.
