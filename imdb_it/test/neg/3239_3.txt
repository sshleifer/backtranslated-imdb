Based on the excellent novel, Watchers by Dean Koontz, it is this extremely horrible film that probably should not be seen by anyone. Not since "The Running Man" have I seen a book so slaughtered beyond recognition. The difference, however, is that the movie "The Running Man" was still enjoyable as a fun action movie full of millions of sentences. This film?? No, nothing remotely funny. In fact, if you love the book, as I do, you would hate this bastardization even more. <br /> <br /> ** NOTICE ** CONTAINS SPOILER ** Rightio, basically I'm going to tell you history here, almost in its entirety. Why? Because you, dear reader, you don't even need to suffer for this abomination, that's fine by me, because I like watching crap. Because I like to complain about burning things. Now for the bad: this movie revolves around a boy and his mother who run away from the government and a mutant soldier-creature-monkey who escaped from a destructive government genetic laboratory with a super golden retriever that the hero called "Furface". Groan ?? Trust me, in the novel, this story is shaken. We'll get there later. However, the hero is nothing but the dreamy boy-child Corey Haim. Oh, I'm not kidding. Our hero goes around, in a cracked voice and everything, trying to convince his mother to save this "evil government" dog that gave him birth and made him genetically ultra-intelligent. The ape-creature, who calls itself "Oxcom" (God helps us) is also a genetic stew of a creature built to be the last combatant on the battlefields of the future. Michael Ironside (Total Recall, Starship Troopers is always a tough guy) is also in this film, and no, I couldn't understand how someone convinced him that it would be a good idea. A government agent plays with the NSO hunting the dog and the creature. Oh yes, here are some spoilerama: it is also a creation of the government, and the laboratory itself, and so most of the film is a sting and kills people and everything that kills should be done by the soldier monkey. Instead of a gruesome horror movie, a creepy horror movie, we have a rectal hemorrhage of a teenybopper horror movie. The intelligence of the dog is discovered too easily, and it is considered easier than we think we can see the clouds looking out. Breakdown !! <br /> <br /> Change from Book to Film: <br /> <br /> - Lead character (Travis) passed from man to child. <br /> <br /> - The man's love interest in the book (Nora), is now his mother and all his depth and his character growth have completely disappeared. <br /> <br /> - Lem Johnson, a black man, is now white Mr. Ironside. This counts as the strength of the character was built on his legacy in the book. <br /> <br /> - Relationship between two completely ignored authority figures, Lem now kills the boy who was originally his best friend. <br /> <br /> - A main character in the book is now totally absent, the "immortal" who hunted heroes - perhaps this should be Ironside, but then why is it someone else? <br /> <br /> - The dog never receives the worthy name of "Einstein" in the film. <br /> <br /> - No part of the book was set in a high school, at least nothing that had a significant impact on the plot. br /> <br /> - Takes place within a few days, rather months as the unrealistic pace of the book. <br /> <br /> - Mayy Haim's girlfriend in the film appeared in no more than two chapters in the book - and they never met in the book. <br /> <br /> - Lem Johnson's character is no longer cold; instead, it's a total asshole that bullies people. <br /> <br /> --Hero Travis was part of the Delta Force (military segment specialized in the hunt for terrorists), instead, his dad, who is never seen in the film, was part of that group. <br /> <br /> - The forced intelligence in the monster now totally absent. <br /> <br /> - Plans involving Soviets and The Mob have been completely destroyed by history. <br /> <br /> - These are just the most heinous changes, and what I could remember from the hand (and the day after). <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - In the end, after an odd 90 minutes of mental pain and anguish, the film is finished. <br /> <br /> It didn't hurt, it didn't help: <br /> <br /> - -Michael Ironside ?? usually, I like it. <br /> <br /> - The dog is still quite likeable. <br /> <br /> --Wacky "totally 80s" title screen. <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> --Ok, writing for one is extremely horrible. <br /> <br /> - The direction is so absurd that anyone watching the film feel superior to everyone is involved. <br /> <br /> - Acting is disgusting and weak, especially from Corey Haim. <br /> <br /> - The loose, weak, watered down story. <br /> <br /> - The monster seems only pathetic, that is when in reality we are allowed to see the bloody thing. His head is enormously oversized, the yellow eyes that were so much part of the thing in the book are seen for no more than two seconds. Instead of a slim, powerful, fast and intelligent killing machine, we have a donkey with an ugly monkey suit who is hanged. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no character development. <br /> <br /> - Even violence and blood are hurt, for God's sake, this should be a HORROR movie !! Usually violence is at least well done! <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The idea that Dean Koontz disdained his brilliant novel to become this lousy sh * c shking piece brings me dangerously close to vomit about myself and whoever is close to me. There are films worse than this (headache as that idea might seem), but so far, only "Alien vs Predator", at least for me, is a bigger disguise and a more painful disappointment. <br /> <br /> Memorable Scene: Watch the credits that begin. <br /> <br /> Acting: 3/10 Story: 4/10 (the novel was really good, this is simply terrible) Atmosphere: 5/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character development: 1/10 Special effects / Trick: 4/10 Nude / Sexuality: 0/10 Violence / Gore: 4/10 Music: 5/10 Direction: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br / > <br /> Overall: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I recommend that no one ever watch this movie, except for a few extreme horror fans who die and only if you haven't read the novel. Instead, I would advise anyone interested in this to avoid it altogether and to buy / check / borrow the book. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
