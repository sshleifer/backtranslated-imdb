Any fan of Russian cinema will have great difficulty believing in the sub-par performances staged by Mashkov and Bodrov Jr., and will perhaps be completely perplexed by the trivial and confusing script of Bodrov Sr., which is coupled with an unusually weak direction. Most characters wander into the movie as if they had no idea who they are or what they are doing. It is also sad to see that Jennifer Jason Leigh's acting skills have not advanced a bit from FAST TIMES TO RIDGEMONT HIGH, and her on-screen display is mercifully limited. This is a terrible film about the mafia; so much so that it makes GODFATHER III a winner of the kind. To see the main Russians at their best, take a look at Bodrov Sr.'s work on PRISONER OF THE MOUNTAINS (which also includes Jr.), Mashkov's turn in VOR (THE THIEF) and Bodrov's new criminal Jr. in BRAT.
