If you are a fan of the original series, DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I should have been skeptical of the previews when Aeon expresses his motivations for the murder. In the series Aeon had no family and no reason for his adventures, except for selfish interests. Obviously the reigning chimpanzee felt that the film had to serve the demographic "bad grr" by making the character mortal, but he has a good reason to kill people. <br /> <br /> You wouldn't have thought it possible, but the film is more two-dimensional than cardboard. The characters are all portrayed as intrinsically good with some conflicts of interest that are eventually resolved. All dogs go to heaven, and the same goes for every character who dies in this movie. <br /> <br /> The selfish, twisted, perverse, dominant people of Aeon and Trevor are nowhere to be seen. Eventually they literally turn into a Charterhouse pair from Annie Hall. The only character who remained faithful to the show was the Relicle, the car floating in the sky. I guess if I ever thought "Damn, I like Aeon Flux, but I wish it was more like any other bold Hollywood science fiction phantom-v-evil out there," so you're ready for a surprise. <br /> <br /> They didn't even look right. I suppose a black metal bikini was too much to ask, but the whole scenario is wrong. 400 years in the future certainly seem 30 years in the past. Instead of a decidedly urban post-apocalyptic world, the eyes of the spectator are offended by a mod frutopia from the 70s with egg-shaped furniture, wood-paneled walls, earth tones and many plants. Bregna was a dystopia, not a utopia. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Bregna, this is the only city on earth according to the film. The show is clear that there are two cities, Bregna and Monica, who once were one. In the film, the "monks" are just the freedom fighters of a Hollywood storybook. They also have as much technology as the Bregnans, which is not the case with the show. <br /> <br /> The only possible conclusion is that the real writer of this film was a high school kid who wrote it the day before was due to the studio exec, and he never saw an entire Aeon Flux until the end. The overwhelming amount of inconsistency with the carton is staggering. In addition to using some names like Aeon Flux, Trevor Goodchild and Bregna, the film doesn't look like the show. <br /> <br /> The actual size of the film seems to try to blend the green soybean textures, the blade hunter, Logan's run and the grave raider, which came out of a dull brown mess.
