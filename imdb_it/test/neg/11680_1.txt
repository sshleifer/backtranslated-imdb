this is by far one of the most pretentious films I've ever seen. it's a slap on the face of some Indians who speak in English and look in the mirror. Disgusting. the bubble gum version of the politics of the 1970s of the northern plains of India. the message: the educated Indian of English language tried to save the poor beggars of India in all honesty. ignore the fact that even the poor beggars are capable and are saving themselves. <br /> <br /> like a love story is fine. the problem is that the romance and character development are based on a completely fraudulent version of the policy.
