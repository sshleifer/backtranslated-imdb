What can you say about THIS? Truly one of the most shocking experiences of my life. Your brain will try to shut down as part of a primary self-preservation impulse. I was left to pieces by the experience of watching this "movie" and it took me two hours to fully recover. This film joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the infernal trinity of horror movies. I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way. I mean this in a terrible way. A terrible way. <br /> <br /> This film has no saving features. Everything is scary. The camera without art presents to us infinitely the ugliest setting you can imagine, that is a lot of corn, so much mud. The story is beyond the stupid. Was the script? Was there a script? The villain is severely unlucky and wears yellow rubber boots. Children are annoying. The guide man is devoid of charisma. And have the audacity to go on for 100 minutes. Absolutely without merit at any level, this is similar to torture. Normally such an affirmation would be an exaggeration intended for comic effect. Not in this case. Will I tell you again? this is torture. <br /> <br /> In the end I was in a state of paralysis. This was luckily briefly. But once I recovered, I decided to look at the "Making Of" featurette. I had to understand. Perhaps there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity. Was it all an elaborate joke? I watched the first 2 minutes of the "Making Of" featurette and discovered that the writer / director was, to put it mildly, a little misled. I also found out because I took time to watch the first two minutes of Dark Harvest 2's "Making Of" featurette that I was an idiot. Not a pleasant journey to self-discovery. Life sucks. <br /> <br /> Highly discouraged.
