Garden State must evaluate among the most invented and pretentious films of all time. The plot is simple, involving a young man who returns home after his mother's death and discovers love. But in reality, the plot is not important. What is important for Zach Braff - writer, director and protagonist ?? is that it is able to hang all the necessary kits of an "indie" or "arty" film on the plot. We are therefore presented with infinite and extravagant characters and scenes that do not exist for reasons of plot or character development, but simply to give a certain artistic credibility to the film (Ã  la Wes Anderson - or so Braff hopes). Unfortunately and somewhat surprisingly, Braff has not only tricked many on IMDb, but also some critics who should have known. <br /> <br /> Of course, Braff's free use of the eccentric alone doesn't make Garden State a bad movie. What really makes a Garden State stench is Braff's script. He simply does not have the writing skills to take this film away, and the dialogue and characterization are abysmal. Braff often has to resort to sharp symbols and symbolisms to get what he cannot get through writing. For example, the numbness of Braff's character is shown to us by his indifference to an imminent plane crash (this cannot be worked on in the plot, and so must happen in a dream!), Later it is shown that he fights against his circumstances screaming in a bottomless abyss (life = a bottomless abyss, very clever Mr. Braff). These two scenes must be classified among the most ridiculous and artificial ever seen on a cinema screen. <br /> <br /> The upside is that acting is acceptable despite the lack of material the cast can work with (which means a script), and I admire Natalie Portman for her efforts as a love interest - a character so poorly written and implausible that he is little more than a mindless doll that Braff molds into his fantastic woman. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Braff took 3 years to write the script for Garden State (3 years to write such a bad script - he's really inept!). I therefore hope that it will take some time before you make another film.
