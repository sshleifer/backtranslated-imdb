Being a former MST3k observer, I also found this movie unwatchable. The terrible attempts at humor ... the hideous attempts at acting. No one needs to read harangue about this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> I like how all positive reviews have been clearly written by cast members or family members. Just click on the other reviews and wow - they're all revising Modern Vampires. Give me a few dollars and I can make a better film than this. One of the most incompetent films I've ever seen and is saying something. Look at your own risk. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10
