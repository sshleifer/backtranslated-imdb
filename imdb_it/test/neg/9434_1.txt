Can there be a worse movie? Even Ed Wood in his horrible worst failed to invent something so ugly. Hunted, stupid, long-winded, absurd ... and those are the positive points. I saw this garbage back in the early 1980s, when I was incredibly bored at first, and actually I witnessed the whole thing without blowing my brains out, although it would probably have been a more pleasant experience. I really remembered it because it was so ugly. In a way it saddens me because some of the best directors have started producing films for TV (eg Spielberg) and it was a wonderful way to get their starting material in front of the audience, but bullshit like this has completely killed whole processes.
