Entering the film with the right expectations, I liked this movie a bit. Like most reviewers who have seen this film, I fully agree that the plot was razor thin, clich√©s and I could foresee every twist since the beginning of the film. But the dancing sequences were VERY well done, and I really appreciated the fusion of classical dance and hip-hop (both of which I like to watch). The film's music / soundtrack was also very good, which made the "dramatic" scenes more bearable. The protagonists (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were OK as actors, but their way of dancing throughout the film was impressive and mesmerizing. <br /> <br /> All in all, a film that is worth watching if you like watching good dance sequences, and this film is VERY MUCH better than "You Got Served" in terms of plot and drama. Then again, this doesn't say much, does it? = P
