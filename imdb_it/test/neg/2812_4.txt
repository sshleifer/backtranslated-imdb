The reports of the brilliance of this film seem to have been very exaggerated and, unless the other reviewers were watching a different movie, I can't see how anyone can find this movie anything but boring, unbearable, disrespectful, too long and sometimes unbearably irritating. I'm not a schlocky horror fanatic. I love the jorrors and the horrors of the euro on American horrors every day, but I feel the need to warn all potential viewers of this film before they invest two hours of their lives in it. <br /> <br /> Could have been so beautiful A journalist is investigating a series of bizarre deaths and events, which appear to be apparently disconnected, but it seems that a series of unnerving tropes connect them: dead pigeons, deaf noises, presence of strangely linked knots ... Our journalist goes from person to person, interviewing them, filming them and then passing. Three important characters are in the midst of this mixture of people, a young, shy psychic girl, an immensely irritating, crazy psychic man, and a crazy old woman and her boyfriend, whose importance is not revealed until later. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the film is not even remotely interesting, which makes its two-hour duration unforgivable. It's not even remotely frightening or scary. Presumably scary scenes, such as macabre face shots are incredibly badly done, shown twice or, worse, we are told when they are about to happen. Other techniques, like telling us that a newly interviewed family "died five days later" simply don't make me worry, let alone moderately creep in. <br /> <br /> The film takes a bit towards the end, as our reporter, cameraman, psychic and cursed woman, goes to a village to "remove" the curse that binds all these deaths. However, at that time, I was in a state of catatonic boredom, and I couldn't care less, so all the scary job photos and shocks were wasted on me. The "final tape" is pretty good, but once again I gave up the treatment and wanted this movie to end. <br /> <br /> Boring and boring, not scary and not disturbing, I would advise you to keep away from Noroi. It has promising moments, but this is a film that has been hurt and not worth your time.
