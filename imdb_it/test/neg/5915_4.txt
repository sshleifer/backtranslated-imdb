Produced at a time in his career, where he had the gist to do what he wanted, Eddie Murphy took on the task of producing, directing, co-writing and acting in HARLEM NIGHTS, an expensive but ultimately empty gangster saga. group of black nightclub / gangster owners who run a luxurious club during the 1930s, led by a hot shot (Eddie Murphy) and adoptive father (Richard Pryor) and their attempts to avoid being invaded by white gangsters who think to take possession of apparently, they think it is rightly theirs, simply by virtue of their color. This was an idea that probably looked great on paper, but it definitely lost something in the translation. This was a piece of vanity for Eddie and I think it has spread a little too thin here trying to be the whole show here. Of course, it was a pleasure to see Murphy and Pryor together on screen, but the rest of the great supporting cast, including Arsenio Hall, Redd Foxx, Della Reese, Michael Lerner, Danny Aiello, Jasmine Guy, Thomas Mikal Ford, Stan Shaw, and Eddie's brother has very little to offer (although I would admit that Murphy's fight scene with Della Reese is hysterically funny and probably the best scene in the film). Murphy clearly poured a lot of money into this film and a good deal of it is shown on the screen. The art and direction are impressive and the stunning costumes should have won an Oscar, but this was a great lack for Eddie who certainly tried to wear too many hats.
