I thought I had seen this movie before, because the plot summary seemed familiar. However, when I saw him one afternoon (he needed carefree but entertaining entertainment), I didn't recognize anything - if I had seen him before, I must have blocked the horror from my memory. <Br /> <br /> This film is terrible and shows its age. In fact, it looks older than it is: more like a comedy from the mid-80s. While I am a fan of toilet humor and can see the fun side of many things, this is "comedy" in its most childish and homophobic. The plot is as thin as a Top Model, which wouldn't bother me if only the movie was fun. <br /> <br /> There is only one funny phrase in the whole movie, pronounced by the character Louis: "It looks like someone threw away a perfectly good white guy!" Indeed, Louis is the only nice character (and is not saying much). James and Carl are the kind of irritating and immature men that a reasonable woman would do less than a mile, their practical jokes like the Iraq war; the character of Susan Wilkins is colorless (it seems Julia Roberts, but lacks her charisma) and there is no chemistry between her and Carl - although it might be unfair to blame the actress, because I don't know what she could have done with a badly written part; and the villain is neither funny nor scary nor memorable. <br /> <br /> There is good rubbish and bad rubbish. This is rubbish that should not be recycled.
