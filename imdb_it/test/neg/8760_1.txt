I always appreciate classic horror films, however, this film was really a big waste of time and if it wasn't for John Carradine to play the crazy doctor who is able to control human beings through his experiments. This film was made during World War II and John Carradine was a German Nazi who worked to find a human weapon against the whole world. Bob Steele played many roles as a cowboy or a gangster and in this photo Bob looked bored to death with his role in this film and acted like it was his first film. Mantan Moreland, (Jeff) gave an exceptional performance with a great comedy that helped keep the audience's attention. I hate to criticize a movie made in 1943, but this is really a big disappointment. If you like John Carradine and the roles he played as Count Dracula in many movies during the 1940s, you might just see John do his best.
