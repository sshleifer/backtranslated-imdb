Okay - the title "House of Frankenstein" was a reference to a phrase from Frankenstein's original film. When they follow him with a movie called "House of Dracula", which makes no sense, you know he is just starting to become a franchise. <br /> <br /> Without explanation, Dracula is back, and he is calling himself Baron Latos. He infiltrates the home of a doctor Edelmann, with the claim that he is looking for a cure for his vampirism. Edelmann has a hump nurse who assists him (what has he got to do with the hunchback assistants in these films?), But what Dracula is really interested in is his other, nicer assistant. At this point, Larry "Wolf Man" Talbot returns (again, no explanation provided) and seems to be looking for the same doctor for a cure for his lycanthropy. And then it happens to fall into a cave where plants can be grown to help him, which even by chance contains the monster of Frankenstein. Dear God, when it ends ... of course, the other sequel to the Universal monster was stupid, but this is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Good things first. There are some fantastic settings and the effects of the vampire are slightly better than usual. Some of the other effects are also fairly accurate. John Carradine is not as bad as Dracula, once you get used to him, but still nothing as ingenious as Lugosi. In my opinion, Onslow Stevens plays a much better vampire in this film, even though he has exactly the opposite problem with Carradine - all the creepiness and none of the class. None of the performances is so beautiful, but it is more due to the atrocious script than to anything else - the female parts are written in a particularly bad way. But no matter how stupid, it remains reasonably fun for the most part. The best thing is that it is short. <br /> <br /> Now the bad things ... they are not disturbing, they are badly written and do not work. I was hoping that the three monsters would start a sort of supernatural struggle for power, but they don't. The focus is almost entirely on Dracula, who is not particularly well represented. On the other hand, this is the only film in which Dracula infects another man, but it is done through a blood transfusion rather than a bite since Universal was always uncomfortable with the possible homosexual subtext. Larry Talbot is decent as always as the Wolf Man, but plays a relatively small part. Once again the part of Frankenstein's monster is reduced to moments of anti-climatic closure. For God's sake, Glenn Strange was as fantastic as the creature! Why not give him more screen time? It is a pity that the series ended on this note (not counting the classic comedy "Abbott & Costello Incontra Frankenstein"). In the end it was only flamed in the sunlight and died, just like Dracula himself.
