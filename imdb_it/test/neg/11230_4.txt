Ken Russell directed this strange (not long) erotic thriller and if I hadn't known I'd bet on my life that the director was Brian DePalma. Absolutely everything about CRIMES OF PASSION screams DePalma, from the showy cinematography that is turned on a little too lively, to the domestic plot that turns into a plot of stalk and slash, up to the title this too screams "Depalma, DePalma, Depalma" /> <br /> Unfortunately since Brian DePalma is increasingly seen as a poor Hitchcock over the years, Russell should have tried to emulate his own style. Surely an erotic thriller in the style of TOMMY or BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN would have been bizarre with a capital B, but at least it would have been a unique cinematic experience. The stories of prostitutes living a dangerous double life and being persecuted by a religious maniac were a sight all too common in the video market of the 1980s. Oh and Anthony Perkins plays the same role he played in almost every movie he did in the 1980s. Yawn <br /> <br /> The only thing of any real CRIMES OF PASSION note is the controversy it caused. I guess the studio was the happiest person to hear this since no publicity is bad publicity, but as for the controversial sex scenes ... What scenes of controversial sex? There are none and the only controversy I can think of is of China Blue dominating a policeman on guard with a truncheon. Needless to say, he did not come silent. HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
