I looked at "Gristle" mainly because of the presence of Michael Dorn, as I liked his portrait of Worf on Star Trek TNG, but I had never seen him out of his makeup. Dorn seems to have a nice presence and probably has the potential for a profitable acting career. This film, however, gave him a little dramatic challenge, except to show that he can, in fact, use the word "F". <br /> <br /> It seems that this film was made by someone who imagined himself as a thinking attacker with a social conscience. Yes, for 1965. Today the themes are so ambiguous and sophisticated that even the horrible "Bamboozled" by Spike Lee seems in comparison. <br /> <br /> This criminal-caper film has a complicated maze of double -, triple- and quadruple-crosses, but the plot pattern is so convoluted that it collapses on itself within the first 30 minutes. Mostly, after that point, I simply looked out of the momentum and a slight curiosity about how each scene would unfold. There's a big cast here - you'll recognize virtually everyone as an actor in much better movie characters. Why are they all in this? I suspect it was 1) Work, and some money, albeit modest. 2) Maybe the director knows all of these actors from acting classes and social bonds around Los Angeles --- you know, maybe they participated to support him, like a guy in trouble in the third and fourth level of the Hollywood scene. Boh ... but the film was half cooked --- not really "finished". I gave a 3, although my affection for the actors involved has not diminished by my admiration for their previous work. We hope that everyone has moved on to more professional projects, more carefully realized and deepened since then.
