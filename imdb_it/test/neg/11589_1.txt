Writer and director Jay Andrews, aka Jim Wynorski, offers more than his signature shlock with a decent cast threatened by computer-grade reptiles in "Komodo Vs. Cobra", as a steal of "Mysterious Island" meets " Jurassic Park "as you can imagine. The main problem with this predictable yarn on the eating of monsters is the incredibly fake special effects. The cobra and the Komodo are hilarious. However, graphic people do a good job of integrating monsters with their victims, not that this is in any way credible. Clearly, "Komodo Vs. Cobra" had such a low budget that practically everything that was not human in its appearance was as false as everything that comes out of it. This epic cheese monster takes place on a remote island where the US military conducts top-secret DNA tests on animals. The result is that gigantic Komodos and cobras thrive in this paradise of tropical islands. When the action opens, the primary scientist is swallowed by a cobra that loves to swim. Later, we are presented with a group of "Greenpeace" as environmental protesters and a journalist. Planet One organizer Jerry Ryan ("Hellbent" Ryan McTavish) pays sheriff Jim Stoddard (Michael Pare of "CBS-TV" Houston Knights) five big with the promise of five more if he takes them to this forbidden island . Meanwhile, the US military suspects that something is not going well on the island, so they send their team of men to feed the supersized predators. Our heroes meet the last scientist left on the island, Dr. Susan Richardson (Michelle Borth of "Wonderland"), the daughter of the scientist responsible for this mad scientific project, who tells them that the army is about to hit the island for destruction. The meeting of the title between the two invaded predators occurs in the last quarter of an hour after our heroes, who were constantly shot down by monsters, find a helicopter and take off in time before the military pulverizes the island. There is no tension, no suspense, or anything worthwhile in this substandard feature of creatures. The best thing about this yawn is the orchestral soundtrack by composer Chuck Cirino; gives "Komodo Vs. Cobra" an epic air. Usually, Jay Andrews writes and directs a tolerable drivel, but this is far below its low standards. Sexy women are better at surviving than boys. In one scene, our heroic group earns a river and we don't see any more wet T-shirts. Damn! There is nothing in terms of dialogue or memorable relationships in this dreck. I think the military does too well when putting their heads together to conspire. We hope that Michael Pare got a good payday from this junk. The ending in which one of the scientists assumes the characteristics of a lizard comes strictly as an afterthought. It's not so bad it's good, it's just bad.
