The Earth was destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. Well, parts of the Earth, because somewhere in Italy, a band of purebred survivors - those without radioactive contamination - are holed up in a massive villa surrounded by lush grounds, waiting for the next opportunity to hunt those with polluted blood. The Final Executioner is the story of one of their alleged victims, Alan (William Mang, who looks, not surprisingly, very similar to Kurt Russell), and his efforts to bring down the legally sanctioned hunters who are led by Edra (Marina Costa ) and Erasmus (Harrison Muller Jr.). Alan was trained to kill former NYPD policeman Sam (Woody Strode), who mostly wanders giving his pupil moral support and mooching for canned meat. Strode is by far the best thing about the movie, even if it doesn't look good at all and only appears for about a third of the running time. As for the story, it is a fusion of elements drawn from films and better stories, including Ten Little Indians, The Most Dangerous Game and Escape From New York. The final executioner moves at a fair pace and offers reasonable entertainment for less discriminated fans.
