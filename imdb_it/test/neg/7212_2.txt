Well, let's be honest. Following a cult classic like Road House is not an easy task. Now subtract Swayze from the equation and get a monumental task. So, with Patrick not on board who had the head of bones to proceed anyway and make this piece of garbage? I'm going to blame the director who didn't even provide 5 minutes of decent footage during the whole movie. I was shocked that Will Patton (Armaggedon) would come aboard. Johnathon Schaech did a good job with the lead role, but the writing was atrocious. Lowering his ugly brown bomb (Crystal Mantecon) in the first 5 minutes of the film made me want to expel him right there. But I got stuck with the film hoping to catch a glimpse of that great cheese humor that worked so well with Double Duece. Not much luck. The DVD's cover is hilarious, show these two stacked blondes making a 10-second appearance in the film. Costar Ellen Hollman also performs decently. But again the effort is useless in a piece of garbage and dishonor like this. Has Jake Busey ever been chosen for a decent movie? Couldn't they attract at least a couple of actors from the first film for some sort of nostalgic treatment? Even one of the old bouncers or two, or Jeff Healey, would have been nice for a performance. Immediately take this movie out of your queue. -LostFlix
