I was a fan of the film AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON and so I was curious to know if a sequel of 16 years later could have been performed with the French language and the local re-cast, the supporting characters and minors. Tonight I saw the version "edited for the FOX network" which was a kind of curious hybrid of several hyperactive sequels. The writers and directors pay tribute to some of the key concepts of the plot: the tourist takes the bite of the wolf, the full moon comes out, the boy meets the girl, the boy becomes a beast, the boy dies of heroic death after the help of a ghost victim. For me, the strangest aspect of this special teen-horror "formula" effect-ride was the casting of the school's teacher - the love interest of the TV comedy "ED" as one of the most secret victims of the werewolf which is more or less totally unpleasant in the written lines that they delivered. I have not seen another horror film that this film is "sequelling" (a vampire fighting film called BLADE), but I imagine that some parts of the plot have to explain how werewolves (they are spoofing) are threatening the "good" pair of werewolves during a long part of the film. There is also a final conflict in a Paris metro train at the SPEED. This 1997 studio product is a strange hybrid of a film, since notable technical effects are shown for appalling purposes, but the authentic terrors of the original have been completely undermined, in my opinion. Such a strange rewrite of the legend of the werewolf and the "mythology of cinema"!?! My suggestion to those who consider it in the video store - choose a classic "top of the line" Thriller: Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO!
