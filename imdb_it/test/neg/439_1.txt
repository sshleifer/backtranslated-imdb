Well, what can we say about a "horror comedy" that presents neither horror nor comedies? There are no characters in the film, but too many plot lines - all underdeveloped and mostly superfluous. <br /> <br /> Computer-generated creatures look very bad, a bit like Disney versions of oversized rats without a tail. The living dead are the biggest rip-off apart from the title, they'll look like the dead in the Landis movie, but they're very far away. They just look like bad actors with some plastic and added bull blood. <br /> <br /> Two plot lines really showed some promises (the love story and the "company" story), but they failed miserably as the director, writers, SFX department, production and actors .
