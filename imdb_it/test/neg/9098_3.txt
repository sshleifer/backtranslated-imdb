I remember seeing a clip of this movie on HBO when I was a kid and it scared me more and more. When I found it, I looked at it. I wish I hadn't. The film was not scary. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around an old woman who runs the castle. It feeds this horribly disfigured person in the basement of a 12th century castle. She beats the poor boy every day and feeds him. Well, that day, she dies. Then, a few months later, a family moved into. A father, a mother and their blind daughter. His father was involved in a terrible car accident that killed his son and left his blind daughter. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, the daughter hears sounds, things break, etc. And everyone doesn't care about anything at all. That is until some people turn out to be dead. Apparently, the creature in the cellar has freed itself and is killing people. How this thing has survived in recent months without food or water is impossible! Every time I saw the creature, it gave me the creeps. The creature continues to revel and the police blame his father for the death. <br /> <br /> It was a pretty bad film. <br /> <br /> Give this 3 star movie to 10 Creepy not scary!
