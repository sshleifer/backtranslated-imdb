Dubbed beyond comprehension, the HBO version of Lumumba is a disastrous rendering of what looks like what was once a decent film. Some scenes simply make no sense in English and the actors bring zero energy to their vocal reading. Add the self-censorship involving Frank Carlucci, a CIA agent, and you have a film that is deprived of its drama and its power. We hope that the subtitled version will reach American TV screens at some point.
