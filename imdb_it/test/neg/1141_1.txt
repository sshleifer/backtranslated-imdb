I'm a big fan of the "Vacation" franchise and I love Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie, and at least a couple of the backstage names have been involved in this project (in particular Matty Simmons, who produced or executive produced all 4 theatrical, as well as "Animal House"). For these reasons, I thought this TV spin-off might be worth a try, even without a Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> For the record, I didn't expect it to be very good; I just thought it might be a bit of a fun diversion. Therefore, my high level of disappointment shows how bad this total asshole of a movie really was. It was shocking, with an open mouth, stopping the heart, exploding terribly. And yet, somehow, I couldn't stop looking at him. It is a disease I have; I can't go out on a movie or give up a TV show before it ends. Nothing has ever forced me to want two more hours of my life than this movie.
