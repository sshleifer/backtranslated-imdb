The film listed here as produced in 1980 is not the film available from Something Weird Video in their "Driver's Ed Scare Films Vol. 5". First, the 1980 version is in color. SWV has on this record a previous version (1972) of the film made in b & w for the WLWT television Channel 5 in Cincinnati. In both cases this film is famous. However, unlike most other driver films, this was intended for television broadcasting and viewing by the general public. So the carnage level was reduced to a minimum. It is still a rather bleak exercise in the exploitation of bleeding death for an alleged educational purpose. I live in the Cincinnati area and I remember that this thing was projected around Channel 5 every year. If you're looking for a film that shows the tone of this unique American film phenomenon, "The Last Prom" is quite typical - dark, hyperbolic , extremely didactic, heavy on melodrama. Regardless of the fact that he really influenced the leadership of a teenager, nobody knows.
