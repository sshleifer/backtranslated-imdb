I'm so glad he's not alive to see it. This film is a debauchery of his work. I agree with the other commentator - this film was a terrible disappointment. I'd give it a zero, but I'm forced to give it a 1. <br /> <br /> The story was weak, and it reminded me of the days when I was a young teenager trying to write a movie, so thinking back and realizing how horrible it was. Bad actors, family and friends and someone stupid enough to fund it was the way it was created. It's really amazing how you can pull strings to get something. If this film was able to make it known to the public, it puts great hopes on other independent filmmakers who have a talent worthy of the damned who are struggling! This movie made me laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. By all accounts, this was not meant to be a comedy. Scary movie is a better game for a horror genre - this movie sucks.
