I own a vacation lake house not far from Plainfield, Wisconsin. Ten minutes from the Gein property to be precise. I saw his land, the cemetery where he is buried and where he made his excavations, and I made purchases in the hardware store that was previously owned by the Worden family. While visiting relatives in California, we decided to rent this movie. It was disgusting. The true story of Ed Gein is so disturbing and disturbing, because the creators of this piece of junk have decided to invent their story are beyond me. The actor who plays Ed is a very big man, And he was a very small, meek and shy man. This is part of what makes his story so terrifying. He did not have a helper to dig the graves and anyone who owns land in the area knows that it is mostly sand with some dirt. You won't break much sweat digging a hole. They didn't have to hire an actor with the body of a wrestler, just do your research. And if the writing wasn't bad enough - there are NO mountains in Wisconsin, and I'm pretty sure the 911 wasn't available in 1957.
