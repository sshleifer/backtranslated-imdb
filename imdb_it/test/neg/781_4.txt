This is a flip that you can safely avoid. Cameron's childish plot and poor acting (she shouldn't really play these serious roles - they don't fit her) Also she looks very little glamor, let's watch her, she's big on Charlies Angels and she was superb in There's Something about Mary ...

Come on, professor.
