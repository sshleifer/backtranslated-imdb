What a mess - and I'm not referring to the "destruction" in the title. I could continue on the trivial plot, the bad effects, the cast (actually remarkable) that makes faces while carrying the worst lines of their careers, etc. I will only say that there were no palm trees in Chicago the last time I checked, and leave it to that. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... need ten lines to get this posted on IMDb .. OK, well, I think a DVD release with outtakes might be interesting. Perhaps Dennehy will reveal what favor was called to appear in this thing. Maybe Dianne Weist will show us the sack of money she must have taken to get her involved. Maybe CBS executives will apologize ...
