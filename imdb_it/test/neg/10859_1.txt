I would definitely not recommend it. It was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater, so I couldn't leave and watch a porn movie in part (except that they didn't take off their clothes - it was body language and certainly language). I have to say that I was embarrassed. Filming was a very low budget, no good dialogue. How disgusting. The actors regretted except the two best characters killed (?) And they were David Carradine and Dennis Hopper. He sucked at Kill Bill and that old movie with the two boys riding the dessert with their chopppers. You know what I mean. blablabla. The shots were grainy and of very low quality. There was no one in that theater who liked this movie, and the people around me were younger and tattooed.
