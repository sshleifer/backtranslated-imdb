You can only describe it with a word and this would be WOW !!! Wow, I really didn't think a piece of shit like this could ever be published. If you watch a movie called ninja, you expect to see at least some fantastic martial artists, right? However, none of these guys know any kind of martial arts and they seem to have gone to China and chosen the first people they saw on the street and trained them for a day in the martial arts, that's their skill level in the arts martial! The actors are very exaggerated, the special effects are ridiculous and there is no plot that makes sense. This is the worst martial arts film I've ever seen and I've seen many!
