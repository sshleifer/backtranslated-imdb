This film would be a great piece of history if it was actually a real movie of the Kennedy assassination. There are too many mistakes in this film for me to point out. It's a film about the Kennedy assassination, but many of the important facts have been changed. There are missing scenes, and many scenes, after the president's limousine passed the sign, do not fit. Both Kennedys move considerably slower than the other four people in front of them. The next time you watch this movie, look for things that don't add up, like the Texas Gov. and his, along with the men of the SS in the front, launched forward but you can see that the limousine does not stop or slow down, in fact it is accelerating. This film is clearly an attempt to cover up.
