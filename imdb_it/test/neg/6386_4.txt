I went to this movie expecting / hoping for a seedy seventies-style piece of exploitation, but what I got was more than a bizarre pseudo-western with too many rumors and not enough action. It is clear that this film was made on a limited budget; the settings are dull and hardly affected, while the acting leaves much to be desired. The plot focuses on a trio of robbers (a father and two sons) who steal a load of gold after killing some miners. They come across a hut inhabited by a young girl and her stepmother ... and all this is told in flashback by the girl, who currently resides in an asylum. It is clear that the directors Louis Leahman and William Sachs thought they were doing something really shocking; but despite his best efforts, South of Hell Mountain is too boring to shock the viewer. The film lasts for about eighty minutes and most of it is made up of boring characters that arise from boring and verbose dialogue. The only good thing I have to say about the film is about music; which is good in places. The ending is the only other positive thing in the film; and that's just because it's the last thing that happens. I would not advise anyone to worry about tracking down this ... there was a lot more garbage made in the seventies.
