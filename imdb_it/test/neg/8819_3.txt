This first film by director Bob Clark ("Porky's", "Black Christmas", "A Christmas Story") didn't really excite me as I expected. In fact, it annoyed me. It is a theatrical company that sails towards a funerary island, composed of dead criminals, where they plan to evoke some evil forces and resurrect some corpses ... The leader of their group, a presumed enthusiast of black magic and possible homosexual , he tries to evoke the help of Satan for the resuscitation of a resurrected body, which fails so that they bring the corpse to the nearby house of the abandoned keeper and play with him ... Nothing interesting happens until the last fifteen minutes or so when the undead finally jump from their graves and go after the collapse. The effects of make-up are ok, the gore is VERY minimal (PG rating), and the extremely irritating characters are focused on a lot, which really made me nervous. I imagine that having a bunch of terrible actors fighting for an hour should have matched the status of "comedian", but I found no humor in it, anything. The whole concept is simply ridiculous - how these children are willing to dig and mimic with a corpse for as long as they have done. The characters are stereotyped and insipid and the film is simply boring ... Don't waste your time with it ...
