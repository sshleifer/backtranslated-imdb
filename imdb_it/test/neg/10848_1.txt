don't buy this movie for the value of the comedy like I did, I didn't find it a bit funny, but so f *** miserable and lame is incredible. I gave it to a friend for Christmas which was a lot of fun (on my side) I recently heard that he looked at it and told me what I am a ** Ehole! <br /> <br /> There is nothing more frustrating than looking at a scene that is too bright, too dramatic and badly marked where the camera is sitting on a tripod and does not move ... work on the film it's really pathetic, and I can only say DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE !!!! !!!!!!!
