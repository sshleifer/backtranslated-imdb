All the pro comments on this film claim that the film is balanced. This is their main justification for giving the film a high rate. But a film is not balanced when the main author analyzed is given the last world in every single subject. The director herself admitted it to the first San Francisco film festival. He justified himself by saying that he could not waste the possibility of having access to Fujimori. It may be true, but showing so much Fujimori's vision of the problems makes the film clearly pro-Fujimori and unbalanced. I challenge anyone of the other commentators to prove this mistake. Suggestions 1: affirming that Harvard professors, intellectuals and Latin American diplomats agree with you does not help your argument (use logic). Tip 2: disagreeing with the director doesn't even help your argument (the director says he thinks Fujimori is charismatic and patriotic and therefore interprets him that way)
