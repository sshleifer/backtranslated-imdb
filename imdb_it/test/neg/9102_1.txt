My friends and I rented this movie for another on a skateboard. Watching Steve Guttenberg as an action hero is fun. The film is so incredibly predictable and over the top that it ended up being a party of laughter. Even if I gave a 1/10 this film should be seen especially if you can capture it on TV anywhere.
