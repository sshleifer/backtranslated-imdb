I'm a fan of good, plausible, action movies. And I'm a big fan of elite military units like the Navy SEALs. Finally, I'm a big fan of Michael Biehn. Unfortunately none of these allowed me to really enjoy this movie at the time. I gave another chance more recently when I bought the DVD. Here are the problems with this film in a quick list: 1. It is a poor man's gun, for example by including a virtual music video of the SEAL team that plays golf with a soundtrack of "The boys are back in town", which is concludes with Charlie Sheen makes a chase to get his towed car back. <br /> <br /> 2. This is simply a Charlie Sheen film, when Sheen was trying to become famous before starting to do things like Hot Shots. The reports I heard indicate that Sheen was a child on the set and influenced the roles and direction that the rest of the actors in the film got. <br /> <br /> 3. Biehn is the head of the SEAL team, but Sheen rarely obeys him. Any SEAL that shows the lack of discipline of the character of Sheen, or that has endangered the team like he does, would not even have gone through a BUDS training, let alone obtained on a team. <br /> <br /> 4. The SEALs are cross-trained on weapons. However, in one part of the film, a SEAL must "understand" how to use a US missile Stinger missile. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes in the film. The initial assault voice, Bill Paxton as "God", and some of the footage in what was to be Beirut at the time. Overall, however, this film is a loser.
