Alien assholes in the desert. Small blue rocks that look like cheap plastic. The general plot is not bad if you like that sort of thing, but acting is so beyond the poor that it amazes me that some of them actually enjoyed me in The X Files! And the special effects? Hello?! Where did they get their FX, Secondary School crew? I mean, come on; there was much more they could have done! He was amateur and extremely simple. I didn't particularly like it (and my father fell asleep during this!) And of course our hero falls in love with the main character! It is so typical and highly predictable. Bleugh !!!!!
