Do not get me wrong. I love the "martial arts arena genre" and am increasingly surprised at how many movies like this are out there. This is one of those, and it's not even close to being one of the best. With Mathias Hues, I thought it would be nice. However, he cannot save this film and, to tell the truth, he was not as good. Just don't pay attention to what others say; The fight scenes in this movie are NOT good at all. I really know what I'm talking about, since I've seen so many movies like this. There are also a lot of scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot. I guess they just added them to make the movie last a little longer, as well as manifesting the bad like, uuuuuuh ....... bad (as we didn't already know).
