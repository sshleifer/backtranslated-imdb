WAIT until you have watched most of the other films ever published, wait a year, then watch it when you're ready for something with such low production values ​​that it won't challenge anyone's imagination. <br /> <br /> I agree that anyone who has rated this film as a ten-star production must do it to distort the data. Something higher than 8 would be strange. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see the very young Sandy Bullock with her sinuous hair for the brief period in which she was described, even if she exaggerated with the New York accent but sometimes with her southern (Virginia and NC ) the accent has penetrated. Ancient history for this established actress who has grown so much from this film. <br /> <br /> The DVD I rented had two bonus features, a mini-bio section that only contained Sandra's biography from IMDb. Also had a quiz about the quizzes as a bonus - 3 questions. I hope you did them well!
