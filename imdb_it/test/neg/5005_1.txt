Ugh. Yes, it's exactly like the chaos of McMartin, or the horrible arrests of Wenatchee in Washington. In the film, the mother continues to interrogate her child aggressively, again and again and again, until he finally tells her what she obviously wants to hear. Court investigators and "therapists" repeat the scheme. The interrogation itself is sexually creepy, a relentless repeated assault in its own way. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers introduce a doctor who talks about physical evidence of abuse, perhaps to justify the point of view of the film: that two: four-year-old children never do "things like this". Well, they will do it if every adult they know asks them. The way this piece supports such discredited interrogation techniques makes the vision of an exercise in frustration for anyone who knows what it takes to achieve real life success. <br /> <br /> (They also add a special stop at the end to "prove" their case - not parallel to this fictitious incident ever in real life. I can't say more here without turning it into a spoiler, but you'll know it when you see it.) <br /> <br /> Yes, children are abused, sometimes by paid care providers. But watching a movie that claims ridiculous and hysterical accusations against so many totally innocent people, looking at the re-creations of the trials that ruined the lives of countless children and the lives of the defendants - I didn't think it would last until the end the apparent approval by the writing team of abusive, paranoid, obsessive interrogation techniques that started - what can we call it? The beacon of common sense? <br /> <br /> None of the people I know have ever been accused of child abuse, thank goodness, but my grandmother, 12 times older, has been accused of witchcraft and killed for it. The cops full of what they think is holy anger are just as dangerous now as three hundred years ago. A sensational feeling like this - "These accusations of satanic abuse are popping up all over the country, there must be something there!" "Tell the jury!" - shoot them only. <br /> <br /> And who thought it was a good idea to have children under ten, some under the age of five, play these roles? It is traumatic to watch them utter their lines; how much more traumatic was it to act in these parts? The commitment of filmmakers to apparently combat child abuse does not apply to themselves. And what were the parents of the child actors THINK? "Melinda" (uncredited, at least in the version on the A & E network in 2005, but I think it was Cassy Friel) and "Teddy" (Brian Bonsall) were fantastic. Professionals or not, however, were too young to be exposed to this material, and much less to be paid to implement it. Despite the ruthless exploitation of these children in real life, "Do You Know The Muffin Man" got an Emmy nomination for directing, which shows that things were crazy in 1989.
