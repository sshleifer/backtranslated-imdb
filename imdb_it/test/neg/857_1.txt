Even those of us who like pictures of cute animals - and I hate them - it would be difficult to find merit in this abysmally ugly parody of a movie. Perhaps inspired by the "101 Dalmatians" with his intelligent and loyal dogs, his stupid and devious humans and his absurdly "happy" and predictable ending, the alternative title "101 Turkeys" comes to mind. This would affect all those involved in his unfortunate production. I dismissed it as a perversion of Hollywood for the British customs before learning, to my horror, that it is actually a Canadian film, made in Victoria BC, that fake British city theme park, while sucking dollars from Ottawa ON , which is an equally fake hole of Canadian mediocrity. Let me count the ways it is bad. The dizzying plot? The donkey script? The dismal performance and sophomoric direction? The sickly animals? The endless clich√©s and the predictable disgust? Come to think of it, neither I nor those who browse the IMDb have time for a complete catalog of its flaws. Yet if I had to detail his merits, this space would remain empty. Trust me, it's bad; a monumental sign in the vast pantheon of truly terrible cinema (Canadian). If you've already seen it, condolences. If you haven't, stay away from it as you would with SARS or bubonic plague. Or other films with cute animals. Do not allow even your children to see it, for fear that their tiny minds will be deformed by even smaller minds than those who finance, manufacture and film this frightening madness. Perhaps tonight, when I retire, I will have a nightmare with fearsome beasts sprouting from the bedside table while I escape on the frantic escape. I hope. It will be a far better thing than watching this beastly banal boondoggle. But then, I could dream of having to see him a second time and the pure terror and the cold sweat of this makes me want to stay up all night, trembling at the very possibility of seeing him again as a bad dream. I could also find something useful to look at in its place. Maybe "Godzilla" or "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes" Maybe the instruction video for my built-in vacuum cleaner.
