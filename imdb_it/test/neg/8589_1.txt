I've never seen a movie more unrealistic than this horrible piece of dung. The acting was exaggerated. The management was tacky and amateur. The script was just a joke. The story seemed to be written by a person who has never been around for a high school football game, much less a professional game. And why, why did Oliver Stone feel the need to put himself in this film as an actor? It was terrible, interpreting the most unrealistic announcer ever. He could not even be hired to do professional wrestling competitions. Then you have Jamie Foxx, who throws like a girl. But he's a little more athletic than Elder Dennis Quaid. Seriously, Stone wanted to direct this film at 16-year-old males with ADD. That's why we listen to loud music, fast cuts and numerous changes. It just became a bad MTV video. Too bad for Al Pacino for doing this shit. Cameron Diaz? Hell, that non-talent takes on a role that comes down from the pike. When Lawrence Taylor is the best "actor" you have, well, your movie sucks! And this does it.
