A forgettable pilot who never really explains why Nostradamus is really important for the plot of this film, but Rob Estes plays an avid cop who for some reason is Nostradamus and who fights medieval monks who travel through time and run with fire guns to start 'apocalypse. Oh yeah, there's also a sexy FBI agent who seems to be a pessico and is trying to convince Rob to believe everything before it's too late. Too bad they could not foresee a better plot. Yawn. <br /> <br />
