First of all, I would like to say that I really enjoyed this movie. However, having said that, I can't say it was a "good" movie. I went to the theater with rather low expectations (something I learned to do). I'm glad I did, because the plot and development were not stellar. The jokes were low-level humor. But, I was in the right mindset to enjoy them. <br /> <br /> I was not the only one. In fact, the whole theater was laughing out loud. I didn't hear anyone complaining after the film ended. I even saw a boy fall from his chair laughing! But again, I have to warn you, Grandma's Boy is NOT a high quality movie. It's a funny movie (albeit low), and if you go with the right mindset, you'll really like it. Oh, and don't bring the kids to it.
