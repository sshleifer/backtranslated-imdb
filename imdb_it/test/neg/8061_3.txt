One of the most famous "Video Nasties" of the 80s is also one of the most excessively exaggerated. "Making them die slowly" is about what you would expect from a master of jungle directed by Umberto Lenzi, inventive (but poorly reduced) native techniques of torture, some ridiculous "social commentary" (yes, even more foolish than "Cannibal Holocaust") and many guts are chewed. The exploitative violence of the film, however, is often shown only in the short term, and has never lingered long, which diminishes its effect (interpreting what is possible). The dialogue is the usual nonsense of Lenzi, since our male heroes show their affection for women by calling them "tw @ t" and the like. The cast of familiar faces (including Lorraine De Selle, Giovanni Lombardo Radice, Zora Kerowa and Robert Kerman) do their best in the face of the escalation of idiocy (including an absolutely ridiculous "preservation of castration"), but cannot save this overload, disgusting effort.
