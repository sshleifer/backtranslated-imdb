The concept of this film was pretty good. But somehow the execution failed in many parts. There are not many horror films that I can think of those used dolls that seemed so realistic. Especially when these dolls start blinking or moving hands. So much could have been done with this premise. There were many scenes where there was room for tension and suspense. And I really expected scary things to happen. But the film never managed to scare. One of the main reasons is that the plot is too minimal and predictable. Actually I thought I had done it on purpose to surprise us with a wonderful turn. Unfortunately this does not happen. Well, at least not in the way I hoped. Even the cast failed to make everything credible. It would have been nice if the characters had been given more background. In the beginning when we are introduced to the main character. It seems that she and other characters have been invited by some sort of artist. But it is also evident that they do not have an idea of ​​themselves for what they were invited. Of course this is part of the mystery. But it seems unlikely. If I receive an invitation without having the slightest idea what the agreement is, I simply wouldn't go. Furthermore, most of the characters are not really nice with the final result and never really take care of them. Another flaw is that the director deviates from the basic premise which is quite scary and brings up new elements that are never explained and are not even relevant to the "mystery of Doll Master". Overall this film was a big disappointment for me. If you want to see a good horror movie involving dolls go see "Dead Silence"!
