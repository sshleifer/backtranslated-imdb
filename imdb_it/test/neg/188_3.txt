Luscious Candace Bergen as a primitive Victorian beauty, kidnapped by Sean Connery as an evil Sheikh of the desert! How can you go wrong? Such as? Oh, let me count the ways !!! Terrestrial, primitive Sean Connery, exactly the right man to tame a fragile and classy beauty like Candace, he is. . . well, overwhelming in the role. This is because, instead of having a dialogue about real problems ("you are a woman ... I am a man!") He must make a babble of nonsense about "the will of Allah" and "the wind blows destiny through the sands of desert. "John Milius, a director known more for worshiping naked male bodies and brute force than any intuition (or interest) in conventional human relationships, has an exasperating way of cutting off his desert lovers whenever he seems to Candace may be kissed. Instead of watching nature take its course with two fabulously attractive people in a picturesque landscape, we are treated to endless (and I mean ENDLESS) shots by Brian Keith that blink his triton mermen and deliver gritty sermons about the joys of being Teddy Roosevelt . I have nothing against Teddy Roosevelt, but watching him test his new gun or talk about the heroic death of a big bear doesn't excite me just as the romance between Candace Bergen and Sean Connery would do. . . if it ever really happened! The strange thing is that Milius spends most of his time building characters and plots without resolution. Candace's two little sons in history both have more screen time than her. There is no humor, no chemistry, no sizzle in any of the things that happen in the desert. Unless you think it's funny that after weeks of riding your hair is still perfect. <br /> <br /> The only "real" moment in history is when, late at night, Candace Bergen shakes off her little daughter from a deep sleep on soft cushions and says "we have to escape". The girl turns around and, without missing a beat, replies, "but mom, I was sleeping!" That line summarizes what is really missing in history. No danger, suspense or sizzle in the basic plot, of a lady caught in captivity. She (and her children) are both so comfortable and attentive that it's hard to believe that anyone is involved in their destiny. <br /> <br /> Please, if Candace herself said the sentence could have worked better. If the tension came from her enjoyment of her imprisonment, (or her joy in being in Sean Connery's arms) and her guilt over all the problems caused by her kidnapping, then the story would have been a little tense . But Milius makes the strange assumption that the public is as agitated as he is willing to decide if Teddy Roosevelt will have the chance to prove his manhood three thousand miles away. In the end the beautiful lady and her children don't seem to care. . . and since they are at the center of the story, the whole thing seems rather dry and endless. . . like the burning sands of the desert.
