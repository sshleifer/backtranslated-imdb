While the premise of the film seemed unique and intriguing after seeing the first 5 minutes of the film, I could have stopped there and moved on with my life. She receives some comments and interesting reactions from her subjects, but not enough to add to the validity of the film. I also felt a little exaggerated with many things. If a guy said a dirty comment, he grabbed it or made a disgusting gesture, I'd say go get it, drop it, it's a pig. What bothered me was that she would go around with revealing clothes and be surprised when the boys would look at her and give them hell. <br /> <br /> I think he somehow forgot that being attracted to other people is a part of human sexuality and an important part of who we all are. Boys will look at beautiful women, especially when they dress provocatively, just as women will look at men when they wear a tight or shirtless tank. <br /> <br /> Some women might hate me for this, but I hope not. I have a lot of respect for women. I was raised by one. I also come from a Spanish family and we are very matriarchal. My grandmother had been at the center of my family for years, but I don't think this did anything to help women's rights and from what the director also said, some women were offended by her project.
