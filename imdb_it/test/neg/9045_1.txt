Umberto Lenzi hits new lows with this recycled garbage. Janet Agren plays a lady who is looking for her missing sister. It turns out that her sister is part of a Jim Jones type religious cult in New Guinea. He takes on a shabby guide interpreted by Robert Kerman to help her reach the cult complex located in the jungle. This is another (!) Cannibal movie, and I probably would have liked it if it hadn't been for Lenzi to fill this film with scenes from his superior "The Man from Deep River". I mean that every cannibal scene is raised directly from this movie, which I think makes it as credible as Al Adamson. I felt ripped off. *** SPOILER *** 1/2 star and this is for the dildo scene.
