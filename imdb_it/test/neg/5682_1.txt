First of all I have to say that I don't like them so much from fiction films! But there are some films that I really liked. This is one of the others;) I have the same opinion as some (many) others here. The film is still happening in my back, but the few effects aren't really enough to watch all the time .... I think what they did well are the animated scenarios with 3 suns and 4 moons, but it's the only one is liked. There are no intelligent dialogues (are there ???). But it's a great movie for all those who love Lara Croft or other girls in HOT-PANTS ...;) <br /> <br /> For the directors: "Just try again, PLEASE !!!"
