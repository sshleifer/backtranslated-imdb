I checked this video expecting to like it. I would like. I like foreign films, I like beautiful photography, I know that critics liked this film (including my favorite, Roger Ebert), and I don't mind "slow" movies. <br /> <br /> Well, it's beautiful. This is the best I can say for this. The plot is very thin, the shots are very long, the looks are very significant, the actors are very sincere and it looks like a very long film. I fell asleep halfway, I woke up, I rewound the tape, I tried again. It was a process, but I did it until the end. I didn't like it at all.
