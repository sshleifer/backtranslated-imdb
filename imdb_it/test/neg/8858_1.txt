If you've looked at Pulp Fiction, don't watch this movie. This movie is NOT funny This is the worst parody movie ever. This is a poor attempt at a parody movie. <br /> <br /> The cast is bad. The film is bad. This is one of the worst photos ever made. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend Plump Fiction. I prefer the original Pulp Fiction by the great Quentin Tarantino. This is one of the worst parodies ever made. <br /> <br /> Plump Fiction is not a good movie. It's not funny. It's so stupid and vulgar.
