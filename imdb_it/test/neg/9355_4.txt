Go to any movie fan and ask them that the title of the film directed by Robert Wise, directed by Yakima Canutt and Sergio Leone as second unit, was designed by Ken Adam and marked by Max Steiner, played by Sir Stanley Baker, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Brigitte Bardot, were filmed in color, viewfinder and stereo, at Cinecitt√† in 1955, with a thousand extras - and they will tell you to leave and stop being silly. <br /> <br /> I tell you this movie doesn't exist. That the names you mentioned have NEVER worked together - they weren't even contemporary. And that you've just extracted the names from a random movie publication and are trying to confuse them. <br /> <br /> At that point you can refer them to IMDb and show them the cast and crew of "Helen" Di Troia ". They will be amazed! This lesser-known epic sword-and-sandal has ALL these names and more - Niall MacGinnis, Janette Scott and good old Harry Andrews. <br /> <br /> And it is certainly an oddity: after the war, 1,000 Italian extras cost about $ 25 a day and the dramas of the toga were a cornerstone of Italian cinema. The scenes of the orgies were shot twice - one with the tops, the other without (you can guess which version Britain and America got). I think La Sophia is also an extra in this. <br /> <br /> However, the names STAGGER mind. But it's really just a coincidence. All these names were reaching the end of their careers (Canutt, Steiner) or starting them (all the others). <br /> <br /> Only Robert Wise and Niall MacGinnis were in the middle of their career. <br /> For the record, Leone was not accredited and learned his trade - Adam still had to invent the descending circle in the ceiling of the sets (a brand he would continue to put in all the first Bonds) - Baker still had to act and help produce the likes of "Zulu" and " Robbery "- and go to run a Welsh company called Harlech - then die tragically young. <br /> <br /> While Harry Andrews would go on to become one of Britain's favorite actresses - Janette Scott (Thora Hird's daughter) would never make the big moment, but who can forget her on "Day Of The Triffids" ( even if your piece was added later) for stuffing and happy ending) or "Crack In The World"? <br /> <br /> Sir Cedric was theater, but he knew how to film - and Bardot ... it was BARDOT, for gawdsake! <br /> <br /> But what were these star people doing in this old nonsensical field? Don't ask me. The two main stars were Italian without a name - Helen had a mustache and Paris was pretty - while the English were there just for support. <br /> <br /> To sum up, I think you can simply mark this as a major FLUKE. In stereo. To be honest, if I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't have believed it!
