After the opening credits on a black sheet with spots of white paint sprayed on it, oh OK I will be generous and I will call it a star field, we witness an alien spaceship crashing into a meteorite and forced to land on the earth. A terrible model spacecraft lands on a terrible model field. Three campers nearby investigate. From the burning spaceship, a strange-looking reptile, the "Nightbeast" emerges, OK, so I lied that it was a disreputable boy in a rubber monster mask and a silver space suit. Campers are quickly killed by the Nighbeast laser gun, which fires terrible special effects at people. Sheriff Jack Cinder (Tom Griffith) is informed. He alerts his deputy Lisa Kent (Karin Kardian) and brings together a band of men to investigate. Meanwhile, Nightbeast killed an unfortunate driver who stopped on the side of the road for a loss. His two annoying children seek help. They approach a house, two young men kiss, the girl says "someone runs towards the house". The guy gets up to take a look and is attacked and gutted by the Nightbeast, he also kills the girl. So he manages to kill the two kids with his laser, maybe the Nightbeast isn't all that bad after all. Once the sheriff and his men arrive on the scene they have a laser / gun battle with the Night of Hell. After perhaps the most ruthless gunfight in film history, only the sheriff, his deputy and a local man Jamie Lambert (Jamie Zemarel) survive. But the Nightbeast is still alive, the bullets seem to have no effect on it. The next day the sheriff visits the city's mayor, Bert Wicker (Richard Dyszel) and his girlfriend Mary Jane (Eleanor Herman) to get permission to evacuate everyone to town. He refuses to say that a party he is organizing for the Governor (Richard Ruxton) cannot be canceled, and that he does not want to create a panic situation. The sheriff evacuates the city anyway. Two doctors, Steven Price (George Stover) and Ruth Sherman (Anne Firth) are attacked by the Nightbeast before they can leave. However, they manage to scare the Nightbeast and survive. Together with the sheriff, his deputy and Jamie decide to stay behind and fight the alien. Written and directed by Don Dohler, this must be an amateur film, made with family and friends, watch the credits and see how many Dohlers are involved. For this reason I should probably cut it a little, but that doesn't stop it, or excuse it from being a terribly scary movie in every department. It has no history or purpose, things just happen to waste time, what's with Drago (Don Leifert) strangling his ex-girlfriend Suzie (Monica Neff)? This and many other scenes add nothing to the film. Isn't the script logical either, because the Nightbeast roams around the city once it is supposedly evacuated? The special effects are incredibly bad, just look at the effect when Nightbeast shoots someone with its laser, a computer effect that a spectrum of the 80s would be ashamed of. There is not much blood or blood in it, a torn stomach, a severed arm and a beheading, but they all seem predictably poor. The credit to which it is owed, the same Nightbeast is fine for the most part. There is a sex scene between the sheriff and his deputy that must be seen to be believed, music that even a porno would be embarrassed and two really ugly people make this sequence difficult to watch. Less than stellar acting, photography, music, lighting and editing make it a real task to sit on. And the worst thing about this movie? Commit the mortal sin of being boring and it's not funny at all. I'm sorry, friend, but don't give up on your day job! Definitely one to avoid.
