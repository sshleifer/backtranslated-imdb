I'll keep it at bullet points, so here's it: 1. Very badly scripted. 2. Try to be like Resident Evil. 3. Slow and docile zombies one minute after another. Mad lunatics. 4. Never seen blood clean up so easily! 5. The special effects are not as good as the "day of the living dead". 6. Acting is not as good as "Bold and beautiful". 7. It appears to have been written in 1 week and made the following week. <br /> <br /> The Basicaly Med team and the Special Forces enter a zombie infested university to find the first Zombie and extract a serum to cure the plague. Everyone dies except the 2 main stars so predictable, even if unarmed and teeming with hundreds of surviving zombies. However, the special forces (who had been trained in kindergarten scouts) took only 1 zombie to kill them, even though they had weapons. Even the obligatory tear at hand to fill any gaps. Global garbage load.
