directed by Albert Pyun in his inimitably horrible but strangely hypnotic style, "crazy six" is yet another jewel in the crown of this decade's hugo haas (jess franco?). "Elegant" overdirection, incoherent textures, time-outs in the middle of action sequences for eurodisco torch performances, all these seem to mean traits for our man Pyun. The most interesting is the way he always gets the best b-movie casts, compared to Wynorski or other video directors. Ice-T, Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, and the strange Burt Reynolds is not a bad cast, although they often seem a little confused. Check out "Postmortem", "Mean Guns" and "Omega Doom" for more upscale Pyun mayhem!
