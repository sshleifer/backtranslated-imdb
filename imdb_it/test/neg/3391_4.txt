Some of the greatest and most loved horror films have a wicked sense of humor, but when a film arrives that is not as original as the "classics", but merely does it for a laugh, then a lot to be critical completely discarded. This film made me laugh out loud, this is a testament to the way this film has been approached and shows. The two main conductors seem natural and credible together and this really helps this film. You cheer for them all the time and laugh with them, everyone has friends like both. Another highlight for me was the monster truck, it's fantastic, intimidating and really well shot. Taking inspiration (completely stealing) from a lot of movies, the most obvious is Duel, Jeepers Creepers and probably referring to co-star Jack Black, Orange County. But in reality you can choose any movie that went wrong and find a reference here. But then, he is not trying to win the Oscars, just give the viewer a good dose of fright and laughter and on that score is a 10! Obviously he is not getting a 10, I provide reviews and really sensible scores unlike 99% of people on IMDb. There is no way this film can reach zero like so many lazy idiots give to too many movies and fun as it wasn't even a 10. It's just a funny movie for anyone with a sense of humor and a taste for frights. You can't really become simpler than that.
