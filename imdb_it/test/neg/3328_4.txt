I mean, I liked this movie, I really know it, but when it comes down to it it was too boring. It starts to look promising, and even when they enter the mines the eerie atmosphere and the mood are fantastic. The problem is the monster, or the lack of it. As people have said it is a stop-motion monster, but that's not the problem (stop-motion can look beautiful when done correctly). The problem is that we don't see enough of it and we don't see deaths. This should be a horror movie, so the lack of monsters and the lack of deaths equals boredom. There were some scenes I liked, like when a girl uses her camera in the dark and the monster comes towards her. There are also some disturbing scenes but they are too few to keep your interest and certainly not worth watching the movie. It's a shame, because I can see that if it was handled correctly it would have been a really terrifying bad horror movie. The saddest thing is that films like this will never be made again, because film producers downplay their films these days and rely on poor CGI effects.
