This is a new approach to comedy. It's not funny. <br /> <br /> The joke is that this, in itself, should be fun. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a French story, located in Paris, and the characters have French names. Louis Aubinard, for example ... played by ... Bob Hoskins? The film also features the equally French Jeff Goldblum and Natasha Richardson. The situations are similar and the characters behave as if in those Carry-On movies of previous years. <br /> <br /> I think these are also jokes - to cast these actors who make no attempt to behave in French in any way, to make them cavernar like a great comedy in the English ballroom, and to leave the whole unexplainable mystery to the public. <br /> <br /> In the humor department, this is practically the Algonquin round table, isn't it? <br /> <br /> The film tries to be charming and bizarre, and I think these features are quite fun. Not as fun as Duck Soup or Love and Death, maybe, but more fun than The Deer Hunter or The Battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> It is an example of personal filmmaking. It makes no real effort to reach and share with the public, but remains true to its premise and its internal logic. Although all situations are incredible, they are logical within the bizarre world of the film. <br /> <br /> Generally I like this kind of eccentric film, but I found this rhythm too slow, to be dull, boring, and to provide few pleasant surprises or genuine spirit. It's just kind of meandering in predictable and sophomoric ways, and wasting some wonderful talents along the way. It must be the lowest point in the career of each of the major stars, who are all different players. I found the biggest waste of talent from The Betsy, and I wish I'd never seen Goldblum and Hoskins in this thing. <br /> <br /> So call it an interesting miss, and pass it as a rental unless you really have a lot of time to kill. <br /> <br />
