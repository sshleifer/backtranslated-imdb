Why did I buy this movie on DVD? Well, the short answer would be: I really don't know. As for the longer version, I am largely convinced that I really like Tatyana Ali and plays Alicia in this. <br /> <br /> Now Tatyana Ali really makes a positive effort in this movie? I must say he is one of the best, and he is proving to be a pretty decent actress. I look forward to seeing it in action when better material is available. <br /> <br /> That said, this film was terrible - and my score is given based on this: 1 star for not being the worst movie I saw, 1 star for the performance of Tatyana Ali and 1 star for not thinking he deserved only 2 stars, there are worse films for this. <br /> <br /> Ja Rule should stick to rapping, he is not my favorite rapper to say the least, but some seem to like him - and if he is there, I would be glad not to see him contaminate the acting scene. <br /> <br /> Ving Rhames: Ah friend, Marcello Wallace, what are you doing here? Just because Michael Caine is a fiercely brilliant actor, who has been in so many terrible and good films, it is not necessary to copy Ving. <br /> <br /> The rest of the seeds big names in the cast: Okay, there are bills to pay, and we all have to do things we are not proud of from time to time. <br /> <br /> The movie itself. It's so badly flawed, it's pretty hard to know where to start. It's more like a bunch of scenes put together, just as the director said "we have to say it and we have to say it". There is a story, unfortunately there is nothing surprising or inside it. To say the least, the story changes in the story were too obvious and it was therefore predictable what would have happened at any time. <br /> <br /> To summarize in one word: Reallynotgood
