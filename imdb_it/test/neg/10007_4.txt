"Tokyo Eyes" tells of a 17-year-old Japanese girl who falls in love with a man chased by her big brother who is a policeman. This lame blow is about 50% filler and 50% speaks, talks and talks more. You'll see less than a stellar cast of three talking on the bus, talking and playing video games, talking and cutting their hair, talking and walking, walking and talking, talking on a cell phone, talking and talking, etc. while reading subtitles waiting for something to happen. The thin thread of a story is not enough to sustain a film with a low production value, a scarce cast, and no action, no novel, no sex or nudity, no heavy drama ... only incessant yadayadayada'ing.
