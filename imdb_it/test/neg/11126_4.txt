A cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a Caribbean island. To bring him back to civilization he makes his way into the loading bay of a large luxury cruise ship with the buffa and I think the script produced disastrous results. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the only thing I don't like about this movie ... The monster really looked like a guy in a rubber suit. The CGI scenes looked like a different movie. Ok this has taken away my chest, now, on all the funny pieces of this movie B. <br /> <br /> The best thing was John Rhys-Davies (his daughter was the second for the eyes). John was intermittently funny, sweet and no matter what the writers told him, he said it well. A good job given what he had to work with. The Cyptozoologist was exaggerated and fun to watch too, he had fun parts. The marines were all OK and they make good cannon fodder for the monster as did some of the crew and guests. There are some pretty funny lines in this movie, and a very funny storyline involving a thief. <br /> <br /> The special effects are generally low and I swear that they reused the same jet of blood on the wall scene in about four different parts of the film. I liked the blood of the man without legs. Really, since this film wasn't scary at all, I feel a little more gore than it would have gone on improving the ability to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all if you like B monsters, it's worth a visit.
