Some scientific people descend into a cave for some reason and there is a kind of creature that is killing them. <br /> <br /> I usually give a more detailed plot, but I wasn't paying too much attention to this. Overall, it was boring and the only time you pay attention to it is during the action scenes, which the director did wonderfully. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, but the characters are so boring and forgettable they blend into your mind. You will forget who lived and who died for two reasons: 1. The killings are boring 2. The characters are boring. <br /> <br /> The ending could shock me more if I knew who it was. <Br /> <br /> So you're looking for a cave creature movie? Check The Descent instead.
