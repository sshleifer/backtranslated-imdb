I saw this movie when it came out and I hated it. I saw him again 27 years later. Actually I liked it a little ... even though Robin Williams was totally wrong about the role ... What I remember hating the movie is that it was almost the exact opposite of what I had understood by reading the book. Since I have not reread it, I can only give you my impressions from the past - but I am sure of one thing - the film is a paean of family life, while in the book, almost ALL traditional institutions - including, and perhaps, in particular, marriage - they prove to be jackets of strength of which we would free ourselves. The only positive in the book is the wonderful nature of children ... something that only the beginning and the end of the film really captures (with that incredibly beautiful baby floating in the air. Too bad Williams doesn't have a tenth of his charms !) My low vote is therefore from the fact that the film misrepresents the book. Like a movie alone, it's better - but only for some key performances. Mary Beth Hurt is wonderful - I think anyone who looks at her would fall in love with her. And John Lithgow as a former football player who has had a sex change operation is fantastic ... he never camped out or made the character anything but commendable - and as such his performance was unbelievable integrity. I watched him closely during all his scenes, and never once was anything but a woman. Nothing in his performance has ever come close to showing a drag queen ... and that made the difference. In fact, of all the people in the film, his is the only one who is beyond reproach. It is worth seeing this film only for its interpretation.
