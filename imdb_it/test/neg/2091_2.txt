This shipwreck begins with Brujo and Alma crossing the Mexican border. Alma suffers from a terrible curse that causes her to vomit garden snakes and Nickelodeon Gac every few minutes, as well as grit her teeth and mutter nonsense. So apparently Alma has this uncle in Los Angeles who knows about a cure for her. They jump on a train to get there and luckily their friend pays their way. Alma and Brujo remain in the luggage cart for the entire film as they cannot afford the upper class seats. Meanwhile, in the upper class, we see a group of nonentities traveling to LA for whatever reason. A bald guy on a business trip, two girls, one of whom carries $ 5 dollars and a handful of cocaine, three stoners and some Mexicans. The Mexicans do the ugly with Brujo and try to take his "herb" which is apparently a sedative for Alma's snakes crawling inside her. They realize that snakes do not attack, they enter your body through your veins! Very twisted and B-Movie. Brujo saves the boy ripping his heart out (Temple Of Doom style) and procuring the snake. For some reason, it can't hurt snakes or hurt Alma. While this is happening, a narcotics expert tries to smash one of the girls and gets a small (topless) action in exchange for not saying about his drug shipment. A mysterious boy shows up and has a firefight with him. As a grand finale, Alma turns into a vampire, bites his man and then becomes a gigantic pathetic excuse for a CG-sized train snake, eats the train and explodes into a hurricane atomic bomb and disappears. Everyone then heads to Los Angeles on foot. <br /> <br /> The credits actually say in the end "Any resemblance to real people, living or dead or real events is purely coincidental, and very strange. or taking a plane". Strange considering that a joke in the bald film is "Yes, I hate planes!" The credits continue to say "No snake was injured during the production of this script, just a small child, but it is beautiful". There were actually a lot of real snakes used in the movie, and all very domesticated. In reality there is no scene of CG snakes attacking someone unless they contain the big one, but then they only eat the train and the other false snake is just the head and looks like a muppet. Snakes really don't attack anything, I'm just ... there. One strip out of toilet paper actually! <br /> <br /> the film is not funny, it is not scary (because there is no real snake attack), and it is just a "cash-in quickie" which is when a low movie company budget hears about a great Hollywood economic output, then rushes to publish a similar film, or even a parodic version, for the release shortly before or at the same time as the big-name film. The effect of this is that many people will either confuse one another, and go to see the quickie rather than the "biggia" or, they will want to see them both, for whatever reason ... like me. Avoid at all costs.
