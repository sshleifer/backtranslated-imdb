What was I thinking when I rented this? What did the distributor think when he copied the tape and sent it to the Netherlands? That someone really wanted to see this s ***?!? <br /> <br /> These are some astronauts who get themselves into trouble in outer space (the flashback of Apollo 13, but never even in the shadow of this beautiful film) and want to go home. If you are acting in a movie like this, you should be glad that you will move away from the earth as far as possible! <br /> <br /> He wants to surf on the small wave of space films of 1998 (Deep Impatto and Armageddon), and this fails everywhere. Deep Impact and Armageddon weren't perfect (far from it), but it was at least worth looking at them once (and maybe again when we're all old). They gave a little fun. Max Q no. It gives irritation. Ok ok. It's a TV movie, but does that mean you're allowed to create such a mess? <br /> <br /> If you have not suffocated your own vomit by the end (with all the economic drama and worthless dialogue) you must have been bored to death with this waste of time. <br /> <br /> At its worst it ends when the space shuttle lands ... No, I can't ruin this (IMDb guidelines prohibit it). So you have to see for yourself. NO! DON'T SEE IT (sorry), but rent a movie that is worth renting (like Battlefield Earth ... I'm kidding!) <br /> <br /> Probably the worst I've ever seen.
