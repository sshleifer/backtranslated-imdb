For the first fifteen minutes the story of NAKED FAME is interesting: two male pornstars from the late mid-thirties in an apparently healthy relationship decide to leave the porn industry and try the world of singing and acting. The two very buff and preening men are Colton Ford and Blake Harper. With the help of Kevin Aviance and Marc Berkely, Colton creates a dance floor that is then marketed in New York with the hope that Colton Ford will become an instant star - a singular record singer who plays his background as a porn star for PR. /> <br /> The rest of the film is rumbling and in-combat and comments from Porn Producer ChiChi LaRue and the film slowly sinks into repetitions and stasis. It is not a bad idea for a film if there was a little more depth revealed in the desire of each character to move away from a successful career (although strongly influenced by the loss of both characters) in an alternative. It's just that a song of a single note is consumed quickly. Grady Harp, 5 November
