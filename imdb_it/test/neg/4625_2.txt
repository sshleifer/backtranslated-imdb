This movie starts off great and sucks you. Most of the acting is good as long as Patrick Swayze (with his Texas Twang - everyone else looks English - even the Muslim) shows up and shows he can't act. You can live with that until the first fight scene in which everyone falls apart. Because Patrick Swayze fights the bad guys with an ax when he stuck his sword in the ground 5 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> There is still a spade error a few minutes later, and people know about other people they shouldn't know. The other reviewers mentioned "Troubled Production" and it shows. <br /> <br /> In the end I didn't even bother with the fight scenes, of course, the CGI dragon was weak, but the plot was the biggest disappointment.
