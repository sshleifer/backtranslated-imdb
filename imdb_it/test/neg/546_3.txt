The 1935 version of "Enchanted April" manages to be boring at the same time <br /> <br /> and superficial. It is difficult to show the transformative magic of Italy by shooting in a studio with the only stereotype of Italian behavior. The transformation of the four strangers fleeing London is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later. Rather than developing, the script turns a switch over and the characters <br /> <br /> are different. <br /> <br /> Husbands are quite boring in flashbacks without getting up, even if their presence does not guide the four women return in their shells and / or hostility. <br /> <br /> Jessie Ralph is the most fun (moving instead of chewing the scenery entirely <br />) and Katharine Alexander has a poignant charm from her husband's shadow (and far from her horrible hum). Ann Harding is <br /> <br /> insignificant here (with the production code applied). He had an appropriate <br /> line in a previous film (pre-code), "When Ladies Meet": "You are not <br /> <br /> not worth a minute of anxious hour or one of us gave you ", but in" Enchanted April "he can only look hurt, run out and proclaim loyalty to his wandering husband.
