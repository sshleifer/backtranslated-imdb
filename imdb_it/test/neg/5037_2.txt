From the epicenter of the cultural world, four working class teenagers have tried to change the world through music and fashion. It was the last attempt to do it in the last century, and they failed. Before the dust cleared, the band manager and SEX shop owner Malcolm McLaren spent the money. The Sex Pistols had earned a "mockumentary" on its role in their success. The film was called The Great Rock 'n Roll Swindle (take the hint) and consists of very few footage of the Sex Pistols that actually play music, and quite a few movies of McLaren that actually call the audience idiots. <br /> <br /> Cod-surrealist absurdity in which guitarist Steve Jones is a detective on McLaren's tail, he soon dissolves so he and drummer Paul Cook can leave for Rio and spend time with "the great robber of trains "Ronnie Biggs. Get ready for the spectacle of three very unattractive men dancing naked in a horrible version without "irony" of "Belsen was a Gas" (a song about killing Jews for gold in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp), and a another song sung in the tone of Ronnie deaf whine which includes the text "God save Myra Hindley, God save Ian Brady" (texts that Johnny Rotten would have considered unpleasant). Sid Vicious's scenes are few and idiotic. Jump out of bed in a loincloth with a swastika over the testicles to sing a girl's motorcycle song from the 1950s. Interpretation of the "Punk's a joke" theme of the film, in an attempt to transform Sid into James Dean. I'm surprised that McLaren doesn't even realize Siddy's death. The saving scenes are those of Sid in Paris and the infamous interpretation of My Way. The zeitgeist of punk rock right there. Make fun of an adoring audience before taking them all back. No need for an entire movie, just watch that video on YouTube. <br /> <br /> From the continuation of the documentary of the distant (and more amusing 2001) of Julien Temple, The Filth and the Fury, we were given a more balanced / honest view of what emerged in '78. But there were also a series of scenes that I wanted to see in Swindle (since Fury was basically a reissue of the same material). One was an animated Sid complete with Sid's voice; "Tu f * cken betta wat'ch out, ok, or I'll break you" - a catch appeared on the cover of the Something Else 7 inches - a snippet was shown in Fury, but I don't know which context originally appeared. Was it in original prints but removed after Sid's death? Was there more? Fury also shed light on the film Who Killed Bambi, which was going to be the fake Hard Day's Night movie that McLaren intended to make. He starred in Sting (!) As a member of a gay New Romantics group, and looks a lot more fun than Swindle. <br /> <br /> Sod Swindle, it's a scam. If you have to, rent The Filth and The Fury and enjoy the failure of music as a controversy that changes the world.
