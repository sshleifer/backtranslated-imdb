I don't mean to sound pretentious here, but to say it, the next cult classic is another example of the lowering standards that directors have for themselves. This film is an offense to everything we consider sacred, and not in the good "artistic" way of offending. This film becomes the archetype of the PAINFUL dialogue, delivered by even more pathetic actors.
