Combine a good casting, bad writing, good orchestral score, wrong dialogues and a good idea of ​​history with a lot of potential, but you never realize that you have Slipstream. <br /> <br /> I just bought the film for a dollar, it's worth it, but not much more. <br /> <br /> Nice to see Mark Hamill recite again. <br /> <br /> There should be a decent follow up done to remedy the damage of the original. Or at least give him the proper attention he should have received in the first place. <br /> <br /> Berstein's soundtrack called for your attention from the opening credits, however, the long shots of slipstream planes and the even longer revelation of interesting plot points do not take into account his attention. <br /> <br /> It's really easy to hunt down a movie like this, after all it's the producer of STARWARS and the director of TRON and an extraordinary cast, but that's what it is. And it's not much. <br /> <br /> Preferred line- "We'll make it, ha-ha! ... (BOOM!)"
