I know it's quite unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece - but I'll do it anyway! I waited for a laugh, I tried to give him time. I think 20 minutes is long enough to wait in a play for a laugh. My laugh never came, so I gave up. <br /> <br /> It's a stupid humor, not so stupid as to have to laugh, though. It's not even close to this high level. Let me correct it, it's just * stupid * - not stupid humor. They might have thought that some scenes were funny, but they weren't. I suppose, if you were really bored, you could somehow merge the movie with a hallucination and end up with a slightly fun experience. <br /> <br /> A very pathetic effort.
