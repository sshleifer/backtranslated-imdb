I've seen a lot of movies over the years and I'm a big fan of comedies. <br /> <br /> But this so-called comedy almost brought me to tears. It is undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen, the worst. <br /> <br /> I remember hearing about this film from a friend and decided to watch it. If I could, I could go back in time, I would do it. I will regret all the time I live, the time I lost watching this garbage. <br /> <br /> The plot is so crazy; it just doesn't make sense and leaves you confused. There is a Scottish crowd and a German headhunter looking for Pestario 'Pest' Vargas (John Leguizamo), the Scottish crowd after $ 50,000 dollars and the Germans after his head. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to escape The Pest, it takes the form of many disguises. But in doing this we witness some of the most annoying, worst, disturbing acting, dialogues and sounds in the history of cinema. This film bothered me so much; in the end I was full of aggression. I was so angry that I had lost so much time watching a movie that would have definitely pushed depressed people into almost suicide. I mean, how can there be hope when a film like this can be given permission to be done? <br /> <br /> I know that people have their opinions, but the most shocking thing about The Pest is that people really like it. Why? What's funny about a man who is annoying from the very first second to the last? A man who can't act? Who has an annoying voice and a confused face? <br /> <br /> I sat inside thinking that the film would improve, it certainly would be. I did not do it. Usually, you want the good guy to survive, but I wanted the Germans or the Scottish Mafia to find and kill The Pest, anything to get me out of my misery. There is nothing funny, interesting or normal that happens in this film, it is simply annoying and confusing. The jokes are dead even before they are told. I'm sorry for the cameramen who have no say in how the film is made, but in reality they have to film this drivel. I would not be surprised if they received advice. <br /> <br /> If you want to stay sane and part of society, my advice is never to watch this movie. I'd rather lock myself up in my room for 5 weeks and go without food and water to watch this movie again! <br /> <br /> I don't think I'll ever hate you again.
