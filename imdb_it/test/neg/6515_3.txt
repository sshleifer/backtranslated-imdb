My age: 13 <br /> <br /> James Cole, played by Steven Seagal, is sent to help Detective Jim Campbell, played by Keenen Ivory Wayans, solve a series of killings in which victims are crucified. Given that Cole arrived on the scene, he realizes that the murders have changed a bit and he thinks there is a different killer. He becomes personal when his ex-wife is killed and Campbell finds his prints on the body. Campbell investigates the mysterious Cole and discovers a very dark past. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Steven Seagal. I like action movies, but he's the worst actor I've ever seen. This film is not very funny to watch, incredibly stupid and, of course, Steven Seagal's acting is absolutely horrible. Keenen Ivory Wayans is not so bad, though. The only thing that redeems in this film is the occasional scene of good deed, though most come because of insanely stupid reasons. The plot of this film is absolutely meaningless. I didn't care at all. The entire past "glimmer man" of Seagal's character was stupid, all the fighting and mafia struggles in the restaurant were there for almost no reason. Give this film a lack. <br /> <br /> Australian classification: MA 15+: high level violence <br /> <br /> Rating: 35 out of 100 (quite generous)
