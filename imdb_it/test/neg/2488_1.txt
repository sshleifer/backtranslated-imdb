I was expecting a documentary to cover the era of Sci-Fi between 1950 and 1965 and I received a large commercial advertisement with left-wing political insinuations from James Cameron and the tycoon of the baby boom movie who pushed their work. "Watch the Skies" referred in the past to the "Giant Bug" and "Space Exploration" films of the 1950s, including the favorites "Earth against flying saucers", "The thing from another world" and "Forbidden planet" like "Them", "Deadly Mantis" and "Tarantula". There are examples of lower budgets that are rarely cited as "Space Monster", "12 to the Moon" and "Cosmic Man". <br /> <br /> This would have been a much better documentary if the few remaining actors, directors, stuntmen and collectors plus the non-Hollywood boomerers of the time had been interviewed. I only wish a "0" rating was available since a "1" is very generous.
