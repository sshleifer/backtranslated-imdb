This is a standard action movie as we have seen them many times before. Not much action in this though. Again this is the boy who protects the president. He is macho - as usual, and at the same time soft and melancholy - as usual. Do you dare to take a bullet for the president ?! And then there's the girl and the usual conservative who flirts around. Stereotype and predictable at the last minute dilapidated.
