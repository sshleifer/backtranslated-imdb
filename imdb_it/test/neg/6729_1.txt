The films of Steven Seagal recently have not been exactly good, but this is by far the worst since The Patriot. The plot makes no sense what ever; it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are, who works for whom or who makes the double intersection who. The film is completely separate, each scene seems to further confuse the story rather than carry it forward. The action sequences are also uninspired and difficult to follow. Most of the blame must lie at the feet of the director for not even understanding the basics of filmmaking, but Seagal doesn't take it lightly, as one of the producers of this film, must also share the blame. Oh, and I haven't even mentioned how awful acting is, even by Seagal standards. Even for video fodder, this is not worth even for Seagal fans. Give it a wide space!
