This film has been made before. It is basically a non-original combination of "Napoleon Dynamite" and "Sordid Lives". There are some fun parts, but otherwise it's a boring clich√©. It is a good first film attempt and the director (who also acted and wrote the script) shows many promises. But the script was pretty rough and the story wasn't very original. I swear I heard a few lines in other films. However, the acting was very good and the film was shot in an interesting way. It is also refreshing to watch homosexual films not being bogged down with political correctness and tired stories of anguish. The main character seemed quite well-suited for a gay teenager in rural Texas, so don't make a mess, coming up with drama here!
