It is difficult to make a bad film with the theme of sport "the loser in the end succeeds", but this film succeeds admirably. My mind is shocked at how boring and boring this movie is. I imagine the director cannot decide if this concerns the runner or the coach. It ends up being neither one nor the other. Ultimately, who cares? No character has a nice personality. There is nothing in the film that makes you worry about anyone. Even the "bad" is not really bad. (I think it's in two scenes, and apparently it's about some sort of barbituate.) I think he asks her, once and kindly, to leave the coach and train with him. Then after a bit of "sort" he asks her to move in with him. that's all. Conflict! Voltage! What will she do? !! <br /> <br /> - And what is it with the depiction of running? Has the director ever seen a real marathon? Christine's form is so wrong that it is absurd, as is the form of the alleged "champion" she competes with (a character without lines. Maybe they could have taken him, you know, a real RUNNER?) <br /> <br /> - And the speed of the race is beyond comprehension. Were they running or walking fast? It's actually ridiculous. I can literally walk backwards faster than when they ran in the big race. Maybe it was too difficult to move cameras at full speed? <br /> <br /> Another absurdity: (spoiler, I guess) At some point in the big race, the two women in the head fall inexplicably, equally time. What they fell on is a mystery. Maybe they are both exhausted and have fallen? -And then they get up, but they don't start running again for maybe 30 seconds. Oh yes, very realistic. This ridiculous event does not even add tension, since the other runners are not close, and also at this point you have been numb in a state of catatonia. <br /> <br /> - I especially liked how all four of his male teammates, all highly qualified athletes, quit the big race due to charlie-horses, or pull the tendons, or something equally unlikely . <br /> <br /> But who cares? This film has almost no tension, no resolution, nothing. Some woman runner without personality has been discovered by an old boring trainer with some barely past failures. They train a lot. She is not happy. They train a little more. You win by great race. Woopie. <br /> <br /> My description is actually more interesting than the actual movie. I just saved you 90 minutes. Avoid this like the plague.
