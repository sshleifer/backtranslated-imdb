This is the worst movie I've ever seen, without exception. From fragile, poorly lit scenes, to laughable acting, to childish plot and to shoddy and haggard action sequences, this film is so bad, its hilarious. For about ten minutes. After that you will reach the remote control or the power outlet to end this non-movie experience. Although it was obviously made with the collective language of the production staff and the acting staff (please God), I found Jack Frost 2 so terrible that it was unwatchable for more than a quarter of an hour. If you haven't had enough after this time, you must indulge in drug abuse.
