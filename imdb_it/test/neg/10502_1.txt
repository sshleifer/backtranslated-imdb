If you came here, it's because you've already seen this movie and you were curious about what others have to say about it. <br /> <br /> I try for you, I * really * do. And I apologize profusely as a Canadian (because that's what we do) that this film has never had to cross its eyes, even if only for a moment. I have heard that there is no cure for retinal hemorrhage reported in every dozen cases. <br /> <br /> I, like everyone else, rented this movie believing it to be a stupid imitation of Blade's B-movie. I thought, "of course I could use a good laugh for a stupid movie." I will give the creators of this film a positive comment on their "creation": thanks for removing REC XX / XX / XX from the bottom right corner of the screen. I can see how it would have been a distraction from seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> And for the record, I * saw * the movie, but I didn't watch it. The dialogue was inconsistent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother's trailer, I swear to God. <br /> <br /> Do you know what? I don't write about this anymore. It's too painful.
