Just read the cast list and the credits to salivate in anticipation of this DAVID COPPERFIELD, but, alas, alas! The way that so much acting and director talent could have turned one of the richest tales of literature into such a monumental BORE, is totally beyond me. It's nice to look at with a nice photograph, especially the sequences of Yarmouth, but, JUST PLAIN DULL !!! No need to go on! Skip it and take a look at Selznick or the wonderful BBC 80's miniseries.
