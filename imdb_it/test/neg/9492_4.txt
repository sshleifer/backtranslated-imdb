The inaugural "female painting" by Douglas Sirk for Universal, based on a predicative, dogmatic and didactic novel by the intolerable Lloyd C. Douglas (author of that other beautiful piece of shit, * The Robe *). Rock Hudson, in the role that catapulted him to celebrity, plays Bob Merrick, a drunken playboy of countless million who is more interested in chasing skirts and speedboats than to finish his medical degree. In the first scene, he destroys his boat on a sumptuously photographed lake. The accident almost kills Merrick, and therefore requires a rather mysterious "resuscitator" to keep him alive. . . Meanwhile, on the other side of town, the beloved surgeon, Dr. Phillips, finally died of a heart condition. Since the local hospital can only maintain one resuscitator at a time, Phillips dies so that the louse can live. When Merrick learns of this, he tries to make apologetic openings to Phillips' family, especially the widow (Jane Wyman, dressed and dressed in matronly hauteur), but indeed anyone and anyone who knows the surgeon spits Merrick as a couple of cobra. A hospital staff doctor even defines him as "a total waste" that the playboy experienced instead of the Christ-like surgeon. Hippocrates may have had something to say about it! <br /> <br /> These first scenes are where you will find the typical Syrian iconoclasm: the director rubs our face so much in the unpleasant middle class, mid-century America, that one is rooting for the wastrel playboy for put whoopee pillows under the demijohns of these moral hypocrites. But, alas, no: the laughable plot of the novel must proceed, and Merrick will soon find himself converted by God, in the guise of Otto Kruger, an artist who claims that Phillips made him a better man and even a better painter. (Why do we see nothing of this wonderful art?) We learn that Dr. Phillips, intolerably omnipresent, often refuses payments for medical services rendered (even if those who are exactly qualified for these "magnificent exemptions" are never clarified). This should provide our hero with a completely new vision of life and an example of personal conduct. Kruger even tries to make everything look very exciting: "Once you start this thing, there's no way out of it! It's an obsession ... a MAGNIFICENT obsession!" So Merrick proves it STILL by beating up the widow with his apologies, but somehow he gets her hit by a car. You lose your sight. Apparently, Merrick will have many other stations on the cross to go before he can be considered a good boy. <br /> <br /> But Sirk continues to sneak into his vendettas even as the film grows more and more preachy. The most obvious part must be the presence of Agnes Moorehead as a nurse in the chief hospital and friend of Wyman and unrequited injured lover. Notice the disappointment on Moorehead's face when Merrick, finally redeemed as a doctor, shows up to save Wyman's life towards the end. Hudson's own homosexuality, a secret opened in Hollywood at the time, is also used for a great ironic effect. He and Wyman - older and older than fifteen - generate absolutely zero erotic warmth in their scenes together, which, by the way, are deliberately few, presumably because other scenes among the stars would have exposed the whole enterprise without hope. (One thing we feel certain about: if Rock Hudson was obsessed with something, it certainly wasn't Jane Wyman.) It's a chronic case of * Tea and Sympathy *. Sirk seemed to enjoy changing everyone's nose because this gay actor - who was attractive to the innocent women of the time - drifted adroitly among these "women" of exquisitely colored colors. In fact, the director worked with Hudson 6 or 7 times more to get the best result in the following film, * All That Heaven Permits *, which reorganized Hudson with Wyman but was also accompanied by a realistic storyline. In * Obsession *, meanwhile, we must bear that God / Kruger looks kindly from an observation window to Merrick and his medical team as they prepare to save Wyman's life, in tandem with a musical score of swollen voices of a Hollywood choir. <br /> <br /> But to understand why Sirk is considered an author, take a look at the scene where Wyman explains to his grown daughter that she can actually distinguish night and day. The whole structure is blackened, here: the daughter is barely visible, and Wyman's face is slightly silhouetted against a faint light. He goes on to say that he hates the night because "I know Dawn will never come back". A great chilling moment that deserves a much better movie than * Magnificent Obsession *. <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of 10.
