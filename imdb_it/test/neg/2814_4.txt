After scalping the American Indians with scalp number one, frontmanman Bruce Bennett (like Daniel Boone) seems, at first, as if he wanted to get a draw; but, he really wants to make friends with the natives. When the sad-eyed Indian chief Lon Chaney (like Blackfish) also loses his son number one, it becomes more difficult to clear up misunderstandings. Apparently, this was Republic Pictures' attempt to do for their "Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer" what Disney Studio had successfully done with "Davy Crockett, the king of the wild Frontiers" (1955). <br /> <br /> The song by Dan'l Boone, booed and sung by a group of children in a wagon, did not follow Fess Parker's "Davy Crockett" in the Hit Parade. The singer Faron Young (like Faron Callaway) does not perform the title song (perhaps wisely); he sings "Long Green Valley" and makes a good impression as a blond boy for Boone's daughter. But the Spanish actor Freddy Fernandez is the most valuable player in the film. In a cute scene, Mr. Fernandez reminds Mr. Young of the name of the character ("Susannah") he should be in love with. <br /> <br /> **** Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer (10/5/56) Ismael Rodr√≠guez ~ Bruce Bennett, Lon Chaney Jr., Faron Young, Freddy Fernandez
