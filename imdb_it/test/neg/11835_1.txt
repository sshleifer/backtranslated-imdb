Why is this film not on the 100 fund? Raptor is, without a doubt, the worst film I've seen in all my fifteen years of life. I have never witnessed such a catastrophic disaster like this. Absolutely everything that concerns him is embarrassing and cheap. <br /> <br /> No one in the cast offers quite decent performances. Dialogue is completely inconsistent and humor is anything but fun. Corbin Bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing. I can't help but cringe when I remember some of his jokes, like "Inside or outside? You're worse than a cat!" and "Your friend is not a very good poker player. She has just revealed her hand." <br /> <br /> Raptors are a joke. I could also make more realistic dinosaur effects than those these directors did without shame. It's an insult to current velociraptors, or any dinosaur for that matter. Not only that, but the killing scenes are too gruesome for me too. I don't seriously think these animals can tear the victim to shreds and throw pieces on the floor just to make everything more showy. Furthermore, blood and guts are all useless when you can see the deaths coming from miles and miles away. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Jurassic Park movies and dinosaurs. Maybe the filmmakers didn't foresee anyone with a shred of intelligence or sense to ignore the bad movie production to run into this HBO movie late at night, like I did. If I could say something to anyone involved in this film, I should mention Dr. Alan Grant of the first Jurassic Park ... <br /> <br /> "Just try to show some respect."
