Immediately after seeing the first one and he is very stupid. I happened to watch an episode of Bones first and then the eleventh hour. The eleventh hour should be embarrassed. <br /> <br /> It's so weak. Stewart introduces himself as a government scientist. There is no mention of what kind of scientist only general science things. In a program on cloning they bring a custodian, who was paid to deposit embryos without success, in a church and had him kneel before the statue of Jesus on the cross and ask forgiveness ... and even tell them where the villain is as well as they can move the plot. Now that science is at work :( <br /> <br /> There is a dumb, not good fool, a bit where Picard rages on a television that advertises a scream of skin that makes you look younger, screaming "It's a lie," as his randy female assistant is tempted by the hot bobbie club next door. <br /> <br /> The end of the first episode is like a bad cartoon where the bad old lady takes the name from Pinnochios dad to move the awkwardly long plot, greets Picard from the road as he gets into a taxi: Picard is one-story and looks out a window that runs sadly ... has escaped, might try running down ... or maybe to play the police .. or maybe take the taxi number and call it or maybe have something different from ... I'm saying goodbye and getting on a taxi now and there's nothing you can do until next week .. mahhahahahah <Too bad it's so stupid: at a certain point a grieving father is convinced by Pi card that, even if a son of the replica clone were born, he would never have been his son as his son had a soul. hat is right folks. The general scientist discusses against cloning based on the fact that every soul is unique and sure for what other reason one would like to clone. <br /> <br /> Although the general scientist Picard finds cloning a little sticky, he is ready for stem cell research and goes so far as to say that the calamity will fall upon humanity if it is not allowed. He has a rather jarring grimace on how important it is. Obviously he doesn't mention just one example. This type of summary summarizes the show. Buzz words and tawdriness.
