I thought this movie was totally different from another teen slasher. Well, I was completely wrong. There's a liquid nun coming out of the toilet and something really weird. I know that Spanish culture is a bit different and their films too, but I didn't expect to see a fake Hollywood movie. Surely they fake it pretty well. Why did they make a film without new aspects? This is simply boring and was done totally without any imagination. <br /> <br /> I thought that having a nun as bad in the film was something really original. He turned out to be a teenage slasher. If it had been done ten years ago, it would have been something new. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie for anyone but it certainly has some comic value! It's like a parody of horror in some places.
