the hills have eyes is not a great film anywhere in the imagination. for one the bad guys seem almost normal, not what you would expect the absurd lunatics to seem. For another the rhythm is very slow at times and there are many scenes of the characters are repeated by themselves, I mean that there is a lot of filling in the film, with lots of aimless laps. The film has no clear direction. The plot of the film is hardly original, even for its time. The Texas chainsaw massacre came out a few years earlier and is a much more effective horror film. The film has little in the way of fear, and the pounding soundtrack only served to be both grating and distracting all at once. I suppose the music was used to hide the fact that not much happens for most of the film, even if it fails at its destination. In practice I kept looking at the time every few seconds hoping that something would happen or would end. when something finally happened, some promise The film was ruined by a simple chaos and a loud noise. I tried it because I like giving the film the benefit of the doubt. Yes, there is a loud scream, and yes, people die, but who cares too much. get to any kind of compensation, if you can call it that. My friend had fun, so at least one of us got something. The hills have eyes it's not the worst movie we could have seen, but I doubt I'll watch it again. This film was redone in 2006 and I will also have a review of that version. However, this film was painfully slow at times, while at other times it was chaotic and repetitive. Unless you like looking at the dry paint, occasionally interspersed with someone running after your block, screaming with your head down, stay away from this movie. A better bet would be the original Texas chainsaw massacre (1973) 1.5 * out of 10 * which is generous
