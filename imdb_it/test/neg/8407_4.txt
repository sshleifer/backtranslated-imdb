Um ... okay, this is really very poor compared to the first movie, Rosemary's Baby, very critically acclaimed. Indeed, it is a rather poor film in general. Yes, there are some qualities of redemption, but I'll get there later. <br /> <br /> Well, it's been a while since the last movie ... in fact, it's been about eight years I think. Rosemary is still trying to escape with his son and influences him in a good way, rather than letting him succumb to the evil future that the coven (or "tribe," as it is called here) has prepared for him. When she escapes with him and an empty bus arrives that picks her up, leaving her child with a prostitute, the prostitute raises him until he reaches the age of majority, where Satan tries to possess him because he seems to refuse his evil heritage in every < br /> <br /> Obviously, things do not go as planned, and then there is the ending that I would have felt seriously ashamed for not having seen it since I learned that there was a sequel to "Rosemary's Child"! Ok, when I was about 11 years old, I saw the masterpiece Rosemary's Baby and then I read the rest of the book. Thinking that this film was an adaptation of this, I tracked down this movie and understood it ... was I right in doing it? Well, somehow, yes ... I'm a real fan of this "franchise" and I can say I saw the sequel, and I have some ideas on what will happen after the events of the first film (talking about both this movie AND "Son of Rosemary ", the sequel to Ira Levin, not yet adapted to the film. <br /> <br /> Ruth Gordon, who played Minnie in the first film, is shown a few times in this film, but because ... oh, why is the coven so different? The knife that Rosemary had dropped in the first film is shown to come out of the ground, yet Minnie pulled it out! The coven is now called a tribe (as I said earlier.) Now they go around with hooded hoods they sing "Ave, Satan ... Ave, Adriano ... Ave, Satan ... Ave Adriano ..." and so on and so on. The Gothic building is now like a two-story house on a meadow in the middle to nothingness, it looks like a small suburban house or something! And the child himself looks quite normal, with eyes that they all become "cather" when they get angry and kill someone or something. <br /> <br /> As for acting, he is rather poor on all sides, except Stephen McHattie, who plays a very grown Adrian. Pattie Duke Astin, replacing Mia Farrow in the role of Rosemary, must have one of the flat DOLL performance ever seen for a movie! It's so ugly that it's hardly even funny ... when he shouts "OH MY GOD!" and she cries as for the fifteenth time in the film, you are like "Ok, it's not fun anymore", and then when she's gone and the movie has only been active for twenty minutes, you're like THANK YOU LORD I DON'T FEEL "OH MY GOD "ANY LONGER !! Sheesh! In the end, this movie has a lot, a lot, * very * few redeeming qualities, enough to get it at least four stars. But, if you look at it as a serious sequel to the first film, it is practically non-existent.
