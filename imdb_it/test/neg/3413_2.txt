I just watched this movie in a lovely air-conditioned cinema here in Bangkok. And since the outside temperature is around 37 Â° C with very high humidity, my 100Bt was not wasted. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I haven't seen a piece of junk that has been extremely well done for a long time. This is the kind of film that provides a taste test, so to speak. Anyone who claims to like or love him goes immediately to the same list of insipid fetishes that continue to talk about the superiority of British television. At least the old, wide-open wheelchair in the wheelchair was good for some snickers. <br /> <br /> Pseudo-depth and fat lips, typical features of much of French cinema, they don't really make a good movie. I'd rather watch Independence Day 10 times in a row rather than sit on this stinky once again.
