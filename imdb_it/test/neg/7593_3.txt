Strange things happen to Americans Will (Greg Evigan), Maura (Alexandra Paul) and their young daughter Aubrey (Briana Evigan, the daughter of Greg's true life) when they move into a big new heritage home in Ireland. Crunchy corpses are found in the cellar, a turkey spurts blood, moves of furniture and ghosts of a dead child and a cackling old lady show up to frighten the child. Paranormal investigators are eventually called to banish evil spirits, but Maura becomes possessed anyway and chases everyone with a cleaver. <br /> <br /> This film is full of clich√©s, but there is an extraordinary performance by Alexandra Paul. .. pity that does not belong to this film (nor anyone else I can think of the hand)! He can barely keep his face straight and his over-excited and hysterical tantrums are a joy to see. In any case, it is much more interesting to look at than anything else in this film. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
