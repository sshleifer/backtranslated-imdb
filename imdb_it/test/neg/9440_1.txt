... I can't believe that there are people here who recommend this movie ... This is a slow POS that doesn't go anywhere. Oh yeah OK it goes somewhere, but you see it comes from far away. Acting: Really really ugly, maybe the bartender was kind enough. Mounting: BAD! I suppose the publisher was told "we need at least 90 minutes", because half of all the scenes could have gone into the trash. Music: don't let me start, the most amiable soundtrack I've ever heard. Who's singing in the last scene to shout loudly? Direct: oh my, IMNSHO, David Lynch sucks, but someone who tries to copy it sucks even more. Skip this.
