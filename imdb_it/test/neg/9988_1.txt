At the moment I'm flipping through Gibbon's "Fall and Decline of the Roman Empire", so I had everything Roman thought of me. I'm still not far away, maybe two hundred and more pages, but it's amazing how many of these Roman emperors were killed. I believe I have read perhaps 15 emperors so far and only Antonio, Traiano and Adriano have not been killed or at least suspected of having been killed. I was also fascinated by the crazy excesses of many of these principles of Rome. Caligula was no less expert than these. This brings me to review this film. I am thinking of the film on a historical basis for what I understand from Gibbon's explanation of Rome, as well as other research from some good websites and some reports of fiction novels with the period. <br /> <br /> My point is that I don't think this film is what many think of its supporters. I don't think the depravity shown with sex and the horrendous violence of this movie qualifies him as accurate. The general ideas of the film seem accurate. Caligula grew up on an island, exiled with his family and content fear of being killed by the increasingly mad, suspicious and strange Emperor Tiberius. He grows paranoid and scared and can't shake off the nickname that was given to him by his guards, Little Boots, which helps him grow up feeling abused and helpless. He is given the empire after the death of Tiberius, the senate who hopes to get away from the teams of informers who caused the death on a whim of the former delirious paranoid tyrant, and to remove Rome from the madness in which the dictator had placed it. Caligula begins as a decent emperor, if not with his bare hands, but gets sick, almost dies, and a real monster returns from the brink of fervent death. His perversity with his sisters starts here, if not sooner. He killed Macro and many others who were his original supporters. The acts of madness did not seem to be the murders of Caligula as much as his new way of thinking of himself as a living God. He saw him talking to the statue of Jupiter in equal condemnation. His violent crazy excesses would have condemned him anyway, and three years seems to have been a decent race for Tiberius' successors. Well, the film basically sticks to these lines while managing to be coherent, which is not common through its wholeness, it does it while trying to shock the audience at every turn, in every single scene the movie begs you to be disgusted from the depravity of ancient Rome. Shocking scenes are what this film is all about and where it completely fails. It is really too much to see successive rulers have men killed, raped, tortured for no reason other than fantasy. The depictions of violence are probably, but not probably, accurate. Murder was certainly the order of the day in imperial Rome, torture in advance was by heart. But the director's visions of these deaths and the bored fun of their protagonists, while passers-by look carelessly, I don't see that it went exactly like this. The death machine, the convertible, is definitely something you've never seen in movies, and something that once seen you probably will never forget, even though I, you wish you could. The wine that is drunk while the penis is broken is the same, once you have seen this shame it is yours forever. These things affect me the fantasies of the director and that porn magnate. They came from their sick imagination and not from any proven record. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good. Actually, I think McDowell is the weakest link here. Mirren is always something to look at, and here in her youth she is formidable and beautiful. The portraits of Nerva and Tiberius are done very well by their respected actors. The film could have made much better narratives, it's such a failure that way it's just another level of what a shame this thing was. For example, he could have given an opinion on how and why Caligula went mad, or showed that he was crazy, paranoid before his illness and that the fever then broke the mental containment he had previously possessed. He could have shown Claudio's weakness and the miracle that he had survived Caligula. He may have these and many other things but he is attached to his sad nightmares. <br /> <br /> Finally on sex. It's a porn. Show that these sexual acts are done in all buildings by many people. Male on male, female on female, male on female. It's a sex without passion and disgust. Sex that if your point is to get down on it, I seriously doubt that you can do it. Both Tiberius and Caligula may have been drug addicts, and the orgies may have been quite common, but the visions of this film seem to recall more a Greek era than a Roman one. I do not believe that the kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgies that were seen in the open were common to the strange depraved realm of Elgabalus, and he was killed for it. <br /> <br /> This movie should probably never be looked at, if your curious about it, let it go. It's something, as I said before, if you look at it, unfortunately you will keep its sick visions in your mind's eye for years to come. I do not think that it is a specific historical picture in particular, even if it is historical as a whole.
