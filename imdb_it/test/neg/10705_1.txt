The plot - in the future when almost all men have been killed by a Y chromosomal targeting virus, a (genetic) female genetic engineer "creates" a man in a chemistry lab - it's intriguing. Despite the rather promising premise, the film falls flat in almost every aspect. Dialogue is ridiculous. The characters are very thin. The exploration of a unique genre world is superficial. The worst part of the whole film is the Asian detective who offers such vulgar and artificial lines that you want to throw up. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine how the hell this junk was made. Most of the film is a male who beats. "All men are violent". "All men rape women". "Men are just animals." All women - even the "closed hetero cases" - seem to show anger towards, fear and hatred for men. If you want to see a sci-fi movie along the lines of the premise of this film, you'd better look elsewhere.
