I know a lot of people like this show and I apologize to the people who think this show is fantastic but it's the worst show ever created. Sure, I'm sure I'd be a big fan of this show if Jeremy Clarkson wasn't there. I mean, I think testing the cars and doing things like seeing if a car can fly a plane is great! But Jeremy Clarkson is just pathetic. Here are the reasons why I hate this man: He thinks it's nice to fool speed cameras that measure average speed by measuring distance and time by driving 200 miles per hour and then resting for two hours. . He clearly thinks he's better than Richard Hammond and James May. . He has my best friend who says pathetic things. . He screams to the children just to take a picture of him. I'm sorry for the extra gear, but Jeremy Clarkson is a monster.
