Sometimes I look in high school and it surprises me that he never went any lower than Marvin did in this BAD movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Marv is the main character to whom bad luck gets worse and worse. Despite his intelligence, he manages to be a victim of bullying, exploitation, support of his bad dead dad, and a lot of extra tricks including a bold shot that we say he does not completely plan. Of course, the viewer does not empathize with anyone in this film, so all this disastrous sadness bounces like harmless zeta rays. Recommended for those days when you feel down, let this film come in and smile and say: "I'm so glad I'm not Marv!"
