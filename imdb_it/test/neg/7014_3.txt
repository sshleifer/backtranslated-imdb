Some good scenery. Good songs, though like the other he said that they are not performed with much energy. Bea Arthur, who was trying to do something with the material, occasionally had a good lining like Mame Vera's friend and helped move the song "Bosom Buddies". Besides this, there is nothing here that is worthwhile. Slow rhythms, incredibly bad cinemography, not very good at singing (except Robert Preston), a horrible script, a bad acting (except Bea) and a horrible leading actress. Who thought Lucille Ball would be as good as the classy mom and lover of life? The Warner Bros. bosses were undoubtedly on the crack when they decided not to use Angela Lansbury, who had done so well on Broadway, and instead of using Ball, which was not as funny as it was then 20 years ago, could not possibly play the part "in the right way" and use a painful croak as an excuse to sing. Although (maybe because) the film was painful for her to realize and even if she financed it, she is not a Mom. Auntie Mame is such a great film and the soundtrack to the Broadway musical with Lansbury looks great. For the most part, there is nothing here that is beautiful, engaging or not at all interesting. Forget it, unless you're a big Lucy fan who thinks he can't go wrong. I hope that after having seen it you will realize that it was only human.
