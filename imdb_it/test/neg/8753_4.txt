Yes, the film is not a work of art, but the first time I saw it I was 10, my parents were out and I stayed at home with my two brothers. It was May 1970 (I know because I found a note about the cycle of horror films that a network had). It's one of the most vivid memories I have with boys. We ended up all in one bed and covered up to the head! Our very first horror movie! We kept talking about it for years and laughed at the moment. Those were horror movies. Today, horror movies are always the same. Or was it better when we were children enjoying themselves without analyzing the plot and the cast and dialog boxes? More sure it was that. But for me this is a great movie!
