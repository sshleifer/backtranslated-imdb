I won't say much about this film, because there's not much to say, because there's not much to talk about. The only good thing about this movie is that our favorite "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" characters are back. Many of the bad things about this film are that it has horrible characters, it has a horrible comedy, a horrible animation and James Arnold Taylor trying to copy the wonderful, unique Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch. The reasons for my criticisms are that all the characters have changed into something they never were, and should never be, animation that has been downgraded to the minimum possible extent, and finally, because someone who has done a wonderful voice over job for Obi -Wan Kenobi in "Clone Wars" wants to copy Michael J. Fox? I happen to have an answer to this. Because I'm the same person who thought he had to copy Eddie Murphy from Mulan to Mulan II. Yes, unfortunately, it's true. <br /> <br />.
