I went to see this film at the cinema about the strength of its potentially interesting topic, the good cast, a director who had already made the appreciated "Once Were Warriors" and my appreciation for the noir films set in LA in the Forties and Fifties . I would say that I am reasonably easy to please in this category of movies; I appreciate the classics of the genre, but I'll sit and enjoy an almost decent effort. However, I found this film absolutely unbearable. <br /> <br /> Despite a good situation in which to put the story, no one seems or will say anything interesting or entertaining in the whole two hours, besides this regret. . Good actors are wasted on endless dialogue scenes ranging from the trivial to the awkward. The narrative is loosened and drags unbearably, and none of the events it portrays is managed well enough to do anything but bore the audience to death. There is no drama, atmosphere, tension, absolutely no entertainment value and in the end it just doesn't matter what happened because I didn't believe in anything in the film. <br /> <br /> L.A. Reserved came out a year later and regardless of whether a version of the story is more realistic, the latter deservedly deserves all the praise for its excellence in every department. Mulholland Falls, on the other hand, fails in all departments, made even more tragic by the amount of talent involved. If they ever show it on a plane, I will get out anyway.
