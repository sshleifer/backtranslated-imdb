Who the hell got the "brilliant" idea (?) Of launching Lucille Ball in this movie ??? It had to be Angela Lansbury's little girl to the end. At least Lucy should have made her sing dubbed. <br /> <br /> There is some compensation in the fact that the soundtrack of Jerry Herman is well maintained intact except for "That's How Young I Feel", and we receive performances from the original Broadway cast members Jane Connell and Bea Arthur. <br /> <br /> I suppose Robert Preston received a song, from which the inferior "Loving You". <br /> <br /> In general, I think the wrong redhead was chosen in this one.
