What can I say about this film, it really is one of the worst gay-themed movies that has ever come out of the UK. I can only imagine how Diana Quick and Georgina Hale needed money. What story is there, it's such a mess that you care about pretty quickly. It should be based on real life events. Well, all I can say to that, is that it's an insult to real-life characters. The DVD is out right now in the UK. It is available both in split screen format, which must make the full screen version I watch even worse. Gay cinema can be much better than this and we deserve more.
