(May contain spoilers) This film is the epitome of strangeness. I rented it hoping for such a bad movie that it would have been fun. However, honestly I still can't decide if this movie was meant to be scary or funny. Combine emotions in a rather disturbing way. Apparently this is trying to be smart but it really isn't. For example, when the knife comes out and tries to kill the teacher, it starts playing happy music. When we go to Toxico, we have up-beat, quasi-Mr. Roger's Neighborhood music. However, when the child dreams of falling into the "blood" and when he finds the leg, these are clearly destined to be tense. So watch this movie and decide for yourself. It's too weird to be described in words and for that I say, congratulations. <br /> <br /> "Nose-dive ... WOW!"
