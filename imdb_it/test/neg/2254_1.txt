Seriously disappointing show of Brad Pitt and QT, the plot is very superficial and lame and, if not indirectly understood, this film actually glorifies the Nazis and portrays them as men of honor, and shows that the Jewish people are deceiving, cannot keep promises and vicious bloodthirsty. ((THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILER)) Hitler, along with the most notorious Nazis, takes part in a stupid movie in which less film about the killing of 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema in Paris is incredibly ridiculous. the Nazis laughed and scolded every kill in the movie as if they were watching a STUPID basketball game, the deal is lame in the end. what is really scary is that the film has received excellent reviews and is ranked here in the 40s among the 250 best films. he will not be surprised if he has collected many awards, including the Oscars. the film is simply a kissing ass for the Jewish people, but hey reconsider, it's not even a great job doing it. he really played down the entire Nazi-Jewish conflict and a mere insult to all those who fought and suffered the tyranny of the Nazis.
