The initiation into the local sports team is to bring the neophytes to the cornfields and guess what? There is a scarecrow that kills people there. Only one of the neophytes survives but falls into a coma due to diabetes. Meanwhile, the scarecrow starts killing all the people involved, one by one. What are the secret scarecrows? Will they find him before the scarecrow has them all? This is a low budget film and show. The sound is OK, but the image is really trivial. The plot / screenplay really sucks and is rather pathetic and not logical. The acting is really bad and sometimes just ridiculous. I can't say much about special effects because there aren't many, but the few go from bad to OK (for a low budget). There is some nudity and this is probably the only thing worth seeing in the movie (ie if you are an excited teen, if not, skip the movie all together). Another complete waste of time and money so don't see it. It's also for hack'n'slash fans.
