Ocean's 12 starts to bother and gets worse from then on. As in a presentation of awards for celebrities, each main actor / actress is presented in short 60-second scenarios that seem to stop just after making a flashing sign of "clap now". The first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed, badly modified and, at times, completely unrelated to the plot and confused. About the story, ... there is one, a little ... but it's barely visible for all the "look at me" shots and cameos. Only Matt Damon actually seemed to be "acting" during this movie ... the rest of the cast seemed to be there just to attend a rat-pack session. As for robbery, action, drama ... it was put in the last 8-10 minutes of the film and was pathetic and anticlimatic. Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!
