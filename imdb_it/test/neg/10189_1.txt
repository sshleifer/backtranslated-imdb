After a good start, he turned out to be the worst piece of holier than you ever saw. This film is an open insult designed to make you feel bad about not reading the "Holy Bible". <br /> <br /> To resume the ... OK let's call it a plot ... Essentially alien not to kidnap people (who we already know ..). No, in fact his demonic forces kidnap people who are in new age or witchcraft, or read porn magazines (as a protagonist does). <br /> <br /> It is complete with small emotional piano music when the main character realizes he must blindly follow Christ to be saved. <br /> <br /> a quote summarizes everything, imagine a subtle piano music in the background: "You can't let others, even those you love, keep you from following the Lord ..." <br /> < br /> and we should live in an enlightened age ... still work to do. Boycott this piece of shit
