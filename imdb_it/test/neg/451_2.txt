To be honest, I haven't seen much of this show. Probably because it wasn't as good as the original M * A * S * H, but I seem to remember it by moving it to the weekly program. Some shows are not worth following about every week. But at first I really tried, so it wasn't bad at all. Maybe I kept hoping it would improve, but I can't give this show to 1. In all honesty, I can't give it more than a 2. <br /> <br /> It wasn't MASH (I won't write those stupid ones * every time) . And he was trying to be MASH without making any effort, as if it simply happened magically. Well guess what? No magic The best I can do here is to compare it with other shows. <br /> <br /> Trapper John, M.D. it was a much better show by far. However, they should have called him B.J. Hunnicut, M.D. because Pernell Roberts looked exactly like an old BJ, but not at all like Trapper John. Keep everything else the same, just change your name and the name of the show. Soon! After MASH it was not the only sequel to completely bomb and dishonor the original. Archie Bunker's Place was a lame following for All In The Family. He had no heart, no conflict, no depth ?? all the things that made All In the Family so memorable. Similarly, MASH was funny because the doctors were reacting to the absurd impossibility of war. Remove the war and remove the unit for 99% humor. Potter can't shout at Klinger for wearing a suit, because Klinger doesn't wear a suit, because he's not trying to be expelled from the army, because he's already out of the army, because the war is over. (breathes) All the jokes were forced because there was no motivation for anything. The least motivated was the spectator, to be around and watch the show. <br /> <br /> And from what I remember, the whole show seemed to be Potter, Klinger and Mulcahy standing there unnaturally, facing the audience like a trio of Vaudeville artists. He remembered Good Times, where they spent 90% of the show standing behind that couch and talking to the audience, trying to make it look like they were having a natural conversation. They weren't. And I felt even less natural on After MASH. <br /> <br /> Another random tidbit I remember is that the people who made MASH never received royalties from the spin-off. The studio used the absurd excuse that After MASH was really a spin-off of the MASH movie (owned by them) and not of the TV series. Nice try, but Mulcahy was the only one of the three in the film, and he was never deaf. I imagine the studio executives will do anything for a dollar. Anything other than making a sequel is worth it, that is.
