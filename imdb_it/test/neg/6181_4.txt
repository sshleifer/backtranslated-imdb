Ok, I saw this movie at Sundance this year, and I was incredibly indifferent. It took fifteen minutes of footage before there was a change or a line of dialogue that made sense, and it took another 30 minutes before the hard-haired script gave way to a work plot that didn't depend on a close - Ryan Gosling's smile or forced moralization. However, after the first 45 minutes, the script became a watch, though not completely entertaining or inspiring. The salient points certainly include both the acting of Gosling and Morse, Gosling is an emerging star, and Morse is an extremely assertive character with a good sensitivity for disparate emotions. As a sidenote, after the screening I was talking to a few snaps of the film to some of my friends when David Morse followed me behind: he looks like the most beautiful boy in the world, but he is a solid 6'2 "and he probably exceeds me by 50 pounds, I took my foot out of my mouth and immediately changed the subject.
