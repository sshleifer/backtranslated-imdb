In this sequel to The Naked Civil Servant we see the last years of Quentin Crisp's life in New York. John Hurt is again Crisp (let's go who else could play the part?) And his role is inhabited to the point of disappearing. For me, Hurt is Crisp and I've always found it very difficult to take the man himself because Hurt was more like him than himself. His masterful performance. His peer is Denis O'Hare as Phillip Steele, Crisp's longtime friend and confidant. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, outside the exhibition, the film has little to recommend it. To be sure, the film gets the correct details. Shot in New York and around the film, the film looks and resembles New York and its surroundings, but dramatically its kind of inert. His Crisp talks to witty people, trying to come to terms with the world as it is (he ended up regretting some badly chosen words about AIDS) and dealing with the infirmities that old people have pushed. Quentin the man is always interesting, but his life portrayed is actually not. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed with the movie. I have always admired the man and his unique point of view. I just hope it was better served by this movie about his life.
