It is difficult to criticize a film with the title "Death bed: the bed that eats" and involves a ghost storyteller who is trapped behind a 2-way painting he designed and a bed that snores and ?? if I'm not mistaken, he masturbates. (Now, this is going back to his human companions!) Also, it opens up (in orange, for whatever reason) to absorb edibles lying on its surface, including apples, wine, fried chicken and, of course, people. Again is it enough to say that you don't expect too much when you see what I imagine is stomach acid ?? the final remains of everything that takes the orangeade? dissolving only a few things. He will drink the wine, but the bottle is fine and he will eat the chicken bone, but the bucket is fine. Heck, the bed also replaces unused containers. Hilarious, at a certain point it lowers Pepto-Bismol. I had to laugh about that. I don't think they really wanted you to take something like that seriously. It's a low budget and it's extremely easy to see where they reduce costs and save a great deal of money. I thought, in a world where there could be a killer "Lift" and a "Blood Beach", this "death bed" could be fun to watch. For reasons that could lead to costs, 90% of the film is a voiceover, no one screams or shows extremely low signs of fear / confusion as to why a bed would attack (I can think of one and I've never been one of those children jumping on the bed) and you will have to incredibly suspend your disbelief. (A victim loses all the flesh on his hands, barely saying "ow.") Was only one scene, which lasted too long, minutely tense ?? a woman tries to crawl away only to be dragged back, using a sheet. Where are the MST3k guys?
