Finally a film that rivals "El Padrino" and "Darkness Falls" in terms of absolute and absolute obtuseness. This is actually the first movie I ever gave 1 in 10 to IMDb, and for good reason. <br /> <br /> For one, the cast is nothing special. This is usually not a problem for me except that the only character that is still interesting or different from everything else is Harrington of Grand L. Bush. Secondly, the production has a lower value - television science fiction as "Stargate" has more convincing sets, and all the underwater scenes NOT run by the SFX teams are shot on dry sets with "falling particles" that are not very convincing. This film is literally "drydocked". The worst part is that this film is BORING. For the first 45 minutes, I felt like we were going around in circles: "He is a prehistoric shark". "Bullsh * t". "No, really." "Bullsh * t". "I'm not making this up." "Bullsh * t". "Here it is, now!" "I have not seen anything." "Let me guess?" "Yes. Bullsh * t." After that, it rises slightly for about twenty minutes. So let's go back to the dialog box. Dialogue is not a bad thing, but this is all that this film has. Speaking characters. Again, this is not a bad thing, except that this film is not very good. Dialogue is often forced and clich√© and is not very interesting to listen to. I don't see any point that offends the special effects; this film has worse qualities. <br /> <br /> The sets are small and unrealistic. The acting is sub-par. The script - oh Lord, the script - is worse than a trash on science fiction television that has to pull up. Makes you wonder where this film's budget was or was. <br /> <br /> Yet another terrible, horrible addition to the "Megaloadon" movie series (there are about four). Give Steve Alten, please ...
