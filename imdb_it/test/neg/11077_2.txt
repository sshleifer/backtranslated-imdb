I can't say if "The Cavern" is a parody of "The Cave" because I haven't seen it. I have seen "The Descent" and it is not terrible, but it is very difficult to look at and it is also for this reason. Difficult to look at, as in, there is very little light and a lot of fast movement, so it's hard to say what you're looking at. There are times when I imagine you should be afraid, judging by the music, but are you afraid of what? Bad camera? Poor lighting? If this is the case, it should be the scariest movie made. The story is that a group of cave explorers go to a cave in Kazakhstan (home of Borat) and make their descent, but something is (obviously) in there with them. And what is it? A guy says he's a wolf / bear hybrid, that is, just before it splits, but whatever it is, you can't see it. And just when you think (or hope) that the film ends, since the screen goes dark for a while, you see the two cavers left (the two women) wake up somewhere in Betty and Wilma's clothes and start looking find the way out of wherever they are. They drink some water and start eating SOMETHING until they find out what it is and start vomiting ... and then the mystery of what is in the cave appears, and you will simply be amazed. Maybe yes maybe no. Dumb stupid dumb .... I think I'm pretty well done with cave films at this point, 2 out of 10.
