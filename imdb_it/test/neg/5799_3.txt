I have to say that I was very excited about this film before renting it like an Adam Sandler production "Happy Madison" and I'm usually attracted to that kind of silly humor. <br /> <br /> There were some funny moments at the beginning of the film, but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie. I realize that many films that are not realistic can still be quite funny, but this film was unrealistic and not at all funny. The acting was horrible, the cinematography was very poor, the plot made no sense. I can't get over the fact that 3 older class women would work to write so badly. Overall, I was very impressed with this movie and I don't recommend wasting $ 5 on the rental.
