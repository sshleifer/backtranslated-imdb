Carlos Mencia is not fun. From his stand up special to this wrecked train of a TV series, Carlos Mencia is not fun. I tried to convince people for two years that he steals the other comedians' jokes, and as for the material of his comedy, he is a "Johnny-as-latest", with results much lower than those sub-par. Astronaut psycho jokes? Britney Spears breaking jokes? I hope this is just a scheduling error, but let's go to Carlos and Comedy Central, those topics, and many others, have dominated the late-night TV show monologues, Saturday Night Live, Mad TV and many others. Surprising ethnic and racial stereotypes? The comedy has no chance of evolving with Carlos Mencia around. Perhaps the people, especially the spectators and executives of Comedy Central, will get the point since this week's issue of "New York" magazine labeled it precisely: "Carlos Mencia, unrepentant prank-filcher".
