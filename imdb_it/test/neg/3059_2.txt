When this film was released in 1996, director Mark Lester had been making narrow and sharp action B images for more than 20 years. He was responsible for the large "Truck Stop Women" of the 1970s and many other small gems; unfortunately, he is also responsible for this disaster. It's a shame to see the talent - and still smoking - Theresa Russell has lost again, but is still the best actor in this photo. Eric Roberts shows up for a while, does his Eric Roberts thing, then leaves, an event not entirely unwelcome in a photo with Eric Roberts. Frank Stallone is actually not bad, which should give you an idea of ​​how pathetic this picture really is. As mentioned by other reviewers, the action scenes - which is why a photo like this is realized in the first place - are almost completely illogical and unrealistic, as well as being a bit inept. Apart from some "vintage" clothes and some old cars, there is nothing strange about the 1930s, the era in which this film is set. A script written with annoying deadlines in logic and little historical accuracy - this is not a documentary, of course, but filmmakers might have at least TRIED for some authenticity - and shows ranging from grade B to elementary school banish this little quickie inexpensive at the 4:00 Sunday slot on HBO, which is right where I saw it.
