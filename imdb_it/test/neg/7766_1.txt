The first time I saw him I drew myself back to HORROR in what was presented as a modern and liberated woman. Sorry, but I can't tell idiots whining whose lives revolve around sex without love and the acquisition of Gucci, Etichette Prada and Louis Vuitton. The worrying thing is that some may actually think that this is how career women live in New York. It is absolutely not. These women are incredibly superficial and materialistic and, as another reviewer said, behave like golden swarming dogs. <br /> <br /> This is not liberated femininity and I'm glad it's gone. 0 stars and simply AWFUL
