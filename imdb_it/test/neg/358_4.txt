Despite the fact that it was a "Made-For-TV" movie (and of course obvious), CLASS WARFARE let me wish I could get my money back, and considering that this lame production was partially funded through Canada dollars, I could have the right. <br /> <br /> What made me go through it in the first place was to see actress Lindsey McKeon, whom I saw in the last two years in her role as "goody-goody" "Mara Lewis on the soap -work GUIDING LIGHT, in turn to play "the bad girl" for a change. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, she does quite well, like Kristen, a rich spoiled girl who suddenly finds herself poor in dirt, but with a conniving vein and a turning point in destiny, which will perhaps change its fortunes back around.The fate of destiny is given by the character of Richard (Robin Dunne), a socially radical outcast who discovers he has just passed by having nothing win $ 23 million on a lottery ticket Now, put Richard, Kristen, his jock-boy Jason (Wade Carpenter), and their mutual camera buddy Graham (Dave McGowan) together for the weekend in a remote booth, cut out of the world from storms, and only guess so a takes place. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from congestion in both the story and the characters and the motivations of the characters. Everyone is rather one-dimensional and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that some things, and some people, will go very badly, very quickly. I don't think this is an original storyline and it doesn't go out of its way to do something more. The acting is OK, McKeon is well chosen as the protagonist of the female manipulation, and Dunne is very good, maybe a little too good sometimes, but it's not worth writing it at home. The only other real credit that I can give to the film is the only turning point that I have not seen coming towards the end (but not in the end, however, that is so obvious that it hurts). Regardless, I sat through it all and lived to tell the story, so I can't say it was a complete reset. <br /> <br /> 4/10. A film like "something to watch when it's impossible".
