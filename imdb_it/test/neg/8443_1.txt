I was seriously robbed with this purchase. The other posters cover the flaws of this poor film quite well. My DVD that I actually bought had the 1978 cover of Piranha on the cover with the credits for the movie "Directed by Joe Dante", etc. I was really disappointed to find the wrong movie on the record. I'm actually a fan of many bad movies. There is always something fun or at least fun in most of them somewhere. This film! In reality I will spend the three dollars in cash for the gas to return this two-dollar DVD just for the principle of the thing. False obvious packaging here. Easily the worst movie of all time. No redemption factor. DON'T GO THERE !!! It's not even worth checking just to see how bad it is. Seriously.
