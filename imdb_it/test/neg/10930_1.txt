This film is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. A woman "The EX" pretends to be a number of people in order to gain access to her ex-husband. Kill people without reason in the bathrooms to reach their goal. The women I don't think have ever gone to acting college. He just spends the whole movie making silly expressions, and he seems to be trying to do his best to avoid looking into the camera. Failing on most occasions. He befriends his ex-husband's wife and son, he does so to use them against her husband. At first, when you watch this movie, you think the ex wants to kill his ex-husband, maybe because he treated her badly. But in reality women are obsessed with man and want him back. The two used to have fun with entertainment (using whips of course). My advice to the public is not to buy this film, not to rent this film and not to watch it like I did (at 1.15 pm on FOX)
