I have buzzing. A good-looking kid gets into trouble, the poor girl falls in love with him, the ex-jealous boyfriend causes tension .. yadda yadda. Actually I laughed aloud in many parts of this film because the next scene was so predictable and simply stupid. As one scene moved on to the next, I often found myself wondering how we got there, as if I had skipped some chapters in a book. <br /> <br /> The script was rather painful and I didn't have it or my wife cares a lot about some of the characters, except the abandoned boyfriend. Now, if the ex-boyfriend had had an ax and had set apart the girl and the rich child, then ... then we would have had a movie, and all the stupid dialogues and jumps in the plot could be acceptable. But, since this film tries to be touching and totally devoid of the boat (and ends up resorting to the equivalent romanticism of the divine intervention to try to snatch a tear) ... it falls very very flat. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Hook your toenails instead, you'll have more fun.
