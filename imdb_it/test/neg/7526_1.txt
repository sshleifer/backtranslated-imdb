H. G. Wells is running. There is no doubt. <br /> <br /> Actually, it would have been a decent science fiction / adventure film, if it weren't based on a classic novel and directed by the author's nephew. I kept hearing how this would be the final version of the novel. What resulted was a pathetic and simple bastardization. <br /> <br /> The novel is a great science fiction story, but what many people miss when they read it (probably because they read it when they are very young) is that it is overflowing with social commentary. The Elois and Morlocks are a satire of the class distinctions of Victorian England, and the general message of the film is that EVERYTHING DECIDES AND DEGENERA, a satirical blow to Victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization would last forever. There is no love story, no romance with a beautiful Eloi woman ... in the novel, the Elois are three meters tall childish beings with a mental capacity not much higher than that of an animal. The Time Traveler makes friends with an Eloi woman, but it is clear that he thinks of her more like a pet, and in any case is killed before the novel ends. <br /> <br /> This film first tries to give us a totally stupid background "because it wants to travel through time." Triumphant romance and the lessons he has to learn are enough to make movie fans vomit. <br /> <br /> The journey into the future is marked by a future disaster. OK, not bad, but it would have had more punch if we had been allowed to see that humanity degenerates in general, as in the book. More a reflection of the times, I suppose, like a nuclear war took place in George Pal's version. <br /> <br /> The general story? Ugh. A total distortion of the novel. The Elois are too competent and warlike. The Morlocks are too intelligent. The UberMorlock is embarrassing and there are no settings. He shows up just in time to be killed. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba does OK. Guy Pearce is one of my favorites but he often seems confused and sore. (He reportedly broke a rib during filming.) He too looks unhealthy and too thin, as if he had been ill for a long time before doing so. <br /> <br /> A sad, sad film version of one of the classics of the world. H. G. Wells deserves better .... MUCH better. <br /> <br />
