In a happy family comes the gypsy, played by Myrna Loy. With his incredibly wild hair and his voice that seems very sharp and strange, it's hard to believe it's Loy !! He bears no resemblance to the refined and amusing character Nora Charles who played in the films Thin Man. Instead, he behaves so badly that you almost expect him to be in an Ed Wood movie. What a huge difference a few years have made in the quality films that he obtained as well as his acting ability !! In addition to the terribly stupid character, the film also fails because it is not interesting or exciting - just very, very tired and stupid. The only good thing is the Vitaphone sound system - which makes the sound quality of this turkey the best I've heard since 1929. Heck, it was even better than most movies from the 1930s, so the sound engineer has at least something to offer proud of - everyone else, forget it. <br /> <br /> This is a film that even Turner Classic Movies guest called a "guilty pleasure" because the film is so ugly! And, after seeing it, I don't agree ... slightly. The film is simply bad.
