This film does not look like City of God at all, you may have the same feeling, but it is not, there are no intense or intense drug scenes, you have an idea. If you ask me, I think this film was a waste of time, there are many other films that give a meaning and a teaching 100 times better than "Wooden Camera". Yes, I could be the only one to give a negative comment for this film, but it's just me. It's one of those movies where I can get the feeling of being swept away, but when the credits start acting, my friends and I took a look at each other, and we all laughed at how ridiculous this movie was. So to conclude this topic, I advise you not to watch it. <br /> <br /> Personal note - Making Africans speak English was a big mistake. In City of God they used their native language which gave the film much more power and reality.
