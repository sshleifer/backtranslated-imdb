When I first saw the previews of this movie on TV, I thought it could be a funny movie. I was wrong. All if I'm not totally against the movies that make fun of others. Some are actually funny like the first horror movie. This was one of the many that were made late that are not. The humor in this film was far from fun and was rather boring. <br /> <br /> I feel that one of the biggest problems is that they have entertained many movies like Varsity Blues, Friday Night Lights, Stick it, etc. And if you're like me, try choosing each movie instead of paying attention to what's going on in this movie. Even the adult humor in this film was dry. Do yourself a favor and save money and time and rent not rent this movie
