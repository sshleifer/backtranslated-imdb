You just need to see it as a poorly executed anti-abortion propaganda and you will realize how bad it really is. The main message of this film is that even the sickest people cannot commit abortions. If you ask that it is not very far from detonating abortion clinics. So this guy wants to kill a poor girl, but first he has to convince her to do an abortion. What a load of shit. And the worst part is that he has a convincing argument (bringing a child into a loveless environment), but that he should be fired because he's a monster anyway. And the part with the Bible dealers ... first throw this girl out just because she explains that someone stole her money (that rule must be in the Bible somewhere) and then in the end I'm kind of an angel like deus ex car that delivers the murderer from the evil by harassing him in his yard. Come on. Other downpoints include a very confusing scenario (and I don't mean in a good way) ... so this guy is just a little psycho why? Why did your mother have a little liver once? And I don't know for the rest of you, but it seemed like the nicest person in the world for the duration of the trip! even though she wore girlish clothes, she stole money and registered girls in her car. If you forget the idiot story, this movie has a really great cinematography and Bob Hoskins was truly exceptional, and has one of those fun little English cars. If it was actually a psychopathic killer, I'd give at least a 7.
