This film is about a group of people who have been infected by a powerful man-made virus. They are persecuted by government men in the desert. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is quite interesting but it is hampered by the fact that the delivery is extremely boring. The film never involves the viewer at any level. Sure, the tiny budget is a problem, but it's not the reason for the failure of the film. Much more guilt is the very pungent delivery. There is a great deal of narrative but, unfortunately, the narrator has an annoyingly too dramatic voice. Very little seems to happen to these people and long before the end there will be cheering for the men of the government - the sooner they kill the protagonists the sooner the film will end. A much better title for this film would have been Four People Run About In the Desert with some footage of a helicopter. Overall, very boring.
