I'm actually still in doubt if there's anything in this film that I like. As for the story: unrealistic and very exaggerated. The acting was too bad in my opinion. Not very likely that Antonie Kamerling will get the status of Rutger Hauer. Some will wait for it anyway. First let me work on his English pronunciation. If you look at the "journey" in Paris of these actors (DVD-extra), you will most likely want to come up with it. Tips for Beau Dorens: stop your acting career, you'll never get there ... To the 2 main actors: grow up, please. Being generous, I would give 4 out of 10. <br /> <br />
