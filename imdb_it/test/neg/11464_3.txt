This film is called "Solomon Kane". Which is not. The main character wears a hat, but that's all he has in common with the character of Robert Howard, Solomon Kane, known from the first pasta magazines and many publications since. It's a fantasy film, not so bad, and could easily have gone through a pretty good review - if it wasn't Solomon Kane. The hero is a newly invented character who is definitely not SK. Nor is the story of Robert Howard. <br /> <br /> As a fantasy film is another film that follows the traditions of the genre: simple story, poor CGI, poor actors, poor directors. Yet it can be fun, you know: "the more they are, the better they are". But since it's called Solomon Kane, I can't accept it. Imagine a Lord of the Rings movie with a Bilbo hero fighting the black wizard Saugalf with the help of his dwarf friend Aragorn and the beautiful heroine Shadowfax. And in a final fight where the three use a magic ring to kill the evil wizard who turned into the Gondorian dragon. Imagine that. This is exactly what this film did with the character of Robert Howard Solomon Kane. <br /> <br /> I'd give him a 4-star review if it was just another horror movie, but since it's called Solomon Kane, I can only vote for 3 stars.
