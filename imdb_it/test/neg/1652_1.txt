Oh, how I laughed ... this one has it all ... an Asian / white family, a disabled Asian boy ... everything a healthy person needs to see in the BBC's eyes. <br /> <br /> What an absolute tribe: this was a total insult to my eyes that saw this garbage for one episode and ONE EPISODE. <br /> <br /> When you think of some of the qualities that the BBC has put out over the years (Fawlty Torri for example) and then this comes to fruition ... It's a shameful dishonor. <br /> <br /> Everything is oriented towards political correctness and is devoid of any humor. <br /> <br /> This is straight from the bowels of hell: but what would you expect from the far left BPC ... I mean the BBC.
