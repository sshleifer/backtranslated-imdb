1993 was a period of changes in the WWE but for this Wrestlemania they decided to go back in time while Hulk Hogan returned, along with his good friend Brutus Beefcake, who had been out of wrestling by a paragliding accident in 1990. <br /> <br /> This was not a great event. Only two games had a real build and the whole thing was rushed. The in-ring action was not great and the turning point at the end, which I will discuss later, was not the shocking moment that the WWE hoped it would be. <br /> <br /> This unforgettable night began with Shawn Micheals defending his intercontinental championship against the undefeated Tatanka. Tatanka had beaten Michaels a couple of times in the fight. Michaels had a new manager, Luna Vachon, while Tatanka was accompanied by Michaels' former manager and the future WWE Hall of Fame, Sherri Martel. Tatanka won by DQ. Michaels retained the title and returned directly to the feud with Marty Janetty, who was put on hold only for Wrestlemania. Because, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Next up saw the Steiner Brothers (Scott and Rick) defeat the Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) with Scott who scored the pin after hitting Samu with the Frankensteiner. Good game. <br /> <br /> Doink the clown needed the help of another clown to win his game against Crush. A second Doink who distracted Crush when he was in complete control and allowed Doink to get the pin and win. Doink was a fun gimmick, which became quite fast. <br /> <br /> Razor Ramon easily defeated Bob Backlund's return in the next game. <br /> <br /> This brings us to the first of our double main events. Like the Mega Maniacs Team of Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake, with the newly transformed good boy Jimmy Hart in their corner, he hired former Hart Money Inc companions (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster). This was a pretty sketchy finish. Beefcake, as mentioned, had been in a paragliding accident that required full face surgery and struggled with a facial mask. Shyster tore off his mask and beat Beefcake to a pulp. The referee went down, Hogan grabbed the mask and knocked DiBIase and Shyster down and then Hart, who was wearing a referee shirt, counted the three. Another ref came down and canceled the decision, declaring the winners of Money Inc by DQ. <br /> <br /> Go ahead on Lex Luger or the narcissist as he was also known at the time defeated Mr Perfect. This match was born because Luger was managed by Perfect's old manager, Bobby Heenan. Perfect had his feet on the ropes when he was pinned, but the referee missed him. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker achieved a weak DQ victory in a rather poor game against Giant Gonzales. The Undertaker had earned the wrath of Gonzales' manager Harvey Wippleman in 1992 and Taker had defeated his great monster Kamala at the Survivor Series. Wippleman vowed revenge and took him to the Royal Rumble when Gonzales attacked Taker, and cost him the game. Gonzales dominated the Undertaker in this match, but was disqualified for choking Taker with chloroform. Strange ending for a bad game. <br /> <br /> This led us to our main event as WWE champion Bret Hart, seriously challenged as a champion for the first time, put his title in the balance against Fuji Yokozuna's unstoppable monster. Yokozuna controlled the start, but Hart resisted and took control. He had Yokozuna in the chosen shooter, surely he would have succumbed and Hart would have become a heroic hero after eliminating the great monster. But Fuji had other ideas, throwing salt in Hart's face, making the Canadian helpless while Yokozuna took the pin. <br /> <br /> What an end to the end. But wait here comes Hulk Hogan. He's checking Hart to make sure he's okay. Suddenly Fuji challenges Hogan to a WWE title right there and there. Hogan accepts. Fuji throws salt towards Hogan, but instead hits Yokozuna. Hogan hits the leg and wins the game and the title. What did I just see? And so, what most fans thought would be the night when we saw Hart as a giant killer, or Yokozuna established himself as an unstoppable monster, we instead saw Hulk Hogan win a meaningless title. A title that he would not have defended for three months. In fact this was the only game Hogan had fought for the WWE before the king of the Ring PPV in June 1993.
