Jimmy Stewart, inefficient, poisoned, self-pitying and lousy, is having a bad marriage with Carole Lombard. After falling into hard times, he suffers a debasing job, an unfeeling, passive-aggressive live mother who desperately needs an epic smackdown and a child who cries endlessly. The trowels of the film about failure and squalor do not have a visible end. Do you want to watch a couple of quarrels with your mother for ninety minutes? Many scenes feature a screaming child. The film fails to make clear why we would like to bear the mother from hell, or why Jimmy Stewart cannot grow a pair. Who wanted to see this? Who wanted to see Stewart and Lombard without laughing or enchanting? <br /> <br /> It is utterly depressing and unbearable.
