I loved Bellocchio's last film, the masterpiece "The Hour of Religion". He had a fantastic script, great actors (well, I have to say that Castellitto is much bigger than others), a brilliant use of lights for a great photograph. <br /> <br /> Well, Good Morning Night is a different story. A ridiculous script erupts tons of morals (and we could talk about weeks of politics, you know we are Italians ...). Little cinematography (it's too simple to represent the dark years of the '70s with dark colors and dark lights, make some effort in more peoples !!!!). Bad use of music: what is the use of psychedelia to represent the tragic rationality of the Red Brigades? <br /> <br /> And to all the people who have won the first prize in Venice, I reply: "Are you crazy ???" Maybe the Russian movie was bad but not so bad. <br /> <br /> I'm down with P.E. Don't believe the hype !!!!
