I can't emphasize enough, do * DON'T * take this movie for kids. <br /> <br /> For this, you should also save the adults. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating a little. This is not the worst film for children ... no, let me reformulate you. This is not the worst film made by disguised adults FOR dissenting adults and somehow marketed towards children (it would be "Jack", who intended to revise / gut like a fish). <br /> <br /> Adults will not learn anything surprising (well, if necessary, fast forward before the end credits for an educational bit on an interesting cosmic phenomenal). Usually we do not end up as adults doing what we wanted to do as children, since reality tends to get in the way. Well, I could have told you (so I can do four years of college at an art school, but I degrade myself). <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the guys can do to get out of this movie. Most likely it will only upset them (we will see the time when Russ was traumatized at age eight). There is a better movie, "Kiki Delivery Service", which has essentially the same message, but handles it conspicuously instead of drilling it in your head. Even adults will appreciate it! <br /> <br /> By the way, there is a moment in the film made with the amature MST3K-in in mind, if they think of that other Bruce Willis movie with a sad little boy inside.
