This is an old-dark movie. A young couple creeps around a strange villa that is said to be headed by Satan, where they run from one to another to a mismatched team: a struggling lady, a monkey, a monkey man, a dwarf, various types watching people, and (for some reason) two Chinese. They end up in a throne room where the hero is forced to play a sort of "Price Is Right" race which involves a climb of seven steps with seven illuminated footprints; hence the title. For my taste it's too much of the same thing. The creeping around the aisles of the house is fun for a while, then it becomes repetitive. Compared to Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton or Laurel and Hardy who do the same bit on two reels, it's not really funny. Not even scary, and apparently was not destined to be: the family is too absurd. Most movies in this genre balance the comedy with a real threat, and generally two - one that the characters are led to believe is real, and another for which it is a cover. Here the cover should not be taken seriously, nor should it be covered. Some fun moments emerge from the mix, but it's pretty fun. The novel on which the film was based was a straight thriller and I think it could have been interpreted directly with better effects - and it could still be.
