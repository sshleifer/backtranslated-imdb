the first addict film was dark, bloody and hilly. This film is a merciless battle for cheezy jazz music, not at all true, and the worst drug addict mask I've ever seen! His deep voice is now a light and happy voice, the characters of the first part reappear from actors who don't seem NOTHING like them (Claire, Mom Junko), the characters' names change (Claire or Sara?). All the brutal violence, dark humor and political inaccuracy of the first film is missing. Had it not been for nudity, this film could have been evaluated as PG. Really lame. I'm a big fan of Part 1, but I can't stand this.
