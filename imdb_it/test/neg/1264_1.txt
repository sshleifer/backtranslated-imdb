Czech film-goers may have appreciated and evaluated this film a lot because it was Czech, but I found it to be banal, boring, boring, bland and boring. Once again, I suspect "spreading" to increase this dog's sales of a movie. Amazon describes this film as if it were a couple of friends who refuse to grow up, but I'll make one later - I think they are two people who have entered a state of dementia and perform actions that make no sense to anyone. I was told that one of the actors in the film committed suicide after the film, and I would have believed it. When he saw his performance he probably realized what had been a horrible job he had done and realized that the only way to avoid the terminal embarrassment was to make the "big exit", which are certainly much more dramatic and a much better performance than he had done in "Autumn Spring". Don't waste your time or money on this pathetic performance. It is nothing more than a dog in a manger.
