This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I tried to appreciate this movie but they managed to ruin practically every aspect of this movie! Economic dialogue, no character development, no tension, not enough history to pull you in, no action apart from some really cheap scenes. Looks like they tried some things on the set and said "hey, this looks pretty nice, why not put it there", after which the director probably said "Yes ... Yes, this is genius!" and I went back to snorting coke or something. When it comes to acting, I think the only person to TRY to make the film work is Daan Schuurmans, but in the end it's all for nothing. Because this movie sucks !! 2/10
