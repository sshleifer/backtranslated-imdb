I took it on HBO under its "Guilty Pleasures" category, and I agree that I felt guilty (and welcome) at watching it. One, it's really vulgar trash and garbage. Two, the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn "who did", you think "So what?". However, I have to admit that I am quite a chauvinist male pig to want to go through what is obviously a poor movie, if only to see Peta Wilson become completely naked a number of times. Do I feel dirty for seeing it? Yes. Sorry if I saw it? No. Therefore, there is the contradiction between being a lover of good films and a lover of female anatomy, even when in a poor film. Sigh!
