A really flatulent script, and I was very disappointed with Marc Singer for agreeing to be there. <br /> <br /> I actually left the cinema for about 15-20 minutes and asked for my money back. Actually I came out of a movie only 3 times in my life (I'm 43) and this is the only one that made me mad enough to ask for the price of my ticket back. If I could, I would get a refund even for popcorn. This was a really bad movie, and there is no excuse. <br /> <br /> First, how does someone who grew up as a pre-tech barbarian learn to drive a car? In California!!!? (Driving a car is a bit of a complicated skill, and in California, even more complicated ... I should know, I live there.)
