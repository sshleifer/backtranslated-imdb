Did the writer of this film not see the other three? I loved the original, I thought 2 was the best, I tolerated 3 (it was OK, nothing special). But I hated this. Who dare kill UG? This was certainly not the UG that had been almost like a brother of Charlie in the number 2. Remember his speech? Charlie said, "You wouldn't leave me on Earth, would you?" Ug replied, "Charlie, Bounty Hunter", saying he was now one of them now. How dare the writers ignore this special bond between them and turn it into a villain who is killed by Charlie (in a particularly embarrassing scene) just because they understand that the film was getting boring. In fact, for the first 20 minutes, we get a new cast and we have to wait so long until we find out what happened to Charlie, who was the hero we were waiting to see. I kept waiting saying "Come on, when will Charlie appear?" Angela Basset must do her best to deny that she was ever in this Turkey. Moving it to the future eliminates the possibility of ever seeing a sequel with the original cast or in our time. I think the writers decided that their film would be the last and that they could do whatever they wanted. This film totally disagrees with the first two. And it doesn't even seem to have been written by the same people who did 3. 3 at least had a humor and could easily be seen by younger children. 4 is just ugly and mean (Eric DaRe) is particularly cruel and useless. I hated this movie Hated, hated, hated. I hated the fact that someone might like and hated the fact that it ruined what was one of my favorite field classics. I give this a start simply because IMDb.com won't let me give it a zero.
