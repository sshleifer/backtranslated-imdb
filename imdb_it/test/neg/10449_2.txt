the plot of this film revolves around this submarine builder who is a real bastard and wants to launch his new submarine that can travel thousands of meters deep. unfortunately, it cannot. oh yes, and he is obsessed with memories of his mother and father being eaten by a megalodon when he was a child. the boy meets a scientist who is very hot, and they and this troupe of about a hundred people jumped on the main character's submarine to kill the same megalodon that killed his parents. Now the shark in this film is a really bad-looking CGI shark. in practice this is a bit like Shark Attack 3, except that it is more depressing. if you don't understand what I mean, listen. the opening credits of the film show "home movies" of the main character when he was a child with his parents before they were killed, and in the background there was really sad and depressing piano music. you would expect to see a shark or something, and you do it. a short shadow of the CGI shark floats around every few seconds, but that's right. furthermore, I don't remember a happy facial expression during the entire runtime of the film, most of the film takes place in the darkness of the abyss, where the story becomes even more boring and all the characters (even the shark) die in the end . I was thinking that on Saturday he would be able to kill the shark and be able to save himself and the girl, but no, they all die, and the film ends with the shark, all blown up, and the submarine (with the body crushed and burned) of Sabato in it) sinking in the abyss. if you are a happy person and do not like to be depressed, avoid this movie. if you're the opposite, then congratulations, you've found your movie.
