After sitting in this terrible excuse of 82 minutes of a movie, and having previously wanted to steal my eyes after seeing another mess of James Toback entitled "When will I Be Loved", I came to the conclusion that he has the best agent of the world. How else can these pieces of rubbish written in a horrible and painfully direct way be made? <br /> <br /> I like Robert Downey Jr., but being in this movie has led to substance abuse. <Br /> <br /> Heather Graham must be embarrassed about her zombified performance. Half of the times the camera is on her, she is looking at herself in a daze. <br /> <br /> Such a lousy script. Get ready to make the name of Hollywood in abundance (for example: five minutes of meanders on the acting of Denzel Washington ... etc.). There is a great character in the novel by Joseph Heller Catch-22, Dunbar. He spends most of his time in the novel clay pigeon shooting, which he abhors. When asked why he shoots all the time if he hates her so much, he replies that he makes time CREEP, and will have a longer life. Well ... if you really want to feel the time creep in, watch this movie! I swear ... the 82 minutes will feel longer than a 4 hour David Lean epic. It goes on and on and on and on ... <br /> <br /> I hope I never watch another James Toback movie again. If I could give this NO STAR, I'd do it.
