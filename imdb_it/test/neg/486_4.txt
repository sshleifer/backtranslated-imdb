Okul "The School" is the result of a new trend in Turkish cinema. Having always used the same stories, new generation directors have finally had different ideas. Of course, it doesn't mean they are all great. I think Okul is one of them. It should be a scary movie but it is not. It didn't even happen to be scary. So what is it? The actors are so mediocre, especially Deniz Akkaya is rather annoying with the role of teacher. I'm sure it could have been better if it was tried harder. Perhaps focus on a topic like making it scary or vice versa. But the directors missed the goal this time. ** outside *****
