my friends and I are always looking for chuck norris movies to have fun and make fun of them. One of our favorites so far is Lonewolf. I went to a martin Christmas market and came across this movie in the 5.99 trash. I had to take it I had high hopes for this film and, although I was sometimes hilarious, we agreed that the bells of innocence are the worst movie we've ever seen, made, produced, thought, etc ... who the hell might think this is a good idea. sometimes it's not just confusing, but acting is hard to watch. the man who plays oren has acted I can compare to my vomit, and chuck took a dip in it, he's not the greatest actor, but it was terrible. and what kind of names are oren, conrad and jux ........ jux. let's go people. If you honestly thought that this film was absolutely watchable, great for you because it was difficult for me and I had a severe headache and stomach pain after seeing it. I'm telling you now if you haven't seen this movie, NOT !! For the love of God, please do not subject yourself to these horrible 90 minutes of your life.
