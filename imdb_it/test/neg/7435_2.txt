LTL is the formidable and hopeless kind of comedy that can be appreciated by the kind of sheep that stop and listen when they meet a band that plays in a mall. <br /> <br /> I remember that Murray promotes LTL on Larry King's crappy CNN show, where he said something like "if this movie won't become a hit, I'll stop making movies (or comedies)". He was not as jovial as one might think; he must have heard that LTL was an infallible success and that his failure would mean his star status had fallen sharply - so a kind of live-on-air ultimatum for his fans to spend their hard-earned money on a comedy of dumb elephants. (The play is stupid, not the elephant ...) Or maybe he just realized during the shooting (or when he saw the final cut) what a turkey was, so he desperately tried to convince everyone how much optimism he had in the against the LTL quality. "Go see it, it's really good!" The actors are prostitutes entwined with car salesmen. <br /> <br /> LTL is the kind of bad project that comes from the "Amici" comedy school; their motto: "If you are ever short of ideas - or if you've never had them before - then stick an animal in the plot and this will at least let you inject an element of sweetness". Cuteness = a sad substitute for the lack of fun gags. The other motto "Friends" was: "Always include useless, boring sentimentality", with which this film ends so predictably, when Murray says rather pathetically: "what they forgot to tell you is that you never forget an elephant". Maybe not an elephant, but I certainly managed to forget this turkey, which I saw many years ago. I was suddenly reminded when I saw a scene on TV today (hence this review equally useless). Murray wastes his talent in this turkey (camouflaged as an elephant), but he is not nearly as interesting as McConaughey's (or in any case the man's name is written); one might think that M.M. He would have had an easy time playing himself, that is, a hick, but it is so painfully little funny and unconvincing that I could hardly bear to see him do such a fool himself. It was worthwhile. To conclude this nonsense, we have that fool of generation X, Garofalo, in a rather useless role. Then again, everything about LTL is useless ... <br /> <br /> After LTL, which he bombed as far as I know, Murray went on to become more of a "serious actor". What is it with these comedians and their inferiority complex? Is it only a question of getting awards, for example "recognition from their peers" (read: votes of their deficient colleagues)? This piece of shit marked the end of a series of good and great Murray films made in the early and mid-90s, like "Groundhog Day", "Quick Change", "Mad Dog & Glory", "Kingpin "," What about Bob? "And" Ed Wood ". Recently we had the immeasurable pleasure of seeing it in garbage / mediocrity as "Hamlet", "Lost In Translation" (you just can't get away from these "ultra talented Coppolas") and "Broken Flowers". Compare those two lots. <br /> <br /> A guy described LTL "funny as heck". Now THAT is the kind of audience that this film was hoping ... Shopping centers and caravans ...
