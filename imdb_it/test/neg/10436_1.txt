The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man defines the film as a comedy. It is certainly not a comedy, rather a boring independent film about a group of losers. Presumably set in the 1970s, there is little attention to the details of the period, with the correction of the too-damped color that takes its place. The monotone soundtrack only serves to accentuate the repetitiveness of the film (perhaps this is the point, but it does not add to the enjoyment of the visual experience). In an impartial way the loser clique just likes to go out in one place, the stands. It seems that the film's packaging as a comedy is intended to trick people into renting or buying this movie, which is a complete waste of time.
