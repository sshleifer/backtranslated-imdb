Naach A more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else on the web. This is a good portrait, even if I don't completely agree. Taran is a commercial guy and therefore only from his point of view. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma (RGV, looks like a political party) has created a marvel in Rangeela, so this looks like a pale reflection of one in some parts ... I don't even intend to compare Urmila and Anthara .. both are good! The first has a better acting talent, even if the latter is recovering pleasantly. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I like the character of Anthara. He is faithful to his art, not touched by useless emotions and definitely not too practical. She is a dance scientist, actually she is so sure of her theories that even the comparison with a scientist would have offended her. Hey .. Donald Trump .. maybe you have to get rid of Melania, here is Anthara and you've already built a Taj Mahal ... isn't that easy? On the other hand, Abhishek is a practical type who wants money, power, fame, etc. So these two, although they are struggling to penetrate the film industry, can't get along, given their different styles and approach to life. This is very typical, but what I like about the movie is that it says what an Abhimaan would say in its total runtime, in a scene! What's new? This film takes a different angle from the film industry and how different people get into it. There is always something different about RGV movies, this one is different too, it's too slow for its standards. In part, he drags one almost to sleep. <br /> <br /> Noticeable It is difficult to notice anything other than Anthara in the first half of the film. I think this leather show was necessary for the dance sequences involved :-) Furthermore, it seems that Anthara is a Yoga professional, he is too flexible, almost like a Prabhu Devi. Aby Baby is improving as an actor in every movie. I'm sure his movie star blood is paying rich dividends. The title song was really good, the overall music was above average.
