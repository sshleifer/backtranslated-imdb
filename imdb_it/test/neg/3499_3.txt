Crash is too rough, over-thought and overcooked. A great example of how to make a pompous and self-important movie with a message. Haggis strives too much to express his point and exceeds in almost all categories of the film. He feels very much in love with his sense of social relevance and has all the subtlety of a jackhammer on his skull. Of course, race relations all affect and there is a great deal of ambiguity about the problem, but the "Crash" universe works to suggest that we are all victims of our perceptions of race. It is an annoying thread that repeats itself until nausea and is consumed in the first 30 minutes. I found the outcomes of the characters not surprising and forced and the film took forever to spit and die. The fact that this film is in the top 50 films on IMDb is a testament to the public's desire to be sucked into Hollywood by malarkey. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you want the real "Crash", go and take a look at David Cronenberg's one: dark, twisted and original. This film sounds like a preacher, boring and masochist.
