Jim Varney's first real movie is a real treat, but don't expect to see Ernest P. Worrel any time soon. I heard that the wide range of characters played by Varney were fantastic, but without being said, the rest of the film should be put in a shredder or something. A rather strange beginning for an icon of a film.
