A man is building a hotel with a partner. He finds out that the hotel is too secure. Things get worse. This movie has a huge pile of scenes. They must have been put together in someone's sleep. Jump from one place to another. It doesn't stay focused on anything for a long time. The finale begins on Christmas morning with a fire at the hotel. So cut to a night scene of that fire and then cut back to the day time. The soundtrack of the DVD is horrible. It takes a right storyline and turns into the worst movie I've had in a long time.
