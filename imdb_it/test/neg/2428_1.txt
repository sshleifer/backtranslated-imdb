Terrible, terrible, horrible ... <br /> <br /> I loved the original film. It was fun, fascinating and had the heart ... this piece of trash has NO ONE of those things. <br /> <br /> Jokes reused from the original film, silly plots, bad animation, different voices (except Kronk and Yzma) that sound NOTHING like those of the original (especially Pacha ... * shudder *). <br /> <br /> The characters are out of model, the animation is flat and boring, it's just a bad job all around. <br /> <br /> And why is Kuzco a jerk again? I thought he had reformed ... but since these television spin-offs are true to the original * he rolls his eyes *. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but there is nothing redeemable in this ... for nothing. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
