Rutger Hauer helps a film that can be summarized in the young man who finds himself a category, and quite obviously so, so he needs a lot of help. <br /> <br /> The beginning has many more promises, than a film that could turn into Michael Clayton or Stranger Than Fiction. It's a shame because I really fell in love at the beginning. So, like the initial soundtrack, it went from big and intriguing to pretty much anywhere. <br /> <br /> It's quite fun, with lots of interesting facts and interesting characters. I'm sure it will be enough for many people. The problem is that everything seems artificial and empty which, ironically, should be the main discovery for the character's self-realization. Not the film itself (it's not a self-conscious film), but the character should recognize that his life is invented and empty.
