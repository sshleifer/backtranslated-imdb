You must add a comment to this !!! <br /> <br /> First of all, ironically, it is necessary to add the "spoloer alert" to conform to the IMDb parameters, but there is absolutely nothing here to "ruin". <br /> <br /> There are six characters: the beautiful girl mentioned in the A-list mountain guide in the area of ​​"climbing" and apparently among all the guides (including Mount Everest Sherpa) on the planet; his lost love, which disappeared from the title titled two years earlier, which the party is looking for, but never finds; his friend the landlord, also a guide, who could be better than a sherpa but cannot compete with her; the strange leading actor who engages his services, and says that they will find his love long gone; his only partner, a computer hacker with a purportedly unlimited competence, of a sufficient level that Gates could seek advice from him; and his other colleague, a bodyguard who apparently has an IQ not even close to three digits. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, atrocities, and the protagonist's secret quest is to obtain the recovery of a satellite that has fallen into the "Passage" and has worldwide and unique data to bring them priceless riches. Exactly what has never been revealed. <br /> <br /> Abundant abounds, the script looks like something that could get a C- in a freshman class (but an F if presented at a higher level), and the actors nibble every piece of scenery as a horde of beavers. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspects of this film have been juxtaposing portions with three other films or roles I've seen. <br /> <br /> First, the mysterious, hidden data secrets recall "The Spanish prisoner", an A-list / Mamet film, which surrounds a valuable "process" company, "never specifically clarified, but better for this.There certainly is not so here. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the peak biscuit proved perhaps even more enterprising then "Rambo" in dealing quickly when threatened later in the presentation. <br /> <br /> Third, I remember a Steven Seagal flick (don't remember the title) where he was semi-conscious and abed for about 1/3 of the time, and completely in a coma for another 1/3. Although I didn't try to view Much of his work, I saw enough to have noticed that while in a coma, he provided the best work he ever did and more in line with his laconic character. In this opus, while he was awake, the young hacker could be the most engaging personality on the screen, but while unwell and incapable du the second part, and unable to emulate, provided the best acting during these seemingly endless two hours. /> <br /> Get the thin and silly base of a plot here. Imagine being compressed, for example, on a LIT on SNL, with Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Martin Short in the four roles. They could get record laughs with few changes to the dialog box here. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspect in the last analysis is the contemplation of what information could have been in the spy satellite to be worth "even billions" to any many nations, and yet rendered useless (according to the hacker of the guru) if you simply put it on the internet, with no apparent consequences from then on? Even a turkey like this should have at least a little trace of logic somewhere. This is totally lacking.
