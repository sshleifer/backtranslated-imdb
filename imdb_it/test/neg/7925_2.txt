This movie is so stupid that I want my $ 2.99 back that I paid !! First, this film starts with a group of wooden actor geeks with a full talent as if they had been teased somewhere because the "real" actors didn't show up for the ridiculous script or simply couldn't find no one desperate enough to make this movie! The music of this film is enough to make you fall asleep, the flute music created for the desert dances would not even be good enough for this movie! And the guy dressed as Satan looks like he's all dressed up in a special Halloween K-Mart costume! There are no dead scenes except for some lame scenes. When I saw what the terrible killers looked like in those bathrobes with Nosferatu faces, I laughed! This is what the whole city should be running away from once a year! This film is one of the worst demonic films I've ever seen. Avoid this!
