One of the horrors of the low budget schlockmeister, the most animated roles of John Carradine as an implicit Nazi scientist, who is turning humans into zombies to serve the Reich. Mind without mind moving, only able to obey the simplest orders ... a bit like the McDonalds staff. <br /> <br /> Hitler is not mentioned by name, since America was not at war at the time they were shot, but it is quite obvious to whom the bad guys work! <br /> <br /> It seems that there are two types of zombies in the film, the traditional type of voodoo popular in the old black and white movies of the 1930s and 40s. Hollow eyes and just following someone else's commands as they stumble. And then there's the guy we know from later movies like "The Night of the Living Dead" and "The Evil Dead". Still around but with only the intention to kill and eat the flesh and brains of their victims. Both have their moments in various films over the years. <br /> <br /> 'Revenge' presents the former type of zombies, though, these are particularly stupid and seem more comfortable in an old monster freak like geeks who bite the heads of chickens. A black zombie named Lazarus with his wild hair, looks like a young Don King. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, the evil doctor decides to make his wife a zombie along with the others and that's where he makes his mistake. Even if he leaves her strappy heels like a nice feminine touch while turning her into one of the living dead, she's not happy. <br /> <br /> Everything becomes horribly wrong and ends in tears, and the moral of the story must be, never, never, turn your wife into a zombie, it's just asking for trouble .... <br /> < br /> The film is quite interesting and goes quickly to the finish, but it never rises above its origins of poverty. Not a patch on any real zombie classic but fun in the same way.
