This film is a waste of time. Even if he has actors who have the potential to do something decent, the acting in the film is sub-par, and has a click-point. "You never know what will happen tomorrow, so live your life to the fullest and do what makes you happy." That phrase saves you from wasting hours of your life in this movie. The people who like this movie are the same people who would like to sit for two hours before discovering that the whole movie was a dream sequence. If the most important part of the film is not going to happen, at least make it look nice and appealing. There is a reason why this project didn't bring out a movie, and even though indy movies can be great, it doesn't even come close.
