I just rented the Blackwater Valley exorcism because the cover and the images looked terrifying, and I don't usually watch movies that are automatically published on DVD, but this seemed so interesting and scary! I was very much in the mood for a good film of fear and for me, possession is one of the scariest themes to watch or know. Just look at The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose, both fantastic films that have not only broken horror but also history. <br /> <br /> The Blackwater Valley exorcism speaks of a girl, Isabelle, who from the get go is automatically possessed, so we can't even say what kind of person she should have started. But a former wife thug turned into a priest with a gardener ...? I know I know. Then come in many other stories with Isabella's priest and sister, and did the priest hit his sister and clashed with Isabelle? I'm not sure, so let's get into a story with Isabelle's father and his questions about his wife's loyalty to him. <br /> <br /> I mean, the story goes in too many directions and wasn't well developed at all. Not to mention the fact that the exorcism does not seem at all authentic and more than a simple fright the pants from a type of film, something that I did not like at all because I could not take it seriously. Anyone who has directed and written this clearly has no idea where to go or how to direct the story well, so I wouldn't really recommend it. <br /> <br /> 2/10
