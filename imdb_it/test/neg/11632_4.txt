Some changes for the better (special effects are more elaborate), some for the worse (Scott Grimes, a nice child in the original, turned into a clumsy teenager), but in general this sequel is roughly equal to the original - which does not say much. The PG-13 rating is questionable; even if the film is not at all scary, there is some short but rather explicit blood, and some misplaced nudity. (* 1/2)
