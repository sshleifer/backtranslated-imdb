Like many of you, I have seen many great films; In the midst of those who often or voluntarily or wrongly we also find those films that are so useless that we think of reasons why someone should make it. This is exactly what I can say for the size of Dead Man .... <br /> <br /> The least I can do is try to "warn" some of you. If you like being entertained by a movie because of the plot, the acting and the intensity of what you might want to choose something else. Now, it's not all bad ..... In fact, if all you want is creative film editing and unique angles with original ambient music, you might think it's OK. As someone who appreciates a movie plot, acting and being entertained by a movie, the truth is that I thought this movie was so terrible beyond words. I could easily find a place for this on my list of the worst movies I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> As for having Val Kilmer in this, the truth is that he was probably chosen as a favor to the director; As a fan of some of Kilmer's films, I can't understand what his motive was. The film looks like part of western romance ......... In the end, I'm sure most of you can agree with me that it's just a rude waste of our time. In case you haven't seen this movie, my recommendation would be to avoid it completely.
