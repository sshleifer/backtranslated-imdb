Do I like science fiction as much as the next man ?? what the hell was that? Apparently filmed in just three days using the excess film left over from his previous film, 'Nana (1926),' this Jean Renoir short is a bewildering futuristic satire, produced on a budget that couldn't have been much more than zero. In the year 2028, following a great war, Africa became the most civilized region on Earth and what was formerly Europe was designated "Terres Inconnues (Unknown Land)". An African explorer ?? played by Johnny Huggins, a black man dressed as a white man dressed as a black man, if you follow me ?? he travels to the ruins of Paris with his spherical plane, and lands out of the den of a Parisian savage (Catherine Hessling, then the director's wife) and his fellow primate, perhaps the most disturbing monkey costume I've ever seen. The savage, as part of a bizarre sexual initiation ritual, begins to show the explorer the Charleston dance, which he is pleased to learn. <br /> <br /> It does not help Hessling the film, which was wonderful the following year in "The Little Match Girl (1928)" by Renoir, "is not very dancer, although the extensive use of the movement "Slowly adds a touch of surrealism to the ceremony. Furthermore, I am quite shocked that Renoir would have exploited his own wife as such an overt sexual object. It is no surprise to learn of their divorce only three years later! As for the sides positive, I liked the concept of general science fiction behind the film, and the astutely satirical touch of the reversal of racial roles usually typical in stories like this, however, because Renoir decided to dress his black actor as a minstrel will remain a mystery to all the time. Silly, raw and completely useless, "Charleston Parade (1927)" is a cinematographic strangeness of one of the most respected directors of cinema, and it is perhaps an effort he would have liked to forget. ne DVD came without a musical soundtrack, but I compromised with a selection of songs by Dmitri Shostakovich.
