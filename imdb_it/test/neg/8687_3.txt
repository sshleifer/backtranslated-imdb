The Lower Evil begins on "The Strait of San Sebastian 1683" as the treasure ship of the seventeenth century that the Diablo sinks in a violent storm. Go to the "St Sebastian Strait Present Day" where two divers are exploring the beautiful underwater reefs that are rich in wildlife, stumble upon the submerged wreck of El Diablo and explore it but are attacked and killed by something that looks like an eel fierce. Captain Max Cash (Wayne Crawford) owns and operates a rental boat called "Vagrant Viking" which is aimed at tourists who want to fish, dive and generally explore the islands. Sarah Livingstone (June Chadwick) is an art teacher who dives for the treasure as a hobby (well, we all have to do something to pass the right time?), Assolda Max and her succinct assistant Tracy (Sheri Able) so can try to locate El Diablo and get rich. Talking about sunken treasures excites some of the most unscrupulous members of the local community, while they dodge criminals and thugs is brought to the attention of Max and Sarah that the Diablo has a sinister past, a past that apparently still leaves its supernatural legacy behind even now ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Jean-Claude Dubois, according to the IMDb with a little help from the star Crawford although the version I saw only listed Dubois, I thought that The Evil Below had some potential and it is a little different but unfortunately it is not enough to save it from sinking to the bottom of the sea like a stone. Arthur Payne's screenplay starts in OK with the two divers being killed by some sort of sea creature, but this opening is NEVER indicated anymore, the creature is NEVER seen again and there are no more supernatural killings. The Evil Below then suffers from a serious and terminal case of identity crisis, does not seem to know what it wants to be given that it removes fragments of various genres beyond underwater adventure, horror, action, thriller, crime & also has time to launch in a small murder mystery and religious nonsense as well. As a result, the Evil Below is very bizarre, fragmented and since the best scene of the whole film is the opening sequence, I found myself sitting there becoming increasingly frustrated by the lack of a coherent horror as it went downhill quickly and the never see the sea creature again. The Evil Below is boring, slow, uneventful, predictable, silly and lacking in any kind of charm or intelligence, in short The Evil Below does nothing right which should be a good movie. <br /> <br /> Director Dubois fails to rekindle things even though he obviously shot a lot of material about underwater wildlife, as I sometimes thought of watching a National Geographic documentary with all the fish, coral and wild animals in general. Forget any gore, a little blood stained with blood and a cough of blood is as bloody as I am afraid. <br /> <br /> Technically The Evil Below is very simple, it is bland and totally forgettable apart from the beautiful underwater fish photography. This is point & shoot stuff and overall the production values ​​are very low, even the place in which was shot does not seem very sunny or attractive. The acting is poor, but then did you expect more? <br /> <br /> The Evil Below is a poor film, its basic story is everywhere and it can't decide what it wants to be & consequently ends up being a mess. Add it to low production values, to the fact that there is no blood here and to the minimum horror content you have a film that is probably best avoided unless it is absolutely desperate and even then there are surely better ways to spend over 90 minutes your life. .
