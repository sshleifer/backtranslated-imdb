This must be the biggest joke of all time. I'm surprised that all the other actors have had a straight face. I could be wrong, but the impression I got from this film was that they tricked Frank Stallone and Joe Estevez into acting in this film that has a budget of just under $ 40, depending on how much those bats and sprays cost. the most inconsistent movie ever created, and sit back and laugh that Joe Estevez and Frank Stallone weren't involved in the joke. <br /> <br /> If by chance they weren't kidding and they legitimately tried to make a real movie, I'm sorry for everyone involved in the creation. I had a love story with sensible films, but this film is so ugly that I can hardly see it. They repeat unnecessary "special effects" so many times that it is obvious that they were just trying to hide the fact that they only shot 30 minutes of footage. If I were forced to watch this movie on repeat, I would have blamed myself unconsciously with my hands after about one and a half times. No offense to the great Frank Stallone, but I'd rather watch Sylvester teach a painting class by hand for 10 hours than watch that movie again.
