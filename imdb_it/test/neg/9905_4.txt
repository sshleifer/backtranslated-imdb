The first two hours of the TV version are full of character and plot exposure - after a brief tornado hit sequence in Las Vegas, the action doesn't really start until the next two hours. However, some character relationships do not become clear until the second part. The actors turn into competent performances, but nothing special (anyway, better than those of "Aftershock: Earthquake in New York"). An exception is Randy Quaid, whose character is superfluous and incredibly annoying. The plot is a pretty standard mix of parts of "Independence Day", "Speed", "The Day After Tomorrow", "Earthquake", "The Towering Hell" and many other films. You can predict what will happen next, and get closer to predicting dialogue, word by word. The special effects are incredibly bad. Despite the effects in "Twister", the tornadoes of this film seem less realistic than that of "The Wizard of Oz" and other effects have obviously been made for less money than "CSI" and "Cold Case" totality of a single episode. If you have to watch a movie about the disaster created for TV, see "The Next Day", "Asteroid" or "Special Bulletin": you will get better plots, acting and effects.
