*** GREAT SPOILERS! *** "Flesh Feast" of 1970 is a conclusion more than unworthy of the great career of Veronica Lake. This has the great reputation of being a horrible stinker, and rightly so, I must say. Being a big fan of low budget horror / exploitation, especially in the 70s, I still decided to watch it, mainly because of the nice camping image on this site, but after seeing it I had to recognize that the image actually has nothing to do with the movie. The photo on this site is the cover of a DVD collection entitled "Flesh Feast" which contains four films, including "Mountain Of The Cannibal God" by Sergio Martino and "I Eat Your Skin" by Dal Tenney. What the collection does not include, however, is this boring turkey. "Flesh Feast" is not only camp and ridiculous, but above all rather boring, which is even more pathetic since the film lasts only 70 minutes. Also, don't let the title fool you, the film is not at all bloody. Yet it is watchable, if only for its trashiness and, above all, for the extremely stupid, but somehow amusing ending. The film follows a ridiculous plot about Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake), an ingenious scientist who can somehow reconstruct the youth with the help of carnivorous larvae (don't ask yourself how). A group of criminals (or terrorists, or whatever), who are paid by a radical political group, assign the doctor to restore the youth of a "mysterious" commander. After an endless hour of nonsense nonsense, it turns out that the mysterious commander is actually Hitler himself. It was pretty obvious before, but I still had to burst out laughing because the film's ending was so incredibly stupid and unintentionally exhilarating ... This is a movie that is very inadequate as the last film of a great actress and former beauty queen like Veronika Lake. Except for the lake, the performances are ridiculously bad, even for a production with a zero budget like this one. Bad performance, however, is something I can easily forgive in films like this. What I cannot forgive, however, is extreme boredom. The last five minutes make this watchable for the fiercest fans in the camp, but I still recommend skipping it.
