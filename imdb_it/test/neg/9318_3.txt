OK, last night I saw the world premiere of The Exorcist: The Beginning at Paul Schrader's International Fantasy Film Festival. With all the hustle and bustle of the film, it was highly anticipated. <br /> <br /> The director was there and so were most of the stars (except Skarsgard). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the film sucked big time. It was a real disappointment for me because I'm a big fan of Shrader's and Friedkin's original 1973 movie (RIP). <br /> <br /> What was wrong with that? Most of this actually. The FX (you would think that the digital revolution of the Matrix and LOTR never happened: it was made so bad!), The editing (without rhythm or real rhythm), the acting (sometimes only Skarsgard was able to convince). The screenplay was an IMO created to explain African scenes in the original film. So the film had the feeling of an editing scene, but it didn't contribute to anything. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the photograph of Vittorio Storaro, even though I saw better from him (Apocalyps Now). /> <br /> All the while I thought this was just a sharp cut, a work in progress. And this, given the (well known) circumstances, is probably what it is. But that doesn't change the obvious problems with the script. <br /> <br /> I had the chance to meet Schrader (very briefly) but I didn't have the courage to tell him what I thought of the movie and I was so nervous (this is the guy who wrote Taxi Driver for Christ's sake !!) that I forgot to ask him to sign my copy of his Taxi Driver script ...
