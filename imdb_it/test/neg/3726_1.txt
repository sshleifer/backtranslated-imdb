A waste of time, talent and shelf space, this is a truly abysmal film. What are the big leagues like Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Dan Aykroyd who waste their time on this kind of garbage? The little criminal Reeves shows up at his brothers' wedding (Vincent D'Onofrio) and ends with the bride. A comedy?, Thriller?, Romance? I honestly don't know! Reeves is on wood and has hired Dan Aykroyd as a cop is so terrible that he has to be seen to believe it! Diaz is just the bright spot of a dark dark tunnel and she's not that good either. Rent something else. all those involved in this mess should keep their heads in shame and the prey that will be lost in oblivion for years to come.
