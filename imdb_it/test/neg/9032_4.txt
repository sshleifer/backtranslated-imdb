Have you ever wondered why these guys - Seagal, Stallone, Willis and others - manage to survive all those shootings in which they are in the minority? I think I understand. The enemies are always missing, and the hero is not. <br /> <br /> Here, Seagal has a gun and they come out of half a dozen soldiers who shoot him from a few feet away. One of the heavy men has a rifle. Or maybe two of them have. It does not matter. There could be thousands of shotguns exploding against him and Seagal would still emerge with his intact ponytail. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to hand fighting, forget it. The evildoers may or may not be armed with swords or knives or blunt objects, but Seagal, with his skill in aikido or tempura or sushido or in the game or whatever it is, pushes them away with some contemptuous blows. Not only is he a master of these abilities, but his physical strength is Herculean. More than once he breaks someone's long bones as easily as we break a toothpick. One breaks the SPINE of a boy above his knee. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you something. (I'm getting into the spirit of the movie here because Seagal uses that phrase, "I'll tell you something", several times, along with "What should that mean?") These guys fully deserve extinction for any good Xenophobe manual. They are all black, they speak with incomprehensible Jah-MAY-can accents, they wear dreadlocks that desperately need a shampoo, torture and kill with ease, and - here's the worst part. They are not Christians. Quite right. They practice voodoo. <br /> <br /> Actually the voodoo element comes close to being the most interesting element of the film. They obtained the constituents of the ritual quite well: cigar smoke, rum spits, sacrificial chicken. They left only the dance of possession in which the spirit rides the dancer. They should have read Metraux on voodoo. <br /> <br /> Otherwise the plot respects the usual conventions. What was done to Jaqueline Bissett by voodoo practitioners in "The Deep" is done here by a friend of Seagal. What was done to John Wayne when he got stuck in the "McQ" trucks was done here at Seagal himself. At the opening of the film, when Seagal gives a brief speech about having seen too much unnecessary violence in his career at the DEA, he is now happily retired, and when his friends and relatives are introduced to us, I tried to keep track of his affiliates to see if you could choose which ones would be horribly murdered or mutilated to generate his quest for revenge. <br /> <br /> Acting doesn't really require a lot of comments. But Charles, the Jamaican policeman, played by Tom Wright, is really cute. Wright has a considerable radius. Here, he is an associate of dubious loyalty, rather sinister. But in "The Pentagon Wars" it has a comic part that underlies perfectly. <br /> <br /> Jamaicans have never flown like film villains. I don't know why exactly. It's a small film market. And if you go to Jamaica, stay true to Montego Bay. However, if you want to see Jamaican voodoo drug traffickers as heavy, and if you're in the mood for another typical action movie, this should be a satisfying vision.
