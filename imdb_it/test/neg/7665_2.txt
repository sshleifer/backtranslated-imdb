"Airport 4" is basically a combined casino for Universal Studios to try and work on a new twist - the Concorde supersonic airliner - in their "sky disaster" formula. <br /> <br /> Getting bogged down in involuntary humor, the best is when George Kennedy draws his hand from the Concorde window at supersonic speed to fire a rocket launcher on a heat-seeking missile following the plane's flight path and the simple fact that these stupid passengers continue to re-glue the same plan to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air. Many stars in this include Robert Wagner, Sylvia Kristel, Alain Delon and Martha Raye as nervous passengers. <br /> <br /> Not really connected to the other "Airport" films.
