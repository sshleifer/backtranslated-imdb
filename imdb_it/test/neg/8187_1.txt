This is a really terrible movie. The jokes are few and far between and the rhythm is a resistance test in the lower right corner. The only funny thing about this production is the comparison with the classic film "This Is Spinal Tap". <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as if it were one of the plagues of the Bible itself. /> <br />
