Very simply, they are all episodes in syndication and NOT the original uncut / unchanged NBC episodes. It is NOT the first complete season, all the eps are modified to conform to 21:00 for syndication, which means that the lines are cut, an extra commercial fade is included, all the Harvey Korman intrus are not here ... very badly done! Too bad for a series I was waiting for .... booooooooooooooooo! If you are a true Mama fan, don't buy it and go to http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/main/help/whv/customer_service.jsp and send them comments on why we are unhappy about this butcher job to a classic sitcom!
