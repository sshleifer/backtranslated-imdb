An ugly women-of-cell movie rakes the bottom of the midnight movie's barrel, combining a muddy slush with the crazier clich√©s of girls in the shower. Linda Blair plays an innocent who was sent to prison (we learned casually that she was involved in running on a guy in his car), facing difficult times in the Big House with some of the most evil characters alongside a picture of Russ Meyer. Blair is continually beaten, struck, raped, humiliated and harassed. Dialogue is a four-letter word that sucks in everything and the film does not leave sad bursts of violence and stupidity. Yet some viewers see this as a classic of the field, although perhaps his tongue is not far enough from the cheek. * from ****
