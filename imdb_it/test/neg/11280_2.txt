I gave this 2 stars on a possible 10. <br /> <br /> I went into this not realizing what it was - and I found out that it is apparently a kind of African musical - since people break up the song every few minutes. br /> <br /> None of the songs make the rhyme, most of them are not saying anything sensible, and they all have the same non-existent melody - if you could call it a "melody". <br /> <br /> Karmen is a tall and spectacular young woman, with the longest braids I've ever seen. [The actress seems like she probably did a bit of a model.] <br /> <br /> The film opens in a women's prison, though not like any other prison I've ever seen or heard - the inmates they wear anything Desire - and it looks like they're having a party. <br /> <br /> Karmen is making frantic dances, and the woman custodian of the prison, Angelique, [a beautifully attractive woman] is decidedly erotically interested. She and Karmen dance together. Later Karmen visits the guardian's room and they make love - unfortunately the scene is not detailed, and it is very short, although there is some nudity. <br /> <br /> Karmen escapes from prison and then we see her dancing in front of another group in which a man, named Lamine, perhaps a colonel - was never really clear who he was, he looks at her. It is with a young woman who does not like the seductive dances of Karmen and there is a dance between the two women. <br /> <br /> After that the story [as it is] becomes even more confusing. <br /> <br /> With Lamine in prison, out of prison, and who knows where. <br /> <br /> Karmen could be involved in a group of smugglers or thieves. <br /> <br /> There's more singing. Other dances and a scene of Angelique who evidently suffers from a broken heart. <br /> <br /> The film merges with the finish line, and I breathed a sigh of relief that it was over. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
