If you are looking for a movie that makes you sleep, Heart of Darkness is the movie for you. The book was not what I expected it to be, and the film disappointed me even more. The cast list was pitiful, and the overall plot was pathetic and was not like the book except for some scenes. I understand that everyone has their point of view as they read Heart of Darkness and create their own lead film, but the director cuts out important scenes and adds unnecessary. If there was someone in the film who should have been of a certain culture, he would have had to use an actor who belonged to that culture. There are actors everywhere, and I'm sure they might have found the best ones to fit the roles. Joseph Conrad was a respectable man and he created a book that will entertain you if that's what you're looking for, but the film was cheap and useless, and someone who could make the movie as respectable as the book should have done it. If you want a film that takes you into darkness, then Heart of Darkness is the movie for you.
