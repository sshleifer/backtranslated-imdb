Yawn, this is my reaction to this movie. I really hoped it would be a good modern slasher, but it didn't even fall into the coupon category. Instead, try to be something that is not, which is a psychological thriller, and fails so miserably in this. Also the title "Freak" suggests that it could be interesting. Match it to the DVD cover and think "OK, maybe I'll give this a try." It is not worth the time. <br /> <br /> The story actually starts a little interesting with a poor deformed child with bandages wrapped around his head chained by his Fat Mother. She scolds him and probably beats him, because in one scene we see that she actually slaps him for no reason. After all that, he decides that he has had enough and smashes his face with (I think) a stone. Today, he is now in an asylum and is transferred. On his way out of the van where he is and flees. It also features the 2 main characters, a little girl and her older sister. They are moving and hit the road. So most of the movie is shooting them in the car talking to each other. But the banded "Freak" is now on the loose and is about to unleash a grueling murder! (This is me totally sarcastic) <br /> <br /> I can't believe how boring this movie was. The budget was the smallest ever with absolutely no special effect and the dialogue I could care less about. This is one of those films where the packaging is better than the film itself. And to compare this with Halloween ?! Nonsense! I'm not even a fan of the Halloween series (except the third), but Halloween is far superior to this. At least with Halloween we have a great score and some really gruesome moments. With this, there is virtually no music except some piano here and there and there is nothing disturbing about this film. Perhaps this film would have gone better if it had a solid score, because even the worst films are tolerable if the music is good. <br /> <br /> Well, that's just my opinion of the movie. I thought it was just a complete tour of time and money. But since the film has a 4/10 rating on IMDb, there must be people who like this movie. I'm not one of those people. 2/10
