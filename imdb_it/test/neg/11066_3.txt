Monday 2 October 2006 So I went with my father like I always do. We ordered some Japanese takeaways, turned off the lights and pushed the game. I'm an avid fan of horror movies. However, The Cavern released on DVD this October was certainly disappointing. It looked promising, meeting all the standard requirements of any horror film machine: elaborated from an antagonistic present character, a sex scene cannot be omitted, and the pre-spook all too familiar (when they frighten you unexpectedly but it turns out is the idiot friend). Then, finally, when he got to the hard core, I was ready for a real cold-blooded action. The director, I admit, was enthusiastic. Obviously you should be about to fill 81 minutes in all with people running back and forth in a space about 10 feet wide. It all starts when some college "spelunkers" gather for another cave dive. They all seem to be experienced professionals, very serious and spiritual about the whole cave experience. This time they bring a new, annoying photographer too blinded by his National Geographic coverage to understand the dangers of cave diving. As they descend deep into what they call "Pozzo dell'Inferno", they soon realize that they are not alone in the abyss of death. I would kindly greet any spoilers if you are naive enough not to listen to my advice and avoid wasting your time. Although the atmosphere and background music were ghostly; and there was a lot of blood and blood, when the moments approached to witness a real dismemberment it was more like watching a porn movie without the full front. The camera work was deliberately obscure and sketchy. I imagine the director used it for effect. I suppose the thing I like most about the film are the moving characters. They have earned the Acadamy Awards for those who touch litigious scenes. I almost shed a tear when they finally "made it" ... A tear of joy! If you like dry horror, soft porn and you hated Braveheart. Then this is the right movie for your next Saturday night.
