I logged in here immediately after watching this movie, feeling that it was so terrible that at least his reviews could be fun. But all you unbelievers seem a little like this. And so, since I want the work to be done well ... <br /> <br /> From the opening click, the film establishes its contempt for the attention of the public by showing a completely irrelevant image of a irrelevant bridge for a long time. long. Then switch to a skateboard in slow motion, which is at least a little cold, but then compensates for that glimmer of excitement by superimposing the most repellent soundtrack song I've ever heard. Some girl screams in a French whisper on what looks like a plywood sheet that beats together. Anyone who has decided that he should have been there has never driven a skateboard, I guarantee. He seemed to be there to test the limits of public patience. <br /> <br /> From there, the film is in slow motion of 50%. Do you know what's worse than a free slow motion shot? A free slow motion shot of * nothing happens. * Here is a boy walking along a path. Here is a boy sitting. Here is a boy who looks around. Here is a boy who looks at another boy. After a while I started watching the double-speed movie, bringing it down whenever people appeared on the screen engaging in a real dialogue, which was rare. Once, surprisingly, I slowed down the film to find out what a girl was saying, only to find that the camera was showing them, but the sound was another horrible and horrible song and her real voice was not audible. <br /> <This reminds me of a great piece of advice I once heard about writing - if you have nothing to say, don't use fancy tricks to pretend to do it. Go back to work and think of something to say. All these camera tricks, like the slow motion and the strange lighting and the lenses and the bizarre music, are what seem the absence of contents and sounds. A lot of people have apparently bought and perceive emotional gravity and profound meaning, but I think they are projecting this film on a film that has not done any of the jobs needed to create it.
