For Jupiter, what a disaster! Revenge, incestuous love, mechanical games like fighting, incessant and absolutely useless violence, some primitive "music" that pounds the bewildered victims, big "surprises" (which actually tend to be "revealing" like The National Enquirer titles) . Add some shoddy camera movements by pretending to be elegant and creative and you've already impressed the crowd. The totally undeserved popularity of this film strongly indicates that the very low-level pop sub-culture has succeeded not only in reaching in the last decades, but also to impose itself as a dominant taste on an impotent public. (For much deeper insights into human suffering under mental illness, without the vulgar excesses of "Oldboy", I recommend an old Dutch / French film, "The Vanishing".) <br /> <br /> Well, don't believe not there is absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. Indeed there is. The scene (famous) in which the hero (actually he is a "hero", an abject father who sleeps with his daughter and then tries to get oblivion rather than redemption?) Eat a live octopus benefits from the vivid presence of the best actor in the whole cast: the octopus itself. Too bad that the poor beast, having been eaten, could not survive its one and only action to get another worthless diploma for the "best actor" at the Cannes festival. <br /> <br /> Which festival, among other things, between Moore's propaganda nonsense and this epitome of worthless, if somewhat exotic, oddities has become a festival of emptiness and ridicule. <br /> <br /> Transit sic gloria mundi!
