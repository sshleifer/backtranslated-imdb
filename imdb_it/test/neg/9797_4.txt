The plot here is simple. The country boy, Lem (Farrell), goes to town to sell the wheat crop, falls in love with a maid, Kate (Duncan) and the bride, taking her home to a hostile father and a group of women hungry harvesters . There are nuances of THE KNEW WHAT I WANTED and MICE AND MEN here. The courtship, which takes place in two long sequences set in the restaurant, consumes the first half hour and has a lethargic rhythm. Lem is so weak as to allow his father to abuse his wife, who is proposed by Mac (Richard Alexander), one of the harvesters, to come away with him. Duncan and Alexander are the only positive things in this boring mammoth, which lacks the insights and cinematic beauty that we expect from Murnau. Farrell's character has no backbone, so we end up rooting for a "real man" (Mac) to take Kate away from it all. With the sympathy of the distorted public, the film loses its narrative progression. His father's conversion at the end of the film is unrealistic and incredible, creating a forced epilogue. This film is only for star fans and the director - the general public doesn't need to worry.
