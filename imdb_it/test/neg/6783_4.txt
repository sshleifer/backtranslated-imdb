I saw this film with a group of friends at the 1999 Melbourne International Film Festival and nobody had a good word for it. <br /> <br /> I like to love Bluegrass and Country Music so it's not like I'm unpleasant to the subject. But the problem is that basically it is a very conservative film, little more than a story by Mills and Boon. A body-ripper from the simplest and most sugary type. <br /> <br /> It's not just the romance in his heart, the one between Reece and Dr. Lily Penleric is more than a little unbelievable. (Because any male would be attracted to the man by the flaring-nostril-devouring Lily is beyond me, and frankly Mike Harding like Reece seems to be just going through the motions) <br /> <br /> It is simply that the whole film is too docile and well-behaved for its sake. There is a small precious danger, dirt or drama. Of course, there is a moment of "excitement" that involves a school run by Lily's younger sister, but the whole episode is more fun than dramatic (it's written and interpreted so badly). And the film betrays its conservative program in the way this subplot is solved. <br /> <br /> As for the good old Reece Kinkaid (now, what's wrong with a name like Eberneezer Bumpass?), I ask you! Is the end of this film credible? Adapt to the character that this film had previously built? I do not think so...
