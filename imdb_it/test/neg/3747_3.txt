Sorry, but I usually love French thrillers - eg. Chabrol - but this was a slimy and glossy mess. The fact that it was based on a book by Harlan Cohen is significant, because rather than being a French film (strong in psychology and character), it is more like a roller coaster ride by John Grisham with numbers with ridiculous twists, flashbacks which updates the previous flashbacks, a predictable bad (as soon as its name is mentioned, think "hmm, it will be the bad guy!") and series of mysterious stereotyped characters that seem to live in different films. In the end I was laughing hysterically because of the irregularity of the tone of the film (the scenes in which the main character is helped by two shady and extravagant characters are unintentionally hilarious), the absolutely disconcerting plot, the absurd coincidences and the caresses of luck (eg . the password for an email account) And he yawned uncontrollably (I thought I had misread the execution time of 1 hour and 50 minutes because he seemed to drag it for 3 hours and 50 minutes).
