I don't recommend watching this movie. It is a film in which a film is filmed, without any attraction between an actress and an actor. The sex scene at the end of the film, which explains the actress's reluctance (acted in the film) to collaborate with the actor (starred in the film), is a frank repetition of the same scene in the movie Breillat Fat girl. Everything was played with more delicacy, if delicacy can be attributed to such a sexual act. A typical French expression for the thing that happens in Sex is comedy is Oh la la! There is also sensitivity in the film Breillat Brief Crossing. In Sex is a comedy, I do not see a real sensitivity and even a clear plot for the film is not developing, so there is a rather loose story with the disillusionment of the end.
