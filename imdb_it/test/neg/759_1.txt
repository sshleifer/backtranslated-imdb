This move is bad on so many levels that I don't even know where to start. OK - the positive points - Peebles is as nice as a dirty black leather outlaw. Some of the landscape photographs were stunning. That's all. Oh, and it was a nice touch to have the buffalo head over the door of the Freemanville bar, I guess it was a nod to the Buffalo Soldiers. The film starts in an OK way, but the characters are so flat, so comical, so "very", the bad guys are just terrible, suffocating trying to describe them further. The Spanish-Cuban-American war was in 1895-1898 and America was involved only between April and August of 1998. I think the film said it happened in 1893 (I could be wrong but I don't want to watch it again to check). Much of this film focused on the KKK killing Jessie's father. Well guys, the original KKK started in 1865 and was destroyed by President Andrew Johnson in 1871. The Klan wasn't even around during the time period of this film. Obviously the bad base was again engaged in 1915 and we know the rest. BUT, for the purpose of the film, it is historically incorrect and this was an important part of the plot. I think I could make myself crazy by going a few more shots here and I'm done. I didn't know that Boyz2Men and other bands of the genre were inspired by the 1890 New Orleans street singers. I also didn't know that fetish necklaces were all the rage for Sioux women in 1890 ... but then I was surprised to see a singer of the bar that made jazz while wearing 1 "acrylic nails ... We almost died laughing and I like a cheese westerner more than most people do, such a waste of talent and money: this really got the chance to show a part of American history that is not well known /bkcwboy2.htm for more information This may have been so good but it was just .... bad 1-10 this gets a 1 instead of a zero because Mario has a good looks in the hat and there was an Appaloosa horse in the film.
