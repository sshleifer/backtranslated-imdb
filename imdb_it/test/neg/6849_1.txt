To really appreciate this film you have to be there (acting?) Or being a member of the crew. <br /> <br /> Yes, I am "Selena", and at the age of 42 I have serious doubts about what we were doing / doing. <br /> <br /> It all started as something like "John Waters", friends who behave badly in bad movies. Somewhere along the line, the fun stopped, the people who were supposed to be friends no longer spoke and the BAD got worse. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the bad image I could have projected. size one gold spandex pants,) <br /> <br /> Besides that, the film SUCCOR so badly, I wouldn't even want my mother to look at it. <br /> <br /> To my director, cast and crew I say, <br /> <br /> "Why can't we all get along ?? <br /> <br /> It was BEYOND TWENTY YEARS, PEOPLE !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!
