A rather mild horror film; if it weren't for a couple of sex scenes, it could easily have been a TV movie. Holes abound (an example: why would there be a secret passage from the 18th century leading from the upper floor of a house that was burned to the ground and a new building put 200 years later?), Cardboard acting, characters who do things that anyone with an IQ bigger than the shoe size wouldn't do it ... <br /> <br /> There are some fun moments, but overall it's a sub-par movie that managed to get Roy Scheider because his bills they were due. If you are looking for an extremely formulated and predictable film that can offer some laughter, it might be worth watching. If not, then this is not for you.
