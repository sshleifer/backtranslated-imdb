Considering the subject, I thought that this film would have been at least pleasant, if he had stopped short of a masterpiece. I was wrong. I was still waiting for something to happen and it's over - I thought the ending was kind of what happened before it became exciting. The only reason I gave 2 instead of 1 is because the effects deserve some recognition.
