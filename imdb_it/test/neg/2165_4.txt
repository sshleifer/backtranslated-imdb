With Matthias Hues on the cover and only $ 3.00, I had to buy it. I liked a few moments, like the irritation of Hawks with the droids of pleasure, but I only really saw the scenes of Matthias Hues. I particularly enjoyed the showdown at the end. It was a cross between "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" by Clint Eastwood and "For a Few Dollars More" (a quick draw showdown of 3 men, with a musical pocket watch used as a timer for the bill at the down). Apart from that, I can't add anything else. The actors gave good interpretations, (all except the "Assassin Droid" whose performance was nothing outside the comedy) but the film really lacked depth and purpose; Simply not enough to fill 1 Â½ of the movie's standard time, so we're stuck with the main characters wondering aimlessly from place to place for an hour or so, until the ball moves . For example, the main character returns to the same strip club about 4 times, occupying two fifths of the film. <br /> <br /> The scenario lacked depth and creativity, probably due to the film's budget. I don't think we've ever been able to see this "perfect city" of New Angeles that was always talked about, in fact, when the main characters finally reached New Angeles, his set in a factory or in a warehouse full of pipes and walkways; hardly the kind of "kingdom" in which the owner / creator of an entire city would have lived. Even the "super-high security" of New Angeles was always discussed, but only a total of 15, maybe 20, security guards were counted, even when the alarm went off; not even close to Matthias's approximation of "at least a hundred men out there". <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of all the actors / actresses in this film, then you might want to watch it, simply to "add it to the list". However, if you value 1 hour and a half of your time, or $ 3.00 of your money, you may want to lose this.
