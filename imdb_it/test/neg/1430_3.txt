Dee Snider is the villain in this movie and his bad acting and his exaggerated kind of ruined for me. The whole film seemed to take itself too seriously. Try to get the "Seven" dark atmosphere without good acting. The film highlights the urban industrial rock / tattoo / body art subculture and expects us to be impressed (scared?) By the size of a boy's nose ring. I'm not a film expert but the script and the acting in this film are just awful. Dee Snider looks at the bad guy but his career is definitely horrible. I recommend not wasting time on this unless nothing else is available.
