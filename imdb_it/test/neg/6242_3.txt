Now I know why this movie can be bought for so little money in video stores. I was curious since it had three big name stars but it was among the "B" movies that the video apparently can't even give away! The answer is, it is a film that would attract a very limited audience: an over-50 crowd with very liberal sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Those who watch Robert Redford, Willem Dafoe and Helen Mirren essentially give a fundamental message that "betraying your wife is fine as long as you still love her". This is the beautiful "message of well-being" here, especially at the end, at the end of this strange story of kidnapping. Who wrote this script ... Bill Clinton? <br /> I say "strange" because the kidnapper is the best kidnapper (Dafoe) you've ever seen, except at the end. He often raises his hostage (Redford), which no kidnapper would risk, has casual conversations about family matters, etc. It's all ridiculous! Well, the L.A. Times says it's "a smart thriller". Ha ha. Well, this confirms what most people know about L.A. For those of you who believe it and have not seen it, I will not ruin it with other gigantic holes in this story, especially at the end. The fact is that it is an insult to anyone with intelligence. <br /> <br /> However, you cannot fool all people at all times, as critics have yet to understand. Here is another film that they advertised legitimately bombed at the box office and at the video store.
