First of all, I read the director's comments below and I would like to thank him for offering his opinion. I always wondered what the creators of the films on MST3K felt because their works had been torn to pieces (not to mention how Best Brains had acquired the rights). Rissi's comments intrigue me, however, about how much science fiction could cut the film to make it look different (now I think I could rent it from NetFlix). Of course, I've never seen the non-MST3K version of this movie, but even having seen it on MST3K, I never thought of it as a bad movie or something unwatchable (even though I thought it was a pretty funny MST3K episode); certainly not, as Pearl describes it, "terrible skin peeling"; not after seeing artists like "Future War" and "Hobgoblins". <br /> <br /> As for the cut of the film, it has already been done before on MST3K, at least once. Case in point: Joe Don Baker's film, Mitchell, in which the subplot involving John Saxon's character is cut out in the MST3K version, yet Joel and the Bot comment on Saxon's absence after his appearance at the beginning of the film. If I can make a criticism of MST3K, if you need to cut the film for temporal considerations, well, but be honest for the movie being cut (even if it's as bad a film as Mitchell). Of course, these criticisms are rather useless with the finished show, but I think the look of the show was unfair. But anyway, if it is the case of Soultaker, this makes me feel sympathy. Anyway, I think it's a fun MST3K episode even though the movie itself, even the hacked version in MST3K, is not terrible at all. <br /> <br /> As a final note, in a strange coincidence or perhaps in a case of Synchronicity, I happened to watch The Hudsucker Proxy the day Soultaker went on the air and you wouldn't know it, the guy who played Vivian Schelling's father played a part in that film; one of his three other accredited roles, actually. I thought it was a little weird.
