First of all let me take this breast that I hate Octopussy with an absolute passion. What is so frustrating is that it has had so much potential and has had a very good opening sequence, unfortunately after the opening sequence everything goes downhill. In the first place there was absolutely no plot to begin with, just an excuse for Moore to tell his banal jokes. Then there are several sequences that would make a Bond fan shudder, for example the sequence in which Bond turns to spread a clown bomb. The villains are rather poor, Louis Jordon fails to make an impact while Kamal Khan and Bollywood veteran Kabir Bedi are equally poor as his henchman. It's funny that when people argue over what the worst Bond and Octopussy film is, it's overlooked when they can easily give them a run for their money.
