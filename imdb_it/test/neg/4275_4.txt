Ok, I haven't read the book yet, but I have to say that the protagonist was a mixture. How can I say that such a thing has not read the book you ask? Is simple. As a spectator of this miniseries, I was irritated by the mannerisms, gestures and appearance of the main character, Fannie Price. It is one thing to be a good person, but it is another thing to be a stick in the mud creature that disdains to look at someone in the face or otherwise meet their gaze. Apart from the exaggerated profile of "Susan B. Anthony", she seemed resolute in refusing to look at another person. The scene in which Edmond is pouring his heart towards her, she is looking straight at all the time, forcing him to do the same. As a result, it was just embarrassing and I couldn't tell if anyone was in love with her, let alone Henry and Edmond. Many have said that it is true for the book, if so, I find it difficult to believe that Jane Austen can create a character like her protagonist. It is possible to create a character that has been put on by others and that manages to earn their trust and tenderness, but the portrait of this character in this miniseries was not made for me.
