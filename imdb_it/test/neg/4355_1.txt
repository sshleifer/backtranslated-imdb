The quality you will probably remember after watching The Big Knife is how claustrophobic it is. Rhythm is sacrificed to a uniform plot of dialogue. He's talky in the extreme. Modern viewers will feel that every point has been made (and then some) but the film will not move yet, or will do the viewer a favor and change the scenario. It is very inert. At the 45-minute score I was sure I saw two very slow hours. My besieged answer was: "Good God, where are you going?" It seems that Odets has been paid with the word ... <br /> <br /> This is a good place to note the decline of the drama from its height in the 40s through the alleged projects of the 50s and 60s to the true filmic value was rediscovered in the 1970s, only to disappear again. Here we get flashy, conventional, emotional explosions from Steiger, Lupino et al. and the camera moves pre-organized to satisfy the excessively practiced blocks. This is due to the increase in the Method; the unfortunate tendency to sacrifice any other merit of the film, to guarantee the actors their most selfish desires. "Great acting," ho-hum, killed the thought in the movies. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance's forehead and pompadour shrink back and push forward whenever he reacts to something. It's disturbing. <br /> <br /> This is a terribly boring thing.
