Fred Williamson, one of two or three blaxploitation stars. Cynthia Rothrock, one of two or three American female action stars. Imagine a movie with these two together for the first time! Now imagine the movie THE WORST that could be made with these two together for the first time. Welcome to "Night Vision". Of course, this film was made in 1997 and both had passed their first film, but this does not mean that they no longer had what they needed: they just needed the help of good writing and directing. They have neither here. Rothrock gets to kick a few kicks towards the end, but this movie is so atrocious that you probably won't be awake to see them. (*)
