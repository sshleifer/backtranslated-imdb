Essentially this is a terrible movie with some features that may or may not redeem it for you, depending on how much you want them to do it. In opening "The Red Green Show" for the big screen, the filmmakers have thrown away the carefully perfected rustic charm for over a decade of episodes set in Possum Lodge and around a "road movie" blandly photographed with a horror of the " great "Hollywood soundtrack and a deeply boring storyline that is not adorned with enough gags to make it as fun as the most mediocre episode in the TV series. <br /> <br /> Having devised a storyline that keeps most of the Possum Lodge members off the screen for most of the film and requires virtually everyone to be contemptible with the petty Harold (which is the hero of the film, the usually affable Rosso who is relegated to this incarnation to nothing but the role of head harold abuser), the only performers who really manage to shine are Patrick McKenna and Peter Keleghan in the role of Harold and Ranger Gord, who satisfactorily distribute large-screen versions of their small-screen characters.
