The future of fantasy has never been so dark! Christopher Lambert gets to fight the evil demon Grendel in this dark and fanciful fantasy-epos. "Epos," I said? Um ... there's only one place, so you can't really call it an epic adventure, can you? The location is a 5 inch tall medieval / futuristic castle, so how did they cram all the actors? Oh, I see, those with special effects. A Silly me miniature. <br /> <br /> Here are some reasons why you might want to or NOT want to see this movie: <br /> <br /> - Lambert does his swords tricks again like he did in Highlander. <br /> <br /> - The sets and costumes are incredibly fantastic (if you are 12). <br /> <br /> - Rhona Mitra has a voluptuous couple who likes to show off the whole movie. <br /> <br /> - ... and Christopher Lambert has white hair ... <br /> <br /> - Every time they start fighting, this soundtrack of exaggerated exaggerated music goes on. So why these medieval assassins fight as they dance. <br /> <br /> - They have no electricity in this castle, but they have speakers that seem to work well. So where is the amplifier? I imagine they borrowed it from the techno-dj who delivered the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> - Watch it for the climax, in the end, presenting a demoralized and outrageous CGI creature from any Playstation 2 survival-horror game. <br /> <br /> If all this interested you, then go see it (at your own risk), but don't tell anyone I told you to do. I strongly suspect that Pinhead visits the set during filming, because this film has no soul. Anyway, if you want to see the beautiful Rohna Mitra really show some skin, then look at Paul Verhoeven's HORSE MAN.
