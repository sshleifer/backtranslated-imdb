This is the scariest movie ever made in Hollywood. It is a warning story about how to take a European masterpiece and suck its life until it is a dry skin like an insect carcass on the window sill. Scary because it reveals how the world of Hollywood really works: ignorant money that generates waste. I wonder how many great films could populate the corridors of my memory if the Hollywood process had not led them to forgettable mediocrity. Cry for the murdered children! See Spoorloos or read The Golden Egg, if you dare, because they will come back to you forever in the idle moments of your life: when you walk down the street and see a 'missing' poster; in ordinary looking parking lots; when you listen to the Tour De France on the radio; and, above all, when do you think "what is the damage?" wearing a sock with a hole in a perfectly ordinary day. <br /> <br /> If only I could give this zero.
