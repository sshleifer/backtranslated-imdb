You could see the final result from a mile away. All the signs were there ... the prom, the liquor, the fast ride, the distraction of the females .... A good spot for the use of seat belts, and then the vehicle models. Furthermore, the final is rather anti-climatic, as the Ford Econoline van barely suffers a blow on his nose after hitting a bridge at high speed (highly unlikely). More damage to the van would have made it a little more credible. And why do these films always take place during / after a dance? Is it a case of once you survive the dance, will you be good for life? More than anything else, it shows the lack of control of the dance for liquor, and does not keep an eye on the MINOR who are leaving the dance for a boat ride.
