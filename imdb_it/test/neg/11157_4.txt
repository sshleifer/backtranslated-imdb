While watching "End of Days", I had the feeling that the directors were perhaps trying to make it unique to the Hollywood action movie. They failed, of course, but you have to recognize them for trying. Peter Hyams actually tried to direct this time instead of turning out another action movie. He tried to inject the atmosphere into the film by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood. This method can work if used correctly (see "Se7en") but here it seems simply a cheap trick to try to scare us. Hyams is a decent action director and offers nothing but basic shootings and fight scenes, except for the lackluster "battle", sub par f / x end. As a photographer, Hyams demonstrates real skills, showing good work and frame movement, but it's nothing above solid work. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Andrew Marlowe is the film's greatest enemy. In some parts, the script actually shows the qualities of a good religious thriller, and sometimes even shows some almost intellectual thought (the scene of the temptation between Arnold and Gabriel Byrne), but these small advantages are stifled by a stream of negatives. Generic dialogues / characters, plot holes and useful plot points that point all the characters in the right direction are just some of the black holes in Hollywood that Marlowe's script falls into. The shadow of the good movie could have been faded very quickly. <br /> <br /> The film has a surprisingly good cast. Arnold, still in possession of that greater attitude of life, tries to interpret a depressed, to the limit, with results not superior to the average. Be the invincible hero Arnie, that's what you like. Gabriel Byrne is the strong point of the ensemble, bringing a pleasant air of cynicism to the role of Satan. In an evil role, ripe for overcoming, Byrne limits himself and adds a little more threat to the character. Kevin Pollak, as usual, is able to bring at least a few laughs to the film, but he did better. Also look for a small role from Rod Steiger. <br /> <br /> It seems that Hyams is trying to separate him from the anonymous mass of Hollywood action movies. He was going in the right direction, but he had neither the script nor the originality to bring him there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
