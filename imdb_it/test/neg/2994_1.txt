I can't think of anything, I repeat, NOTHING positive about this "movie"! The entire 1 hour and 45 minute movie could be reduced to a short 5 minute movie! In most scenes, there is absolutely nothing and it seems that the camera has been left in recording only to increase the movie's time! Everything you see is someone in the background that turns around or watches TV without specific topics or even talks about what ever! I feel I wasted 105 minutes of my family's weekend, my family and my friends for nothing! If a movie is badly made or the scenery is not great it's all another story, at least it leaves you something to discuss, but on DISTANT, I just have to call it a "movie" because they were movies recorded by a camera. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, imagine a 105-minute film based on two or three lines of story! What will you end up with? 5% of the content and 95% of fillers! It's exactly how "Distante" was at least for us! The actors did a great job starring in roles that had nothing special about them, barely spoke or showed special emotions! I took this film in the comedy section of a store based on what I read on the back of its cover. I'm still wondering what was funny outside our face after watching the movie.
