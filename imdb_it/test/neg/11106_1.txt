Horrible script, which was apparently directed by ... nobody? The Marines fail to defend themselves from the monster with machine guns, yet it stops when a 15-year-old karate kicks her in the face a few times. It should be a luxury ship, but the Fancy Dining Room looks like a hospital coffee shop. They seem to have rented a high school for the summer, and pulled out chairs and stuff to decorate the set with. In the final blow, they are pulled by water and into a boat and less than 3 seconds later they are apparently about two miles from the ship as it sinks. How do movies like this work? I imagine that anyone can be in a movie these days. Aaron James, New York
