If good intentions have made a film fantastic, then this film could be one of the greatest films ever made. The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme - at least a significant theme, subdued in the fifties: tiredness of the existential world, aerial scenes that should have moved both the senses and the imagination, and characters on which one could deeply care. It concerns patriotism and patriotism in a healthy way. <br /> <br /> Not ten years after the film, I met the Air Force officers who taught my R.O.T.C. college classes. They were intellectuals. They thought deeply about their work. They have a sense of humor. One had been a crew member on the first plane to launch a hydrogen bomb. I wondered if any of them died in Vietnam. I guess they did missions there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film fails. The film lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feelings and celebration of the same patriotism that underlines the narrative. No actress was used worse than June Allison in this film. His Susan Holland is a woman who would like to escape, not embrace. Colonel James Stewart (who was then a colonel) makes a good stab at this role of Lt. Col (and then Col.) Dutch Holland. But the most interesting thing he does in the role is biting a sandwich. I'm not kidding. Stewart was as good as biting into sandwiches as he did with The Spirit of Saint Louis. <br /> <br /> You could think of Ted Williams, but I don't do that when I look at Mr. Steward in the role. I think of William Holden as Lieutenant Harry Brubaker in The Bridges of Toko-Ri. The comparison is not good for Mr. Stewart, who seems wasted on this film. <br /> <br /> Movies shot by a B-36 appear to have come from commercials for an airline. Although beautiful, aerial shots are trivial. For the moment, they may have impressed the spectators. The collapse in Greenland involves non-exciting modeling. You expect the result to be good. <br /> <br /> The undertone - the subtext - for the film expresses the boredom that the air force crews must have felt during their long missions and the banality used by the Air Force to do business - as well as any other business . One imagines how a director of La Nouvelle Vague can explore this theme and then start thinking about how someone with imagination could have filmed this film. Little moments have been missed. When the crews returned from long missions, the crew members received a dose of scotch and a massage before interrogating the mission. Showing this may have helped. <br /> <br /> The banality was the image desired by the Air Force and Mr. Mann hosted the brass instruments. Perhaps, in this sense, the film works, but not for me. <br /> <br /> I cry when I watch the film, because I think that all of us, director, actors, crew, spectators and film members, armed services might have liked to give and get much more than what we get here. <br /> <br /> I don't think this film should be Dr. Strangelove or 2001, both of which portends, but had potential never realized. Still, I like watching it. I think of the aviators in their long missions and the ground crews in isolated places. There is a certain sense of honor celebrated here and I celebrate this honor. <br /> <br /> I certainly understand why people who praise this film here and elsewhere appreciate it. If there were no intentional errors, he would get a 10 from me. <br /> <br />.
