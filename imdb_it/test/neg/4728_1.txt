This is not the real story. It is the most obscure fiction possible derived from events. Supports suicide, the dark obsession with death, a totally free turning point towards organized religion in general (and the Anglican Church in particular) and generally provides a nihilistic and useless world view from which film supporters, I imagine, mean go away, richer in their poverty and more hopeful in their despair. <br /> <br /> Too bad, though attracted attractively by a capable cast. That anyone can suggest that this is a real rendering, however, is a very false advertisement. Do you want the real story? 'Fiaba' rental. This is the real story. See if you can find a match between the facts presented in both cases. I found only one: the girls who made the original photographs were pre-pubescent.
