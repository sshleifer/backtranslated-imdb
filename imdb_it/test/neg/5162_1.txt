It's nice to hear the 3 or more comments, which indicate what the "footballers' wives" mean for women. The title alone washes away any alleged equality that women have in the media industry or in society, reducing them to two-dimensional caricatures of cartoons of how men think women should behave. It's a post modern Catholic farce. He could also be called, "Wifey Footballers who stays at home and knows his place". <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it could really be a kind of parody on the representation of the UK's celebrity junk press and their role in maintaining a patriarchal society. Thus women can undermine stereotypes by acting like those stereotypes and possess the image that was created for them by the desire of men. No, it would be ironic and intelligent. I also seem to praise him. <br /> <br /> Zoe Lucker is simply too camp and over the top to be taken seriously. Just like Cruella De Ville, even more economical. He just needs a manic, condescending laughter, but at the same time self-supporting to show his true acting. Oh she does it? Right. However, it is only a question of summarizing to whom it is addressed. Or clever 'journo's, who thinks it's a seesaw awakening of vaudevillian proportions, or people who think it's' real'. "The best actors"? OMG!! Stop watching this pantomime parody and take a life. <br /> <br /> It is totally sexist and is of such low quality, that perhaps those who enjoy themselves think they are "in" on the "joke". Do actors really care or understand what they are communicating? It is so demeaning for women and men. They are not all materialistic, selfish, football-loving idiots, who think that women are nothing more than another trophy to put on display for the public. It's so humiliating. I'm sure Mrs. Lucker would easily line up with them in her "real" life, and twist them around her finger as easily done with "Footballers' Wives". <br /> <br /> But of course, it doesn't really matter. I mean it's just a T.V. after all. So please let him cut. It's terrible and you will look back with the same incredulity that "Prisoner Cell Block H" has been so fond of. <br /> <br /> How was it born? Certainly it is not thin or complex. It could only come from the same mind that reads FHM magazine, and thinks "okay" to watch soft-porn and "do" so many women who bow to their "will" and recite patriotic and racist comments whenever "their "losses / victories in the soccer team. It's totally coarse.
