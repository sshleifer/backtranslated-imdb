Of course, the only reason I saw this movie - since it's been about a decade since he was released - was because of Ian Holm; I was intrigued to see his portrait of my favorite character in this play. However, this film is as gritty as anything produced by the Old Zeff from "Jesus of Nazareth". But some of the best parts of the game have been left out. I understand the choices of directing / editing, but I don't think it's really up to the comedy. Maybe I'm too purist. I should direct the people (who have read this far) to the Branagh version, if it were not that I disdain its tendency to excessive dramatization. However, he plays a better Hamlet than Gibson. But then, weren't we all waiting for Gibson to prove himself an actor? Now, all he has done is show that he wants to make films in extinct languages. <br /> <br /> ... Perhaps the only worthy Shakespearean interpretation here is Scofield as The Ghost.
