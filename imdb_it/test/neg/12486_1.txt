I'm a big fan of Zack Allan and I was disappointed that he only had one scene in the film. This was also my favorite scene in which he confiscated a character's weapons and directed them down. Unfortunately, unlike Thirdspace and River of Souls, most of the action took place outside the station. I didn't care much about Garibaldi after the first three seasons and I think Sheridan is fine, but not Sinclair. I like Lochley but only had limited time on the screen. If you like Crusades or space battles you should have fun. Personally I can only give him 1/10.
