For all intents and purposes, Showtime was the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Why? Because having Deniro in the cast adds immediate credibility and makes you want to watch the movie. I had also made the mistake of watching the 48 hours and the Beverly Hills Cop recently before seeing Showtime and for some strange reason I thought Eddie Murphy was still funny. Well, it's not. In fact it looks like he was castrated. While watching this movie, I was amazed that Deniro had decided that it was a good enough script to give his name. No chemistry between him and Murphy. The horrible writing, the horrible jokes, a movie that you think should be good can only get worse. Not long after visiting the unfortunate Showtime I happened to see national security starring Martin Lawrence. The film has its fun parts but it wasn't great. But still it was 20 times better than Showtime. Please if you are a Deniro fan DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !!
