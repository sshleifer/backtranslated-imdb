I like Christophe Lambert as an actor. He has played in several good films (Highlander, Subway, Greystoke, ...). But I can't even think that he acted in that movie. The story is almost nothing, the special effects are bad and even the actors. To film the film, I have only one thing to say: it is the first time I go to see a movie and I want to leave after 10 minutes.
