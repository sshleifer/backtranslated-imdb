I have read reviews by other hackers of this film and, although it is certainly not the best film ever made in the sci-fi / horror genre, it is not so bad if you accept it for what it is - low-budget, movie b-movie that (say) "borrow heavily" from people like "Alien" (ugly extraterrestrial monster that wraps its victims) "Species" (splendid and confused "space girl") and "Incubus" (the corner of breeding beasts from reproduction with prisoner girls). This is a film in earnest, and the whole thing was obviously done on a shoestring budget, even though the alien isn't all that bad (I saw a lot less convincing men's rubber suits anyway). None of the acting is Oscar material and the Isle of Man doesn't really double for Boston Massachusetts very convincingly. The plot is quite predictable and the premise that an alien aircraft would travel thousands of miles and crash in the middle of a college-only university campus - thus offering a rich source of perfect reproduction victims - is utterly ridiculous. However, the film has its moments of suspense, there are some aids of nudity and semi-nudity and the film presents one of the few cinematographic appearances of the beautiful and tragic model / actress Kadamba Simmons (as "Space Girl") who, at the age of 24, he was murdered in London by his jealous boyfriend shortly after making this film.
