The plot of "The Stranger" somehow reflects the 1969 film "Journey into the Far Side of the Sun" (produced by Gerry & Sylvia Anderson of "Thunderbirds" and "Space: 1999"). A Land of the Parallel Universe is the premise of both films. But there is a difference. Where the world in "The Stranger" presents a totalitarian regime to defeat the freedom of citizenship, "Journey to the Far Side of the Sun" simply showed a mirror world where writing, roads, houses, machinery of all kinds, and of course organs interiors were all in reverse (or mirror) order. Thus, the similarity of parallel Earths is the only connection of both films. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the TV series "Land of the Giants" came before both films, from 1968 to 1970. a world that was almost parallel to the Earth with the exception that the planet was populated by giants 12 times larger than the humans who crashed there. The idea of ​​a totalitarian government to capture and contain the "little people" was similar to the premise of "The Stranger" rather than the premise of "JTTFSOTS". Perhaps due to the similar to "LOTG", a series of "The Stranger" has been set aside. If it had become a television series, it would have been a sci-fi version of "The Fugitive", with star Glenn Corbett chased by villains from week to week, hidden in different places, etc. they helped this movie.
