My brother was working in a movie theater when I saw this movie; I saw it for free and I'm still out. I've seen a lot of movies in my day, but this was the worst. When people ask me what the worst movie I've ever seen is, I mention this movie in less than a second. This film is ugly because it goes from a lame plot to the next, encourages stereotypes about blacks that are disgusting and the flow is terrible. If you want to see how to make children cry and vomit at the same time, then study this film. Ok, this movie is not "bad" but terrible. If you're like one of those people who watch horrible movies for fun, like me, you won't even be able to get past this short film. Please, God's love destroys all copies of this film.
