This film suffers from the fact that for years Hollywood had no idea how to package Jackie Chan for the masses. His low-budget films in Hong Kong were all kinetic thrillers with a fast-paced rhythm that underlined his extraordinary gymnastic skills and talent for light comedy. His first Hollywood films blocked him in the same films that were made for Stallone or Chuck Norris. There is nothing in the character of Chan in this film that requires the character to be Asian except for the fact that he is the protagonist. In his Hong Kong films Chan is never boring, with movies like a rapid-fire martial arts sequence after another, but "The Protector" is lifeless for everything. A Danny Aiello is not given much to work with both and the lack of chemistry between the two is probably more the result of the script and direction than of the way the two actors got together. Both were better in the worst movies. The best thing about the movie is the settings in Hong Kong. The worst part is the scary way in which Jackie Chan comes off so colorless and sad. It wouldn't have been until the "Rumble in the Bronx" made in Canada that the west would finally figure out how to make a good Jackie Chan movie.
