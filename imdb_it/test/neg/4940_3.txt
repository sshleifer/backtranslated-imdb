I found 'Shuttle' an incredibly frustrating movie to watch. It starts quite well and proceeds quickly to the first "injury" (which is doozy). After this it becomes very lazy and signed up as a story. It was the case of the plot that guided the characters and not the characters that guided the plot. If you hate the movie where you can't understand why the characters do what they do, you hate the 'Shuttle'. In particular, the last act is strange and seems to occur in a world without common sense. Also, eventually one of the characters confessed his murder passed on to his friend, rather than generating sympathy from the public, most people started to giggle. This is probably because the "heroines" of the story were complete idiots. Finally there is an ending that seems to be stuck to be "shocking" and comes from the school of horror hangovers "people are bad, the public, so accept it without explanation". <br /> <br /> Shuttle 'is neither good nor bad, but mediocre. It's annoying.
