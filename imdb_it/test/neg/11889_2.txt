The fact that this film has such a low IMDb score is not surprising. In our post-Enron era, do we really need other memories of America's obsession with the belief of greed? The topic has become so politically charged that many viewers will not only not be entertained by such films, but will respond with barely concealed anger. It was all I could do to sit quietly through this cinematic memo of corporate corruption without extracting the DVD and destroying it into a thousand pieces. <br /> <br /> What is really annoying with this type of film, including "Purpose", is their claim that behind the twinkle there is a significant message that makes the film worthy of note. In "Scopo", I did not find any such significant message. What I found was a story that idolized the materialistic traps of power and capitalist wealth. The two main characters, nauseating in their ease, do very little real work. Instead, they enjoy themselves, play golf, flaunt their coolness, play "fashion" with dialogues directly from the MTV culture: "rock my world", and "Now back to parties, it's an order". John is smug, self-important, superficial and smiles a lot. Robert, who wears small, funky glasses, is even worse. <br /> <br /> The film includes two very young garage fans, who seem and seem to have come out of the movie "Antitrust" (2001). The stereotypes are reproduced for all they are worth, and in this film are also included elegant looking computer equipment and Barbie doll chicks available for those occasions when our future billionaires can relax after all those heavy parties. And with images and time-limited dialogue that requires such a story, can you imagine how this film will be dated in fifteen years? <br /> <br /> The best I can do for this cinematic celluloid waste is Let's say it has nice aerial views of San Francisco. The film would have been much more enjoyable, much more fun, if they had abandoned those hateful characters and that repulsive story, and they would have simply pushed the spectators around in that little plane for the duration of the film.
