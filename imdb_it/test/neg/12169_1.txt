I remember when this show came out. Initially it was advertised as a mini series. At the end of the last episode he said "To Be Continued" to the dismay of all the people who saw the whole boring beyond words. It ended as it should, so yes, you can blame the series for having no end. The plan was that there be another one of course if the ratings were higher, but it was a boring show that way too long, and the annoyed people didn't finish when they said it, so they didn't make it anymore. Many of the comments blame his deletion and lack of purpose on the viewing public, when the truth is that for this show it is not the case, he closed the way it was planned to end, it's just a bad ending.
