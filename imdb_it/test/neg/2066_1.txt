I don't even know where to start ... <br /> <br /> It's not worth writing a review so I'll just mention what another user posted because I completely agree, but I give them 1/10 instead of 2 / 10 "I can't find the words to express how bad I thought this film was: the initial precept was promising, but in all respects it was really terrible afterwards. Let's go through the main points. Idea, but really terrible development: c ' they were many points where I thought "no, nobody would do anything stupid." The ending was incredibly anticlimatic Characterization: all the characters were completely bland or grotesque caricatures, one that was not - perhaps the mother, but that's it - Music - intrusive, inappropriate and generally terrible - Direction - totally amateur - Cinematography - Doubt that they heard about it Camera corners / stability / zoom levels are often really bad I am totally confused by how this film has marked so much. It's the worst movie I've seen in the cinema for years, if ever. "
