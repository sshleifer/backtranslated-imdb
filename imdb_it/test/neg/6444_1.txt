It must say something about the state of our nation that this program is one of the most popular currently screened. <br /> <br /> The "square" is populated by a group of characters so miserable, unreliable, amoral, spiteful, implacably severe as can be imagined. Everyone is stabbing someone behind, everyone is trying to commit adultery, everyone is trying to cheat someone. That, or they are stabbed, betrayed or cheated. No one is cheerful No one laughs. No one has a blast of luck or a nice day. It's hell, with cockney accents. <br /> <br /> I suspect that this program should be sponsored by the Samaritans. It is a perfect vision for the depressed. It does not cheer them; what it does is present an entire community of such drowsy terminally terminated that viewers are led to believe that their fate could be worse - they could live in "Albert Square". <br /> <br /> In addition to the above; as a representation of the eastern end of London, it is pure hokum. Obviously the programmers have never been in the city. The first thing you meet on the Mile End Road is a colossal mosque. And this defines the racial majority of the population quite well. The white British Londoners are a dispersed and rapidly diminishing minority. A large billboard near the Bow Road flyover, sponsored by Tower Hamlets Health Care, states that "Eight out of ten members of the community can now see their doctor more quickly". Ten healthy and smiling faces smile to the observer to confirm. Eight of them have dark skin ... <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I worked with a group of Anglo-Saxons - I would say "pukka" - cockneys a few years ago. And I can tell you that a most hatefully racist experience I never had. Every day was like a gathering of Oswald Moseley. They could not spend 5 minutes without denigrating some other race or nationality of their own, and in repulsive and obscene terms. 'Fackin' Pakis 'and' fuck 'Maceroon' were the small conversation change. In fact their entire (and extremely limited) stock of adjectives fixed on sexual organs and their application. Alf Garnett was an example of liberal virtue in comparison. <br /> <br /> Any program that purports to represent the East natives of London in their true nature would be completely unsuitable for transmission - even after the 9 o-clock watershed. Imagine a Ku Klux Klan script written by Quentin Tarantino and you would be close to the mark. But when they weren't hardened bigots they were at least extremely cheerful. <br /> <br /> I don't know how a soap opera was born. This imaginary shipwrecked island of white misery has absolutely no connection with true culture. And if you are of a relatively optimistic disposition, it will quickly reduce you to tears of pain. Comparatively ordinary actors who pretend to be relatively ordinary chronic depressants with cockney accents - what's the point? <br /> <br /> Dark, sad, inexorably disenchanted and ethnically absurd. The most popular program of an apparently sick and dying nation. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague.
