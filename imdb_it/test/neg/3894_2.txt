I saw this movie twice, once in college a few years ago, and again last weekend. Even if I absolutely despised him the first time, I decided to give him another chance. Terrence Malick is clearly a respected director, and it seems that at least IMDb viewers think very well about the film. But unfortunately, it seems that my tastes have not changed at all. <br /> <br /> Where to start? First, the narrative of Linda Manz is horrible. His voice is so irritating with the horrendous New York accent (please don't try to convince me that the Chicagoians speak that way - they don't). She herself admitted to sitting down and talking about things at random, which doesn't make her a talented actress. He's not even acting! I came to IMDb to see it ripped open, because her performance is just so ridiculous, but people seemed to like it! She is simply unattractive in every way: I was hoping that Malick would simply kill her. <br /> <br /> The other actors were fine, but certainly nothing special. Adams was probably the strongest of the cast, but he also had the only decent part. Except the old man - he was pretty good. <br /> <br /> Speaking of acting, how could Shepard's character be so ridiculously stupid ?? He bought the "brother and sister" act because ... uh, why would he buy it? Bill and Abby took every opportunity to be touchy, as if they didn't realize that their lives depended on acting in a very platonic way. It was simply amazing. And finally, after a considerable period of time, the Farmer suddenly realizes that, "Oh my God, they are together!" Then he goes after Bill with a gun, but instead he seems to stumble into Bill's hand and ends up with a mortal wound. <br /> <br /> By the way, the fate of the characters was equally stupid (and, dare I say, lazy). Obviously Bill has to die - could it be more boring than getting shot by a bunch of cops in a pond? Abby continues her happy life, getting on a train and feeling really happy with the way things worked. And the irritating narrator accidentally finds his friend deadbeat and wander around in the sunset. But that's okay, because Malick never gave me reason to worry about the characters anyway. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, this film drags on forever without twists or real developments. I can't believe it's only 94 minutes - I could have sworn I was sitting in my place for 3 solid hours. The sudden catastrophe of the locusts was like throwing the Bible at me; I'm completely okay with metaphors and allusions, but this was completely over the top. Clearly the message was: "Don't marry for money or bad things will happen to you". Very original. <br /> <br /> I understand that "Days of Heaven", like all Terrence Malick films, is meant to be a work of art. And I will certainly agree that cinematography is simply stunning, and magical hour shots add a unique aura to the film. But I need more good pictures to enjoy a movie, and that didn't do it for me.
