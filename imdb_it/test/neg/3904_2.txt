After wasting 2 hours of my life watching this movie late in the night on television, I went back and reread some of IMDb's materials to remind myself why I saw it in the first place. In hindsight, the only thing I can think of is that I generally like the genre. But this film was a total waste of effort. It fails on all levels, and to see that it is described on IMDb as a comedy really leaves me at a loss. I don't remember a couple of laughs anymore. There is more laughter in every episode of Law and Order than in The Last Man. Seriously. <br /> <br /> Too much of the character interaction didn't seem to me to have any basis and was therefore very unlikely / unbelievable. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't for the almost free bikinis, well, what can I say? Avoid this movie like the plague. Or fasten it with adhesive tape and make a quick advance towards the bikinis. Don't spend even $ 1 to rent it though.
