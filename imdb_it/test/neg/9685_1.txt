Although I have a great interest in biblical films, I was bored to death every minute of the film. Everything is bad The film is too long, the acting is mostly a joke and the script is horrible. I didn't understand the point in mixing the story of Abraham and Noah together. So, if you value your time and your sanity, stay away from this horror.
