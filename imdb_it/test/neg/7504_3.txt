Set in the near future, an obscure stranger enters a zombie-stricken southern American city. Settling in with a group of friendly facial inhabitants, our stranger learns the harsh realities of city life. There are two groups of people; the upper classes that live safely behind the city's concrete walls are provided, at the right price, by the state police. Then there are our friendly face inhabitants. These lower class people live next to the zombies. There are only means of survival to trade goods, which they cultivate during the day, with the police in exchange for food cans. Our stranger discovers why his world is plagued by zombies. A new diet pill that suppressed the craving for carbohydrates was the basis. The desire of the human race to lose fat has caused the collapse of society as we know it. These pills increased the desire for protein and meat, even the domestic poodle. However, there was another serious side effect, after death people perked up with an even stronger desire for protein and that is human flesh. <br /> <br /> With what I feel is an imaginative presentation I have heard that this film many make inventive material. What better way could explain the cause of the zombie rush than a contemporary idea of ​​people's desire to make any sacrifice to change their bodies without the hard work of the gym? However, the imagination of this film stopped shortly after this exhibition. This film falls into the old trap of "I can't imagine what the world will be like when society collapses". When you watch this movie you don't escape to another world like you do when you watch Planet of the Apes (original), Alien, Mad Max or Texas Chain Saw (original). In this film the alternative society is defined by people with orange and green dyed hair. Leather jackets to paint face and charity shop. There is no harshness in life in this alternative society, only healthy faces and rigged zombies. Movies should allow you to escape so as not to remind you that you need to empty your wardrobe and take your old clothes to the charity shop. <br /> <br /> Forget some of the pitiful actors or make-up zombies. This film fails because it is too shiny, too congenial and too predictable. I've seen movies like this since the early eighties. If you are going to make a film of this nature I suggest you review films like Dawn of The Dead (original and remake), Threads or Fulci's Zombie to see and experience that feeling of despair in a devastated society.
