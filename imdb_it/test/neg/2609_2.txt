As a child, I never understood WHY nobody would see this very bad show. It was pretty stupid and I always wanted Spridle and Jim-Jim to get into some kind of fatal accident (they were so boring). <br /> <br /> Now, almost 40 years later, I have a new attitude towards the cartoon. While I still think it was complete crap, this is only for the American version of the show. This is because I was reading a book about souls and I discovered that the shows we saw growing were completely different from those originally shown in Japan. You see, the idiots charged with syndicating the series thought it was too violent, so they cut off the episodes. It's bad enough, but what they did is incredible: they actually cut up the episodes and put them together to create shows that were NOT there like the originals! For example, an episode could be composed of parts of episodes 3, 6, 18 and 27! As a result, I don't really know if the original show was really bad - it could have been brilliant. But who can say considering all we have to look at is this Americanized mess!?
