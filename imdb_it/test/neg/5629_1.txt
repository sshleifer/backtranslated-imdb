SPOILERS FOLLOW - and I haven't even seen it. <br /> <br /> Let me guess ... the murder is related to the developer of the evil property who wants to develop the riverbank, and Dickens was murdered because he was trying to discover such a vile plot. If someone you saw could let me know if I'm halfway through, you would have saved me the time to watch something useful and the rest of us will know to stay away from this movie and its enthusiastic critics. On the other hand, * sounds * intriguing; but if it were a good thing it would * really * be given away with a Sunday rag? And what kind of track record does Foley have anyway? <br /> <br /> ... So, as a public service, I managed to make it. It's worse than "Swept Away". Really. I have read stories of eight-year-olds with more drama than this. Really terrible. And I had half right.
