I bought this DVD only because it was cheap and seemed interesting in its own way ("special" which means "retarded"). The film turned out to be rather uninteresting: boring camera work, nothing really underlying the story, and of course the acting is horrible. It wasn't even "bad" in a campy way - it was just bad. There are actually a handful of broad lines of dialogue, but for the most part it is uncomfortable and weak. All I could think of while watching this was that in reality this film could be a good movie if the script was subjected to a general revision (if it was written by someone who actually understood the culture of drugs) and if they were chosen decent actors. I wouldn't recommend "Weekend With the Babysitter" unless you plan a career in film and want to learn what not to do in a movie.
