An ear-splitting film, an almost old-style puzzle designed to highlight the comic attributes of star singer Madonna. In fact, she is very relaxed on the proverbial limb that recites an extremely living parade that tries to prove that she was framed for murder (a body was found in the trunk of her car after she threw a red light ... big laughter) . After an energetic sequence of animated titles - which is much more fun than the rest of the image - we have nothing to look at, but Madonna's black mascara and red lips highlighted by platinum-colored hair and a pale complexion. What else is there? Griffin Dunne looks defeated as Maddy's caretaker, while the poorly chosen support cast strives for laughter with bad dialogues. It is an unfortunate setback for the talents of director James Foley, who carelessly lets his star flood into the spirit of crazy slapstick movies of the 1930s (but also Katharine Hepburn in "Bringing Up Baby" had a human side). Wretched. * from ****
