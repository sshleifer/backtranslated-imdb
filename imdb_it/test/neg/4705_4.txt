There is no doubt that in a film it is a stupid and not very funny joke, but to be honest it is quite funny (if you are the first spectator to look and try not to analyze anything). The whole film has good ideas but badly written. <br /> <br /> The story of the two losers, waking up and discovering that they can't remember what happened to them the day before. Only to find out later that they are looking for angry twin friends, aliens, transsexual strippers, alien nerds and some gang members. <br /> <br /> Isn't it like The Bourne Identity? Yes, yes, I know - how can I compare the two films, but what the hell? Both have no memories; the people followed them and so on. <br /> <br /> However the film is stupid and it is only for the viewer that it is like a stupid film. <br /> <br /> Reason To Watch: · Loads of talented young actors, · Very stupid (after all you know a stupid movie, why not make it extreme) <br /> <br /> Reason for not doing it: · If you like to analyze, then forget it, · Talented young actors become bad, · The good turning point is really bad <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 (Rating: E ​​+) <br /> <br /> ------------ ------------ ---------- ---------- ---- - --- --------- ---- <br /> <br /> 'Dude Where's My Car' -wait, what do you expect from the Ashton Kutcher movie. I think almost all people have the same answer for this guy - "A really stupid movie". In addition to "That 70s" Shows, this guy really has nothing to offer his fan. (He should thank the series for his reputation.) 'Friend Where's my car', is one of his trademarks: ' stupidity. Somehow his film is even worse than Adam Sandler's films (you can imagine). The film is really meaningless, without plot and nothing. their talent in this junk They even invented "Seriously, friend, where my car is." This shows how movie companies are dying to make money rather than quality. <br /> <br /> Max: 4/10 <br /> <br /> Recommendation: borrow from your friends or just forget about it
