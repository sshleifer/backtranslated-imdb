I recently had to look at this for a project in a sociology course and thought it was absolutely the worst movie I ever got to sit on. It was a bad movie of cinema with all the "beautiful pieces" eliminated. The bad acting, the fake documentary, the absurd plot and the rudderless direction all combine together to create a terrible and terrible film. <br /> <br /> Female characters are basically just there to be sexual objects. Consider this exchange: "It's hot". "He has a girl." "Do you have a girlfriend?" "No." * the girl takes the boys' hand and leads him behind some bushes. the boy goes out and sits next to another boy, the girl stops * "Did you hit him?" "No, I didn't want to take my pants off." "You're stupid." Another girl shows up when the boys go to Beverly Hills, enters the trunk with one of the boys, and when they are dragged by a policeman, you see the car going up and down. <br /> <br /> A homosexual pervert, an unnatural-looking Clint Eastwood, they look alike, and what appears to be a luchador mask all adds to inertia. One of the boys is captured by a policeman, nobody cares. One of the guys is shot, nobody cares. <br /> <br /> Someone said that the dialogue was mostly improvised, and shows. Just awful. I would never recommend this movie to anyone.
