Debbie Boone had a monster success with her recording of the pop song "You Light Up My Life;" the movie Didi Conn of the same name, however, was a horribly embarrassing flop. Conn plays the stereotypical and compassionate and vulnerable girl who is in love with Michael Zaslow, who plays the yuppie-wannabe stereotype. They are engaged, but everyone knows that Zaslow will not marry anyone who is not blond and built, so only Didi is surprised when he unloads her. Needless to say, Didi is rather embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, he did a little songwriting in his spare time, and he came up with a reason he thinks is pretty nice. She calls him - can you guess? - "Light up my life". Jump in the car and leave for the big city to sell his song and make a new life. Now, I remember sitting in the theater looking at her as she got into the car to drive to the big city, and thinking "Well, thank God, we finally took the show off. Now maybe something interesting will happen." success. The credits have been drawn. <br /> <br /> Yes, that was it. Not only was the film played poorly, badly written and filmed badly, but it also ended up in the middle. This film is a really bad movie, and we're not talking about cult movies here. We are talking about an absolute flop, a real yawn from start to finish. If you liked Debbie Boone's song, buy a copy. But don't waste time or money on this film. This is a movie that you will like to have lost you. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
