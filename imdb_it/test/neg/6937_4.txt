In a sense, I liked this film because of a "thoughtless", positive atmosphere that it transmits. I had a problem with one aspect of the plot, but we'll talk about it later. First of all, the characters were a bit silly and one-dimensional. The "good people" had physical characteristics and similar characters and the "bad people" had physical traits and similar characters ... hmmm. The basic plot was OK (rather simple and standard) - nothing too exciting or questionable. The main attraction was, of course, the miniature dinosaurs - a kind of beautiful fantasy element to have. However, they had a minimal presence in the film. <br /> <br /> Outside of this, the film has maintained a brisk pace and has not bogged down anywhere. I liked the movie. <br /> <br /> The problem that I had with the plot had to do with the idea of ​​"stealing". I think this film hasn't been thought of enough - something's wrong, especially if it's a children's movie. I will keep the abstract of the next sentence for not being a spoiler (skip if you're worried). Good guys steal something and don't have the same information the public has - so it's just stealing and that's a bad thing for a children's movie. <br /> <br /> In general, if you have children, due to a questionable aspect of the plot that I would consider the passage. However, the whole film is quite low, so it may not matter. Pass this if you have other interesting choices.
