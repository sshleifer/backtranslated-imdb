Despite the cast of all the stars, this epic attempt fails. It looks like a set of flat cardboard stereotypes joined by a too intelligent social commentary. <br /> <br /> It is as if with all sorts of dialogue and introduction to a new character the writer peeks out and says, "Isn't he so smart? Am I not smart? Isn't that a sharp social comment?" And unfortunately, the answer is always "Ummmm ... no". Get tired of things that absorb the self that look more like a soap opera (in the worst sense of the word) than a movie ... and an obvious attempt at television immortality. Fortunately, he died young. Empire Falls falls flat.
