I got a kick from Reynolds telling his lawyer: "Look, I've done a lot of unknown things in my life, but I've never killed anyone." Obviously he forgot his career that slipped down the hill after he started making stupid movies like "Cannonball Run". Originally Physical Evidence was supposed to be the sequel to "The Jagged Edge" that Glen Close wisely refused. The verdict is in, to avoid physical evidence.
