This film is really an excuse for making films. The rhythm is poor, the budget must have been depressively low and the acting is at a reduced pace (with the exception of Bela Lugosi). Even the audio at this point in time is terrible, with so much noise in the background that it seems to me that an airplane is taking off for the entire film. If these things bother you, don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome this, however, you will find that the idea behind the film is very good. A German plastic surgeon (Bela Lugosi) was hired by the Japanese to operate on several Japanese agents and turn them into the form of honest American businessmen who the Japanese kidnapped and killed. After completing his work, he was betrayed by the Japanese and thrown into prison. He later escapes and travels to America to take revenge on his patients through a series of advertised murders. It seemed that Bela Lugosi was the only decent actor in the film and, to be honest, the rest of the actors were completely forgettable and boring. The leading actress became rather boring and stereotyped, while the police officer assigned to her case was the dominant, chauvinist and always correct dominant male found in many films of this period. <br /> <br /> I also found that camera work was completely uninspired, often taking the exact same angles of the same same rooms over and over again. After a while, this tends to drag the film down, setting a very slow pace for "action", which is more or less non-existent anyway. <br /> <br /> For me, the idea is fascinating and with a top writer, director, screenwriter, equipment and actor it could become an excellent film. Unfortunately, these handicaps keep the film for now, and I can't recommend it to anyone other than the most open movie lovers.
