excuse my spelling. This is probably the funniest horror film that has ever existed. He thinks the evil is dead * 1000. The acting is horrible, you can see the makeup line on a certain lady's face. there is a lesbian scene, which makes absolutely no sense. And the ending, haha ​​ohhhh, the ending ... be prepared to hurt your stomach with laughter. Now if you watch this movie for more than 5 minutes and you're still waiting for something, take a look at yourself and ask what the hell is wrong with you. This is a very bad film, designed to laugh and have fun for its sheer nonsense. <br /> <br /> Don't forget to watch all the outtakes after the movie, you can see how low the budget was. All in all this film is a rare gem in demonstrating the lack of talent / care / skill / money / and anything else you would ever need to make a hit movie. But it is certainly worth looking at.
