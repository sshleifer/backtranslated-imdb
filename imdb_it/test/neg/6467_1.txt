The only funny thing I found in watching this movie was listening to Star Wars through the cinema wall (yes, I go to a really bad cinema). This film is so shocking that I think I'd rather have my eyes scratched by a cat than watch it again. <br /> <br /> Let's compare it with the original. One is fascinating, fun, exciting, well acted and one of the best films ever made, the other is so far from funny that all you can do is hope that your eyes will fall so you don't have to watch them anymore. I'm sorry that Christina Ricci is a good actress, but she can't compare to Hailley Mills, and she didn't even let me start on Doug E. Doug in a part occupied by the amazing and utterly charming Dean Jones. The small part of Dean Jones in the new version is the only partially salvific part of this film, and it is the only reason why I can justify a rating of 1 * (also because the imdb does not go in negative).
