Ten years ago I really wanted to see this film about cinema. But I lost it and then I forgot about it. Oh boy, I'm glad this movie never ruined my teenage eyes. <br /> <br /> I saw it yesterday, and seriously, this must be among the 10 worst movies ever made. And I'm talking about films that have had too much attention, like those wonderful TV trailers, and too much money spent on the actors and the making of the film. <br /> <br /> The script sucks and the acting sucks even worse, should I say more? <br /> <br /> Please, Hollywood, NO MORE ARNOLD !!
