The title of this documentary is very misleading. At no time during the documentary show how the introduction of Nile perch in Lake Victoria caused problems with the city of Mwanza, in Tanzania. The film tries to put the problems of Tanzania on an environmental cause, but the truth is that the problems stem from an external parasitic force. The documentary is very slow, without rhythm and without narrative. Instead it relies on small text blip between any related segments to display bits of information that do little to add or expand the topic. There are only two attempts to discuss the environmental effects of the Nile perch. One is a small segment of about 10 seconds in which they interview the managers of the factory where the fish is processed and briefly mentions how 50 years ago the Nile perch was introduced into the lake and consumed the other fish species. The director makes no attempt to follow the issue or delve into the matter. The second attempt is when within this documentary they film the screening of another documentary that is discussing the environmental impact that the Perch Nile has introduced, and once again no concrete attempt is made to investigate how devastating the problem has become . <br /> <br /> The subject of this documentary has nothing to do with perch itself and has more to do with the problems that plague most African countries. The film seeks to link the introduction of perch with AIDS, poverty and pollution in Tanzania, but never establishes a direct connection. As every intelligent person reads well about problems in Africa, the problems shown here are not unique to Tanzania, but concern most of Africa and have nothing to do with fish. It would have been great if the directors had shown how the economy or local life was before the introduction of the fish and how it was negatively affected by the introduction of the fish, but it is not. The fact is that many of the people interviewed say that fish has offered jobs and opportunities for many. Yes, things are BAD within the city of Mwanza, but they are much worse in other parts of the country and on the continent. <br /> <br /> A weak attempt by documentary producers to link fish to famine problems in Tanzania is quickly discredited by the documentary itself. First of all, Tanzania is a very large country and Lake Victoria is only a small part of the country. Many of the people interviewed actually say they can go to Mwanza, the fishing town on the lake, to find a job and feed their families because things were so bad in other parts of the country. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very weak, has no narrative and makes no attempt to actually link anything they show to the Nile Persian. Play on people's emotions by showing images of the devastation of poverty, famine and AIDS that make no attempt to show you how this is unique to the Lake Victoria region in Tanzania or directly related to the perch. The fact is that most problems have more to do with war, globalization and Christianity than with the environmental effect of the perch itself.
