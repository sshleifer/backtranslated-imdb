Well, Dude Where's My Car could be at least a novelty as one of the few Hollywood movies that seems to have been written, merged, filmed and edited in less than a day. I honestly can't believe this was done (or that I allowed my friends to let me sit through the whole thing). The jokes are too stupid and predictable to be "stupid-funny", and the actors involved don't seem as if they were able to come up with any kind of funny if the script had actually provided it. Strangely, unlike most brainless comedies, this film actually has a TROOP storyline - each scene seems to introduce a new morally and uninteresting subplot. Of course, of course they went for the best, but it doesn't work at any level ... There is only one aspect of this film that I liked: Donkeylips of the old Nickalodean show "Greetings your shorts" has a very small role. This is the role that will transform him in the next Richard Gere, however, just look ...
