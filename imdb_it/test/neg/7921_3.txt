All Dogs to Heaven was a bizarre and funny film; With talents of good name, the voices gave an adult familiarity to a basic cartoon for children. It was interesting enough to be enjoyed by adults as well as something good for children to watch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ADGTH2 is a worthless sequel that tries to earn some money by riding the first lines. Charlie Sheen is a viable substitute for Burt Reynolds in this second film and the voice of Sheena Easton in some of the films, delicious but forgotten songs that make her an interesting choice as a co-star of this. Add Dom DeLuise from the first movie and think it would be a decent mix to make this sequel at least relatively respectful of the first. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even with the addition of other good actors such as Bebe Neuwirth in the horrible role of Anabelle, this film cannot be saved from the atrocious production values ​​and animation skills (or lack thereof) present throughout this movie. Horrible editing, voice synchronization and flat out spaces where the characters' mouths should shift to the dialouge but don't combine to make this film similar to an animation project by a university intern instead of the decent follow-up that could have been. <br /> <br /> All in all I would say that unless you are a big fan of the first movie I would give a very large PASS.
