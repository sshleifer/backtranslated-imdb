An old high school teacher of mine boasted that he saw every movie EVER ever made, so one day a friend of mine and I decided to invent a movie called "Pacific Inferno". Later, we discussed whether the main role was played by Carl Weathers or Billy Dee Williams. Our teacher found the discussion interesting, so he came to us and informed us that the main role in "Pacific Inferno" was played by Jim Brown. We thought he was trapped in a lie until we went to the library and discovered that "Pacific Hell" was actually a real movie. This incident forced me to rent the movie ... it's horrible. Our movie had a better plot than this piece. Weathers and Billy Dee would have been much better in the picture.
