What rubbish, isn't there really any part II? If this movie actually ends up as it did, everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed. This film is nothing close to a movie like Outbreak, which was actually a pretty decent movie. This film was rushed in the hope of earning a few easy dollars. I started watching the movie on the assumption that it would be bad, but I never imagined it would be so bad. This film was nothing but a way to exploit the fears of the American people for profit! If you haven't seen this movie, don't worry. The film is full of underdeveloped characters and poor acting. I really hope that the production of this film lasted only a couple of weeks. Stay away! Don't be fooled by the hype!
