I don't understand people here. The film is neither as good as it is bad as some say. Except De Kok, acting is OK. The problem with the film is mainly the script. The characters are not credible. Sex is done well, but the psychology behind people makes very little sense. The film doesn't look good, but what do you expect? The film was shot for little money on video. Obviously it doesn't look as good as a normal movie, duh! The only thing I agree with is that the music is bad. It looks like a soft and cheap erotic film of the 80s. The film is not good, okay, but you have to give a little credit for pulling it out without money.
