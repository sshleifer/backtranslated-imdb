Uh Oh! I just said that this "classic" movie has a storyline that THINKS! Well, it's true ... so top it off! This film was a vanity project for Joseph P. Kennedy in which his lover acted and money flowed to make it an even bigger star. Today there is only a fragmentary copy, which has been retouched a few years ago. However, even if the film had been in perfect shape, it would STILL be stinked for many reasons. And, without further ado, here are some of my reasons: <br /> <br /> First, Gloria Swanson, 31, plays a girl in a convent school - maybe 16 or 18! Come on, she looks old enough to be the mother of many of the children. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film is all based on the stupid concept of "love at first sight". While some people believe it, it's ridiculous to believe that a prince would throw EVERYTHING away on a woman he didn't even know! What hooey! <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film is histrionic and the plot is crazy! After leaving school, Kelly leaves for East Africa and becomes "the queen of whores" - and later, after the evil queen in Europe dies (it is convenient), the prince is able to get out of jail, in reality finds Kelly the bride and she becomes the queen of a true honest-good country! Give me a break - this is RIDICULOUS, even in the days of silent cinema this plot was a croak! <br /> <br /> So, in a nutshell, this is a poor film with great production values ​​(the mistresses must LOOK good) which is parading like a classic! There are so many BEST silent movies out there - see them first and avoid this tripe.
