The film uses random events of historical importance as a background and, like it or not, it crosses the lives and timelines of its 3 central characters. For what purpose, can you ask? The problem with this film is that the script becomes the "story", not the characters or their lives. <br /> <br /> Start with a group of rich and aimless college kids (and a couple of not-so-rich ones too) attracted by the Naxalite movement. Business, rejection and separation follow. People go their own way, apparently. Only until the heroine imposes on them. Not once but twice. After a break in the "Movement", the next obstacle for these 3 is the Emergency imposed on the country by Indira Gandhi. A lot of political characters wander without any obvious reason. The secondary plots are too invented and do not add up to make a whole logical. <br /> <br /> The film tries to impose a false rhythm but never reaches a real rhythm. Sometimes sometimes consistent, there is no maturation and growth whatsoever in the arches of the 3 former college classmates. Even after being supposedly married, engaged, settled or the like, they are always too eager to give up everything and head to a village to have sex with the ex-lover or the ex-flame. The screenwriter has a fertile imagination. So many 4-letter words are used without any rhyme or reason that is absolutely offensive !! <br /> <br /> Chitrangda Singh has a horrible American accent that he doesn't try to hide. Its horrible to hear its mouth like a clich√©-ridden like a dialogue like 'Whats up? I didn't think you'd come "(this, after the hellish nightmare he just experienced) or, at the beginning," I appreciate your concern but I can take care of myself ". Yikes. What kind of clown wrote the dialogues for this? Invite her friend to get a cup of "South Indian" coffee (no less), wish someone good morning and then wish someone else in the family good night. Now what happens with THAT?!? <br /> <br /> The countless unaccredited inhabitants and tribals are the best actors, the assembly is very irregular with too many cuts, of course, striving to make a bold statement, Sudhir Misra made a big mistake about this.
