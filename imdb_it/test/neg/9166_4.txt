Something a disappointment. Lee J. Cobb is the anti-union leader of Roxton Garments in New York. His business partner is killed when an elevator breaks loose and plunges twenty-seven floors to the bottom of the well, in the scariest scene in the film. <br /> <br /> Cobb doesn't know, or doesn't. I let myself be understood, but the man behind the murder is Richard Boone, who protects the company from union organizers. <br /> <br /> So Cobb's son, Kerwin Mathews, returns from Europe determined to learn the business and join his father in running a clean shop. He is shocked, shocked! - to know that Boone has torn members of the union to pieces and killed some who are hopelessly irritating. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is one of the organizers who is killed by a couple of Boone goons, led by Wesley Addy. Loggia leaves behind a widow, Gia Scala, with whom Mathews, understandably and with determination, resumes. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cobb pays for his self-deception, Addy and Boone take their right desserts, and the Mathews wind with the succulent Scala, from which an opera house takes its name. <br /> <br /> There is no spark in any line of dialogue. A couple of lines are literally stolen from "On the Waterfront" - "pistoleros", "you will speak directly into the tomb". The plot is schematic and does not reserve surprises at all. Vincent Sherman's direction is pedestrian. The photograph is flat and uninspired, although there are a couple of beautiful photos of the streets of New York. <br /> <br /> Lee J. Cobb can act. In this case, it must have been easy for him because he repeats Johnny Friendly from "On the Waterfront", only this time with a tender heart. Richard Boone can also act. Joseph Wiseman, to a small extent, does a good job. Gia Scala hits her brands, says what the script requires and does what the director tells her. A wonderful woman, her life has soured at the beginning. The director and the photographer do a good job on Wesley Addy. He has white hair, a bleached face, the eyes of a glacial lake, and sometimes he is struck by a wide-angle lens that turns his surprisingly fleshy lips into those of a kind of parasitic fish. But I don't see him as a low-level muscular man. He and Boone should have changed roles. Harold J. Stone is his reliable self, although he is forced to be more "Italian", like Tony, rather than to him naturally. No one else in something that looks like an important part is more than mediocre, and some artists don't even clarify that bar. Kerwin Mathews could be a good guy in real life, but he is mildly sterile and belongs to the domestic drama of afternoon television. <br /> <br /> Great title, suggestive of intrigue and shadows. Some good people in the cast. A potentially explosive exhibition of a company that nobody knows much about, but that is about megabucks. <br /> <br /> And everything comes out this way.
