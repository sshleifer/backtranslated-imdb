I saw it basically for the sole reason that it should have had references to the Third Reich. It turned out to be a rather mindless and predictable slasher film that seemed made for feminists or something like that. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something, if you wait for a whole movie to see the attractive breasts of the female protagonist, the last thing you want is a sex scene made "with taste" with annoying camera angles that show nothing. Not even his big-titted friend took out his, but we saw a lot of man's butts and pubic hair and boys with their shirts. And in the end you have our heroine magically dodging the thrusts and oscillations of the scalpel (which turns out to be the stem, strangely enough) and she easily fights against him (uh huh) while her masculine love interest is bound and waiting to be saved. The funniest part was when he lifted a chair and "hit her" on the boy and broke on him. Now it would be almost the maximum he could lift the chair and even less to crush it against a person with enough strength to break it! It seems ridiculous, practically touching it against him and falling to pieces. If you are going to do this sort of "role reversal" (which has already been done to death), then you must at least make it semi-plausible. <br /> <br /> There was still a good bit. The villain got the better of his slutty friend, teaching her a lesson about being a tramp and sleeping around. This is not exactly something feminists would like. <br /> <br /> Rather stupid indeed. Not that American action films are generally much better, but you have to ask yourself why it disturbed them. He brought nothing new to the genre. <br /> <br /> 5/10
