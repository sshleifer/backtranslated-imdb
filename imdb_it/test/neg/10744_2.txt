I can appreciate the satire that goes against my points of view, but it must be witty and well positioned. This movie is ... how can I explain it. It does not make the slightest attempt at subtlety, much less intelligence. In reality, it's not even horror. Dead soldiers come to life but are not interested in the brain, only in voting booths. Why? Cue an endless stream of the most idiotic, banal, inflated sack of the "bad president, bad conservatives, bad republicans". What was a piece of pig manure, indulgent, schmaltz, but even if they agreed with the "points" of the episode, only the most stupid liberal would say that they enjoyed watching it. Then again, assigning a degree of stupidity to the crazy, angry, hostile, anti-social and anti-all-halfway normal spectrum is a high task in itself. <br /> <br /> Avoid as a liberal convention.
