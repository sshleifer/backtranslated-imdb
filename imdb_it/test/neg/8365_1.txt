If you come to this film to learn something about depression, forget it: you will not learn anything except how not to write a script on the subject. I understand that the intent was to show how serious depression can turn an average person into a complete wreck, but the result is the most one-dimensional character I've ever seen in a Hollywood movie ... it's not a small feat . Christina Ricci, while Elisabetta, spends the entire duration of this film screaming loudly, violently insulting someone, bursting into tears or some combination of the three (the only exceptions are some tacit notches at the beginning and end). There is not the slightest indication of how it could be WITHOUT depression ... not the slightest glimmer of other aspects of her personality ... she screams. At one point, her roommate tells her "Lizzie, you're such a fun person to be around when you're not depressed" and my reaction was, "Is she?" It seemed strange that writers included this comment without giving us examples, but this script is a lesson in incompetence. It has no visible structure or flow; instead, it consists of a series of hunchback scenes by Lizzie that scream, then ends. Character development? No ... Scenes from his daily existence, that is to say, going to classes, which could be important details? No ... Screaming at maximum volume? CHECK. It's not enough, I'm afraid. 1/10.
