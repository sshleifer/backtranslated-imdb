This certainly isn't a comedy - I don't know what was marketed that way. As a serious film, it lacks any kind of substance. Unless you have just come out of Sunday school or you need Noah's correction, you will find yourself bored to tears. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast took away what little of the film remained. Lauren Graham plays an empty housewife without real depth. His children do not add anything to the film. They seem to be around just to hatch on their absent father in the beginning. Jonah Hill plays a creepy internet addict who isn't funny. <br /> <br /> I found the original as a decent film. Disappointed that this was really not going anywhere.
