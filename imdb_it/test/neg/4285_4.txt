4 on 10 <br /> <br /> A rather incredible storyline with some haunted "shocks" that really don't fit. <br /> <br /> The performance of Gary Oldham is very irregular ... not so much the quality of the performance but the consistency. His character does not behave consistently. Sometimes calm / relaxed / methodical / reflective, sometimes violent / noisy / almost mad. It is not credible. <br /> <br /> Are many films from the 80s dated badly? Will they be more pleasant in 20 years? <br /> <br />
