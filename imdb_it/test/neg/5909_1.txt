Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor join in this alleged comedy about the owners of nightclubs crushed by organized crime. Eddie Murphy wrote and directed this hateful journey of the ego, and therefore has no one to blame himself for his failure. This is a really bad film, so completely devoid of energy and humor that it serves only as an example of Murphy's contempt for his audience. It would be extraordinarily easy to keep beating on this film, but I will show more mercy than it has shown to the public and stop now.
