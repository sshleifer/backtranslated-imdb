I think the best way to review this title is to divide it into pros and cons. <br /> <br /> PRO: ~ turn into wolves rather than plastic monsters / comics. ~ the hunting of wolves through the forest ~ "Cash Machine" of Hard-Fi played <br /> <br /> CONS: ~ some parts of the script make you shudder (for example the terrible part in which the woman escapes from the games) of the guys from "Fortunate Five", and there is about half an hour of "Dear Cousin" and a round robin of "Yes, see, we know Gabriel's law") ~ underwater transformation is ridiculous ~ the obvious ending and ridiculous ~ Aiden is told thousands of times to leave, and then he says "if you care about me you would have left me" ~ the obvious characters ~ the superfluous birth ~ the cut of the arm completely unnecessary by Aiden ~ speeches by Gabriel < br /> <br /> You understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> I love werewolf movies, and tried to watch it a few times to see if I'd like it better, but it got worse. I think I'll read the book and see how I go. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about this if you don't have a 12-year-old brother or sister in spooky things. Anyone over that age can suffer and wants his hour and a half back.
