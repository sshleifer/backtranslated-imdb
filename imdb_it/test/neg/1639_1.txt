This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not the worst though - Manos the Hands of Fate has this honor. <br /> <br /> This film has many problems. For starters, the whole movie is a cheap copy of Conan movies. There is the child in a skimpy suit who wears a hubcap, the quiet Asian warrior, the bad boy with biscuits, the almost mindless soldiers and so on. There are many errors of continuity in this film. Some of the stupidest mistakes I've ever seen are in this movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately when I saw this movie I saw the MST3K version. Joel and the "robots" make the film watchable, otherwise I'd probably turn it off for five minutes in the film.
