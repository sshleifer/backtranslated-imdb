Oh my. Oh, this is a * bad * movie * really *. The acting is absolutely atrocious, the script is terrible and the photograph is simply terrible. <br /> <br /> What makes this film stand out, however, is that you never care about a single soul-- good guy or villain, living, dying or dead ... in all 87 minutes. "Oh, he died? Huh ... I thought they would be" the best reaction I could have collected after each murder. The characters are so black and white that with the volume turned off, you could still find out who was who. While the cast voices had a strange monotonous quality, their faces give the impression that you are watching an old silent film with a large number of brow frowns, exaggerated frown and "thoughtful looks". Each character is a unidirectional pony without passion, without passion, one-dimensional; once they fulfill their particular role in this fiasco they have asked for their creation, they are summarily rejected. <br /> <br /> It made me vaguely think about what would have happened if Thomas Borch Nielsen (director / screenwriter of "Skyggen", American title: "Webmaster") decided to make a low-cost version of "American Psycho "and was distracted during the journey. <br /> <br /> This is not a particularly gruesome film; the cold and passionless cast assures him. It is not an offensive film; the director sounds so confident that no one could ever find him that way. It is, simply and after all, a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid it. We were not so lucky and actually paid to watch this bomb on Pay-per-View. As part of my penance, I'm writing this review. <br /> <br /> Just say.
