Kidman and Law lack chemistry to make this novel / melodrama ill-directed and poorly written, at any level beyond the grandeur. Kidman pouts and <br /> <br /> clearly for his lover Law lover. He just met him when he was brought to fight for the South in the Civil War, and they exchanged only 5 sentences and a kiss, yet they are completely struck. The main direction of the law seems to be "It seems empty and shocked, but sensitive". Rene Zellweger is the only spark in this sad parody, but he interprets it too broadly and exaggerated, as if he were acting in "Annie Get Your Gun". Yee-hah boy howdy! Something in his character seemed to belong more to a sketch by Monty Python - that of "Holy Grail" where the peasants spent all their time wallowing in the mud to create mud cakes for no reason. Kidman is an actress smart enough to keep her away whenever she can. Their scenes together are like a comic book hidden in a Victorian-era novel. <br /> <br /> Whenever the action gets bogged down in total tedium, which is common, all writers make "Cue the Simon Legree-type Villain!" and Teague (Ray Winstone) gallops out of nowhere to perform his unspeakably vile deeds, how to kill and torture innocent God-fearing citizens in the name of loyalty to a rapidly fading Confederacy. which is absurd also in this script, there is a plethora of other talented actors who give credible performances in small roles, these are the characters that Law meets while making his journey on Johnny Appleseed from the front line, where he abandoned , towards the hopeful embrace of Kidman at Cold Mountain. Ultimately, none of these characters is important. The law has no time for them or their lives. Each of these little mini-films has the same tired theme: the war is gol-durn heck and turns decent Christian people into rabid animals. <br /> <br /> And the script is too predictable, too heavy, and the rhythm of the story is terribly slow. m waiting for the inevitable meeting of Romeo and Juliet, with Kidman wringing his hands and sighing, Law who overcomes incredible odds and dodges the bullets. And when it finally arrives, you don't care anymore. You will look at your watch asking yourself how much more of this applause you have to endure. <br /> <br /> I give him one out of five stars for the battle scenes. There is a powerful anti-war message here. The incredible lack of concern about the loss of life by the generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff. But it's only about 15 minutes of this 150-minute dog.
