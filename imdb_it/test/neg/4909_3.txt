This film is a third-range attempt at a thrilling and moody thriller and fails miserably on all three points. He managed to keep my attention while the protagonist was seen slowly and predictably breaking all the rules of life he had set for himself at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> But it is in the last 25 minutes or so that things really start spiraling. A vaguely plausible plot (and that is generous) becomes completely ridiculous as new characters suddenly appear out of nothing and random and bizarre events are never explained. <br /> <br /> This wouldn't be so bad if the scripting wasn't so trivial, the acting like that of wood (despite a strong British cast) and the uninteresting direction. This is not an example of good British film production, nor should Tarantino do it, at least not in comparison to his previous work. <br /> <br /> My advice in this case, if it is difficult to get of, do not waste the effort. If you're a Brit like me and it's in your local video store, drive well. Perhaps you go to the video entitled "American Beauty" - now this is an example of great British direction.
