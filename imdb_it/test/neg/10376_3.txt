Formula one at most Neither title reflects the actual content of the series, "Fighting the Nazis in Morocco" (actually, Iverson's ranch). The plot is just to fill the quiet periods between the fights. The packaging claims over 40 "type meetings" in 15 chapters. This is at least three a chapter! In addition to seeing Duncan Renaldo in the role of a French with Spanish accents, observe how much furniture is turned upside down, torn to pieces, thrown, burned or blown up is what this serial really is based on. When the protagonists start fighting, you can bet that everything in the room will also be in it. So, my compliments for the fighting choreographer, who is the real star of this serial! <br /> <br /> Two positive notes: the characters sometimes lose their hat during fights and, above all, we have the girl's side kick (often a journalist, as she is here) who actually participates in the chaos, mainly shooting and killing the bad guys. Yet coming Linda Stirling kills the main villain in "Manhunt of Mystery Island" (1945). On the negative side, there are too many jumps out of escape routes ... before the slab falls, before the car crosses the cliff, before the speedboat explodes, before the building explodes, before the truck hits you , etc. Etc. . <br /> <br /> It is claimed that this serial has partially "inspired" George Lucas to make the first Indiana Jones movie, but this is more by implicit concept than by the true story or the development of the series. > <br /> Rod Cameron "shines" like a moving rock, a role he has played in all his films. In addition to watching all the furniture smashed, nothing happens here, compared to other serials that have fewer fights, more stories, better actors and more developed characters. <br /> <br /> I give him a 3 for all the furniture you are destroying.
