Mr. Seagal has apparently lowered his (already low) standards even further and has now outdone himself in making bad films. The foreigner has no substance that has ever been so in the script. He is the director who has done an even worse job and the music and the soundtrack are so blatant and misplaced that you don't know whether to laugh or cry. Already 10 minutes into the movie, you just want to turn it off. However, considering the films of Steven Seagal's past, you think, "Hey, there could be some interesting action sequences that are worth watching ..." ... you're WRONG! It only gets worse as the film progresses. Everyone (with few exceptions) seems to kill every person they talk to, good or bad, innocent or not. The only good thing about the film is that it has an end and has a rather short execution time. Summarizing the film in two words: STAY AWAY!
