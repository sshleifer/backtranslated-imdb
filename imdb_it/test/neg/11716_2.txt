This must be one of the greatest horror films of all time. Charles Band has made the best film of the 96 'in this little sight gem. Very realistic and incredibly stylized, with a visual touch that David Fincher would have envied, it is not difficult to understand why Band has continued to create classics like "Killjoy 2: Deliverance From Evil", "The Regina Pierce Affair", "Virgins of Sherwood" Forest ', and' Timegate: Tales of the Saddle Tramps'. <br /> <br /> With a very sophisticated story - a small body with a big head controls a family of strange types performing experiments on naked women, this film can be a little too much for younger viewers and it's just for the more polite type of spectator, but for those who see it, Band is able to convey subtle messages about the human condition through his masterpiece. The head is symbolic of lost love and desire for one's inner self that we all have to face at one point or another, and for this reason I was able to engage with this film on a deeply personal level. Although many of the previous critics have compared the Band's film to the Re-animator and other minor works, this is above all the rest. He is more generous, but not useless. The blood in this film is well made and used to improve the plot, rather than get an economic cry from the public. Furthermore, the special effects in this film are absolutely first-rate, easily the best work done in a horror movie since ... well ... ever! The work in this film makes Savini's effects appear like the work of a blind hobo with no limbs. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this film is the copious amount of complete frontal nudity, which in the end was not necessary to reach the composer's goal - to create a timeless epic that would pass forever to history as the best film of all time. If it weren't for this little problem, I would have given this movie a perfect 10.
