I've seen the movie many times and every time I'm more and more disappointed, which is a shame because the EX YU movies are usually very good. The shame here is that Holiwood has tried to make movies on the spot and on people he has no idea. My own arrival from the Balkans (Macedonia) found this film disappointing. Simply the fact that the Bosnian characters are not really understood and not really portrayed. To understand the mentality of an EX YU person, you need to know their background, their way of life, what makes them cry and laugh. And the film's director didn't take this as a guideline. When we (EX YU) make films, a lot of symbolism is built into it, which makes the characters recognizable and nice, and mostly portray the truth (if based on a true story) movies like "Pritty village, pretty flame "," Tito and Me "," Underground "," No mans land "," Before the Rain "," Black cat, white cat "," Otac na sluzbenom putu ", (When dad was out for work), "Ko to tamo peva" (Who sings there?) Rare is the masterpiece of Balkan cinema, and nothing can be compared to it, not the half history and the study of Holiwood, as someone in the group mentioned the story that jumps from a head of the city until I am sorry, but when the film is made it is not only for the variety of American spectators, but also for the rest of the world, and some of them also live in the Balkans and Sarajevo. at the wound, half of the things are shot in Bitola, Macedonia, where I come from. Imagen my shock when I saw the Broad st. of Bitola in the opene scene of the film, when the bride is taken by the sniper. And what was the real movie of the news covering the film entering? However very disappointing, because the truth is far from the film. Too bad nobody has consulted the real people about how to live in Sarajevo under fire, before shooting the film. the book is one thing and real life is another, and this movie drops both.
