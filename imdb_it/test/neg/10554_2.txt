Wow, Kiss the Bride wasn't so bad, but it wasn't that good either. Certainly they were not "the saints of the day after". The film gives way to the middle ... maybe cutting about 30 minutes would have made a movie more enjoyable. But the film gets bogged down again and again by annoying subplots and scenes to throw away - the whole golden sequence comes to mind. <br /> <br /> Although "Kiss" was made for theatrical release, it looks and sounds more like a TV movie. Each scene is lit up like a department store. So many characters are so thrown away. <br /> <br /> And dear Tori is actually a pleasant surprise. Steal all the scenes in which it appears. <br /> <br /> A scene really bothered me. It was a rehearsal dinner in this larger room with dozens of tables - all decorated. But only 5 or 6 people in a room for 250! Where they all went. <br /> <br /> Gay cinema has sunk into a new low ... but not as low as the horrible films produced and shown on the Here! Channel.
