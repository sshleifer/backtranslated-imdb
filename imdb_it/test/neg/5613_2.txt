This film was made because the concept translates well into a summary of two sentences that can be used to attract investors. That is, the premise is interesting and salable. I mean, I rented it based on the synopsis. The problem is that there is nothing beyond the initial concept. There is no coherent plot, no complete characters, no real comedy, no interesting set design, no surprises and no good performances (except Jon Herder, he does something with very little). It is as if the people who turned on the green never read the script but only the synopsis. And if there were enough people like me, he might even have made money. <br /> <br /> To the potential spectator: do not waste time, there is nothing fun or interesting to see here. To the creators of the film: hey, you made your movie, so if it's not that good. Most people can never see themselves or their work on screen.
