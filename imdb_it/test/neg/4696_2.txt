The IMDB plot summary erroneously makes it seem like it's Noah Taylor's movie, when Fairuza Balk is the main character. It's amazing how a cast of established actors may have been in a non-amateur, useless, meaningless movie. Balk breaks with Boyfriend Taylor, sleeps with the devil (I imagine - played by Dempsey), and accidentally kills Taylor - who follows her for the rest of the film like a ghost. It could be the worst movie I've ever seen.
