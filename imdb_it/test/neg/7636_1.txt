To judge a film only for the landscapes, the furnishings, the costumes ... it is not right, you lack the core: THE STORY <br /> <br /> A film must tell something, to tell a story something that you impresses. Yes, I was pleased with the sea, the cliffs, the clear water and all the rest but ... Is there a plot? <br /> <br /> They are the most interesting films with crazy people, like: THE FLIGHT ON THE CUCCO "S NEST ... etc ... etc. It is a crazy woman who is more attached to the dogs of her children or her husband, just a clear psychiatric case !!!! Nothing extraordinary. Unfortunately a waste of time. Is there all that anger that comes from "fish smell" sea?
