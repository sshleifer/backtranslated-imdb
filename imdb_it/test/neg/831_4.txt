First of all, let me tell you that I wasted Halloween night watching this garbage. Second, let me inform you that the current DVD available from the Shriek Show is not cut, so the towed dogs will be very upset. Thirdly, that scene is the highlight of the movie and since it was cut, well, see where I'm going. <br /> <br /> I know that many horror fans are digging this movie. It is atmospheric, filmed in the woods with some very beautiful landscapes, waterfalls and so on. But after the opening killing, which has a very brutal blow to a machete that is stuck in the groin of a hunter, after this you don't get brutal killings. And, with a slasher movie, you almost want it. At least, I know. The director and the co. not doing anything new with the idea of ​​the murderer in the woods, many of these films were made at the same time in the early 1980s. The only thing that is happening is that you don't hate actors as much as you could in other movies. I'm kind of nice. Children have a reason to be there: one of them owns an estate deed on the mountain. But what is not explained is why his family has property there. There is no house or house, so why buy a property in the East Jesus, especially if you are not a hunter or what? Well, I'm sure some people buy land for camping, but it seems strange. In any case, two inept squawks appear and start chasing the campers and collect them one at a time. And, as I said before, you get practically nothing in terms of decent deaths after killing the machete in the beginning. The ending has a kind of "off the wall" killed by Connie, but even this is not enough to save this from being almost equal to the completely forgettable movie, The Forest, which is shocking. <br /> <br /> If Shriek Show had been able to get a real uncut print, then this review could have been a little more forgiving, but this is the day and age of DVD versions untrimmed / not surveyed of old dark movies for cine-hounds like me. When you offend us, you get the raw review. Unfortunately, the presence of the great paternal George Kennedy is the only strong point of this film to distinguish it from other garden waste that has been baked during the day.
