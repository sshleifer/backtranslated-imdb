An Italian-American co-production co-starring Linda Blair and David 'The Hoff' Hasselhoff: how can a horror trash fan resist such treatment? <br /> <br /> Well, based on the non-bustling, extremely boring, and absolutely meaningless for the first forty minutes or so, I would have said "very easily"; Fortunately, however, things eventually become a bit more fun with the introduction of several inventive death scenes, and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy, even a smattering of nudity (unfortunately, my copy has been changed visually to remove this offensive material). <br /> <br /> The Hoff plays Gary, a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) in a run-down hotel on an apparently deserted island to photograph her latest project, a book on witches; while there, frustrated Gary also hopes to try to cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie of her virginity. <br /> <br /> His plans for the nookie are screwed, however, by the unexpected arrival of real estate developers Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), their son Tommy (Michael Manchester), the nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland), and real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who came to inspect the hotel on the island. <br /> <br /> After explaining their unexpected presence on the island, Gary and Leslie are greeted by the new owners of the property, and when suddenly a violent storm breaks out, which makes it dangerous to return to the mainland, everyone agrees to pass the night in the old building. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to the new hotel guests, the place also hosts the spirit of an evil witch (Hildegard Knef), who requires human sacrifices to bring back to life. One by one, the victims are dragged into a swirling red vortex (which guarantees involuntary laughter), before encountering a terrible fate. <br /> <br /> None of this makes much sense, and the acting is atrocious (Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad, while Hasselhoff proves to be one of the best performers, who talks about others), but the spectators who succeed in overcoming the sad first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore: Rose has her lips sewn together before being roasted alive in a fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burned alive; Linda is tortured by witches and impaled on a swordfish (!!); Freddie's veins pulsate and explode in geysers of blood; and Gary is stabbed in the back. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Leslie is raped by a lipless boy and Blair is possessed (again).
