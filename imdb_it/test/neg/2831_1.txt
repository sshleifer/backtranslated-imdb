First of all this is one of the worst "straight-to-cable" soft-core erotic thrillers I've ever seen in my life. Of course, as all erotic thrillers want to do, it is a lady of the brothel and is set in a brothel. This, of course, makes the simulated softcore sex that opens every 10 minutes seems "in context". Everything. <br /> <br /> Forget for a moment that this was never meant to win any prizes. The actors are terrible and their reading of the line made me shudder. The woman who plays the policeman is so bad that she is beyond description. He must really be a good friend of the guys who put the film on stage for this terrible adventure, if you understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are only slightly higher than porn. Besides that? I suppose if you're really drunk and need something to laugh about, this would be a perfect movie. And if that's the case, I recommend fast forwarding to all scenes with the female cop. What is that accent, Brooklyn? Funny!
