Should this be serious? I hope not. This is one of the most pathetically funny movies I've ever seen. Since I took it for a dollar on the "Bad Movie" shelf, it certainly lives up to its place in the store. What can I say, the effects of the gore are splashed (pun-destined) all over the place, some seem quite real, some look like a teddy bear who had an accident with a bottle of tomato sauce. The music is one of the most horrible I've ever heard, acting is one of the funniest elements ... should I continue? Don't worry if you haven't seen every other pathetic horror movie in the store and that's all that's left.
