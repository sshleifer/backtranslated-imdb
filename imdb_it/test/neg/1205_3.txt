I liked this move when I was a child, but now that I'm older I can see how absurd the plot is. In case you haven't read the previous reviews, it's a teenager and an Air Force colonel who steals two fully loaded F-16s to save his father's dad. <br /> <br /> It has some beautiful aerial acrobatics, even if the dialogue that accompanies then is basically teckno babel. <br /> <br /> Some involuntary humor in the modified version for TV. When the hero's father is detained by Iran, err, I mean a country without a name, and his torturers ask him for a confession (in relation to why he is detained, don't worry exactly why or what they want to confuse him with.) "Tell him he can take my confession and throw it down my throat." However his lips and, more strangely, his gesture make clear what movement, and part of the anatomy, he was really thinking.
