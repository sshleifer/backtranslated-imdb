Be a member of the American service, please believe me when I say that this film in no way describes the emotional state of our soldiers / sailors / aviators / marines returning from the sides. <br /> <br /> Having said that .... <br /> <br /> This film is a big pile of clich√©s. The acting is horrible (except for the child), the character's backgrounds are weak and laughable, and the plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I made an account with IMDb just to warn anyone with half a brain away from it. <br /> <br /> The Canadian writer / director Francesco Lucente really, really should be ashamed of this movie. If you disagree with US foreign policy, you should write a letter to the US government, not punish the entire English-speaking world with a monumental shit movie.
