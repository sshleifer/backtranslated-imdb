I watched all three Mad Max movies in succession for the first time a few days ago and I was bitterly disappointed by the third episode. it destroys the excellent work of the first two films with a weak and light-hearted action and a plot that turns Australian wastelands and apocalyptic lands into a comical sand that one would expect to see in a children's adventure film. Max's character is unrecognizable from his dark and cynical character seen in the previous films and transformed into a predictable and disinterested savior that made me feel betrayed. if you haven't seen this movie yet, just don't do it. Let the story end with the road warrior and save a very painful hour and a half. (spoiler alarm) the other big problem I had with this film that really left a bitter taste in my mouth was the flying man. we had already seen it in the warrior of the road in which he had helped Max and yet when he reappears in the storm it seems that the two have never met. if he should have been a different character or a relative of the road warriors, gyro man, I don't know. however it has not been explained and is a weak element in this overall weak film. 2 out of 10. does not get a 1/10 because of the fight for thunder.
