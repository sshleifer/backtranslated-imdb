I deliberately read all the reviews of this movie on IMDb before watching it because I really wanted to see it and make a decision. I've been a big QT fan in the past, I think we can all agree that he made some great films, but lately he seems to have been overwhelmed by his mystique and disappeared in its foundation. This "film" proves it. It consists of some Bastards at work scenes. Instead it consists mainly of long, boring, boring conversational traits between people who, after a while, realize you don't give a description. He is very long-winded and lacks the great sparkling dialogue that QT has been responsible for in the past. The whole film is anticlimatic. There is no tension - what is about to happen in every scene is wired so clearly in advance that the moment you happen it doesn't matter to you. Honestly folks, I don't think the hype. This is a very boring film and you will not miss anything if you don't see it.
