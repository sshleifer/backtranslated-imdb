You expect him to be young, but at least you expect a complete and consistent film. What a waste. I am extremely disappointed, not only for having seen a bad movie, but for having such a great concept to be contaminated by a common film that we have all seen before. If this money costs $ 1 on the budget, the study would be wise to declare the victory, collect all available copies, store them in the nuclear waste repository under Yucca Mountain, and then never do another film like this again. Most of this movie will make you think, "This is not what I wanted to see." This film appeals to the unintelligent and perhaps the teenagers. It's a shame because most movies are made for that demographic. I had a lot more hope for this movie.
