It is incredible that a yuppie-angst film so full of clich√©s was made in the first place. The characters are so weak and the acting so uninspired, that it's impossible to take care of any of them ... especially Brooke Shields. The temptation to move quickly through the slow parts is almost irresistible. If you like this genre, it would be better to rent "Singles" or "Bodies, Rest & Motion".
