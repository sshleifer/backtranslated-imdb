This is the only film I can think of where, after it's over, I was filled with anger at the waste of money and time on my part and on everyone involved in the realization. No wonder that Alan Moore has refused to have anything to do with V for Vendetta (a phenomenal film) after this debacle. <br /> <br /> It's not bad in a fun way, like Showgirls. It's ugly in a way that makes you want to take your eyes off. Draw holes of the size of the planets. The worst script in memory. Horrible acting by decent actors. Images that should be great, but somehow flop. <br /> <br /> It could have been so beautiful ...
