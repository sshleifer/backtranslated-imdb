Historically terrible. Just a precise moment in 4 hours of ridicule. It is not possible to keep track of inconsistencies during viewing. As with all films on track and archived, nobody bother to ask for track consultants. Events and techniques are shown that were not created until the next century. From the strokes of runners jogging in a 400 meter to the strongly overweight actor who portrays the high jump and the long jump jump, you should definitely not know anything on the track to be even moderately amused. Probably put together in 1984 as a tribute to the games just before the Los Angeles Olympics.
