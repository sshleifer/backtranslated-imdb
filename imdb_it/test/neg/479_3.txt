Written by, directed and interpreted by field champion Bruce Campbell. Easy, it's easy to say that this is a budget on a bad deal; shot independently in Bulgaria. All I can really say is that the fool is not always fun. Campbell plays a wealthy American businessman with an unfaithful wife (Antoinette Byron) and is trying to close a business transaction before being killed. He hires a taxi driver to lead him to a strange town; not knowing that his wife is "carrying on" the taxi driver. Within moments of Campbell gasping; the taxi driver is killed in the same position. A mad scientist (Stacy Keach) proceeds with an experiment putting the taxi driver's brain inside the American head. With massive stitches on his forehead, Campbell frees himself and walks around the streets looking for his wife; all the while he is arguing with a strange voice inside his oversized head. Campbell contorts his rubbery face by making silly expressions as he argues with himself. So Bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be happy. I have the impression that this must have been written as a direct comedy. Completing the cast are Ted Raimi, Tamara Gorski and Vladmir Kolev. Watch this on the Sci-Fi channel.
