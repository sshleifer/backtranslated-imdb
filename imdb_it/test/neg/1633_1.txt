Why was this film made? Are the producers so easily deceived by the sadists who will give them the money to create torture methods like this so-called "movie"? I love a bad movie as much as the next masochist, but "Cave Dwellers" is pushing it. It's seriously painful to watch. The plot is something about a guy named Ator - an inveterate numbnuts I'll call Private Snowball for the rest of this review - who has to fight unseen warriors and save a princess to beat the baddie who needs to find a better hairdresser. I could have been wrong about the plot since it's been a while since I saw this excrement, but really, do you care so much? Oh yes, Private Snowball also has a dumb Asian assistant (who doesn't?). Who's not funny. <br /> <br /> However, Private Snowball fights invisible people, visits some caves, all in the name of a good king so devoid of personality that makes Al Gore look like Jim Carrey. Then Private Snowball builds a hang glider (yes, I'm serious) and takes the girl. Yippie-kee-yay. It's cheap, unintentionally silly and incredibly boring. Why am I not surprised that the director ended up doing porn? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: AVOID. Ator will steal a part of your life and you won't have funny slogans "so bad to do" to take with you from the experience. Bad Ator! BAD! AAK! * gag *
