Peter Yates' film based on the pen of Steve Tesich is a relatively low "thriller" that fails to take off. The story concerns the mysterious murder of an influential Asian businessman and the consequent implication of a pathetic Vietnam veteran (James Woods) who, according to the police, could have taken revenge on his former employer. As an "eyewitness", William Hurt never believes his friend is capable of such an act. <br /> <br /> Hurt is well below his usual strength, and finds it difficult to sympathize with him or an inspired Sigourney Weaver. James Woods and Christopher Plummer do a little better in their supporting roles. Of note is the appearance of Morgan Freeman as Detective Black. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the story of Steve Tesich is just an unlikely love story disguised as a mysterious film. The plot is too invented. <br /> <br /> Friday 17 October 1997 - Video
