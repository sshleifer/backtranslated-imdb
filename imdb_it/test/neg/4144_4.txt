I didn't want to write this film about reviews and critics in the Western world, I mean how wrong were they about Asian cinema that has now become a basic diet of the Hollywood remake monster? Also, Jet L is damn nice, and has made some interesting films in Asia. So with an open mind I was surprisingly mediated by this film. <br /> <br /> There are good points. The story is very clever, using M-Theory as a basis to carry on the plot that there are more universes each with their own versions of worlds, and most likely you. Each time one of you is destroyed, the rest shares the energy and power between them. The idea that someone could prove and purposely become the only version of themselves in all the universes to find out if they become a God. There is also Jet Li, and he is not a bad actor and rather agile as a martial artist, plus Jason Statham who is a good all-round actor. As for the special effects, some of these are really fantastic, a mix of time and speed in slow motion with normal speed, very nice to see in places. <br /> <br /> Negative points? Statham's accent is terrifying, and some of the effects are not comparable to others, so it's pretty obvious that the money was spent on some of the main shots and not on others that were probably considered too short on the screen or simply ran out of budget. <br /> <br /> A big sore point for me is the close-up action of the camera that Hollywood has long favored, something that Jackie Chan has often talked about. Shooting close-up combat scenes serves two purposes. It gives more emphasis to a single punch or movement, making it harder and more real than it really is, and it also hides what happens around the camera lens. For example, people who have a false arm or the face of a stunt double, etc. <br /> <br /> What Chan has always said is that he tried to open the camera and show the public what was happening, to show them people are fighting correctly rather than a close-up of a face and a fist, which cuts to someone who falls into the frame. Showing the entire image is more effective, and it's more impressive. <br /> <br /> So close-up shots were just more annoying than anything else, you didn't see the grandeur of Li's fighting skills, and you found it hard to see some of the action. Slow down the cuts and take out the camera Hollywood directors! The biggest problem was the story, although, despite having such a strong base to build on, they seemed to lose the sense of the plot and focus on the action scenes. There are some serious plot constructs and explanatory moments that are completely overlooked and covered in the space of a few sentences, however these may have formed an excellent and complex character development. <br /> <br /> Even this was held weakly together, and not enough of the story was done. All in all, not a great film and its potential has been seriously ruined.
