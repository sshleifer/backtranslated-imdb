I don't understand why every time someone does a show on one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country (Houston, Dallas, Austin / San Antonio etc.), they portray the average person as someone wearing a wrangler / cowboy hat, talking with a sip , has no fashion sense, and drives a truck on the way to the "saloon" or his next hunting trip, rodeo, clay pigeon shooting or country music concert. I've never even seen a cop in a small town driving a police truck ... anywhere in Texas. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that it is not done for artistic or comedy reasons ... in reality they are serious and I believe that the average person is too stupid to know the difference. Bad scripts and the same bad acting give away. This show does funny shows in the past as the Knightrider looks like high-end entertainment. At least Knightrider had the talking car.
