Really a disappointing delirious film, I actually expected a fantastic cat and mouse movie to go on in the movie and have some of the cat and mouse things that happened, but it was just stupid. And basically he showed all the good scenes from the trailer, in fact if you saw the trailer on this, you pretty much saw the whole movie because it's just so predictable. So basically, the plot involves some workers in an armored truck company trying to steal the 42 million dollars they are supposed to carry, as long as one of the members grows in consciousness. I thought the film would have been better with the cast of famous actors, but I was wrong. I mean, this is not necessarily a bad movie, but it was neither good nor thorough. This is definitely a maximum rent, but it's not worth seeing in cinemas. robbery <br /> <br /> 4.8 / 10
