"The Danish Bladerunner" is boldly indicated on the box. Are you kidding me?! This film is a complete resistance. When I'm thirsty and I go to get a soda in the kitchen, I usually pause the video recorder, so I won't miss anything. Not this time. In fact, I found myself looking at the refrigerator for a long time, just to avoid having to go back. Why the hell isn't there a SINGLE screenwriter script out there who has the vaguest idea how computers work? It's shocking. One of the premises of the film is that our hero (who is a hacker), has a small computer assistant to help him (the Microsoft Office paperclip finally captured in the future). When he loses the assistant in the film, he is helpless and cannot enter any computer. IT'S A HACKER! It's like saying that you can't drive your car if you don't have your lucky "driving hat". I won't even get into the lightning effect when it receives the electric shock ...
