Apart from the district attorney (James Eckhouse) and a short woman apparently attuned to Ellen Gulden (Renee Zellweger), Ellen herself is the only convincing character - and a likeable character in the film. She is the only one, not her dying mother, who should be and is - the only real thing. it is not only in the role, in the acting of Zellweger, but also in the plot itself ... Until when, the plot rebels against itself - and makes the mother "the only real thing" in the eyes of her weak, willing, superficial husband who cannot do anything right for his wife or daughter. The daughter perceives what the observer perceives, but such intelligent perceptions must give way to the superficial feeling of the husband that is obscured both by the reality of his wife and his daughter. <br /> <br /> To start, the only powerful scene in this film, when Ellen faces her father's cruelty, the lie is finally given. Ellen is just another strong young woman who must be domesticated by a whining father. A very imperfect film - so imperfect as to be called boring and not worth it.
