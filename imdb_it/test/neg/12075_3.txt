Wow, this episode started on a premise of STOOOOOPID! The Enterprise is stirring when suddenly, Abraham Lincoln is floating in space and welcomes the Enterprise !!!!!!! Is it just me, or is this a really bad idea ?! Lincoln comes on board and they welcome them. Abe suggests getting down to an arid planet, where they meet other famous deaths - both good and bad. It seems that a slightly rough looking rock monster has gathered a team of GOOD and EVIL people to fight for supremacy. The whole thing seems really crazy and inherently unjust, since the GOOD part is afflicted by Surak - a Vulcan who makes Gandhi look like a Rambo !! Despite an absolutely seen premise, the action is quite good and it's nice to see overhead shots of obvious double fights in this grudge match. But don't confuse it with high art or profound science fiction. The bottom line is that the series was at its last legs as a series of the first series and this really seemed to redraw this turkey and take it back regardless of the absurdity of the premise.
