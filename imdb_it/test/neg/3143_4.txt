What should have been a dramatic life story on the Murray River turns out to be a foolish and sickly story of an English refugee (Sigrid Thornton with an Australian accent) who falls in love with the first larrikin officer (John Waters) of a paddle steamer. <br /> <br /> The first half of this four and a half hour mini-series shows some promises, but it soon falls flat when it becomes predictable and thin. A certain verve and spark in the plot was needed to bring the film to life. The early release of Gus Mercurio did not help as his character seemed to me the only interesting one. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the longest TV version has more depth, because this video translation certainly doesn't have it. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 27, 1993 - Video
