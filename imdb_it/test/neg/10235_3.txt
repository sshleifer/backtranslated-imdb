Carole Lombard is the protagonist of this transitional film. This film is a typical example of a very early "talkie" (the first sound film was "The Jazz Singer", 1927). Overall, the acting in this film tends to be extremely broad and very melodramatic. <br /> <br /> The viewer can easily see that the actors are still "acting" for a silent film, and this combined with the overly pronounced, too honest dialogue (it seems very likely that a diction-diction trainer- drama has been widely used to teach "silent" actors to pronounce jokes), creates some pretty comic scenes that were not meant to be comic at all. <br /> <br /> Carole Lombard has then a great capacity of acting almost unrecognizable under all the ample gestures, the melodrama and the impudent desire. <br /> <br /> Interesting as a historical curiosity of the period, and for its unintended comedy - field value.
