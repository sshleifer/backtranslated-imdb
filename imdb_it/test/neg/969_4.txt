Bubbling just below the surface of Showtime is a good idea. Actually, it's more like two or three ideas that constantly fight for the Screentime. This film not only has its cake and also eats it; has the whole bakery. <br /> <br /> Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) has a drug bust interrupted by the media and an unfortunate police actor, Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy). When Preston's partner is shot, he angrily pulls the camera from the hands of a bad journalist, and the guy lands him in a new police reality show produced by Chase Renzi (Rene Russo). In the first of many errors and oddities in the film, that injured partner is never heard or mentioned for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> De Niro's best gag is his speech to a classroom of children the children open the photo on how TV cops don't behave like real cops. The funny thing is that as the movie progresses, his character and Murphy's begin to act more and more like the clich√©s they are supposed to clash so strongly with. In a smarter film, De Niro's diatribe could have been an ironic comment; here, it shows just to emphasize how lame the film really is. While a parody of a reality-based cop show could be fun, the team of writers and directors Tom Dey (who made the superb Shanghai Noon a few years ago, see that movie instead) seems to be uncertain, and instead of slamming the TV industry has really tarnished them (the hardest thing that seems to be able to tell network executives is that they like to play ping pong at work). The character of Russo has a spark of diabolical delight in his eyes, but his dialogues and actions rarely coincide with the actress's enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> With a small screen to get my attention, my mind started to wander, and this is dangerous in a movie with lots of holes in the plot. For example; if Showtime (the name given to the detective show) is such a success, why doesn't anyone seem to recognize De Niro and Murphy when they are at work? After all, if their investigation of the smuggler and all around means that the guy from Vargas is shown on television, why the hell doesn't he have someone who told him they are on his trail? Then again, given the actions of this villain, maybe I shouldn't be surprised; this is the same joker who is very angry with a partner for using his new supergun without approval, jeopardizing a deal, and then sent him how? Using a dozen superguns to level his entire house, of course! It is like extinguishing a fire with a bigger fire. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, Showtime laughs, but there simply isn't enough for the film that lasts almost two hours. Even worse, the really smart gags suggest that this movie could really have been involved in something, if only they had included some other drafts of the script. Murphy Mug and talks as quickly as possible with minimal results, and De Niro looks bored due to most of this. After a completely useless fist fight between policemen and gangsters (which causes no injuries and no arrests), the Russian character screams "This is a great television!" Maybe it's a great television, but it's far from a great movie.
