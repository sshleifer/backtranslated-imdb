I found this film extremely homophobic ... the main character doesn't know he is gay until he realizes he likes Barbra Streisand and has a limping wrist !!! I was so offended that after the screening at the Toronto Film Festival, I went up and talked to the writer to complain about this movie. This is the kind of film on which GLAAD must work to be banned.
