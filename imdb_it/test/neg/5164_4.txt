I saw this movie on the big screen today and I honestly can't believe some of the comments people make here. I really hoped to be touched by this movie, but I wasn't. <br /> <br /> I am a former Australian army and very patriotic towards this great country, but I feel that this film does not do justice for us and the soldier who fought in this battle. <br /> <br /> The film is poorly filmed. I thought the acting was terrible, they weren't credible and they gave me no reason to worry about them. People say that this film was graphic, there were a couple of graphic scenes but I found most of it very weak. The war scenes were very short and last only a couple of minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall a weak film that does not do justice to these soldiers.
