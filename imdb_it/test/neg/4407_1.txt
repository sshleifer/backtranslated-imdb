It is not guided by the plot, OK; it is not a study of the character, well; there is no action, all right; it makes no sense, hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Perhaps it should represent the boredom and the absurdity of living in Palistina and parts of Israel in these days in a state of violence, small disagreements, deep hostilities, etc. But above all they are long, long scenes of nothing that happens - or things that seem to be dripping with meaning (a checkpoint tower that crashes to the ground, an Arafat balloon floating in Jerusalem, a crouching tiger that deflects the bullets in a halo) but when you try to get meaning, it's not there. <br /> <br /> Bonus: you can watch this movie fast and it will make absolutely no difference except that it could be a little less boring.
