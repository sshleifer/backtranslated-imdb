I really wanted to like this movie, but barely liked a 3. It is amazing that 10 equal votes were the same, 1 other half. All the characters were funny and talented, but overall the movie didn't give its fruits. Sebastian Hernandez is attractive; charismatic and likeable (he also physically resembles Marc Anthony in a more accessible but ultimately conscious way ...) but even he can't save this mess of a movie. The scenes dragged on too long and the points were finally massacred to death. The banana scene contrasted with self-absorption, apparently showing how much movement there was in his boxers. But in his defense it was his first film as a director (of which I am aware) and I appreciate his love work. He left me empty, despite what he was trying to say. Ultimately I think the story would have been better managed by a more experienced director. From what I have seen of the "extras", there is a real story behind this and, perhaps when I finish watching them, I will appreciate this attempt more.
