This can hardly be called a good movie, in reality it is not even close. But I have to say that there were some things that made me ... don't laugh, don't laugh, but something like that. The parody of Resovoir Dog was one of those. The rest is not important enough to be remembered. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was a little disappointed with this movie. The plot looked like an idea, but it quickly fell to the ground. The whole thing was just messy and the actors weren't good for the characters; most of them are simply overcrowded. There was also a lot of unimportant sequences, which was a total waste of movies. I realize that it would make the movie about 20 minutes shorter, but it would only be better. <br /> <br /> Now, with the good and the bad things lined up, let's go to the conclusion: two out of six seats for this.
