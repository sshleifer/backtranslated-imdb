Has this doodoo shard won an award? They must be desperate for giving a reward for something. This movie smells like teen stuff and it makes me sick. Fortunately, I saw it with Mike and the MST3K robots, so it was bearable. Horrid acting, disturbing moment mother / daughter, silly premise, if you want a bad movie here it is. Be careful, however, look at it with Mike and the robots or you will suffer. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10. I still can't believe I won a prize, and the director is defending this * && ^ $$ # $ ^ && piece of ^% ^% $ ^ $ #% @ $ # @ movie!
