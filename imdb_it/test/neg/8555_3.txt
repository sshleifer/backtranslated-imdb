Take the CD instead. The show is docile and the editing sucks. The crowd gets too much time for the screen, as does Till Lindemann. The cameras spend more time on the same guy shaking their heads in the same way (which makes me believe it's exactly the same shot) than they do during Richard Kruspe's solo in Weisses Fleisch. The scenes change so quickly that it's impossible to tell where the camera is pointing, and the replays are simply redundant. Not worth the tape on which it is recorded.
