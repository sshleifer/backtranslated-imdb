*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Some packs of Afrikkaner-Hillbilly types are in the desert in search of Diamonds when they find a hard mound in the middle of a sandy desert area. Spoiler: The stupidest starts hitting the mound with a pickaxe and opens it. Then look into the hole and stick his head inside and SURPRISE! something eats it. The other two fools are no longer seen alive again. Scott Bairstow introduces himself as a pizza delivery guy, but plays a kind of expert scientist with a medical degree (which means he should be around 35 years old, minimum). Bairstow is supposed to join camp C and help them find the diamonds. The truck that collects Bairstow to bring it to Camp C has a handful of weird guys who usually populate films like "PITCH BLACK" "THE THING" etc. The truck happens to cross the first truck and they decide to investigate (how come that truck didn't see the other truck while they were driving to take Bairstow, since they were traveling the same road ??). So they find the bodies eaten, and there are some decent special effects related to the bones with small pieces of meat on them. The group's main madman, Karl, decides that they must find the killer. So the truck turns in the desert following some tracks, and eventually has an electric short and the crew is stuck in the desert. The stupidest guy in this group had picked up a bunch of bones using his jacket to carry them around. When he takes a nap (wearing the same jacket) the creatures eat him alive, and another boy crashes and sticks his arm in the sticky substance and that dummy also loses his arm. It seems exciting so far, except a few minutes later, Dr. Bairstow understands that the creature is actually hundreds of thousands of ants that use bones to hold themselves together so they can travel to a new hive (because the miners open up) to crack the old beehive). Now, the last time I checked, the ants could move by themselves, without having to kill people to use the bones for the structure. If all they needed was something difficult, they could put together a bunch of sticks and use them to create a shape. The whole story is really stupid and the ant's explanation is the only date. The rest of the film is about the group that is killed until they find the new anthill and kill the anthill (sort of), and the hundreds of thousands of ants then leave on their own. feet. An ant-brain backup was found (off-camera) and sent for analysis, thus creating a reason for a sequel.
