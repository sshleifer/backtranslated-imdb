I enjoyed seeing that some of the reviews here were surmounted by ** SPOILER ** the joke in my family is that the only part of this film that is not distributed on the back of the box is distributed in the title. Maybe I'm just a seventeen year old American who wouldn't know art if he bit me in the leg, but I prefer movies that contain at least some words. This film makes the second half of 2001: Odyssey in the space at the bottom right and talkative. This film is so slow that it's not even art, it's simply boring. We follow this creepy boy who is following this boy around Venice. The end was incomprehensible until I read the end of the book. A film should not make you refer to the book, it should be able to be alone. This film has no way to resist. It doesn't even have the bones of a plot to lean on.
