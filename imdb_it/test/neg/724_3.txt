This is one of four films from the 1970s by the television producer Lane Slate on sensationalist murders in small towns. They present friendly TV personalities such as police chiefs and bizarre characters as regulars of the city, including light love interests. The others are: They Only Kill Their Masters (James Garner, 1972); and The Girl in The Empty Grave and Deadly Game (both Andy Griffith, 1977). <br /> <br /> Alda's is located near Vermont ("Mount Angel" next to "Horse Creek"); the others in California, Garner's at seaside ("Eden Landing") and Griffith's in the mountains ("Jasper Lake"). Everyone tries to capture the atmosphere of a small city, to move at a relaxed pace between comfortable characters and to tell a mystery with at least some complicated turning points. At that level, they are a bit funny (they were often repeated by themselves and suggest a certain charm). But he suffers from subtle stories and dialogues, slow rhythm, insignificant settings, flat or exaggerated characters, and offensive attempts, often (often youthful or rough) in color or humor. <br /> <br /> Alda's and Garner's are the most serious about history, characters, rhythm and tone. They have the best supporting casts, even if Alda's is better used; the Griffith throws pale in comparison. Alda has the best director. <br /> <br /> "Shocking" has some surprises and drama. The killer method is inventive. The tone is more uniform and the dialogue is more natural than Griffith's. Alda's film does not suffer like the others from the complacent transplants of cities in the city or from exaggerated local characters, both deceived as screenplays by a Hollywood screenwriter, not so genuine (the worst offender is the pipsqueak of Griffith's films, murmuring moron "Whit ", which, we are told, we tried to hook up a jeep and escape with a trailer that served as a branch of a temporary bank, we dragged off the pier for the police boat, stole tomatoes from a farmer's truck just to get nothing for them, and filled $ 11 on the "Spiro T. Babylis" withdrawal receipt only to be discovered by the cashier). The dialogue in the repetitive and heavy style of Griffith's films is completely merciful ("Are you going to lunch?" "I'm going to get the boat." "Are you taking the boat for lunch?" "I won't go to lunch." "You won't go to take the boat for lunch? "" There are no fish in this lake, why are you fishing here? "" It is illegal in Horse Mountain. "" It is published here too, you are breaking the law. "" A little law, not there are fish in this lake. "" Then why are you fishing here? "" I told you, it's illegal at Horse Mountain. ";" Please call me Lloyd. My name is Lloyd. "" Okay, Lloyd ... . "" Call me Lloyd. This is my name. My name is Lloyd. ") <br /> <br /> But Alda is too low key and insignificant to be taken seriously as well as a little police chief, certainly not an ardent lawyer requested by a rival city Slate admitted the character, when he arrives late on the scene of a now obvious clue, as a result of an acknowledgment. suali of the name: Rather than detect or investigate, Barnes blindly affects emotional rejection. His secretary Lasser gives him a key clue ("Because I didn't think about it," he says!). An embarrassing funeral scene, in addition to a plot weave, leads to another gift clue. <br /> <br /> Worse still, Barnes is more interested in mocking the military style helmets of the county police sent to help him (even suggests Deadly Game Slate has something against the army) that effectively leads them or his men . It allows a late murder by incompetently protecting a known target. Barnes allows his car to be repeatedly rammed by the killer on the run from a crime scene, without taking out his gun or trying to take control. Once again, it is ineffective and almost killed, in the climatic scene, which results from multiple errors on its part that are only partially corrected, by chance. The misleading northeastern accent that influences Alda does not help credibility. <br /> <br /> There are holes in the plot. Why should the killer hit after all these years? And committing the first two murders without a trace does not seem plausible. But they are nothing compared to the next - a couple together, a shopkeeper in his shop during working hours, a fully dressed deputy sitting in his office and, incredibly, his dog! <br /> <br /> Alda's film also suffers from some offensive elements that Slate injects into all the films. Barnes first appears in the bed of a motel employee. He then treats her rudely at every corner and insults and tries to avoid his children. This, and we are talking about the doctor, of a rough and mean model (Garner's film has been described as "shabby", including a scene in which he and a deputy laugh about how a girl in the back seat of a car she's struck by a bump in the middle of the road had a part of his anatomy bitten by a guy in the car with her. Griffith's film is a surrogate Ropers routine, in which the woman embarrassingly tries to convince the man to "supply closet" , a free locker room exchange with a deputy in discussing the death of a young woman's car accident ("Did you take her out?" "I took her once."), a reference to the bank teller "Bernice "like" swollen seats "and" stick a pin "and" hate "and dismiss the secretary" Maude "because she was" too hairy ", a description of the doctor's practice as" two stirrup tables and a flashlight ", a humiliating scene in which Proposals of Fran Ryan Griffith, which o ffre "a little grown up at home" and an offensive subplot in which a woman, pursued by a deputy, plays and is a garish buffoon, seems "to sleep around". <br /> <br /> Finally, Alda's film looks gloomy, bleached, colorless and lifeless. Only Louise Lasser adds spark. At least the other films had a spirit, a setting and pleasant music; Griffith descended on the mountainside, on the lake and even in the big city. You feel more like reviewing Masters or Empty Grave than Shocking.
