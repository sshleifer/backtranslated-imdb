Certainly not a bad low-budget movie, this "Bride of the Gorilla", but nothing special, either, and not memorable enough to be ranked among the significant Sci-Fi efforts of its time. Director Curt Siodmak was an eminent screenwriter in the 1930s and 1940s and published stories for some of the classics ("I walked with a zombie", "The wolf man") but, as a director, he obviously didn't have the required skills. "Bride of the Gorilla" is similar to the aforementioned "The Wolf Man" in history and atmosphere, but the film seems much more amateurish and pitiful. Both deal with cursed men who turn into big animals at night, but the tit gorilla doesn't seem half-threatening like the werewolf, even though the film was released a whole decade later. During a poor opening speech, actor Lon Chaney tries to convince us that the jungle is a threatening place that hides many mysteries, but in reality there is no real mystery to the plot. It's just a plantation manager who is jealous of his older colleague for having such a beautiful young wife and kills him. An indigenous woman testifies to her crime and casts a spell on Barney that turns him into a horrible gorilla at night ... Or maybe he just wants him to think he's turning into a horrible big gorilla? Lon Chaney himself plays the police commissioner in charge of investigating the murder while Raymond Burr (who has acted in about a thousand Perry Mason films) portrays the greedy plantation / night gorilla manager. Does Siodmak try to make the movie look like a supernatural thriller ?? Is it or isn't it all happening alone in Barney's head? ?? fail miserably and cause too much talk and too much action in the jungle. Many jungle settings are well represented, but the rest of the "special" effects are bad and badly done. Still the acting is pretty good, Barbara Payton is beautiful and ?? even if very predictable ?? the story is strangely compelling to the end. Odd movie, probably cursed me against voodoo ??
