It's not right. I really expected this to be a fun and entertaining movie. I mean, I like Drake Bell from Drake and Josh, and Leslie Neilson is nothing to sneeze from her early classics, Airplane and Naked Gun. However, after watching the Superhero movie, I'm glad I didn't even have to pay for it. It wouldn't have been close to $ 9 per ticket. More like a dollar and a few cents. Because this is summed up by the hour and some minutes. And as disappointing as it was in this film, I'm glad the execution time was short, if not shorter. I can't believe how incredibly vulgar, useless and, above all, STUPID, some of the scenes were! And above all, I saw him play better from a wooden mannequin (without the ventriloquist). It's as if Craig Mazin intentionally wanted to make a film that deserves his 3.7, if not less, and even try to be worse than "Meet the Spartans". Really very disappointing.
