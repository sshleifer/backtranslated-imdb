It was the first action film made in a banned fashion in the Hollywood action style of the USSR. It's not even close to the Hollywood action movies of that time. The plot is childish, the direction is so-so. This film was successful because it was the first of its kind in Russia. Although I have looked at it many times I have to admit that it was a bit naive and I didn't like it. This is not the best example of a Russian action movie. This is only the first experience.
