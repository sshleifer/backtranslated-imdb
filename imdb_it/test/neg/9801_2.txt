In the 40s, Veronica Lake achieved a cinematographic notoriety, thanks to her sensual beauty and her highly exploited "peekaboo" hairstyle. He starred alongside big names such as Alan Ladd and Fredric March, achieving such cinematic successes as "This Gun For Hire" and "I Married A Witch". She also reigned with female stars, and even surprised her detractors with her portrayal of a bitter Navy nurse in "So Fierely We Hail". But the changing times and its failures have reached it and, at the end of the decade, its heyday was over. With two unsuccessful marriages behind her (and two more in her future) Veronica headed to New York, where she occasionally did television and summer series appearances before disappearing completely out of sight. It was brief news when she was found working as a waitress in a second-class hotel in the early sixties. But by now, her long-standing alcoholism and years of hard life had robbed her of her appearance. Without them, public interest in her soon vanished again. She returned to the stage in assorted vehicles, but her success was minimal. Eventually, he moved to Miami, Florida, where he lived in relative darkness. In 1966 he went to Canada for a part in an obscure film called "Footsteps In The Snow" which had no release in the United States. The following year, it was discovered by some industrial directors who had long wanted to produce a commercial film. They approached her to act in the movie "Time Is Terror" and they convinced her to invest in the project. As one author said, "If ever a movie queen had an accident in a terminal, it was just like that." Surrounded by amateur artists and pathetic production values, she failed to reach a minimum level in this quick shot in Miami, Florida. Seemed absolutely ordinary in long shots and closely aged in close-ups, poor Veronica did not behave so much as to walk through her side. Like a deranged doctor, who has struck a successful youthful restorative formula, using carnivorous larvae !, she looks bored and confused, her most unintentionally hilarious moment comes when she is forced into ad-lib while she savagely struggles to make a pair made of rubber. The supporting cast is of no help, simply by advancing the plot by talking about death. Apparently, director Brad Grinter has only asked the actors to move while the camera was aimed at them, without needing anything that resembled entertainment (there is, let's face it, an unintentionally funny scene involving a detective / nurse private and a corpse in a wheelchair that precedes "Weekend From Bernie's" almost 20 years old. According to Veronica, the film was archived for three years because no film was made, but in 1970, the production company did it scraped together, changed the title to "Flesh Feast" and released it to cash in on Lake's recently published biography, and since former women's industry leaders like Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and Olivia De Havilland had unexpectedly rekindled their careers in horror movies, this parody was promoted as Veronica's "return movie." This seems like a strange course of action for filmmakers, however, because it is unlikely that the (young e) public of a horror film of this quality has known or cared who Veronica Lake was. As expected, she did nothing for Veronica's career, and died in poverty three years later. A previous reviewer cites a scene in which the female detective who works undercover as a nurse in the doctor's lab (overseeing the theft of bodies from a nearby morgue) enlists the help of a talented driver to cut off body parts. "Poor Mrs. Lustig," she sighs, "I hope you don't mind leaving your body to science." "Try not to think about it," advises the driver, cutting off. "I guess you're right, Hans." concludes the detective / nurse, "What is done is done". What a sad end to a beloved star's career.
