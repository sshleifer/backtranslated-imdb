MY GOD! Having had such a promising start, Critters 2 reiterated the Karmic rule of what is happening around. Clearly, very few things were thought of when this film was made, and what Scott Grimes did with one ear! This should have been the last expedition in the Critters saga, but more rubbish was coming. This was the main reason why I didn't watch Critters 3, and why does every series of bad films have to have an episode in space? (Critters, Friday 13, Leprechaun in Space, Hellraiser, etc.)
