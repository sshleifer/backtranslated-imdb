The opening scene really made me watch the movie. However, no more than 5 minutes later, I was already digging my eyes. Not only could I not understand a word that was spoken, the acting could have been better than a group of mentally handicapped people. The only highlight of this film was that there was a white punk dwarf. However, I didn't understand the connection about how a white dwarf was the son of two African Americans. But I imagine that everything is possible. Also, why the hell was Robin in the movie? I'm not sure he added anything artistic. Overall, I highly recommend you jump off a cliff before hiring this movie.
