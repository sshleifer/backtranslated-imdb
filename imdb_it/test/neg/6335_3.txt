Yet another film about an inveterate adult who meets an adorable cunning boy (Cop e 1/2, Gloria, etc.). And again, it's not fun or interesting for anyone to watch - children or adults. I'm sure some people might find this movie fun, but I have no idea why. Once again, I feel sorry for the poor children who were forced to work in this film, so that everyone else and their parents could earn some money for the price of a cheese cheese movie.
