When I first saw this movie in the 1980s, I loved it. I was totally fascinated by music, by dancing ... by everything. However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the plot was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a lot of crap - and how awful the dance was. I mean, in a realistic world, she would never have approached that ballet repertoire ... The whole thing was pretty pathetic. Even the character's developments lacked depth. I think this was very much a product of the 80s: the film doesn't hold up today!
