How many movie disasters there can be before we get tired of them. Come on, we can see them on the Discovery channel all day. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment that the first part of this film is just a soap opera. The grandson of the Great Predictor makes a prediction and everyone starts complaining about how he is ruining the family name. The bad mother-in-law convinces his wife to throw him in the arms of her mistress, whom she wishes to meet. Can you believe it? The wife wants to approve the new wife! At the same time the lady has someone in love with her who does not have a wife, but she sends him to pack. <br /> <br /> Now that the soap opera is over, the earthquake appears. /> <br /> The special effects are really good, but the dubbing is bad. That's why I like subtitled movies. The actors are all very experienced and have won numerous awards, so you'll see some of Japan's best in an often repeated story. <br /> <br /> But the soap opera story returns with a kitch ending.
