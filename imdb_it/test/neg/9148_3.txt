The positives: it's shot quite well. It has some interesting peripheral characters. Likeable main character (even if weak). <br /> <br /> The bad: Plot / story. Editing. Jessica Alba wasted characters. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of mushy movies, but this movie is incredibly bad. I don't understand how anyone can deliver $ 12M to this Guy Jenkin. And before we go any further, I just want to say that I don't like Jessica Alba - I really wanted her to like me in this movie. However, Jessica Alba with her fake accent and modeling poses made me unhappy. It has absolutely no screen presence in this film, and it ruins every scene in which it is found. Needless to say, the love story does not present itself as credible (not even a little). <br /> <br /> All I saw in all was the actors flapping their wings, trying to get this thing off the ground with the little they had received - but unfortunately this whole movie is sinking. There is no emotional connection, no emotional conflict and nothing is achieved. It's a pretty empty film.
