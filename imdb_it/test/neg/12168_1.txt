Please - if you have not tried to sit in this garbage and are considering watching this movie / miniseries - do yourself a favor and find something else to do. Use dental floss, start learning to play the cello, beat your dog: all you choose will be the time you spend better than watching this garbage. This is not a bad movie from which you can make a few laughs - it just sucks in every way possible. Simply boring from start to finish. <br /> <br /> And for animal lovers out there who hear my comment above it's insensitive - if your dog could talk, he or she would pray for a heartbeat rather than suffer looking at this mess.
