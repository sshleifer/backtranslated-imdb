There are many reviews that describe this film as the worst ever made. For sure there are a lot of mistakes: mediocre acting, rather boring and clich√© script and sometimes paradoxical, and the B-movie sound of series and "special" effects. As noted, there are a lot of plot glosses, making _Cave Dwellers_ a fabric of fantasy films, especially in comparison with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, this film is not the worst film ever. Most, if not all, (including this review) of these reviews are written by MSTK3 fans. Therefore, many of these reviews are rather summarized from the MSTK3 episode of _Cave Dwellers_. <br /> <br /> In the episode, Joel, Tom Servo and Crow point out to mad scientists that this is the worst film ever sent to them. Of course, loyal fans have taken this quote and managed it. I found this film appealing, not in a way that finds _Forrest Gump_ appealing, but in an effort to get the cast into this movie. Furthermore, this film is laughable without its MSTK3 treatment. This is because _Cave Dwellers_ does not take itself seriously, and is not trying to import a sort of right theme into its viewers. For all the monster puppets, the medieval hang glider and the interruptions of continuity, this film no longer promotes what it is, a superficial representation of a rather superficial genre. <br /> <br /> Similarly, may I hate Miles O'Keeffe or Lisa Foster. Instead this hatred is for Coleman Francis, Tony Cardoza, Jennifer Lopez, Arch Hall, Jr. and so on. <br /> <br />
