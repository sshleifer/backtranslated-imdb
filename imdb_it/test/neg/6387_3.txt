A completely disconcerting western with flash-forward sequences set in a madhouse, South of Hell Mountain was one of the first films produced by Cannon Film's schlockmeisters. Co-directed by William Sachs, who would later provide some favorite fans as The Incredible Melting Man and Galaxina, the film tells the very boring story of a trio of gold robbers who stumbles upon a cabin occupied by two women that hide some secrets that are not worth discovering. The cast (most of whom have never made another film) actively engages, but is hindered by the script, which generally makes no sense. The kindergarten scenes are modified with little effect and are dotted with ridiculous sound effects and tape loops. Ultimately, he talks a lot and little else.
