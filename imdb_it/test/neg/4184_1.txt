Just above the box I'm writing in now, I was asked to choose a number between 1 and 10 and evaluate this film. Unfortunately there is no option for a number below zero and I have to put something. If I had my choice, I wouldn't put anything, no number, because there are no figures that express the futility of this film. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this movie even after reading all these horrible reviews, make sure there are no sharp or blunt objects in the area, this will help prevent you from killing yourself in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know how this film was released to the public, it should be locked up and guarded around the clock, somewhere in Fort Knox. I'm angry that this movie was available for me to watch. I feel deceived by humanity, I had no idea that humans could be so cruel. Stalin, Saddam and Hitler have nothing to do with this Cowell cowboy bag. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the film's cover. 1) There are no scarecrows, no one knows why there is a legitimate scarecrow on the front. 2) None of the characters on the back of the case is even in the smelly movie! 3) The tag says something about the "new moon, more victims", there are no victims of the brigand, no one died. We don't know if the dam policeman died, and I assume the killer didn't die because he seemed to have been hit in the head with an iron fist bat bat. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie, lost about 4 hours of my life. It is just four, it took me an hour to watch it (I quickly forwarded through the 4-minute zoom scenes that reveal nothing in the plot), I set the television for about an hour after it was over, contemplating my life and the direction he was following after seeing this shit, and then I started crying for the next two hours because I know someone out there will unfortunately see this movie and there is nothing I can do to stop it.
