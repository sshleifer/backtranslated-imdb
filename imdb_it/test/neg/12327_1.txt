Audrey, I know you really love the memory of Ted, your husband, but PLEASE, do it justice and tie him to his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for good reason. Please stop cashing out your stories, images, fantasies and characters. They are gutted by the powers of Hollywood and Broadway. Tomorrow's children will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books. <br /> <br /> It really is your property to do as you wish. I just want you to listen to the advice of others for a while. Save what remains of Dr. Seuss. Thank you.
