I imagine that if you like watching the dudes get "pumped" to scandalous dimensions, this is exactly your alley. In other words, it is an exercise in ego. I don't need to do that either. I imagine, it is of historical interest, I suppose, to see how these positive muscles and those negative to the brain go in this way (before / after / and among steroids) - but otherwise, this is not going to influence many boys and, as for women, well, I'm not one so I can't say ....
