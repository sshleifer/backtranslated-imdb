The real surprise of this effortless film is how a first-rate cast has been assembled for what is nothing but a moving story of inspiration. Presumably it was a proverbial snowball that rolled down a hill gathering rhythm, size and shape. It can be imagined that when Miranda Richardson was contacted by her agent, the conversation followed the following words: "Do you want to shoot a film in Dublin written by Neil Jordan? Michael Caine and Michael Gambon are already inside! This is a boring comedy that sees Michael Caine and Dylan Moran trying to bring out a well-planned commotion in which Moran must imitate a gangland boss from London (whose arrival is imminent) to collect a considerable sum of money from local boss Michael Gambon. The rest is simply a forgettable game that it is fortunately finished fairly quickly. Moran is slightly funny in places but on this test he is more suited to life on small screen in successful comedies like Black Books. Caine is undisputed in his role and gives a constant performance without being overloaded. just imagine what allowed him to sign up for this film - it may not even have been a summer in Dublin seen c he many scenes look decidedly autumnal in the background. Gambon actually steals the show, and anyone who has captured some of his performances in films like I Got News For You will know he's a wonderfully funny man. But overall the result is disappointing, and it seems that a lifetime ago Neil Jordan was making quality films like those of Mona Lisa.
