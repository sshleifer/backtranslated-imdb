It is a pity that a film with a film as good as this one has had no plot to be supported by the work of Sarah Cawley (cinematography) and Adam Lichtenstein (Film Editing) and, above all, it doesn't make sense what happens in Mexico City . The film tries to be a very realistic representation of life in the city, but is unable to do so. It's a shame, a lot of wasted movies. An American woman tries to find her brother who was kidnapped. The first story in the story is powerful and interesting, very realistic, but there seems to have been no effort to come up with a better narrative of the Calvary, especially when it comes to the question of the attitude of the staff of the US embassy in Mexico City , when it comes to a problem like this. Compare, for example, with Frantic (1988), which deals with a similar problem. Something similar can be said about the role of local authorities. Compare, for example, with Todo el Poder (1999). The film deserves to be seen if we want to have an idea of ​​the appearance of the city itself, paying little or no attention to the rather weak "plot" and to the many twists that require a rather wide suspension of disbelief. Who will believe that a Mexican Mexico City patrol will eventually capture the main characters on the Mexican-US border? And that this policeman will be able to use his radio from the border in Mexico City! Only the producers of this film. It is worth remembering that unlike Frida and other films about Mexico, at least in these Mexicans they speak Spanish.
