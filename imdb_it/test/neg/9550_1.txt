SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> A film riddled with clich√©s that somehow makes an anti-death declaration with dignity, even if it tries to do the opposite. Washington is a paralyzed forensic officer who has suffered and wanted to die in the last four years (apparently he wrote his huge sales book only a year ago though, so it's not all desperate). Prepare a assisted suicide with your doctor who will be back in a week. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, it helps in a serial killer case. He recruits the brave, I don't want to do it, but I'm so good at it, policeman Jolie, and they track down the impossible clue that jumps to highly unlikely conclusions in matters of moments. Hey, that old bolt means the killer has the millionaire's wife in a steam tunnel near the old Woolworth building. Shyeah, right. It's ridiculous. Yet he is not intelligent enough to understand that the doctor who will assist him is the murderer. <br /> <br /> When he comes to Washington to kill him (earlier than expected), he has a change of heart and fights unbelievably for his life. Cut to the bad guy who's about to shoot the good guy scene when BANG the gun goes off --- but the villain didn't fire! No woman comes out of the corner, she just shot him from behind.
