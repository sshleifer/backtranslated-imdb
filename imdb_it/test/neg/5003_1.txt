This film was terrible. It was really terrible. <br /> <br /> The most annoying was the way the process was conducted. The defense attorney is allowed to ramble back and forth when questioning a witness without the prosecution objecting. Attacks children brought to bear witness with cruel ferocity and repeatedly yells at them who are lying. These are not things that subject children who have been sexually abused. The process is silly and ruins the whole movie ... (Law & Order ruined me for the accuracy of the court).
