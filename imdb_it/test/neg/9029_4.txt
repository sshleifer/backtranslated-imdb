Presumably the "true story" of Juana de Castilla, the eldest daughter of the Catholic Queen Isabella (yes, the same one who funded the Columbus expedition), the film shows the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband, the archduke Philip of Austria, known as "The Handsome" (and interpreted quite unequivocally by the Italian canon Daniele Liotti, in his most buttery and muscular place here). This is a family history that dates back to the 15th century, at the beginning of the 16th century. intrigue, betrayal and body tearing. It affects destructive lust from beginning to end. But while La Reine Margot manages to make cruel sensuality and the merciless and ruthless intrigue, fun to watch, Juana La Loca does not hold back. It only ends up feeling like a soap opera with a high budget, acting below average, lazy or too sharp. Does Liotti seem decidedly bored and Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala in the lead role ?? although to be fair could he mature into a true talent ?? it seems only that he is trying too hard, going from a posterior and a fourth point of view with a two-dimensional horny appearance to a thoroughly hysterical adolescent hysterical. Some of the supporting casts are OK, with the exception of Manuela Arcuri, another Italian pin-up, voluptuous and beautiful but really no "actress" to talk about. In fact, I couldn't actually feel any concern about any character, nor, as far as I'm concerned, did I feel strongly negative about any of the alleged villains. What a waste of a substantial movie budget! This, unfortunately, is so rhetorical and deja-vu, which beckons to other films in the genre rather than to its material source - the story - for inspiration. It seems to me that such a fascinating and complex historical era deserved a far superior director to evoke it.
