The best thing I can say about this horror porn movie is: boobies boobies boobies! <br /> <br /> In addition to this, this film is produced by a Hindu / Indian guy with a background in porn movies or the like. <Br /> <br /> Plot: The Talk-Show host and girl are chased by a psychopath who gets angry about the fate of the homeless and pulls him out, you guessed it, beautiful ladies of the real estate agent! (films like these are the reason why the slasher movies of the 80s have a representative for misogyny) <br /> <br /> This movie is not really a slasher, but has the same kind of implausibility and stereotype: the cops dumb, the villain is an old white male, and women are prosperous girls. <br /> <br /> If you like horror porn, this is your movie, otherwise stay away. (Adrienne fans will see her sagging breasts for a second or two)
