Harlan Banks is the thief at the top of his game, but after a successful career, he decided to settle down with his woman and retire. However, he decides to do one last routine job in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive the car and it looks simple. Unfortunately someone warns the police and after a frantic car chase ends up in the slam just to escape and take revenge on those who betrayed him and took him there in the first place. A typical action festival follows. Steven Seagal plays himself (surprise!) Wearing a trench coat and showing off his beloved Colt 1911 along with his usual aikido nuisance. The Colt and aikido have always been with him, but the first one I remember of him with the trench is in "The Foreigner". It's not particularly impressive, but it adds a little more to Seagal's lethal sand arsenal. Or it covers those extra pounds he's doing. Look at it however you like. His main friend throughout the film is played by Treach (another new thing, an rapper in an action movie) and they both discover a small conspiracy of bad boys, on both sides of the law, and give each malefactor what is due to him. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the film is that it is painful, and I mean really painfully, not original. Seagal only follows a clockwork plot throughout the film and even that manages to get more and more boring as the movie progresses. Then he goes from boring to totally ridiculous in the final scene as people who seemed dead by killing each other suddenly, for no reason, start talking. A moan that induces in every sense of the word. The only positive thing is the decent opening: a car chase in Las Vegas complete with police cars and fun, but after that brief highlight you saw it all before. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: constant violence and obscenity
