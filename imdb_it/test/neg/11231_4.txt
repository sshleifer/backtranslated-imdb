A few years ago, I remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who spoke briefly about Rosalind Russell. This theorist wrote that the "strength" of the "strong women" played by Rozzie R. resided partly in the ability to defend their own man (even when it was not worth it). <br /> <br /> I thought of this essay after seeing "Crimes of Passion". <br /> <br /> Kathleen Turner exudes the same strength and style of Russell in her portrayal of the prostitute China Blue. It is the object of affection for two men: the crazy priest played by Anthony Perkins, and a bland whitebread boy whose marriage is slowly fading. And she won't let any of them have a piece of her until ... <br /> <br /> I don't care about the ending - but I'll say this is in the end the fantasy of Bland Whitebread Boy. No matter how hard Ken Russell looks, he can't hide the fact that this film is basically a melodrama from the 40s for the MTV generation. Except his retrogressive class and his gender politics, those old black and white movies seem revolutionary by comparison.
