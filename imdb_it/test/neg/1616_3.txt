I bought this movie from e-bay as part of a lot of about twenty horror films, all on a dollar a piece. While watching this, my first impression was that it was probably from the late 1980s. Later I started thinking: the Linkin Park posters hanging on the wall and everything else seemed to suggest that I was dealing with a more recent film. Realizing this, the blow became an unbearable torment. The last 3 minutes were the longest in the film's history - the film has just refused to finish. Is there a genre like "the horror for children"? In this case, this film is definitely. If there are parents who are perverse enough to want to present their offspring to horror, I suggest it would be perfect for children around 6-8 years old. The only thing I liked best was Greg Cipes, who was too good an actor for that kind of nostalgic retro bottom of a double-bill drive-in.
