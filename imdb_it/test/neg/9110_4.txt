A cut above from the usual straight to the video actor, Airborne has enough in the tank to keep going for the full 90 minutes, although you can't help but think about how low the former golden comedy of the years is 80 Steve Guttenburg leaned into such a cheap production (and even played a tough man!). The plot is simple, the villains have stolen a deadly virus and Guttenburg and the rest of his friends friends are sent to recover it, not bad in its kind but not in the same league (obviously) because the films are also compared on the cover as AIR FORCE ONE and WITH AIR. The cast is still good, with Sean Bean re-proposing his character as a brit-bad guy whom we saw in passing at such a box office as GOLDENEYE and PATRIOT GAMES.
