Ah, yet another Seagal movie. In no less than a few months they come to populate the video store shelves. Bad as Submerged? No. But it's not saying much. Like a perfume on a pig. <br /> <br /> Seagal is a professional thief who wants to resign, but seeks a last job only to be doubly crossed by his boss. He lands in Prison and makes friends with a Gangster who helps him get out and seek reimbursement. <br /> <It's nice to see that Seagal eventually doesn't play an agent, a cop or what he usually plays. In fact, in Las Vegas it seems to have an office in the United States. Then a territory of Eastern Europe as usual. Even here there is no thread. Doon Fauntleroy does a good job. <br /> <br /> However, most of the action and combat scenes with Stevie are clearly double. Down from other films, lack of realism and logic in even the smallest situation. Seagal and Treech make a moment (involuntary) of the team laugh. Sigh the rest. <br /> <br /> Several notable faces turn into slums ... sleepy Kevin Tighe is a long way from his emergency days. Nick Mancuso shows up in sleepwalking mode to take a check. No more rappers. Please? <br /> <br /> At this point the action scenes and textures are more predictable and recycled more generically than ever. Its a stale scene that Seagal needs to go out or hang it. It should have come out some time ago.
