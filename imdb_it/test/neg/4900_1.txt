To start with, I'm not a person who evaluates films I haven't seen, nor am I a person who evaluates films 1 when they don't deserve it. This movie was really so bad. The basic plot was extremely formidable and, although it wasn't exceptional, the plot deserved about a 5. The part that really bothered me was whatever it was about swimming in the movie. I have compiled a short list of things wrong about the swimming aspects of this film. <br /> <br /> 1. No character development. 2. No sense of time. 3. Completely inaccurate swimming scenes, which include: a. A team of six swimmers that goes to something called both "National" and "regional" without mentioning how they qualify. b. The same team that dealt with what they encountered was without having swum a real encounter at any point in the film. c. The rival program goes from being a high school to a club team up to a high school and then a club team again. d. In the scene where Ellis is interviewing for a job, the banners show high school status winnings and national level internships, yet the team is made up of 5 or 12 swimmers, depending on which of the 3 matches is taking place. is. A team of 5 boys and a girl win citizens / regions. f. Said girl wins a men's event of 100 butterflies. g. In this race, he said that the girl beats two guys from a team that the previous year was among the top 3 in the nation. h. The announcer changes a race from 200 breasts to 100 to 200 again in the span for about 45 seconds. I. In the final relay, the 4X100, which is swimming in a 50-meter course pool, a swimmer is seen making two twists. j. In this same relay, the teams stop the swimmers and descend from the blocks, provoking a speech of encouragement, which lasts about two and a half minutes, or about three times longer than the leg would do in a meeting of national caliber. K. The film begins in July or August, assuming that Ellis was applying before the school year began, and the pool had to be closed in 3 months, so assuming both things are true, the swimmers have passed from not being able to swim to win the national / regional, in less than two, since the pool had to be cleaned and the children didn't start practicing for a while. the. I'm sure there are two hundred more, I'm just trying to block them from my memory. 4. Throughout the film there is not a single mention of a swimmer's time. 5. If you plan on making a swimming film, it would be a good idea to hire extras that are good for swimming. 6. The scene where the child is kicked underwater is physically impossible. <br /> <br /> That said, all the swimming scenes were too slow, the swimmers had a horrible technique and the idea of ​​being able to qualify for a national gathering within three months of learning to swim is an insult to the swimmers around the world. <br /> <br /> OK, if you still don't believe me, let me tell you that this movie is one of the 5 worst films I've ever seen, and this comes from the guy who owns Lilies, Soul Plane, Manos: The Hands of Fate , Skullduggery, and any other piece of total shit that was put on film. Please do not go!
