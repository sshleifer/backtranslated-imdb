What a pity. What a terrible shame. The table was set, the candles were lit, the guests had arrived ... and then ... <br /> <br /> ... well, nothing really. Only reckless pretentious. It could have been great, OK maybe not great, but it could have been very good. All the elements were there, but at the end of the day the bottle was empty: NO LIGHTNING! How it happened is a mystery with everything available to the director ... <br /> <br /> ... the story was brave enough, although it certainly required a lot of work with possibly several finishing rewrites to fix the story and tighten up a lot of characters (the only thing that was coherent, constant and unnecessarily narrow was photography, but we'll get to that). But the direction was bad, the acting was just this: _a-CTin-G_ with a heavy side of cheese and a lot of ham, and then the cinematography ... <br /> <br /> ... well that was something to observe ! But only if you find yourself in the "Cinematography 101" of the film school like never using a professional film camera under any circumstances ". Obviously the student had fallen asleep during part of the introduction of the lesson and had only heard" ... use a camera professional ... "and then blissfully return to La Terra as the sentence ended. <br /> <br /> What can I say, amateur and pretentious to the last! I can only see this movie as a Chick Flick, because it should be sad, but then collapses and ends up being "sad" (as an excuse for a movie) ... so that even those "chicks" would not be deceived by this schlockenspiel! <br /> <br /> PS I felt bad for "Miss Diaz. She is much better at her job than what this movie allowed her to be, even though she was totally ABSOLUTELY mixed. In reality I feel sorry for everyone in this film except the director and (you guessed it) the director of photo! I say "first against the mur or for them when the revolution will come! "OK, not really, after all" it was just a film "but maybe a good" tar and pen and run out of town "could be more satisfying or at least a lot more fun !!! <br /> <br /> TTFN :-(
