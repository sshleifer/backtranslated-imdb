"Catchfire" or "Backtrack" as it is sometimes called, is not very good. I mean, it's bad. Jodie Foster had already won an Oscar at this point. Why did he agree to do it? I do not know. <br /> <br /> The hostage / kidnapper relationship is not credible, even if it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life. <br /> <br /> Worse, this film features a scene in which Hopper and Foster go boating under the Fremont Bridge (a bridge in Seattle), which means that traffic must stop so the bridge can open . I had to wait for that bridge to come down many times, almost all on the bus. It is not a pleasant wait. This film has caused unnecessary waiting bridges and the world is a worse place for this.
