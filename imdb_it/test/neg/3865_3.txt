This was a terrible film, almost a comic sketch of a film noir. The budget was low compared to a blockbuster, but still higher than many. But that's where they decided to cut costs which is totally strange. Some actors are less competent, while others seem to have been dragged off the road. One of them is the main actor, it's so bad that I made a face when he said something (he talks through ALL the movie). Then there are the strange choices of costumes At the beginning of the film all the characters wear the clothes of the 1930s. They drive a vintage car, but the background is a modern wind farm that is patently avant-garde. And the costumes and some settings continue to follow the noir theme of the 1930s. Then BAM drives a new escalade with 24-inch wheels .... WTF. Seems new when a guy has a night telescope on his rifle, you get a shot down at his sight. Focus on a guy with an mp5 and tactical gear. In an even stranger contrast the positions are brilliant, and they seem h cost much more than the rest of the entire film. The camera shots / frames are very good and show these settings brilliantly in the scenes. The director has a keen eye for a single good-looking shot, but he has no idea how to do much else. <br /> <br /> People who should be filmed for this film â–¼ <br /> The writer The director The casting agent The costume designer <br /> <br /> People who should be tortured for death by the monotony, monotonous nails on the blackboard. <br /> <br /> Anton Pardo - the lead actor, writer, producer If you've ever seen the movie Hostel, I'd like it to happen to this guy, but he doesn't escape.
