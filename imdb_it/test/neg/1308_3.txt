I don't normally write reviews, but for this film I had to. I'm shocked that the acting talent in this move ends up wasting ... the script was terrible ... the horrible editing ... and the plot very thin. You spend the first half of the movie wondering who is talking to who and what the hell they're doing. The last half of the film slows down slightly, but has no depth or feeling. The only thing that saves is the nice, but still limited cgi, and the location is London. I gave 3 stars for that, and the fact that the actors still tried to do a good job with the drivel they had received. If you want to lose a couple of hours of your life with a mediocre popcorn disaster movie, this is the movie for you. But I would recommend instead to do something else with your time, like watching the real archive video online! :) http://www.weatherpaparazzi.com/flooding.asp
