Monotonous characters with an almost non-existent development, performances by people who play as if they were simply reading the lines, and ridiculous special effects come together to make it a real stinker. The story begins with the eminently bland Russian commando and his fellow soldiers attacking an Al-Qaeda training base. The scene tells us that Al-Qaeda has recently come to look for a definitive weapon, and also serves to illustrate the only character trait of Russo, a tendency to avoid teamwork. With the help of a collection of empty lists and traveling stereotypes, including a Russian spy, Russo travels to Chechen territory to capture a mad scientist who works for terrorists. Along the way they encounter vast hordes of carnivorous bats that fly in broad daylight for some reason. From there, the film becomes nothing but a rousing quagmire of ridiculous actions, including a scene in which a swarm of bats cuts a soldier's arm!
