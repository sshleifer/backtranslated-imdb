After spending the previous six years writing and producing, Luc Besson returns to the chair of directors with Angel-A. I'm a big fan of Léon, and I really liked the perspective of a black and white French film of the same type. André is a liar and a drug addict, owed money to almost all moneylenders in Paris. Unable to repay his debts, and tired of being held over the edge of the Eiffel Tower, he decides to kill himself. He happens to do it at the same time as he is a mysterious woman, who decides to save. Determined to thank him, she starts helping him get his life settled. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a few laughs, which are good for everything. The images are quite beautiful and work well with the attractions of Paris. But it is so. This is all that the film has achieved. And these simple two facets can do nothing to hold back the torrent of a terrible film, which makes the film unleash. Even if I can't criticize the main character enormously (his inconsistencies are close though), the namesake is horrible. A terrible and bitterly annoying screen presence. The plot is ridiculously inconsistent and sometimes strangely silly, especially the ending; an ending that has completely bloodied the new redemption generated by the immediately preceding scenes. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene I've had the ignominy of observing, is stupid, indulgent, melodramatic and far too horrible to be "so bad it's fun". The film's general premise could, at least in theory, have potential, but it is brutally slaughtered by the relentless implementation of its ideas. The film was really a task to watch, and one that made me scream at the screen all the way. <br /> <br /> Massively and immeasurably imperfect, Angel-A is simply bad. Although his occasionally amusing dialogue manages to bring out jokes at rare intervals, in the end it is clear that this film is nothing but repugnant.
