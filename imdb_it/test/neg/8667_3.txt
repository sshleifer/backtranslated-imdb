For a teenager who has never read Austen, this adaptation might be fine. But only for them. This is a sprawling version of "Cliff Note" from Mansfield Park, and if you haven't seen another version or read the books part of it would be scratching your head. <br /> <br /> Why was it so difficult to make a good adaptation of this book? The 90s had so much freedom as to seem barely the same book - the mentality was completely modern and prose. <br /> <br /> Here we have Billie Piper who looks like a beautiful country girl. It has a fascinating personality that develops well - but it has flagrantly dead blond hair, with black eyebrows and - through most of the photo - dark brown roots. So much for the pristine cousin. He's incredibly distracted, and the rest of the cast is in greasy hair, kind of wrinkled clothing that shows a real lack of respect for the accuracy of the period. <br /> <br /> One thing is good here - Haley Atwell is the best Mary Crawford of all versions. It is a perfect, flirtatious note without being modern or suggestive, irreverent and completely devoid of any moral or ethical compass. Henry is actually nice enough here to be a slight temptation for our heroine. <br /> <br /> Jemma Redgrave takes one of the most interesting roles in history and manages to make it really boring until her last scene - even too sensitive. This is just a production that has really missed the mark, a real low for Austen fans. <br /> <br /> The only useful version is the one with an odd duck (perfect for the role) Sylvestra La Touzel (despite the very very gay Henry Crawford - it's just ridiculous).
