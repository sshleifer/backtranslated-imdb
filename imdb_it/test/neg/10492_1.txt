Imagine how it must have been for John Agar. One of the best men in Hollywood. Married to Shirley Temple for five years. He finds himself making films like this. I remember it in "Tarantula" where it wasn't bad at all. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend this movie. The monster is stupid, uninteresting and incompetent. The police are boring. Teenagers are boring. The plot is stupid. People run around. There are events that do nothing to advance the plot. There is dancing going on and on, and then there is no attack. There is an idiotic love triangle that nobody could care less about. It's not even campy or outrageous. It's worth nothing. Agar could also be a post. He has nothing to do.
