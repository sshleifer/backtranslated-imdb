It didn't look like a movie, and luckily it was short (less than 90 minutes), it seemed more like an advertisement of possibilities in computer graphics: most of the special effects are fantastic, to be sure. But this is certainly not a good movie or a good movie. Not saying that visualization is absolutely useless, since it is possible to see what the possibilities are in CGI or GCI, or why it is called. <br /> <br /> As I read somewhere, "You can't fix it in the cutting room", a bad story and non-direct actors, they can't be placed in the editing room or even with the most magnificent special effects! Things can be improved in the editing room if they have a real director and material to work from. <br /> <br /> However, they thought that this could be sold in the US is everyone's idea, since the US is the scammers. > <br /> And isn't it so typical of low-budget stories, they have to create an imaginative country south of Mexico ?? <br /> <br /> Well, well, I read it 2! Only because of the special effects, the rest is absolute garbage!
