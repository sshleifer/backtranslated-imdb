I could not report to this film. I'm surprised people are praising him for being so "realistic". How many people in your school were victims of incest? How many gay homosexual athletes were there? How many silent people you never noticed committed suicide? Hmmm. OK, you wouldn't even know if they were. But in reality these are explosive problems that many of us never have to deal with. Yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems that could have been explored. But hey, where's the "entertainment" in this? <br /> <br /> As for the girl who committed suicide - I found this to be an exploiter. Actually I think that MANY high school people at some point feel invisible, ignored and unwanted. But what does someone who violently commits suicide just another day to be ignored and unnoticed? The director decided that this girl would commit suicide to make the film more provocative. And the graphic nature of suicide to make it even more provocative. I didn't buy it as a real scenario. <br /> <br /> And the problems of the other students I don't completely refer to. Bullying is explored but it has been done until death, we all know it goes on and it is really a matter of resolution within that person. Homosexuality wardrobe? Pfft, another cliché is unrolled. This is really, too many clichés. I guessed the ending at the beginning. There was a predictable unpredictability if that made sense. You have all these characters with explosive problems, and one with apparently none. And I thought, what's the point of this character unless he's the unsuspecting suicide victim? And certainly enough .. <br /> <br /> One thing I will say, and it is the saving grace of the film, is that I do not glamourise suicide. Suicide is very graphic and heartbreaking to watch. It's a powerful scene (regardless of how forced it is) and one that repels suicide as an easy option. But the film is not really very imaginative and has used stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Not bad but certainly not innovative Or worthy of a standing ovation of 17 minutes in Cannes ???
