The film is not the best in the world ???? That was an understatement. Personally I didn't like this movie at all. Not for the plot, not for graphic violence and nudity. Nudity really didn't need to be in it, it didn't do anything for the story, except maybe that the girls were going through a difficult time, and being naked probably messed them up even more. But one of the things in the movie I hated ... was that it was so dark. You couldn't understand what was happening. I think if it wasn't so dark and you could see where they were, then it couldn't have been so bad. All you know is a basement somewhere. You don't see any house, no street, the killer in it, all you saw was half of his face for about 5 seconds. I want to see some things in a movie. It gets boring after 20 minutes of almost total darkness and all you see occasionally is a flashlight or a wall. Then you will hear the girl sobbing. There is nothing that I really liked about the movie, maybe the suspense in the first 10 minutes of the movie ... but not the suspense of how the film will end, but the suspense of ... will be I see anything in this movie, but some naked bodies and various flashing lights. But honestly people, this was a saw that meets the aspiring Blair Witch Project. Both films of the highest quality, and both with the correct lighting to understand what was happening. Forget this movie if you can see ... if you're blind ... you might want to rent it to hear the screams if you're in that kind of thing. But then again if you're blind, you're probably not reading this ... anyway ... BAD MOVIE !!!!
