Some movies will look because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow. <br /> <br /> Some will watch because you want to be exposed to adventure or shock outside of your experience; these will not give you food directly, but they will help you situate yourself in a world larger than what you would otherwise have. And after all, the difficult parts of life are in what you choose not to accept. <br /> <br /> And then there are films that do none of these things, which you will observe by obligation, or because you need a historical context. These are worthless experiences in terms of building a life. <br /> <br /> The problem is obviously that often you don't know which of the three will be a movie, entering. You might get some indication from people you trust, but because a life in the movie is so personal, you really won't know until you go out in the dark. <br /> <br /> For me, this was pretty useless. Yes, yes, I know for many Bunuel is the epitome of the sublime and rich. And you should know (if you don't) that among my greatest cinematographic experiences there are very strange films, really very strange. <br /> <br /> It is not that this is not cinematic, or symbolically profound, or apolitically / politically friendly because of the way I think. That's how it gets out there from the base. It is the deviation from the real deviance that annoys me. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is that this is successful alternative art, which means that it is successful commercial art. Which in turn means that it can be simply explained and the explanation is not only widely acceptable, but simply encoded in shorthand. Surely all this is true. <br /> <br /> When the term "surreal" is used, it is generally used incorrectly to refer to any cinematic image or world that differs from reality or seems strange. But when used correctly, which means according to the consensus theory, it always revolves around Bunuel, and in particular this film and what he really did with Dali. So, since they invented surreal cinema, they define and control the term. This alone irritates me, and I have an alternative definition of mine that does not come from their philosophy. <br /> <br /> It is because philosophy is completely contrary. It is not a philosophy at all, but a rejection of philosophy, an anti-order. His packaged anarchy, carefully selecting the things they use and the things they oppose without clearly distinguishing them. <br /> <br /> So ok: against linearity, against narrative, against history, against religion (easy), against intentional love. But for a linear linear narrative, to establish its own history (celebrated by countless film school professors, what else can they do?); for a sort of transcendent "accidental" love. <br /> <br /> He is his enemy. If today there was a Bunuel alive while selling his image, the first thing he would do is attack the church or the surreal. <br /> <br /> My normal readers know that in almost all aspects of cinema, I stick to Spanish and avoid French. But in the case of the surreal, I'd like you to consider the opposite: take your surrealism from Alfred Jarry, not from Bunuel. <br /> <br /> Ted's Evaluation - 2 of 3: It has some interesting elements.
