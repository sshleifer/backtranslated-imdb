This film is very disappointing for those who have read the book. As Rafael Sabatini wrote, this was a clear story of piracy in the Caribbean, and it would have made a big move. Moreover, it would have been very simple to do. All the action takes place on a ship and on a desert island. Unfortunately, the writers took the title from Sabatini and threw the rest of the book away. Even the name of the main character was changed, and his personality on the screen was completely different from that of the individual described in the novel. It is a sad loss for those who love a good marine history.
