In 1976 a mother named Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). One night a box is placed on the doorstep and the next morning they open the box to reveal a push-button device that must be opened with a key. In the late afternoon, a man with a terrible scar on his face arrives at their door and presents Norma with an offer. This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and will receive a million dollars in cash. If they don't press it, nothing will happen and the offer will pass to someone else. Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone, including their child, about this agreement. The incentive for the family to push the button is accentuated by their financial difficulties. Arthur, who is currently working for NASA, is not accepted in a new job he applies to and Norma, who is a teacher, learns that his faculty funds are being cut. <br /> <br /> The fun for this bizarre The sci-fi thriller, based on the short story "Button Button" by Richard Matheson, will be determined by how willing they are to take this thoughtful premise. The opening of the film is particularly problematic in taking root in a sense of realism with the family. Richard Kelly's previous film, Donnie Darko, has cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify his excursion into paranormal activities and parallel universes. Without the dreamlike state of that far superior film, The Box and the mere thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world, is completely unlikely. That Norma would also accept someone in her home that has almost the same scar as The Dark Knight's Two-Face and believes that this offer seems just as invented. <br /> <br /> If this seems unlikely so far, what follows is even more absurd, involving a conspiracy on someone who has been struck by lightning, the possibility of alien life or some other divine being that influences these situations . Scenes involving open doors in public libraries, random bleeds and carefree drones that haunt the Lewis family, become almost unintentionally comic in their absurdity. At some point, the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going. Kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to get our attention through many of the film tools. In a scene Norma teaches a lesson and then is questioned by a strange boy on her foot. He taunts her because she misses four of his feet. Later, during a rehearsal dinner for a wedding involving Norma and Arthur, this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be following them. Yet the possible justification for these oddities is contained in a very elaborate science fiction revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to digest. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early, many of the initially promised moral implications have diminished for much of the duration of the images. The ending, which will not be ruined here, will re-emerge these moral questions in the hope of echoing that of a Greek tragedy. While the similarities can be seen at this point, given the unlikelihood of much of the film and irregular performance, there are few reasons to worry. Cameron Diaz's southern accent may not be necessary, but Langella is surprisingly the most disappointing of the film, with a very implicit role, like the mysterious scarred man, who seems to hide a military base that would make Dr. Evil proud . In reality it is only the shadow of his impressive performance in Frost / Nixon. There is not much to do for many of the other actors in the film; in particular, both Norma and Arthur could not be considered characters, but mouthpieces for Kelly's pastiche di idee. Underdeveloped and short conversations, such as those in which Norma sympathizes with Arlington due to their deformities, and even when Norma and Arthur wonder if they really know each other if the button kills one of them, underline this. <br /> <br /> Since 2001 Richard Kelly has failed to make a film that matches the quality and imagination of Donnie Darko. Even if this film could be intriguing for a while, it is too absurd and implausible to be fully appreciated and it would certainly not be guaranteed more visions given the rather illogical revelations of the film. Science fiction fans might be able to appreciate it a little more and draw their own conclusions, but what Kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains cryptic. The Box is a film this year that should have been shelved.
