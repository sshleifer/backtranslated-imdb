For the most part, I considered this film unworthy of a comment, but the last 10 minutes prompted me to write one. You see, just then we learn (SPOILERS ... if they can be called that) that the Devil's emissary has no chance to properly prepare world domination from his master, because he is not skilled in martial arts! "Prosatanos" remained in a hole for centuries, waiting for "human greed" to free him, only to be defeated in a simple one-on-one match against the 54-year-old former karate champion Chuck Norris! Imagine what would have happened if he had hired Jackie Chan ... (* 1/2)
