Enchanted April was one of the last Harry Beaumont films - he directed only a few other films after this. He had made the films "Maisie" in the 30s and 40s. In the opening credits, he says "From Elizabeth's novel", and leaves the author's last name completely ... rather strange, but since it was von Armin, maybe they didn't want the German association at the time ... Sad to know it was a flop when he was released, with funny names like Frank Morgan (the Wizard) and Jessie Ralph, who played WC The Field's disapproving mother in "Bank Dick". Two girls in London (Ann Harding and Katharine Alexander) decide to rent a castle to accommodate two of their friends, but things don't go as planned. Reginald Owen plays the husband with more personality. Apart from some funny moments, it moves rather slowly. Ralph is the only bright spot here, like the kind of overbearing grip, and the image is rather fuzzy and fuzzy for much of the film. Italy's points of view are all obvious grounds. The only thing that saves is that the version of Turner Classic is only 66 minutes long. Too bad they didn't give Frank Morgan a wider role. This was redone in 1992 by the BBC as a British film.
