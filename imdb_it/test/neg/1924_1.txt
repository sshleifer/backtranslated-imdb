*** This comment may contain spoilers *** Warning: this contains spoilers I have seen some rather lame movies in my day. And this is simply reasonable since I see about 80 films a year. I should say that from those 80 movies I see at the theater, maybe 5 are really good, 15 or 20 are not great, 40 or 50 are ok and maybe 5 or 10 are absolutely terrible. Here on Earth he falls into a category of his own. This is one of the most predictable, vehement and despicable movies I've ever seen. It is full of improbable characters, maudlin situations on special after-school topics and enough nonsense to make THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS look like American BEAUTY. And I'm not unfair. This is a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a rich boy, a poor girl, a poor boy and a small town that produces fresh cookies every day for all the people of the city. Are you getting hot and fuzzy yet? Let me continue. One day, the rich snot arrives in town with his new graduation present that his father bought for him and insults the beautiful girl at the restaurant, almost collides with her boyfriend for a long time and then challenges him and destroys the little dinner he works at. So he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and her boyfriend have to fix the diner together. What he does is an opportunity to see Chris Klein without a shirt so we can understand why the girl at the restaurant would fall for him. He has abs! Oh and he's rich !!! And ... he is the greatest idiot with no respect for anyone. He's James Dean, he's a rebel who doesn't give a damn !! He's rude to everyone in the city, he doesn't want to associate with someone who is trying to be nice to him and behaves like a rich spoiled brat. But Leelee Sobieski still falls in love with him. There is no reason to explain why she does it, she does. Oh, sorry, it's true that I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet she does. Well, if this doesn't make you wet, then I don't know what it will do. <br /> <br /> Here On Earth also has some of the most predictable moments I've ever seen in the movie. There was a point where I left the theater to get popcorn and read graffiti on the bathroom wall and told my girlfriend exactly what would happen in the next ten minutes. On my return he just laughed and said I was right, even when I said there would be a dancing scene. Furthermore, the disease you suddenly contract is cancer. This is the most beautiful cancer patient I've ever seen. Have you ever seen a cancer patient die slowly? They lose weight, lose their hair, their gums start to rot. It is not a beautiful image. Sobieski emits a glow after contracting cancer, as if she were pregnant. What an insult to the people who have seen it die loves it slowly from this disease. And how does knee cancer contract to fall into the field? <br /> <br /> Now I realize I have seen too many films and this causes my cynicism to become rampant at times, but it's ridiculous. There was not one thing you liked about this movie or the character of Chris Klein. He is an idiot, he is hateful and he has never tried to make peace with anyone around him. Here on Earth is not just a bad movie, it is irresponsible. This received a 4.2 on the IMDb grading list, and is too high. This is an embarrassment to write on the screen and anyone who has given the green light to this being done should not only lose his job, but should promise never to set foot near a script again. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10, and this is generous. This film should be shown in film schools as not writing and directing a film. <br /> <br /> If you are bored and really need something to do and your choices are to clean a farm full of manure or watch this movie, choose to clean the cow manure. It will smell better and you will feel like you have done something good with your two hours.
