Julie Delpy starred in this horrible film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in 14th century France. The film attempts to shatter the romantic chivalrous image of the heroic medieval knight, showing a rather bleak image of the period, defined by psychological dysfunction and violence. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a child, François, who grew up in the shadow of the Hundred Years' War, told by his father to keep his mother safe and wait for his return. François acts when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed. François kills him in the name of defending his father's honor. Like a father like his son, François grows up, and leaves his family, even to go to the same war. This setting is somehow an explanation for the events to come, while on his way home, we have already noticed that there is something wrong with François. The war did not go well with him, he changed. <br /> <br /> The daughter, Béatrice de Cortemart (Delpy), awaits her beloved father, to return from captivity of the British. She is pure of heart and she was left to take care of the estate while her father was gone. In the absence of her father, Béatrice needs to face financial difficulties, which strengthens Béatrice's hope that her father can return to save her. But, on his return, he realizes that he has lost the will to enjoy life, and tortures and humiliates all that surrounds him, even his own daughter. From this point the film describes various ways in which François torments his family. Beginning with the humiliation of his own son, and ending with the rape of his daughter, Béatrice. <br /> <br /> The setting of the film in the Middle Ages should soften the blow, as the spectator may say, that these types of violent acts took place in difficult times. And indeed, many films on the subject of Incest, such as "The War Zone (1999)" by Tim Roth, which are contemporary, have been more shocking for this. <br /> <br /> Delpy appears in this film in several bold nude scenes. In fact it seems to be angelic and beautiful. <br /> <br /> It bothered me to see animal torture scenes. I believe, and this is not confirmed, that some birds have been killed for the making of this film, which really upsets me. The quality of a film falls when real violence is used against animals. I hope this film will be republished without those cruel scenes. Those scenes don't contribute much to the film's plot. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is too long. The script is problematic. We do not see François and Béatrice before the war, we do not really understand the answer because it has become so extreme. I would have shown this film, however, I have to mention some scenes that were worth watching this movie: <br /> <br /> * The scenes of a child who can kill in cold blood is really shocking. I saw it for the first time in "City of God (2002)". Here, François, kills his mother's lover, while his father is at war. Excellent and very graphic scene. * The scenes of Béatrice raped by her father until she finds out she is pregnant by him are really shocking and interesting. The scene after the rape, where Delpy burns his clothes and cleans himself. He asks his brother to kick her in the stomach with the hope of having a miscarriage. <br /> <br /> * The scenes of humiliation of the brother in which the father throws his son's head into the food - then humiliating him by making a grimace of war. Later, dressing her son in feminine clothes. <br /> <br /> The film won the César (French Oscar) for the best costume design, I agree, the costumes here really make the film look authentic for the period of time. The location of the film is Château de Puivert, a real 12th century castle and a historical monument, located in Aude, central-southern France. Beautiful castle and mountain views, it really helps you to settle in the period of this film. The film was also nominated for another 3 César awards, but they were all brought to the famous French film "Au revoir, les enfants" ("Goodbye, Children", 1998). <br /> <br /> --- Released as "Beatrice" in New York City, March 1987. Only to be screened in France in November 2007. She looked at it on YES3 on May 3, 2007, at 5:45 pm, at work .
