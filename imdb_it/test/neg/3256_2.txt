When a hard-working entrepreneur is rejected by a prestigious country club, he starts a battle between the members and eventually buys it from Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) and turns it into a theme park / golf course where everyone can sign up. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie at all, but sometimes it is still slightly fun. Almost all the comedy is cheap slapstick and bad jokes, except for Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase plays one of his biggest roles as Ty Webb for the second time and sounds great. He is not only the funniest character in the film, he is the only funny character in the film. Even Dan Akroyd fails to bring humor into this film that aspires to be a great sequel to a classic comedy, but falls into rubble with the others shown on Comedy Central. The film could have been better if Ty Webb (Chase) had a bigger role but instead was reduced to a minor character and the star became Jackie Mason (Who ??) They should have brought back the whole cast and made a sequel on the right way! This is a perfect example of what not to do when making a sequel to an already great movie. Overall, Caddyshack II is fun but a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
