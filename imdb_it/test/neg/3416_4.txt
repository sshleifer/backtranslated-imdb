The sublime love says the title. Another advertisement during the film's promotions spoke of inner vs external beauty. Well, in this case the beauty - whether you decide interior or exterior - is provided by a succinctly dressed (or dressed / undressed) woman Zeenat Aman that director Raj Kapoor called "a talented volcano" while the film was being shot. You certainly can't accuse him of sarcasm - after all he was promoting his film. <br /> <br /> The thin paper plot is about a woman with a disfigured face who has a very proportionate body, a great voice (thanks to Lata Mangeshkar) with which the hero Shashi Kapoor falls in love. He doesn't want his face just his voice. The acting is hopeless and even the 4th is because of the music with Lata Mangeshkar that gives good numbers. The rest is obviously a game of money. Avoid - save your money. Inner beauty against external beauty. !!! It is not necessary to be an Einstein to understand which director he was concentrating on
