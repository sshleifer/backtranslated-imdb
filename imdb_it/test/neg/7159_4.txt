This glorious documentary on the discovery channel, partly a biblical study, a part of the treasure hunt, all misguided, could have been quite successful in its television origins, but it fell like a movie. From the first glance of its flashy cover, one can throw doubts on the integrity of this serious argument, shown on the front case which relegates the search for the tomb of Jesus to a generic action font that looks more like a national treasure or Tomb Raider then any informed debate and examination of the historic burial site should. This is the sneaky way in which the whole story revolves. <br /> <br /> The most curious son of the then worthy researcher, the explorations of Simcha Jacobovici prove to be self-indulgent while his research turns out to be manipulative. For all the fascinating revelations that this director tries to convey to his viewers through alleged evidence, a wave of repetitive statements that repeat the same research and discoveries repeatedly proves that Jesus' lost tomb has very little information to support swollen claims, even if entrances. What amounts to is a very frustrating attempt to beat the audience on the head with the same little concrete evidence to support the authenticity of this tomb, which ironically removes it. While tirelessly linking together many of these mini-coffins found to support the theory of Jesus of Nazareth, this research abandons an all-round approach to continually pursue the unique obsession of this fictional archaeologist. There may be some impressive factual data that helps shed light on many traditional Christian dogmatic beliefs, but essentially the shady nature of this project meant that it was simply considered a piece of exploitation, financed at a time when the Da Vinci Code was all anger. <br /> <br /> In the end, the art of the cover was poor. Despite my appreciation for the documentary form, The Lost Tomb of Jesus takes an always interesting topic and turns it into a search for geriatric hunting that is too long and unchanged, replacing any relevance and sacredness for the inexplicable motivations of this team. When these tomb raiders finished their explorations, reluctantly having to interrupt the search due to social demands, the spectators remained in the sense that the director insisted on forging this mystery, whether it was there to begin with or not. There are some really powerful moments in which the halls of history come to march through this documentary in unpretentious ways, but all the decodings, explorations and theories of the world still leave this piece of wrong vanity in an empty discomfort of apathetic response.
