When I saw this show for the first time I thought to myself "What is this !!!!!?" It is one of those shows in which there is a perfect false high school world with stupid problems that are considered "huge". Then there's Sadie. This complete maladjusted for her friends and her family well. She is completely obsessed with nature, not a bad thing, but she compares high school students with animals! how is that! they too made another clone of Lizzie Miguire (yes, because the world definitely needs another one of those!). She is also very perfect like most TV girls, which makes me sick! So please, this is a stupid show, it makes no sense to skip it unless you like Lizzie McGuire or other such shows.
