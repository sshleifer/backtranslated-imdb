The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells, from director David Michael Latt, is a slightly lower than average film that is not so bad considering the budget he had to work with - only $ 1 million. For this budget, the value of production was not bad: the best part is represented by visual effects (I was very impressed by the CGI considering the budget) and by the sound design. The less stellar parts of this film are the story that is VERY prolonged at best (but again I think this is due to the budget they had - they had to extend certain scenes to create the length of the 97-minute feature), acting (again it's because the actors didn't have stories to work with), very few exceptional shots and the music. However, once again, I can let the negative parts go mostly just because this film was made for a small budget and still has good production value. However, you should see it to see how a low-cost version of War of the Worlds can also be made with flaws. 4 out of 10.
