I love the first three films, they were fantastic! I once took part 5 on VHS 10 years ago and was disappointed. But maybe because I never saw the fourth, because they were shot one after the other. but having finally viewed a copy today, I have to say that it was not better than the number 5. My expectations were not high to begin with, but this is a cheap direct-to-video stuff, not even a horror movie, it is PG -13. The acting was not convincing, the plot was rather stupid without any excitement and there were not many effects. But the main problem is that there were no murders or gores (the annoying child who is killed in his car had to be the strong point, but come on ..) <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, both parts 4 and 5 were directed by director-sequel Jeff Burr who gave us the excellent stepfather II and Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. I liked Puppet Master: The Legacy, although it was nothing more than a tribute to the best scenes of all the movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, Puppet Master is very similar to the Hellraiser series: a great trilogy but forget the rest ..
