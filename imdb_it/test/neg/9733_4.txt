Basic summary: Ipswitch was a witch community and escaped the Salem witch hunt by forming an alliance of secrecy. The first males that descend from these families have supernatural powers and have to deal with the seductive and compelling nature of using those powers. <br /> <br /> Well, I usually give the films the benefit of the doubt and start with a 5, which goes from there: <br /> <br /> Production: -1 for very noticeable synchronized audio, +1 for well-made special effects, the darkling actually gave me chills, +0.5 for a nice color (I like opaque blue), -0.5 for the stupid soundtrack, +0.5 for the sequence opening - I'm a sucker for elegant compositing and flashy title design. <br /> <br /> Story / Script: +1 for decent main idea, -0.5 for ripoff / pastiche DBZ / Matrix / Street Fighter, -1 to not explain plot threads (spiders, darkling) very well, -1 for the boring, predictable ending, -1 for free exposure, both as words on the screen and the bland monologue <br /> <br /> Acting / Characterization: -0.5 for bad acting, even if it improves a little 'with the progress of the film, -1 for the character development k, especially among all the females <br /> <br /> Other: +1 for the free male and female nudity, which is fun to watch, and + 0.5 for sex scenes, which for this genre are usually done very badly and end up being boring rather than hot, +1 to hit its target audience, teenage science fiction / horror / thriller fans, though this film is not exclusively one of those genres. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This is not a "movie", this is a movie. There's really nothing to analyze, it's just good (relatively) clean fun. A lot of really attractive actors and actresses. Many guys fight in the style of DBZ and Street Fighter. If you like actors and actresses, supernatural special effects and / or funny plots, this movie is for you. If you prefer exquisite Oscar-winning cinematic masterpieces with tons of multi-layered weave and innovative visualization techniques, you probably won't like this movie. <br /> <br /> Using my distorted logic, this the film gets a 4/10.
