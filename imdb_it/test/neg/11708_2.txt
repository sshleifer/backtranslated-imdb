I realize that a vintage piece is expensive to make and that this type of shooting (close-up shots on the camera, camera on the move, wide-aperture, faded shots) allows you to make such films at a price. Like style, it has advantages and disadvantages like all the others, it allows you to make more vintage pieces. As every style has its detractors and supporters - there are probably also those who believe that this way of shooting has an artistic basis. <br /> <br /> If only some of the money saved could have been spent on the script for whatever style is used, a film needs good writing and good acting. <br /> <br /> The acting in this film is mostly very good. Writing less so. It is composed of a collection of bits taken from the book and much of what is relevant to the plot is left out by creating an untidy collection of scenes with little or no continuity. <br /> <br /> If you have read the book, do not look at it under any circumstances. If you haven't read the book, you're happy and you have nothing better to do, there's nothing wrong with looking at it, but be prepared to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> It could have been much better.
