The film is broadcast by television as I write. <br /> <br /> I simply forgot I had a horrible experience in the cinema. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​the film is flawed. The fact that intelligent Europeans and Americans stuck in the desert forget the whole concept of morality and civilization in a couple of days is ridiculous. The folly of the Lord of the Flies was longer. <br /> <br /> The details that annoy are many. One is the only African character similar to a god who mysteriously survives the horrible climate and has done so for centuries without losing his head and seems to have no supply problems. Ridiculous. The same applies to the attempted rescue of the tourist guide, an Indiana Jones look-alike, whose rescue attempt ends in tragedy and death 5 minutes walk from the hut. Then there is Lear's choice, imposed on the group by a joke similar to an artist's guru. It reminded me of my high school hippie teacher. <br /> <br /> The worst thing, however, is the choice of Lear's Levrings. Obviously it's an intellectual fart of the brain. It is never clear to me why it would have been a pastime. <br /> <br /> The positives are few and far between. It's a beautiful film, but it's never important. <br /> <br /> High school intellectualism. Strange for the taste of weird. It's a complete waste of time, unless you like beating useless art movies.
