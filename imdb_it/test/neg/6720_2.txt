Three words: what a bunch ..... Two words: don't bother yourself! One word: Sucked! There is no reason to watch this movie. Seagal groupies should also shy away from this movie. Martial arts, the typical Aikido, are horrible. Martial arts move well but cinematography is pathetic. The film actually goes in slow motion whenever Seagal gives its "killing move" to its victims. Worse, it shows the same move three times in quick succession from three slightly different angles. How stupid. Seagal's acting was simply stupid, but I still give this movie a "6" to act because of the supporting cast whose "bad" roles were actually quite funny. <br /> <br /> The plot is simply stupid. Seagal plays with a Federal Express agent with a license to kill. His character also has a dedicated work ethic which means that all his packages are delivered to the right people in time - at no additional cost - and nothing hinders them. They are not murderers, political leaders, explosions or even death. I expect a certain level of violence in a martial arts film, but there are several scenes in this film of random and horrific acts of violence that lend in no way to the progress of the film or its history. There is a reason why this movie went directly to the video and there are a lot of reasons to avoid it. No one should worry about this tripe. <br /> <br />
