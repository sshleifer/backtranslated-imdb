Hurray for the title Spelling mistakes! After reading the reviews and thinking, my girlfriend and I confirmed that this movie is a piece of junk. This movie lost her as one of those rare Tarantino fans. I wish it was done on nitrate film, and all the copies piled up neatly under a Tarantino fan who smoked chains. The literally useless violence, the holes in the plot, the Tarantino table - sans drama, and the absence of character development have made this montage very painful and glorified. <br /> <br /> What acting was there? And how much of this was just because I was too busy reading subtitles? I look at my part of fanatical souls, and congratulations for the attempt at authenticity, but it was exaggerated for a film in English. With obvious historical inadequacies, constant reading has killed the way of acting. <br /> <br /> Why pay for a storyteller who will have absolutely no connection with any of the characters, plot, themes, setting or anything involved in the film? When the film needs that kind of explanation out of reach, it is the prefiguration of the dirt that follows. <br /> <br /> Historical Research - while it was covered with interesting factiods, used costumes and props suitable for soldiers, this film extended the truth beyond imagination even for historical fiction. Congratulations on Mata Hari as a reference, even if using it as a prefiguration was a bit too much. Mata Hari was executed by a firing squad, not suffocated in an isolated room. This ruined the feeling that the reference may have had. <br /> <br /> Other reviews mention more than half a dozen tributes to other artists in the first 15 minutes. Considering the public, all these and other references have been completely lost on many who would have bothered to see this film, and all those who would have liked it. <br /> <br /> I am confused by his choices about when to start a scene, finish it and what should be included. In a movie promoted as an action movie, why did it take almost 20 minutes to set up any type of testosterone? <br /> <br /> What I believe is the message was trivial. The idea of ​​rats and how we act on a primitive nature against them, and "who is the mouse?" they were the best of clichés, but in the worst case they didn't realize. The mention of American camps for Japanese and German Americans would have added legitimacy to this question on the moral ground. Literally every character in the film who gets a role of speaker is involved in his own legend. Is this the world in which Tarantino lives? <br /> <br /> I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. I'm sorry I took the trouble to see it, even with well-intentioned hosts. There was a rich base of ideas to be developed, but none was realized.
