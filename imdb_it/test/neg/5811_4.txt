I fully agree with the previous review. There is no chemistry between Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr, and the focus of the film is on their relationship. Hedy Lamarr is not at her best, and Spencer Tracy seems to be naive, simple and overly hopeful - both in love and in life; an idealistic role that has had the best in "Boys Town". If you can overcome the ridiculous crowd scene near the train station ... whoa ... it's pretty crap and not worthy of any actor in the cast. It is not the best acting by anyone. Incredible and maladjusted. The story is empty and the varied and disinherited input is evident. Hedy Lamarr is her absolutely gorgeous herself, which is really the best part of the movie. Spencer Tracy cannot match the refinement of her beauty and her wardrobe, and the film is not credible at least for that reason.
