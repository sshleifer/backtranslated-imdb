Start off pretty well with the accident and the decision not to return to LA. But everything goes in place too quickly. There is a decent turn of the plot towards the end, but so many scenes that make no sense. Randy (played by Brian Austin Green) comes home angry and ready to confront people and takes the time to put up the club, when he parks his car in front of his house in the middle of nowhere? I don't want to ruin it, for anyone who decides to see it, but the last 45 minutes are ridiculous. Even the acting, which was not bad at the beginning, becomes bad towards the end. Don't worry if you don't want to see how bad it is.
