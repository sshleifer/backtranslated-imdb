I'm not inclined to scream and my expectations were low, but how did it seem like a good idea? Just because you have a camera, bad friends for actors and talented disappointments doesn't mean you should go out and make a movie. This should have been the cinematic equivalent of singing in the shower, ie he should never have seen the light of day. However, somehow this junk has found a distributor to help it escape the confines of a 3 x 4 foot cubicle. It goes from bad to worse. Speaking of low budgets, a torture scene consists of a guy throwing himself a cup of coffee while tied to a chair. Obviously this is very painful because the big child continues to scream in agony .... maybe he ordered decaf! The acting is worse than the wooden one (I could perhaps see a tree for 30 seconds before I get completely bored, if you can watch this garbage for so long you are a better man than me!) And the fighting scenes would be at home a playground yard kindergarten. Don't touch this film unless you like pain (in which case you should try pouring lukewarm coffee on you). I would like to say that it is so ugly that it is fine, but in reality it is simply horrible.
