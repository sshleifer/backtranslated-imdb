Yikes. <br /> <br /> I have seen quite a few bad films in my time, many of them in the company of Mike, Tom, Crow and others from MST3k. So it was also for this, and although I found the film itself rather amusing, it wouldn't have been as much fun without the comments of MST3k. <br /> <br /> The film is a great example of really ugly films that came out of Europe in the 1980s. Horrible music, horrible acting, horrible plot (what little there is), horrible dialogue and editing really, really, REALLY horrible. Cripes. <br /> <br /> This could be called a turkey if it were not for the fact that it is not unique in any way. It is practically the same type of film that almost all the Italian hacks of a director have produced. <br /> <br /> So, try to get the MST3k version. It's a pretty funny episode with Mike and Gang in pretty good shape.
