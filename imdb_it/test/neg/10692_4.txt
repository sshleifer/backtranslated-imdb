I was looking forward to watching the documentary self-immolation of the mind behind Boondock Saints, one of the most aggravating and useless films I've ever seen. But the creators of "Overnight" - friends (ex?) Of the genius in question - must also learn how to make a film. Several unpleasant remarks, screaming obscenities in the phone, and enjoying his alcohol really make Mr. Duffy look like a putz. But he doesn't understand why the boy has a contract, firstly, what is his creative process or vision - what does Boondock Saints talk about? How hard is it to meet Patrick Swayze? What are these strange institutional machinations in which our disgusting heroes are captured? Since the film doesn't try to answer these questions consistently, it doesn't end up having dippity-doo to say about Hollywood. So who cares?
