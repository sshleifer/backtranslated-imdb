OK. Well, I guess it's worth spending time on this * once * but I won't watch it anymore. There are many things about this movie that have irritated me. <br /> <br /> First, man ... I really hated characters. I had the same problem with Sid and Nancy. I find it difficult to rationalize by spending a lot of time following characters that I don't really care about and can't report. It's not that the actors or the writing were technically bad; is that the characters were written in such a way that I had only contempt for them, and while the film went on, I almost wanted to see the sky fall on them. And this brings me to the second problem, and a question that I think is at the center of this film: was it the intention to simply document this generation and these types of bohemians that were (I imagine) wandering around Europe in the 1960s? Was the intent to criticize and attack them? Or was this a kind of warning? My final assessment of the film (that is, to determine if there was something to be saved here) depends on this question. <br /> <br /> Regardless, these characters are really unlikely and, therefore, it's really hard to give a shit on the plot or what happens to them. If this was a kind of affirmation about this generation, then the film becomes a little more tolerable. It is clear that Schroeder is not a kind of geriatric square, so the way it proceeds here has more weight than, for example, the countless stupid AIP films set or concerning the counterculture of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> With a bare minimum, this film has two things to do - first, the soundtrack (obviously). I like how Cymbaline is used here and others have already mentioned it, as it takes the forefront in the film. I imagine that if you are a Pink Floyd fan and you want to see him for that reason, nothing you read here will probably prevent you from looking at him anyway (he wouldn't even stop me). The curiosity to listen to Pink Floyd in a movie could be enough to make you just cross. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is a beautiful view. Ibiza looks like a nice place to visit. Maybe I'm tired of watching Los Angeles, New York and Chicago in the movies, but European films that take the time to really show us Europe (the beautiful or the ugly - mostly beautiful here) are always welcome. <Br /> <br /> But I really don't see any particular genius here. No revolutionary camera works, not even a moral, a tone, a message, a sensitivity or a plot that has something new to say. Perhaps what was revolutionary was simply that it came from a boy like Schroeder - a critical film of a mentality that at least in part made his films marketable. In this sense it is an honest film; there is no glorification of the abject excesses of the 1960s here, which is perhaps something you might expect. In fact, the portrait of the characters in this film faithfully reflects the (somewhat distorted, in my opinion) modern cultural memory of that generation. Oh yeah, bunch of (yawn) nudity and sex here; nothing new if you watch this kind of movie from this time period. I imagine it was considered new or provocative or something like that at the moment. I don't find it offensive or titillating (I doubt you will too); rather it is limited to lengthening the execution time of an already boring film. In its own way, this particular use of sexuality in films of the time (especially European ones) has become a bit of a clich√©. But I imagine that in hindsight you can't blame them; They were only in that decade able to "get away with it" and I suppose (I imagine here) that the very presence of this kind of graphic sexuality was a political or social statement in itself (the fact that sexuality was a part of life that this generation would not be as strange as their parents were). <br /> <br /> Should you watch it? If you're a Pink Floyd fan, of course ... I guess it's worth watching. In any case, The Valley is a better film. I went to this film, I was expecting much of what I got. If you don't normally watch these types of artistic and avant-garde films and don't know what to expect, this is definitely annoying to die for. This is a normal and healthy reaction :) <br /> <br /> If you're not a Pink Floyd fan, I'm not sure why you'll spend your time here. I noticed that a guy who left a comment really liked this movie, so maybe I miss something. I don't need guys running in slow motion from fireballs, special effects, explosions or something like that to enjoy a movie. But I need some kind of handle - I need to find something I like about a movie, and generally I need to sympathize with some aspects of the characters' situation (except that some Roman movies will work, camera-work and etc). Here, there is really nothing to hold on to except for the magnificence of Pink Floyd. Which is * just enough * to make it tolerable. At a minimum, if you're a Pink Floyd fan to begin with, you'll like it a little with Cymbaline, I promise.
