What makes this movie so damn bad? Is the sub-par lame youthful humor? Could it be the horrible "trendy" sucking ass music? Perhaps the uninspired doesn't go into any story? Or maybe even the fact that Traci Lords does her worst acting ever and that adding insult to injury continues to dress for the entire length of this steaming sandwich. Regardless of why this movie sucks, the fact remains that it really does REALLY. I never wanted to see a movie with Dean Cameron instead of the one I was watching in my life, but "Ski School" is a masterpiece of comic genius with respect to this parody. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nikol Nesbitt, Buffy Tyler and Suzanne Stokes unleash their Tupperware tits <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand
