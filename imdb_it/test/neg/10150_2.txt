So one day I was in the video store looking for a movie. I came across this and rented it because it was a film I had never seen or even heard of. <br /> <br /> Now I like slasher movies in general, but this is simply abysmal, not even good for laughter. Besides being ultra ultra cheap and containing all the clich√©s of slasher movies and terrible acting it has the most incompetent and inept direction I've ever encountered. Now sometimes the above traits can be present in a movie and you can still have some fun, but not here. Painful example of home-made horror.
