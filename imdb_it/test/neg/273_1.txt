I saw "professional" reviews that stated that Julia Roberts interpreted herself as "smart and very funny". I do not think so. An actress who plays herself? And do it with his usual vertigo every time he plays comedy? Talk about Hollyweird narcissism to the fullest. Because he doesn't just sit there and leave, "Me, me, me. Look at me!" The director and writer should be shot to not think of anything better than this in what could have been a fascinating sequel. and from the way Steven, when the public starts paying more attention to the strange corners of the camera, then the story has a problem. Capra, Hitchcock, everyone used some creative cameras but they were talented enough not to lose the audience or simply perform with the camera. You seem to have forgotten a cardinal rule of making films in the name of "style". The chemistry of Pitt and Zeta Jones is pretty good, perhaps if they had made the film more focused on them and dispensed with the narcissism that might have worked. Once again, Zeta Jones shows how more talented and beautiful Roberts could dream of. Unfortunately, this film wastes talent and fails on many accounts. I want my money back.
