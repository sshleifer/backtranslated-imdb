This review contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> I was looking for DVDs of horror movies on Amazon when I came across Flight Of The Living Dead. I already knew from the name that it would be terribly cheeky and most likely a rip off of Snakes On A Plane, but sold brand new for 69p so I thought I didn't really have much to lose. <Br /> <br /> The music played on the opening titles did not fit at all, although I liked that the song itself a pop-rock song was not really suitable for appearing on the soundtrack of a horror zombie movie. It started surprisingly well, the opening scenes weren't so bad, part of the acting was a bit angry, but not as bad as I initially thought it would be. <br /> <br /> It's okay until Laura Cayouette (Rocket from Kill Bill: Vol. 2) enters the picture. You should play a scientist. If she is, she is not very bright. Fortunately it was polished quite quickly. <br /> <br /> Actually I laughed physically aloud when the camera filtered the passengers of the plane during some turbulence. There was a nun. Have you ever been on a plane with a nun !? I was surprised that he didn't hold a crucifix. <br /> <br /> Finally, after 35 minutes, we arrive at some zombie action and use the word "action" roughly. The special effects are rather below standard, but you can expect a movie with this budget. Being covered in blood and having yellow contact lenses doesn't make you look like a zombie, but it makes you look pretty funny. Also the use of slow motion does not work particularly well. I think this film is probably guilty of trying to add too much history. Trying to get the problem out as a variant of the "malaria virus" was not a particularly good move considering that malaria is not a virus. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film plays almost like any other zombie movie. Most characters are killed and eventually end up with a handful of people fighting to survive. Perhaps the worst part of Flight Of The Living Dead is the absolutely inconceivable ending. I know it's a film about people coming back to life and feasting on the living, but the ending was simply ridiculous. Rating: ★★
