I love this movie. Although I classified it as a "4", it's because the acting, the plot and the budget were all destined for the "B" universe even before this film was released. But it's fine! It's a fun movie that has a lot to offer! <br /> <br /> I remember what Leonard Maltin said on "Plan 9 From Outer Space": such a bad film that is fantastic! Lacking the UFO - alien plot, The Thing could not Die is based on the supernatural (divination, a buried head that seeks his body, hypnosis, etc.) to tell his story. The acting is written, the camera works in second class and the settings are limited, but boy! What film! This film is available in the bootleg market. If you find a copy, buy it!
