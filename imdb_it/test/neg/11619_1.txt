I can't believe this terrible movie was made by the same people who created Lepa Sela Lepo Gore. Watch this and skip this. The plot is confusing and the characters are mostly two-dimensional stereotypes. I suspect that the publisher went on vacation in the middle of the film because fast and confusing cuts begin to appear that only confuse things rather than clarify them. Even the ending makes no sense. <br /> <br /> This is mainly a propaganda film made so that the Serbs can feel sorry for themselves and defame America for the 1999 NATO attacks. They do this by perpetuating lies that the Serbs are our allies during the Second World War, claiming that the whole world is unfairly against them and completely ignoring everything that was said and done by Slobodan Milosevic, how to make war on three neighboring countries. They seem willing to make a political film, but they only show a few seconds of Milosevic on a TV screen without audio. A nationalist program has obviously replaced any artistic consideration that was not the case with Lepa Sela. Unfortunately, I recommended this film to a teacher when he played last week at the Seattle International Film Festival. He also mentioned the bad modification and the confusing plot, and I had to apologize for the bad advice. You have been warned
