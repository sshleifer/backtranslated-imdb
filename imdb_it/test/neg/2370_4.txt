This film comes from an ITV Long Running sitcom with the same name. The Sitcom lasted about half a decade and brought to our screens Rigsby, Phillip, Alan, Mrs Jones & Vienna. <br /> <br /> Then in 1980 The film version hit the cinemas. Now, unfortunately, Richard Beckinsale had died and was replaced by Solo when I laughed at the actor Chris Strauli. <br /> <br /> I heard that this gave the film a different feeling. I preferred if it wasn't shot, since Richard was a key character. It's like having the porridge movie without Godber or Mackay! <br /> <br /> The film certainly has some classic moments, but it seemed a bit De-Ja -Vu! Many parts have been seen before in the TV series. Now if you've seen the movie before rather than the series you would have had a different feeling than the series fan! <br /> <br /> Saying that Leonard is definitely in top form and does the movie, just like in TV series. The film has recently had a new life on DVD and is usually on Terrestrial for a quiet weekend. It's a good movie, but for Rigsby fans you might feel that you've seen it before. <br /> <br /> Saying that it is still worth buying / looking at <br /> <br /> 7.8 / 10
