This film gives a new meaning to the term "irregular", providing us with some intriguing characterizations compensated by a clumsy plot based on some well-positioned stings to offer the most thrills. <br /> <br /> the plot concerns a group of men who hide a secret that caused the curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female appearance that causes death. He could also seduce their children. <br /> <br /> It is quite a sight to have all the well-known veteran actors in a film together, but unfortunately they are not very convincing, especially the scene in which Melvyn Douglas turns off the deep end that begs others to listen to him. It is not surprising therefore that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible, especially the giggly Ricky. They offer the worst "gee-we-all-we-all-drunk" scene I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film has some saving thanks, namely the great phantom tricks of Dick Smith (even if misplaced are in this film), and the fascinating performance of Alice Krige as Alma / Eva. I have never read the novel from which this film was made, but I intend to do it after reading some of the other reviews on this page. It is not necessary to have read the book, however, to realize that this is only a shadow of the original story. There is a beautiful story here, but it seems lost somewhere, between an exhibition that shows men who have nightmares again and again and make unclear references to the secret they all share. <br /> <br /> As it stands, it seems that there has been about half an hour of footage removed from this print, particularly near the climax. After all ... how is it that Fred Astaire manages to mount a pond digging so fast? What does Gregory Bate and the child have with Eva? And while we're at it ... what the hell was she anyway? Why let it get out of the car and make the apparition disappear? If it were an appearance, how could he have sex with two men and ignore them? <br /> <br /> These and other questions will never be answered, at least not from this movie. Unless a restored movie is discovered somewhere, it will probably always remain a curiosity with some sweating makeup, bizarre sex scenes and nudity, and some interesting exhibits.
