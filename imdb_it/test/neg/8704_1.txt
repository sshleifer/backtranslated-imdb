I as a Christian am indignant after seeing only the first half of this photo. The film's website says they searched for the film before writing, but I think they forgot to consult THE BIBLE's latest source. I sat down with two different versions of the Bible and couldn't find half of what happened or was said in this picture. It was as if they had invented what was not in the Bible and changed what was in the Bible to what they thought modern viewers would like to see instead of the truth. Personally I'm too young to remember the ten commandments of the 1950s, but it can't be worse than that. I wrote to the net and I can only hope that they apologize publicly for this parody.
