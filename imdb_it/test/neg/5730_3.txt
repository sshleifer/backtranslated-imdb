Red Sonja is a step-by-step career in the wrong direction for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Having made a couple of sword and sorcery films (like Conan), he had moved into slightly more serious acting roles in films like The Terminator and Commando, just to make a mystifying return to the sword and sorcery genre for this debacle of 1985. It's hard to see why he took the trouble, as this is weaker than both Conan films in every conceivable department. Presumably, this would have been Conan's third film, but for one reason or another the emphasis has been shifted to the female lead, the redhead, leaving poor old Arnold to play an incredibly boring supporting role. Also save a thought for director Richard Fleischer who gave the classics of the world as 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, Fantastic Voyage, The Boston Strangler and 10 Rillington Place. In this - his penultimate film - Fleischer also took a step back in his gigantic career. <br /> <br /> The bad queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman) wants to rule the world, and needs a priceless and powerful talisman to do so. She and her brutal army attack a fortress populated by priestesses and steal the said talisman, slaughtering the impotent priestesses as they go. One of the dead priestesses has a sister named Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen), a fiery redheaded warrior who swears revenge on the evil Gedren after hearing about her sister's death. Sonja rides across the land in search of Gedren's lair. Along the way he collects fellow travelers in the form of a boy prince, Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr) and his bodyguard Falkon (Paul Smith). He also meets the muscular warrior Conan - sorry, I mean Kalidor (!) - who offers to join her in his quest. Initially, Sonja does not want the help of Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), preferring instead to show that she can face and defeat her enemies on her own, but in the end she warms up with him and accepts his assistance. <br /> <br /> Red Sonja is an incredibly poor film, especially when it is understood that it was created in 1985 when the sword and sorcery genre was nearing its end. It seems so simplistic and amateurish that one could easily mistake it for a first example of its kind. Performance is poor overall, ranging from Bergman's embarrassing bad OTT to Reyes' incredibly irritating brat for the Schwarzenegger's unenthusiastic wooden hero. Nielsen is slightly better as the heroine - presumably full of enthusiasm at the thought of being in his first leading role - but is very disappointed by the stupidity of Clive Exton and the script by George MacDonald Fraser. The film is full of crap, including a scene in which Schwarzenegger is seen in the foreground while he is hitting the bad guys, but in a long shot in the same sequence there is no body in sight. Technically he is also very inept, with sub-standard special effects and frighteningly mechanical monsters. There are some compensations, like the pleasant music of Ennio Morricone (Morricone spent most of the 1980s providing good music for terrible films, such as The Island, Treasure of the Four Crowns and Hundra). Another reward is the screening of Giuseppe Rotunno's locations - in fact, most of the time it is much more gratifying to look at the enchanting scenery than the actors in the foreground! There have been very few swords and magic films since Red Sonja, so somehow it could go down in history as the movie that destroyed its own genre.
