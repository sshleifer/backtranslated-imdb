Just listen to the Broadway cast album and the voices of Barbara Harris and John Cullum, who do wonders for the wonderful score of Lerner and Lane. Then, with that beautiful cast that he took from memory, he looks at the film, with Streisand as Streisand, and Yves Montand reading his lines with a French accent so heavy that a chainsaw can't cut it. The best part (for those who need something to look forward to) is what Montand does to the introductory part of the title song. Listen to how he sings / says: Can any of us have a hint or a clue, what magical feats of magic and voodoo can you do? (That part sums up the problem that comes from throwing "star names" into movie musicals instead of the appropriate talent for the various roles.) I can see Rex Harrison entering that scene and suggesting that Montand could learn to do justice to beauty of the English language. <br /> <br />
