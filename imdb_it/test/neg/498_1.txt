Critics love this movie. Personally, I found it meaningless and tasteless. This is the millionth time I fell into the trap of "adorable critics" and came out hoping that someone would throw boiling water on my balls because it was less painful than watching the movie. There are many scenes that are completely useless. A warning to animal lovers: don't watch this movie if you don't want to see the sheep killed and harassed. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good Asian movie, see Afrika. If you want to watch a film about escaped prisoners, see the Gene Wilder / Richard Pryor Stir Crazy classic. Avoid 9 souls like the plague.
