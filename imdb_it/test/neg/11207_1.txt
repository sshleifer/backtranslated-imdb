What crack are you smoking? This film, while gloriously funny, is horrible! <br /> <br /> The action scenes are so obviously false that it's a bit sad. The colonel's daughter is painfully irritating. The ninja training camp is so much fun that it's hardly worth mentioning. And when Joe put the bucket on his head and hit the other guy in the army, I practically pissed. I could go on ... <br /> <br /> Funny, maybe so. Well, no. Well done, certainly not. <br /> <br /> As a comment on America as an empire, it is actually quite good. Joe as a typical white conqueror is not all that surprising, especially in the context of mid-1980s American cinema.
