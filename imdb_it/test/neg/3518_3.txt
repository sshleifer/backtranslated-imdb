Hungary cannot make good films. Done. This is a great example of this. <br /> <br /> First of all the term "plot" does not exist in this film. He is seriously weak. Although many people argue with me about this. Sure, it's a taboo, but that's all. There are endless possibilities, which could have been really great, if you use them, but they almost blew everything. I think the whole movie is just an excuse to show pictures, which are the only decent things in this whole pile of terrible things. <br /> <br /> Acting is simply disgusting. There are not many lines, so you would think that the actors have great facial expressions or mimic abilities, but no. In fact, 86% of the time, they suck. And that's when they don't say anything. If they say even one word, you'll start to tilt your head, saying, "It's damn unrealistic." But again, this is partly the fault of writing. In most dialog boxes there are no emotions. <br /> <br /> Assembly is sometimes OK, but most of the time it is illogical and only worsens the entire image. He could have given an emotional boost, but it seems that the editing here is all about putting the cuts one after the other. <br /> <br /> Someone, please, explain it to me, because critics say this film is a masterpiece. Calling this "art" will not make it better. Sorry Mundruczo, but you failed. Convivici. Although you probably won't be interested in my opinion or that of other guys who download your "baby".
