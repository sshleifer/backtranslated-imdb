While everyone does a decent job in this film, I agree with the other comment: it's too loose and scattered, too much like an experiment without a script with very talented actors. As such, it is not enough to get your attention. That being said, there are some really fun moments, one involving Dylan McDermott and a flamboyant shooter that I think anyone who was so drunk would find it as fun as me; the other is a split second with an inflatable dinosaur. Crispin Glover does his usual despicable festoon and does it well, Harry Dean Stanton makes his usual crazy patriarch (Repo Man, anyone?) Etc. Good cast, not enough to continue. Only a few gems, seconds.
