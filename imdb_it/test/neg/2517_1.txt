Luchino Visconti, the artist with the sword. Courage should be the first word associated with his entire work. Movie. Theater. Music. Revolutions, artistic, cultural, personal. A legacy with powerful consequences and endless ramifications. He introduced neorealism through the work of an American writer James Cain in "Ossesione". He gave Anna Magnani the most extraordinary close-ups of his career. He gave us Alain Delon and Maria Callas. But the last word about his life and work is based on the talent of a certain Adam Low and on the voice of Helmut Berger. What a terrible fate. <br /> <br /> For those interested, there is a 61-minute documentary by director Carlo Lizzani (a man who really knew Visconti) entitled LUCHINO VISCONTI A PORTRAIT. It is available on DVDs distributed by Image Entertainment
