Definitely not worth spending money or time. It is the same plot trimmed by a boy and a girl who meet and fall in love. But this is with a western touch. But it fails miserably either by painting a love story or by giving it the Western touch. We never hear that the hero and the heroine are in love. There is no depth for any of their characters. Probably, with a better cast, some justice could have been brought to the characters. Finally, it is a film without fun, without acting, without a theme, without plot, without comedy, without action, without thrill, without romanticism (I associate romance with something more passionate). Surely it is not a film that you would like to go with your family. Overall, if you're looking for a movie with some content, this is definitely not an option. I will wait for the day when Bollywood movies are something I can expect to see and I can refer to my friends as a "watch" movie.
