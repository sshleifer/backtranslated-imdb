I saw all 3 now. I can't believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is. Not in comparison to others, but simply on merit or lack. <br /> <br /> I can't understand how the average rating of this film is over 6 out of 10. I gave the first 2 films to 8 out of 10. They were thought to be provocative and well made. I gave this film a rating of 1. If a number 0 or negative was available, I would have given that evaluation. What a total waste of time he was watching this movie. I thought after the first 30 minutes that I had to turn it off, but then I thought it was just a (very) slow beginning movie. I thought the same thing after 45 minutes, then 1 hour, etc. Then I realized that it would not improve. <br /> <br /> It is very boring to watch and without any quality of redemption. Don't trust my word, look at it yourself. Make sure you see the first two films before this. If you see this first, I can almost guarantee that you would never want to see the first two, but they are definitely much, much better than this "work". <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is when the role of credits in the end. This is when your penance on this earth is complete and you can give up 89 minutes in purgatory, for the suffering you endured by watching this "movie". If God is truly merciful, he will be more generous.
