This movie is terrible. If you're thinking of seeing this movie ... two words NOT. It's tasteless, the plot is really lame, and the jokes are even worse. Acting is really pathetic. I can't believe this movie was made. Instead, look at American Pie, Going Greek or Road Trip if you want a comedy for teenagers. It's about two girls heading to Malibu during their Spring Break. As usual, they didn't do much planning and called his uncle (I think his name was called Michelle) to crash into his Malibu villa. Uncle Bennie strictly forbids them to have any kind of party, and as you might imagine, they go ahead and do it. Please, I urge you, don't watch this movie.
