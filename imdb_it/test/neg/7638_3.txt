I'm sorry people, but these rave reviews on this prestigious site on this movie "Breath" are very strange, to say the least. It is picturesque madness, I ask and I have not found an answer. Of course, the film is beautifully filmed, in part it's almost a documentary. But then, the fact is that when it comes to women Grazia, she shows every sign of a profound illness and I wondered throughout the film what the hell she had. His behavior is absolutely worrying and the (shocked) citizens of the village are really right in wanting to send them to an appropriate institution to see what can be done about his condition. He needs care urgently! Her behavior is hell for all those around her, her husband, poor children (in particular) and fellow citizens. We are not falsely romantic for this! I hated this condoning portrait of a mentally ill person. WHY, for God's sake, shouldn't the husband want to have her healed or at least try to do it? Why the horror of going to Milan (a big city, sure, but many possibilities for people able to cure it)? Narrowness? Irresponsibility? Anyway, I was inspired by this site to rent the film on DVD and after seeing it I had to post this to make others make an opinion about it. Honestly, I understand why the film has never come as INDICATION to the Cannes selection ...
