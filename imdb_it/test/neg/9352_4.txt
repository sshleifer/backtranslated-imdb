Awesome Star Wars knock-off with a slightly more comical touch. Robert Urich is the leader of a group of ice pirates, who steals ice because water is the most precious substance in the universe now (as all the poor remain alive is a mystery). She connects with Mary Crosby (Bing's daughter, around 25 and an exceptional girl), a princess in search of her missing father. In the cast there are also Anjelica Huston, looking embarrassed in some hilarious sci-fi aspects and Ron Perlman (who I think was seven feet tall from the other roles!). And John Carradine, watching the days of death and the famous Hollywood Squares funeral (relative term) Bruce Vilanch. If you've ever wanted to see Bruce Vilanch beheaded, here's your movie. But, even in this case, this is also not worth seeing, as it does not silence him at all (I think he may have been a robot, but I nodded a couple of times).
