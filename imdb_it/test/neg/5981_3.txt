What a waste of a great cast. I thought I'd take a look at it because it looked like a nice stoner comedy with a lot of fairly well-known actors. What turned out was a useless collection of intricate and boring stories about different characters with minimal connections between them. Characters that start to look like honest people but end up with not a single nice or interesting feature between them. Calling it a comedy was also a trait ... the only thing that made me laugh was the song by Jack Black, which was basically Tenacious D. I waited for something big to happen but I ended up with nothing more than 97 minutes of my wasted life.
