Initially I tuned in to Paranormal State because I find (more or less) the kind of paranormal research like interesting TV, if nothing else. <br /> <br /> I really like the Ghost Hunters because over half of their investigations result in unmasking completely, and finding Most Haunted being hilarious with his use of medium and sloppy British women with Paris day eyes Hilton who faint from fear / demonic presences all turned into an enchanting night green. <br /> <br /> Paranormal State does not have this appeal. It appears to have been cobbled together by "conductors" that Ghost Hunters rejected. The episodes ranged from families of towing sweepers and single mothers with emo teenagers who looked around and became frightened, to a "conversation" with a 5-year-old child about the monster that lives in his room (the monster goes RAWRRR, there comes said). All these people call for a university club to solve their problems. The whole show is about Ryan and his companion, his huge ego. He leads his coed crew with doe eyes, except when a case is considered "too extreme" and orders them to stay at the HAHAHA hotel. Better to leave it to professionals, that is to itself. <br /> <br /> The unconscious comedy of this show is all in the way the participants are naive. Ryan turns his tales of being chased, followed, etc. From a demon he met for the first time when the Catholic Church recruited him to attend a case. Sorry, but the Catholic Church has people who can do it, they don't need the manager of Quiznos' day shift to collect his 2 cents. <br /> <br /> This show is horrible, shameful for A & E for bankrolling this stupidity, trying to follow in the footsteps of some much better paranormal themed shows. It's almost unintentionally funny, except that Ryan is so arrogant and lacking in charisma that watching the show long enough to mock him is not worth it.
