The scene that defines this film is when the fat man resigns, but the evil doctor only gives him another duty, he checks the dinosaurs. Remember that he no longer has this job and is therefore not paid for it at all. keep in mind that he is a damn dinosaur and the doctor he should trust is evil and doesn't like him. But it's still like, okay. He just defined the stupidity in this film. A Melissa Brasselle shows that anyone can seriously attack some breasts and be in the movies. I can ride a mountain bike between them, but hey apart from that the people of Paraguay are very nice. Eric Roberts gives his worst performance so far, there is no adjective to describe how bored he is everywhere.Corbin Bernsen saves what there is it's to be saved and you start cheering for him, but they must stick to the formula, of course. And I wonder how much your life sucks when you play like, one of the army guys in this? How low is your acting career? The special effects are so embarra Ssterente badly you expect a sign that says "Studio 3" to enter the frame. It is not even an honest pulp, it is all taken from "Carnosaur", which also sucked it all by itself. And then I wonder why only anyone is allowed to make a movie.
