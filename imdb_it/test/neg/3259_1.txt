After seeing Caddyshack 1, I felt that there was a sequel and I decided to look for it. The film seemed pretty ugly to me and I said to stay away, but stupid gave me up and I actually bought that damn thing! All the reviews and everything you heard about Caddyshack II are true. The film is simply consumed with ideas and the most sincere plot and lines I've ever heard, the gopher, the acting, the whole movie is really bad (Randy Quaid was fun though). <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie, as much as you can, it's all I can really say. I deeply regret having watched and bought the DVD, but I'm not sure which was the worst decision. Stay as far away as possible.
