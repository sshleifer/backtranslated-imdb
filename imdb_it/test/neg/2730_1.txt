I was subjected to this pile one Wednesday afternoon when my mother-in-law was watching him. I can't get past someone who is basically doing a remake of a lousy, big-budget Hollywood flop ("the CORE" with washed actors like Luke Perry). If the HIGH budget is flopped, what drives people to make the movie SAME 2 years later with NO budget would go anywhere? I was laughing for most of the movie because of how insanely similar it was (actually I'm shocked that it's not held in Legal rather than aired on TV), and how it was basically the CORE script just redone, which if you've seen "the Core", you know why doing it worse is fun, since the CORE was ALREADY ugly that it was fun. <br /> <br /> If you have fun laughing at us with REALLY bad movies, this will be your alley. The only thing I can say is that I would like Luke Perry to be able to have a career, because he's not a horrible actor ... he just puts up horrible roles. Crappy made for TV movies that run only for daytime television is practically a step closer to the end for him, if it weren't for 90210 he would have a career.
