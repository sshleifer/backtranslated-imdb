I was waiting for this movie for some time. On the first day of flying in Turkey, I looked at it. It was a real disappointment for me. I intended to watch a historical film, but the one on the screen was fictitious. First of all, the main character of the film Cengiz Han, the great conqueror was portrayed as a soft, calm, even a loser. You can't feel the power in the movie. Historically, the war machine he created was conquered even (even more) than the world in those years. To do this, Cengiz first unites the Asian tribes. However, in the film, this loser man is in a poor man alone scene, and in the second scene, he is commanding armies. The war scenes were incredibly weeks. In the final battle, the Mongol knight was using double swords on the sides and was cutting the enemy. :) As a result, my friends and I laugh at that scene. Mongolian army means hot air balloon rider. You can't see it in the movie. Another bad thing was the use of fantastic elements in the film. I don't want to get into the scenes where Cengiz was described as a prophet. We can say in the integrity of the film, it is acceptable. However, the scenes in which the old monk saw the future and went to look for Cengiz Khan's wife after Cengiz had given him a mission is really fun. When the monk died in the desert, Cengiz's wife felt dead and found the body on the continent. Are we talking about Asia ?? We laughed again. There are a lot more things to say but, I don't think this film has value to talk more.
