There can be no worse criticism for a film than the word BORING. <br /> <br /> Some "bad" movies are very funny, some "funny" movies are really bad, but being BORING means no one will always buy the DVD to watch over and over again. <br /> <br /> It seemed to be a film that used the Antarctic drama class, they were all too busy running to keep warm instead of acting. The main actor, he spoke is a near whisper, hoarse-style voice, damn, it seemed he would seduce someone, and he didn't care who. <br /> <br /> The film can't make money if it's boring, I hope this dies fast, never seen again, dead.
