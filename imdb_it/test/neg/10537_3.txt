This is, for several reasons, a very bad action film. First of all, Seagal is terribly out of shape. He looks old and fat, plays as if he were to fulfill a tedious obligation and his combat scenes require creative editing or simple replacement. Secondly, his opponent is a very weak villain. This is an intelligent and petty scapegoat and Chestnut does not offer. So what about the action? Well, the two sides are shooting each other at different points in the Alcatraz prison. They shoot savages and villains, because compared to the amount of ammunition required, the number of corpses is quite low. There is nothing to save this film. There is not a single good line and not a single good joke. The little psychological interlude with 49er One and Judge McPherson is ridiculous. So what's he got? Well, the usual Bell helicopters, silhouettes that move in blue light and in slow motion, doors full of bullets and 1000 Watt lights that shine through the holes, characters that jump into the air while shooting, lots of weapons coming from nowhere a long black coat containing a bold black and a thin wooden box containing 25 tons of gold. The pain continues until the end, a hopeless approach to lighten the credits. The Californian beachboy Don Michael Paul was writing and directing. At least this mountain of boredom comes from one simple mind.
