The Vindicator opens with the memorable scene of a monkey in a cage attacking a gash of a small toy robot as part of a scientific experiment. This random violence sold it to me and I'm happy to say that the rest of Vindicator provided a real cheesy party. <br /> <br /> The Vindicator is about a scientist (David McIlwraith) who almost killed an explosion in his laboratory whose torn remains are embedded in an experimental suit / armor. For some unfathomable reason he is equipped with a Rage Response Activator, a device wired into his brain that will turn him into murder if he comes into physical contact with any other person. They give some silly explanations of how a defensive mechanism is needed, but I can't see the logic in installing such a device unless you want a machine to kill cyborgs. It is particularly ridiculous when it is indicated that the dress that Carl wears is actually an experimental space suit. What could be the need for an astronaut to transform into the incredible carcass during a mission? He predictably pushes himself out of the lab and proceeds to fight against the shady scientists who put him in the suit, along with the ninja assassin Hunter played by Pam Grier (No, really). <br /> <br /> Vindicator himself looks pretty damn silly. He is basically a guy in a suit of mutilated gold foil. He also has a perpetually disoriented look in his eyes, which does not inspire fear or even compassion. I guess you can't blame him for that, most of the people watching the movie will have the same look on their faces. <br /> <br /> The acting is really bad, made up, "I'm not sure what the character's emotions or thoughts are this point so I take a punt and push out my dialogue in a casual tone as I try not to look the acting school of the camera.The actor who plays the funky black scientist also fights with the latter part. <br /> <br /> It is after this initial accidental death that the Vindicator chases the scientists. The whole activator of the anger response "touch me and I'll kill you" doesn't have such an important role as you might expect with Carl chasing his former colleges in a reasonably detached way. There was a scene where he killed some street punks rather brutally that pushed him around I know that it is a matter of rigor for the street gangs to randomly assault the protagonists of the films of the eighties, but surely one of them must have realized that it could be a bad idea to attack are the exuberant cyborg boy even though he resembles the retarded cousin of C3PO. As it is, they don't even seem surprised to see a mangled golden cyborg walking down the street as if it were an everyday occurrence. The only other time this anger response activator shows up in the film is when old Carl can't hug his wife. When Hunter tries to topple him against him by throwing him at him, so he will be forced to kill her, and casually notice that he reprogrammed himself (off-screen of course), so this doesn't happen. They could have left the whole Rage Response Activator thing out and left with a simple revenge story and it wouldn't have made a huge difference in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a funny sequence in the sewers like Grier and his cronies track down the Avenger. Because of his armored skin, they are all armed with weapons that shoot "vaporized acid". For some strange reason, when these weapons are fired, it is represented on the screen by red cartoon lines that crawl towards their Ghostbusters wing targets. The Avenger fights by tearing off a gas pipe from the wall and incinerating all of Grier's goons in a huge strip of fire that comes out. The resulting fireball is so huge and powerful that it comes out of the sewers from a man hole and detonates a couple of scientists. Strangely, Grier runs away throwing himself into the deep water of his thumbs despite being closer to the Avenger. This is one of several fake fiery explosions in the film, including the death of a funky black scientist when the avenger sends his van to a cliff. (This is after they captured The Vindicator by trapping him in a giant mass of jay, seriously). <br /> <br /> There is also a disturbing and long and out of place sequence in which Carl's treacherous overweight friend, who looks like a poor Ned Beatty, reveals his infatuation with Carl's wife and looks for to rape her. It goes on for about 5-10 minutes and is full of disturbing shots of the boy dripping onto his wife's face, who turns on her and tries to tear off her dress. It's icky to say the least, and it looks really out of touch with most of the rest of the movie which is a bit cartoonish and bigger than life in its violence. <br /> <br /> The ending of the film involves the Avenger who fights a lot of other guys in battle suits. For whatever reason, all these other guys are less excited than Carl, some of them were sent by his wife simply by spilling a protruding tube on their side. Fortunately for Carl the suit he wears is devoid of this crucial design flaw. The only truly memorable part towards the end is Grier's death. Doing something I've never seen done in a movie before a villain, in the midst of his confrontation with the Avenger, he decides he has no chance against him and in a rather materialistic way he blows his brains out with his gun .
