The creature? Yes, it is the film in which he plays. Hell would seem infinitely more frightening if the damned were forced to see it for all eternity. Six university students take refuge in a doomed hospital to save money and end up victims of an ancient monster that must claim five victims before it returns to the "dark world it comes from!" Besides having important logic and coherence problems (besides the fact that it seems to be incomplete), this disaster is terribly played, written, modified (by J.R. Bookwalter) and direct, and the effects of make-up are almost non-existent. It is also significantly shorter than stated (only 80 minutes), but I am not complaining. It's the worst movie I saw from the executive producer of the Charles Band movies Full Moon and the guy is BAD! <br /> <br /> Of note, I almost didn't worry about a review, but this was inexplicably good reviews here and I thought a different opinion was needed. Proceed with caution!
