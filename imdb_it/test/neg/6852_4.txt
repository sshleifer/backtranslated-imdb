This is a painfully slow story of the last days of 1999, when a strange disease broke out and ... I stopped worrying. This should be about two people living above or below each other in an apartment complex. There is a flaw and a plumber puts a hole in the man's floor, so you can see in the apartment under the woman. Also since there is a crisis going on a lot of dialogue is actually news ... <br /> <br /> Does it look promising? <br /> <br /> Not really. <br /> <br /> I became distracted and started doing other things that are deadly in a subtitled movie. Basically I started not looking, which made the events even more surreal when I searched. <br /> <br /> It might work for you, not me.
