More than a study of character and then of a film, COMMITTED is just another relationship that breaks with the finishes created specifically for a young and target audience. The direction seems very simple, with obvious dramatic irony and a classic case of the loser lost against the engaged clueless. COMMITTED is watchable at times and there is a small sensation of originality from Lisa Krueger. <br /> <br /> COMMITTED is completely aimless for the first twenty minutes. We know Joline but the film resumes when her husband disappears. Joline leaves to find him. <br /> <br /> Some parts are strange. Other times the film drags. The second part is more fun when we see Joline's spiritual antics take a turn for the more intense. The annoying guitar music is terrible, but perhaps a necessary evil like COMMITTED still offers very little. An average film hampered by some completely useless moments, the only resource of COMMITTED is Heather Graham and Patricia Velazquez.
