This is a very low budget film, set in a location in a valley protected from the effects of radiation. The cast, an old man and a daughter, a handsome visitor, a couple (a hard buy and a girl), a tramp, a donkey and a man struck by radiation interact during the subsequent effects of a nuclear explosion. Added to this is an entity that watches women take a bath. <br /> <br /> Everyone has firearms, some of them are killed, some are told they have children, others are killed and others drift and well this is the film. Harvey Cormann's first film shows a certain simplicity in the making of a film. To avoid expensive series, the actors pass through the tents to enter and leave the house (ie the study). The settings shot in the hills near Hollywood are the backdrop. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't say it's worth going out of your way to see, but it's interesting to see how films were made with human subjects in the 1950s.
