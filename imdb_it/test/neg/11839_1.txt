OK, let's do a straight thing, I love dinosaur movies, even bad ones. So with that in mind, let's continue. "Raptor" is a really terrible film, in reality it is not even a film in its own right, since it is composed of fragments of "Carnosaur", "Carnosaur 2" and "Primal Species - Carnosaur 3". There is some new footage with Eric Roberts as sheriff and his busty companion running around with a confused, frightened air or whatever you try to convey (badly) on the emotional scale but then how can they react to something that has been shot several years before? . The producers (yes, Roger Corman, I'm talking about you!) They also did everything they could to hire 2 people from "Carnosaur" to play parts of bits so that they can be reused as gruesome scenes of death! So this film is the cheapest of the cheapest. Watch the 3 original films, there are no Oscar winners but they have a worthy and entertaining value but avoid "Raptor". Oh, it also has the most useless sex scene that is performed for almost 10 minutes! Do you think they were trying to make up for the execution time?
