I saw this at Sundance, and I can't understand why he won the directorial award. He was painfully slow and literally colorless. It's the kind of film that is only appreciated by fans of the film fest who think that every movie should appeal to many people. <br /> <br /> The Sundance jury this year seems to have made a conscious effort to reward losing films, on a very low budget. It's all right, but this enthralling and enthralling chaos seems like a movie of origin. Mini-DV shot in a gray winter covered with snow results in a gray appearance for a gray film. <br /> <br /> Some motifs (snakes) are beaten to death despite the fact that they add nothing to the story and make no sense as symbols. <br /> <br /> Now, it wasn't bad at all. Vera Farmiga is phenomenal in her role as a mother with a drug problem. She will go to places and she deserves it. Even his co-star Hugh Dillon does a great job. Frankly, there are many good moments in this film, but they simply don't fit very well.
