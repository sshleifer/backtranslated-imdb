Liberals like Alec Baldwin fail to understand that they lost the 2000 and 2004 elections? The ridiculous. limping banners at WalMart, unorganized workers, George W. Bush and the stock market, not to mention the intentional GWB accent that Balwin's character uses in the film, makes him look silly and bitter on the screen. As the credits continue to spin, the berries continue to receive "Special Thanks" for Ken Lay and other CEOs of Enron, Tyco, WorldCom and IMClone. Let me lead you to something - if you put all your money into shares of a company, YOU ARE A IDIOT. We don't need this excuse for a movie to tell us. What a waste of talent from Jim Carrey - from the trailer I expected a completely different film - what I got was a 90-minute DNC announcement about how to scare people about not investing for their future, keeping them stupid and keeping them dependent on the government. No wonder Hollywood is in trouble and can no longer make a decent movie - maybe you guys could have an original idea and put it on the screen for once ... although I shouldn't be surprised since Jane Fonda was chosen for the original.
