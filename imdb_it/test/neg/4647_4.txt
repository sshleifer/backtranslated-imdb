The film opens with beautiful landscape shots of the northwestern countryside. Enclosures protruding from the wet earth, a freight train crossing hay fields in the distance, clouds of clouds, small roadside structures, a motel or a diner in the middle of nowhere. In addition to this, he plays a languid but mysterious arrangement for piano by Twin Peaks and is all adequately moody and atmospheric in an American Gothic style. Through this, however, the director Jon Jost continues to weave clumsy frames, blocks of letters, end credits with annoying swooshing sounds, colored frames that announce "BLUE", numbers that count towards the "12 steps to a conclusion" announced in the titles of head. It is evident in the first two minutes that, although Jost is more than capable of capturing landscapes and atmosphere, he does not care. He has neither the affection for the open expanses of the Pacific Northwest that Terrence Malick does in Badlands and neither does the time or inclination of Twin Peaks David Lynch to weave mystery and intrigue around a particular place. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is more Jon Jost's frustration with experimental tricks that serve their purpose. The use of the split screen is interesting, I particularly like the way we get the first image of Ricky Lee divided in two, one that tells childhood memories that count only for him, the other is swearing and banging the head against the wall, and over the course of the film prevails the second Ricky Lee, the macho hipster with shadows who is hopelessly self-involved and stupid. On the other hand, stop motion animation and the choice to reproduce most of the film in voice-over narration does not work. Sometimes because Jost writes well as he shoots the static shots of the small American center Nowheresville but the Beth Ann monologues, delivered in the most flat nasal imaginable, a voice that sounds like the program of a computer speech by Stephen Hawking crossed with a horse whining, so grateful to the ear that defeats the purpose of trying to pay attention. <br /> <br /> Each of the couples refers to us their past experiences, their little triumphs and follies and doubts and past relationships that went nowhere. They say very little to each other and what they say they say with empty faces. But hump like rabbits. This seems to be their only communication channel left open, perhaps the only one they can confidently trust. Jost clearly chooses his main characters in Frameup between the naive and the delirious, those exalted by an American dream become immature, but he does not place himself above them. He is not condescending or pleased with his interpretation. They may be misled but they are embellished with moments of humanity, as embarrassing as they may be. We are called to empathize and show affection rather than point and laugh. This is the most successful Frameup becomes; the characters in the film come to life even when their expressionless faces do not, even when Jost gets in their way with his rigged shots and intrusive video games. <br /> <br /> Then we return to rabid absurdities about the destructive effects of the money played on an inserted shot of a dollar bill, we get a strange psychedelic sequence in which Jost's camera slides under large leafy trees that soon become red beet as Beth Ann repeatedly repeats about the "redwoods" in the off-screen voice, we also have a sudden turn to the plot and the genre as the couple of Beth Ann and Ricky Lee, little losers of the city with nowhere to go and nothing for keep them in their endless lives, get to California and decide to steal a 7/11. The film does not rise towards an emotional crescendo in the aftermath of the botched 11/11 work like what one might expect from a 'couple on the run' road movie, which slowly stops until it stops and looks out of the window to actually seeing it has never happened in particular. Parts of the trip were hypnotic and the parts almost touching and fun, but everything else was mostly annoying.
