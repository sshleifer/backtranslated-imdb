The parallels between this film and "Captain Walrus" (an independent film shown at the Team Projection Film Festival in 1994) are so obvious that any praise for "Sally Marshall is not an alien" must be seen with the knowledge that it is riding on the success of another work. <br /> <br /> In Captain Walrus, two young boys (Geoff and Roger, played respectively by Dean Turner and Brett Allen) examine the bizarre behavior of their new neighbor Britney (played by Louise Farley). While the two boys look through their telescope, they observe the repeated visits of a uniformed man they call Captain Walrus (played by Peter Sargent). However, the emphasis in Captain Walrus is on the useless and power-hungry actions of neighboring Britney, and less on the friendship between the two boys. <br /> <br /> A critical success at the film festival, Captain Walrus' storyline was obviously appropriate and redesigned to give the Australian Film Community another notch on the belt regarding the children's product. Although Sally Marshall is not an alien it is a good film, and a credit to her producers, her inauthenticity leaves something to deserve.
