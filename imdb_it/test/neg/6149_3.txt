But then again, what is it? I got it in my local 99 cents store for, you guessed it, 99 cents (plus tax). I remember seeing him on video as a teenager and thought it was a good movie. Too bad the film and my memories do not coincide. Regardless, it's not too horrible to blow a couple of hours, and it's nice to see some vintage Bill Paxton and Mark Hamill. Blah .... Blah .... Blah .... Man, oh man, I CANNOT think of anything else to say about this movie ... (I'm simply filling the space to respect the ten-line rule ... .) Good glutton, this is pathetic, how bad is this film that the best I could invent about this film were five threatening lines of text? So, in any case, ten lines of text, eh? Hmmm, ten lines are hard to find when you can't remember the squat of a movie you just saw.
