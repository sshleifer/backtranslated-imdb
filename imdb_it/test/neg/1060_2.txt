My Limousine Caddy has been destroyed !!! Well, I had one just like that - I drove the hoi polloi and many of the Chosen Ones in Manhattan for a few years. <br /> <br /> It was a lot more fun than this movie I can tell you. Lordy, what a bomb, like in role-playing, explodes. I also drove many more stars in my white caddy than it appeared in this stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Robert Patrick is a very serious actor and has done a credible job with the nonsense he had to work with. Unfortunately, Rutger Hauer played his part as a red-nosed circus clown. If he couldn't take seriously why should his audience? The director was supposed to kick in the set during the first hour of shooting. <br /> <br /> The dialogue has been written for 10 years for the 8 years. Surprised, there wasn't much else to do on the sets. Oh well, I'm a movie fanatic - ergo - you have to take the bad guy to get to the good.
