I was excited about the fresh synopsis (intended for wordplay) of this movie and I can't wait to see it. The first shots introduce some of the characters and the main place where the stories take place; lots of gardening The movie looks fantastic. Colorful but simple. Magical but genuine. Unfortunately, it only takes a few minutes to figure out where the movie will go. We immediately discover that it will be a manipulative and mawkish tale that illustrates a group of exhausted people who are confronted with "very nice" refugees and who will have a happy ending in which tired people will realize the error of their ways and accept them as people. <br /> <br /> The characters, particularly the prejudiced ones, are very "comical" in nature. The plot focuses mainly on two refugee families. One of them is directed by a single mother played atrociously by Diveen Henry. I am saddened to say that any emotion that could be felt towards his battles was defused by what was a memorable recitation. <br /> <br /> The other story is much more interesting and focuses on a father and his two children. All are marked by their journey through this container in this country, where his wife and mother died, but it is the husband who suffers the most. Benedict Wong offers an amazing show here. At the beginning, his emotions are very subdued but, as the story develops, he subtly makes us aware of his character's inner struggles. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the film is extremely boring. There were so many possibilities with this movie. There are several characters to watch, many of which may have potential but none of them are realized. Even worse, despite the fact that this film is not very Hollywood, some of the main plot twists are solved cheaply in a Hollywood b-grade way. Example: <br /> <br /> Character Cute character B Character B refuses his progress No problem! We make the character C declare his love for character A, so we can all have a happy ending. Yawn. <br /> <br /> I really liked the theme of the Asian family. It was done well. Unfortunately, the whole business of housing development, the common aspect of it, the dynamics involving a large cast are all exploited. <br /> <br /> What you have left is a film that has a very low value.
