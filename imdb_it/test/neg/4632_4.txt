The history and experience of the last two decades have shown us that intellectuals who talk about sex talk about the helpless and unintelligent thing that anyone can do, but in 1986 it was not so obvious. Basically, the idea in this film is that these insatiable characters lead to find comfort, security and pleasure in sexual acts are actually the unhealthy motive that makes them so unbearable to themselves - that they hide from themselves with more sex. This drive is linked to the "decline of the American Empire", as expressed in a first interview within the film. <br /> <br /> So the idea is that relatively detestable people talk about sex, and that that conversation is supposed to reveal how detestable they are as people. Arcand at least continues to give him impetus and momentum by doing interesting things with the camera, like isolating most of the characters in single frames, revealing their extreme solitude and cutting quickly between them, showing how they are more in conflict with each other than they are agree. And to give credit to Arcand, this is practically what intellectual life is, a constant struggle with other intellectuals to stand out, even when everyone knows that standing out means being alone. <br /> <br /> But yes, the characters and the action is not absurd and the kind of pathetic. I think this film is much more of an aspect of its time than it is to last, which makes it a little dated. It is also the exact type of mental buffer in dialogues and references to people like Susan Sontag who make art films so unpopular around populist spectators of the show. In all, I'll take it anyway - it basically has its place in the exact type of people the characters are - it's just not really interesting or important for all those who aren't those characters. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
