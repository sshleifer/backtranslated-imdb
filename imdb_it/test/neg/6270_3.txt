Why does C Thomas Howell make these films? Cruise (Howell's co-star Oneell) is a huge success for WOTW and Howell follows with this lame effort. <br /> <br /> Where do I start here? Production Values ​​- I'll start with good things. The graphic aspect of some scenes in this film is not so bad to be honest. The fittings are in place and the direction is not bad. Script - Terrible. A series of clumsy scenes that could have been inserted in any order you like throughout the film. The amount of times the scene faded to black and re-emerged a second later in the same room was uncountable. A very poor plot (but so was the Cruise WOTW) takes the blame, but an abysmal script kills him. <br /> <br /> Special FX - Ok, I don't want to be too hard here as I imagine the budget was smaller than the Cruise lunch bill - but in the general context of the film the effects are badly done. Some shots are quite impressive, especially the blows of destruction of bridges, Washington, of line. But in general "alien" machines and the tentacles themselves are terrible. Even the quality of the camera is blurry in some shots and stops completely on others. <br /> <br /> Acting - I'm a Howell fan, but while he starred in these low-budget films - he succumbed to the "over-acting" bug a long time ago. Watch his performance in The Hitcher and compare it with this film. There is no comparison. Enhances his facial expressions, arms and legs that are agitated (where did he take that style of running ???) and for a final blow to the scene where he loses his family photo. Hysterical. But having said all this, he is still the best actor here on show. Busey is embarrassing to watch and Peter Green (Zed is really dead now baby) mutters incoherently through his one and only scene. I honestly couldn't understand a single word that said - I even tried to enable subtitles in that scene - but the DVD didn't have subtitles. This seems to be a real bargain to keep an eye on, just as Howell's son, the director's wife and the film's producer all joined the film. None of them is good. <br /> <br /> Management - not bad, but not good either. <br /> <br /> Score - Dismal. <br /> <br /> In general, a limping duck effort that will do nothing for Howell in his attempt to return to the big moment. He should take a look at Rourke and try to figure out how he got back to list A, but if he keeps doing things like that, he won't have a career soon enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
