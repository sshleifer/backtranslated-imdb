After searching for this Bruceploitation for months, and then buying it by mistake at a cheap price, it was disappointing. I heard about it on a DVD-R site, and it sounded crazy. <br /> <br /> But no, what I got was a bad martial arts movie. The kung fu-ing wasn't bad, but the rest of the film was pretty horrible, and it made the movie look really, really long, much longer than the 85 minute run time. <br /> <br /> note, the monkey was fun for a couple of seconds (especially when I think they took the only close-up of his face from another movie), and the half-black guy is It was funny because of the line he said, which meant that all black people look like simple idiots. <br /> <br /> But it was not enough, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> 4/10
