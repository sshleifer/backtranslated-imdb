The idea of ​​nine stupid escaping prisoners and going on a trip seems good enough for a movie. Especially because it's made to be fun and I guess it warms the heart in some strange way. The problem is that the film was very rarely funny and often seemed simply useless and unnecessarily indecent. It was as if jokes or interesting scenes were placed over and over again, but no one bothered to finish any of them - there was no gain. Furthermore, the film was just brainless and thieves were spinning all over Japan even though they left so many victims of crime alive that it is impossible to believe that they would not be caught almost immediately - especially since they continued to use the same stolen camper for days and days. And as unpleasant as it is, I didn't need to see scenes after scene of boys peeing along the side of the street. Furthermore, believe it or not, there is a scene in which four of the boys are raping the sheep! <br /> <br /> All in all, I really hated this movie. And it's a pity, because I almost always love Japanese films - just not badly made and uninteresting like this.
