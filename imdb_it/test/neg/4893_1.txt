This film was ridiculous from the start. Let me save you all the time watching this movie. A woman who sells corn liquor to the locals takes her cousin or grandson and he convinces her to open a downstairs bar from her home. He does it and she and her cousin approach. There is a scene after where she is closing her lips with him. Later, the woman discovers that an old boyfriend is returning from prison and holding her between them, leading to a fight forward and backward in the bar. The woman's cousin / nephew is in love with man. The ending was terrible, the story was terrible and if I could make up for lost time in this film, I'd appreciate it. A definitive leap.
