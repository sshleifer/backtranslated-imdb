First of all, I just saw a SHOWTIME movie called Survival Island. He says it was a 2006 movie with Billy Zane and since I like it and couldn't sleep I thought I'd take a look. It sounds interesting. I looked at it, and decided to look at IMDb which was this new face, Juan Pablo Di Pace and OMG. I couldn't believe it, this movie was renamed TRE and it will be a new movie ?? It is playing again in 1 hour and 30 minutes on the Showtime Channel and this date is May 28 and EDT or Florida time. You can check the listings of Showtime by title and see them. I will not go into details so that I can see the film, but at some point there is a woman in a white bikini who goes into the water taking off everything, you see her naked body ... when she escapes from the water you see her funds on . Funny, there are also many other problems. I can't believe by chance I decided to look for this movie ... Go figure! I wonder if the people who renamed it sold it in some movie studio to get it out but it's already playing on Showtime, ha ha. Good laugh. I give 1-1 / 2 stars. C ,, D + film.
