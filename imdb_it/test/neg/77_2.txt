OK, so my summary line is a cheap trick. But the film is full of them and is absurdly praised, so ... <br /> <br /> I took this on TV (not cut, since the TV here shows all the movies, it's for you Americans who could say which I didn't like because I saw a cut TV version - luckily that's just an American thing), and I had no idea what it was. I went by, took the last few minutes of a show and the film started. In a minute, I was pleading that it was a comedy, given the start of a particularly ridiculous clich√© (yes, it's a bad movie in the film, I know, but what a way to try to keep the viewer interested! I also know why I didn't change channel). And yes, in fact the film turned out to be a comedy, even if not intentional. <br /> <br /> Marina Zudina is pretty enough, but hell, what a horrible sight! While the casting of a foreigner in the role is quite clever (he doesn't speak so bye hello language barrier), however, I'm sorry, Marina Piccola, playing dumb does not mean impersonating Harpo Marx. His acting is unintentionally fun in many moments, just looking at it while drawing an X in the air while being chased by the killer. He wants to kill you, it's not the time to play Zorro. We have a lot of things that "run upstairs" that go through tension, like in the worst shears, and things like pulling a rug and a bad guy pull each other. Ugh! Will Hollywood ever learn? Yet the best / worst pearl is having a boy burnt out in a bathtub and ... Well, I've never seen anyone burned out in a bathtub, but I'm sure you can't see the blue cartoon rays in life real, do? And how about trusting a petty-looking guy immediately because DICE: is he a policeman and doesn't ask him to show you his credentials? OK, so it turns out to be a real cop. But still, not asking for the badge doesn't make sense (as far as the plot is concerned, we could always think that the credentials could be false or it could be a crooked policeman. And what do you think of the big break? Don't tell me you didn't see it coming 200 miles away ... I'm sorry for poor old Alec Guinness and his useless repertoire cameo ... Now I think about this, what's the point in giving him a "Mystery Guest Star" credit ... in END titles? movie is over, there is no more mystery, and everyone and their brother have identified Guinness (even non-film fans will recognize "the old man of 'Star Wars'"). Even better this way, so we can pretend that don't be the great late actor. <br /> <br /> People continue to compare it to Hitchcock I suppose it must be John Hitchcock the milkman, since the late Sir Alfred would feel embarrassed not to see this, let alone do it And this gets a 6.8 / 10 ???? material in the background 100! But then, we are talking about an evaluation system that allows "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" to appear as the third best film ever made (check the Top 100), so ... <br /> <br /> 2/10.
