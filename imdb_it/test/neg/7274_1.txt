Sir, this sucked. There is a particular type of stroke of the 1960s sexual revolution that confuses sexual assault with sexual liberation. This film is an example. I lost track of how many times women are slapped, struck, whipped or spanked in the movie. And then there are all the times when women in the movie fantasize about being slapped, hit, whipped or spanked (you know they want it, right?). Sometimes it's apparently part of a safe fetish role-playing game. Other times it is not, but you will wait in vain to see the heroine's report to the authorities that has just been raped. Instead we hear that he was preached by his rapist about his inability to "let go". <br /> <br /> Every scene in this movie smells like misogyny (speaking like a straight, white man, married to his late 30s, not a lesbian major female teenager with a chip on his shoulder for fear of have the wrong idea. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only positive thing about this film is that it provides a strong memory of how bad things really were for women only a few decades ago.
