This could be the worst remake that Hollywood has ever produced, and this is saying something. I'll take it further and say that this film is so incredibly, deliriously negative that it MUST BE SEEN. I don't know if I'm even able to deal with all the wrong things - like the fact that the casting director seems to have pulled the names out of a hat, or that the creator of Richard Gere's character's mind was allowed to walk in the end (I'm sure people say "It's just fiction, who cares" would have no problem if he was a former Al-Qaeda agent who just wants to return to his home country) - so I'll dedicate my review to total hilarity, which is mainly the scene where Bruce Willis is testing his gun. <br /> <br /> In the original version, you will remember, the Jackal practices his killing on a pumpkin. Pumpkin explodes on impact, an effect known as "understatement". In this version, Willis creates a pumpkin target, but does not use a sniper rifle - he uses a giant remote-controlled cannon that costs tens of thousands of dollars and can only be stored in the back of a huge minivan (this man likes a challenge ). Reveal the cannon by pulling away a tarpaulin, then Jack Black, who is there to observe, jumps around and says "That ROCKS! This thing ROCKS!" about 18 times (I guess Willis didn't have to dismantle it first, he just lifted it, cloth and everything, from the back of the van, although it probably weighed several tons). The scene then turns into an Austin Powers movie while Willis misses the pumpkin and pulls out a tree, then Black crosses the mud with his falling pants, finally blowing off Black's entire arm. The pumpkin falls to the ground, unharmed. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend this film for a non-ironic reason, it is for the character of Diane Venora a tough Russian who becomes romantically tied to Gere despite having a facial disfigurement - a bold move for a Hollywood Feature . In the middle of the film I really liked this character, so it was a shame when she was killed. I would have liked to see a movie about her. Apart from this, this pile of shit is only useful as an objective intelligence test. 3/10.
