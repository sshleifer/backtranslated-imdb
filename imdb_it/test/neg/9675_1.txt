I was so excited to see the cast in this film that I was completely surprised how completely WRONG this movie was. I love John Voight but I have no idea what he owned to be part of this parody. Biblical precision was completely non-existent and I honestly could not bear to watch the film with my children. My children were amazed because they too know that Lot was not even thought of when Noah was building the ark. I think NBC should be ashamed of itself for allowing producers to make fun of the Word and cause even more confusion in a world that barely knows the truth as it is ... PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS FILM !!! I thought I'd burn my copy, but I have every intention of writing the producers and sending them the scripture references that MUST BE read before making this movie !!!
