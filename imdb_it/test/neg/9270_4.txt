This is a very strange film, with an unnamed cast and practically nothing of what is known on the web. He uses a familiar approach to those who have seen characters like Creepshow as he introduces a trilogy of so-called "horror" short films and mixes them into a narrative of connection between the people involved in the segments coming down from a bus. There is a narrator who talks about relationships, but his speech adds absolutely nothing to the mix and only adds to the confusion. As for the stories themselves, well ... I swear I have no idea why this film got an 18 certificate in the UK, which would have brought it in line with the likes of Nightmare On Elm Street and The Exorcist. Nothing here is even remotely frightening .. there is no blood, sex, nudity or even a dirty word to spice things up, this is the kind of thing you could put on TV for kids and nobody would blink. I can only think that if he got the score he really deserved (a PG) no serious horror fan would have been seen dead with it, so the distributor probably slammed the BBFC until they subsided. However, here are the 3 stories in brief: 1. A man becomes dangerously obsessed with his telekinetic car to the point of alienating his girlfriend. 2. A man who lives in a filthy apartment is understandably scared when a living organism evolved from his six-month tuna casserole. 3. A woman thinks she has found the perfect man through a computer dating service .. that is until she starts acting strangely .. And here you have it. Some of them are quite funny because of their extravagant premises (my favorite is number 2) but it feels like they should be a) terrifying and b) moral games, unfortunately failing miserably on both counts. To sum up, this film is an obscure curiosity ... for very good reasons.
