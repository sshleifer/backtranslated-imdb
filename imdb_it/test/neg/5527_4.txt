The problem with making a film like this, however, is that the final, the cream-de-la-cr√®me of the film, the battle between the two rigged ships, must be done well. Disappointingly, this scene in Ironclads is obviously done completely with small model ships in an uncultivated tank. There is no tension, few explanations about what exactly is happening and what the stand-off times are. <br /> <br /> The film takes many liberties with the surrounding history, as do all true stories when converted to a film, like the traitor of the Union and, in particular, that of Betty Stuart (Madsen), a beautiful Virginia. <br /> <br /> It refers to making a possibly decent film that involves an interesting story about the battleships of the preaching on the evils of slavery. It was out of place in this historical drama and was an economic ploy to involve women. It has only succeeded in diminishing the positive aspects of the film.
