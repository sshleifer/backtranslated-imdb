If this film had been directed by a man, he would have been imprisoned. While Adrian Lyne was chained with a lawyer in the editing room to supervise the gutting of a piece of classical literature to appease the censorship, and to avoid running into the Child Pornography Protection Act of 1996, a woman unloads Mat√© on us and everyone applaud . Did I miss a meeting? In addition to blatant pedophilia, this film is absolutely absurd. Has this woman never set foot on an active military base? Never met a soldier? Whose army is this? The uniforms must come from Uniforms-R-Us. Just throw some patches, who cares? Make sure everyone has a Big Red One. There is a slight internal joke that undoubtedly went over the author's head, but it could have been threaded by anyone who supplied the military vehicles. Certainly there were no military advisers. The US military does not manage slums. Temporary base camps in jungle war zones are cleaner than this. The US military does not put 14-year-old girls to work on military bases, nor does it allow them to use shooting ranges or training courses. There is a lot of drama to be extracted in the sexual coming of adolescents. This film has absolutely nothing to do with that.
