Pacino and Maconadump have really hit the mark with this stink. I swear, I'm a keen movie fan and fan. I've been a fan of most people in this abortion at one time or another. Until now. The shit of acting The shit of acting (Rene Ruso-Major League was good) The shit-plot The rubbish sub-adolescent The teenager tries to relate to junk sports bets <br /> <br /> I promised to watch Romy and the Michelle's High School meeting twice a day for the next seven days as punishment for not turning off this colostomy of a movie after 10 minutes. I was out of town for a seminar, and this pile of mung cost me $ 9.99 and 2 hours. I was deceived. This director should be in prison for fraud. <br /> <br /> Accompany me if you have any other review questions. I'm always right.
