this movie is so ugly. but it's so ugly that I was laughing out loud. for people who love movies, don't watch this. for people who like good and bad movies, I recommend this. the plot is shaky, the script is horrible, the acting is horrible to mediocre. the soundtrack of the whole film was trivial, but I loved it. the cold example sentences were a little more. ha ha. "if he can bleed, he can die". the fighting scenes broke me. it seemed to me that they spent more time on those parts than any other because the fighting scenes for the most part were pretty clean. I feel almost like this movie could have been good if it wasn't for the f / x .... no it would have been a crapshoot yet. the eye thing was trivial. and the way the girl was eating the boys' stomachs in the kitchen, they could do something where the shed really ate something or at least put more fake blood on her face. and the explosion of the lighthouse disappointed me. I thought they could get a real fire instead of things synthesized by the crappy computer. and the ending was so predictable that it surprised me when they actually did what I could do. so overall id saying that this is a classic for shoddy movies. is in my background 5.
