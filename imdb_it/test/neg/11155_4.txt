I really don't know why I'm writing this. I think a lot of people agree that this movie is bad. Well, let me say this: <br /> <br /> When I'm done watching some movies, I like them. Then over time, my opinion changes about the film. this happened with the end of days. I liked it the first time I saw it. I thought it was fun. But a few weeks later, my opinion changed. So to solve this problem, I looked at it again in a friend's house. Well, it's ugly. <br /> <br /> I am a logical person. If I see a logical hole in a film, I try to ignore it. If I see two, then I start to get irritated. More than two and I lost myself. End of days made me lose time after my second vision. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film is a bit depressing. Everything is sad. Everything from the acting of Arnold to the colors of the film. But dark-looking movies don't bother me, but something else did ... <br /> <br /> If Satan can regenerate his wounds, how can you kill him in his mortal form? If you shoot him, his skin will grow back. If you cut off his head, a new one should come out. So he asks: what is the point of trying to kill him too? I'll tell you why: because this is a stupid film that has a bad recycled. This is not the devil, my friends. This is a human being who remembers the James Bond villains who give the whole scheme to the hero. <br /> <br /> Like I said, it's worth a look, but don't see it twice, because it's crap.
