Like "The Blair Witch Project" before it, "Hatchet" has picked up its fair share of bottom-up advertising (like an avid reader of Fangoria Magazine, full-page advertisements are hard to miss); even after its mediocre theatrical race, the film is destined to survive only on the frame that surrounds it and, at a certain point, it will probably become a cult object. With a MySpace URL and a powerful (if disconcertingly subjective) promise to preserve the so-called "old American horror", "Hatchet" will attract a lot of onlookers with its DVD version (where that statement is emblazoned on the disc itself). Perhaps it was the large print of Is not It Cool News on advertisements that led me to approach the film with some trepidation (it seems that Harry Knowles and his henchmen will approve any movie for VIP passes and free food), but "Hatchet "makes me doubt the idea of ​​director-screenwriter Adam Green of" old school American horror ": based on the evidence here, it means the tasteless, late-80s rips of" Friday the 13th "and" Liberation. The characters are odious stereotypes (Black Chris Tucker type, Survivalist Chick, Topless Bimbos, Requisite Old Couple, Asian Tour Guide) whose interactions are marred by painful dialogues, tried to be hip and mostly obvious stabs to humor (not really as bad as "Cabin Fever", but still); the script has too much padding (the scene of the "bush rustling", for example), and "Hatchet" winds its way through any postmodern slasher of the last decade, with its distinctive feature only an expertly calculated hype. I'll give him some faint praise for cold blood - if you can wade through the stuffing between one killer and another, red wine is certainly a marvel, and the only real reason to see it.
