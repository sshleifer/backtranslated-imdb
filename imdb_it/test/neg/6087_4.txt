How much do I love this movie ?! Now I'm not a fan of bad movies, but I love a movie that is so bad that it's okay. This is one of those. Juan Pablo Di Pace has a nice ass, it looks fabulous on the screen, and surely he doesn't make a bad turn to his debut as an actor (I think). Billy Zane is appropriately bad and moody, although I always feel that there is something more in him. I heard it on Titanic, the expression on his face when La Winslet spit it out, for example, totally destroyed, upset and downcast ... fierce! Kelly Brook is a pretty face ... not seriously, I think so! It's worth taking this to see a very sexy guy, some big fillers from Brook, ugly growl from Billy, laugh at the dialogue, have fun in the landscape and the madness of the whole thing ... I'm ready to see him again now - yes, I bought it !!!
