Please don't waste your time and money with this stinker of a turkey. <br /> <br /> This is an exaggerated melodramatic love story set against the backdrop of New France (aka Quebec in the 18th century). Or is it a historical saga of New France with an epic novel thrown in? I don't know, and at this point I don't care anymore. <br /> <br /> There is a rich story to tell about intrepid French adventurers, thieves and other assorted characters who have colonized Canada and parts of the United States. This is not it. The characters are total clich√©s, the story is exaggerated, breathless and devoid of any charm, and in a short time all the spectator wants to do is get out of the theater, get his head checked, and take his anger out of the clamor . <br /> <br /> This film was the biggest disappointment of my year in terms of cinema, especially since, as a historian and a French Canadian or Canadian of French origin (or anything else) I am a) believer in the fact that the story of my people in this country has yet to be told as in the film b) interested in this topic c) a lover of cinema who thinks that cinema in these days could do wonders with this great and tragic story. <br /> <br /> As I said, don't waste your time with this frustrating claptrap fragment.
