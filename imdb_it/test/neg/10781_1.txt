Sometimes there is such a bad film that you keep looking in awe. This is one of those movies. Of course I can't help being biased. I'm from Chicago so I watched the scenes up close and I don't find Billy Crystal funny at all. And I can't stand all that English-style photography (Tony Scott, etc.) With the smoke machine that works overtime and all the soft, delicate lights. I suppose we should believe that Billy Crystal is really from Chicago because he wears a Cubs shirt. Oh and the plot. If you really think about it, these guys should be locked up, not the bad guys, since they're more dangerous. And of course there's the clich√© of the cops on the verge of retreating. But the funniest scene is the pinnacle where the good guys and the bad guys shot at others in the Thompson Center (a government building!) Obviously it's a fantastic building, but it's the equivalent of making a huge White House drug deal.
