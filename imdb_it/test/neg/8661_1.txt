As a fan of almost all the dramas of the period, and with this huge Jane Austen fan, I was horrified by this adaptation. As a fan of the 1999 version of Mansfield Park, I constantly compared the two and this was very short. He felt extremely hurried and very one-dimensional, so that he became very boring very quickly. There seemed to be no subtle relationship, in particular to that of Fanny and Edmund, and little atmosphere despite being in a splendid position. Although I had been looking forward to the Jane Austen season since Christmas, after an hour I left and went to bed. I will be interested in seeing the adaptations of Persuasion and Northanger Abbey, of which I do not have a much loved version, to see if they can still get bored in this way.
