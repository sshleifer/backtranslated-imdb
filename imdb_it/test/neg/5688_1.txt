The film begins with a 30-minute explanation of war, human cyborgs, battles, history, and then deposits 2 actors in a gravel pit. They run around this gravel / desert area for about an hour shooting each other. That's all. It must have cost around Â£ 10.00 to make, with change. Evita. <br /> <br /> Brands out of ten: Acting -9 Set 1 Costumes -9 Direction -50 Production 1 Intro title 4 <br /> <br /> I think improving this film would be: Losing the comment. (Let the observer decide what's going on). Remove some of the terrible CGIs. Add some techno rave music to it. They could simply save it .......
