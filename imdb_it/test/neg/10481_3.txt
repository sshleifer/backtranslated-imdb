The rivalry between brothers leads to the main plot. Navy Commander Chuck Prescott (Marshall Thompson) developed the Y12 aircraft to test the extent to which humans can ascend into the atmosphere. His brother, Lieutenant Dan Prescott (Bill Edwards), seems to be the best test driver around and was chosen to get on the Y12. Dan, of course, has a problem taking orders and is also a sure heck of a challenge. <br /> <br /> On Dan's second flight, he hits over the 300-mile comfort zone and his boat passes through a storm of meteorite dust. Back on earth, Dan becomes a monster that looks like 200 pounds of bad asphalt. It also has a demanding lust for blood, whether it is farm animals or other human beings. <br /> <br /> Autonomy time reduced by an hour and seventeen minutes; black & white with almost stoic acting ... typical of low budget science fiction. <br /> <br /> Completing the cast are Marla Landi, Robert Ayers and Carl Jaffe. Remarkable curiosity: about two months after the release of this film; the Russians have put the real first man in space.
