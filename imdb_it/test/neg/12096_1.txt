This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen over 300 movies in my life. The atrocious recitation, the only bright spot seems to be the evaluation of the anatomical feats of women castmembers. After watching this film, it is suggested that the observer does not operate on heavy machinery or that he must drive for a period of at least 24 hours. Even a bottle of Valium would be recommended so you don't feel so bad for the 100 minutes wasted in your life. The plot is nothing original, the harrowing dialogue and even the weapons seem partial. Do yourself a favor and go to your local Blockbuster and burn all the copies they have of this horrible movie.
