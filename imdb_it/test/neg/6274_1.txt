This film is so bad that it should burn the master. You can't ruin the plot because this movie doesn't have one. The graphics are less than false, they are horrendous. Then you have the wandering through the star gazer work-a-holic campaign that bounces between its own madness and the mad syllables of the crazed preacher. and when he finally arrives in Washington, they don't even have the decency to kill him; the monster (that you don't know at the moment) is already dying, but how ... who knows and of course has the last mysterious ending ... all the others on the planet are dead or dead but his family and a handful of stragglers survive. Imagine that! This will be the film that C Thomas Howell will go to his grave regretting ever having acted. It probably gives him nightmares.
