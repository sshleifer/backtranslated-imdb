I am one of those people who respect all the filmmakers they have achieved, every film I watch usually respects (even if I admit I select carefully) and I appreciate what it is. Not anymore. This is really one of the worst scripts I've seen produced as a movie ... so much that I felt compelled to warn others. The dialogue was truly incredible, the main protaganist concerned the last person I would be interested in learning more about. A scene was an old friend of the school "tells as if it were" made me laugh just because it was a pathetic attempt to reveal the subtext of a plot already completed. The management is at its best and at worst the film production is in numbers. Comparing this film with the atmospheric majesty of a film like Five Easy Pieces is a parody.
