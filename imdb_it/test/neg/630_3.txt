I couldn't wait to see this movie, having spent some (fantastic) weeks of college in Barcelona. The premise is right: a confused and disordered young person enters a world of equally confused and messy young individuals. But the weak of this director on symbolism, philosophy and social commentary are completely out of place, and leave us, the public, feeling confused and messy. Good boy. <br /> <br /> Maybe if this movie was presented as a European movie "American Pie", then I would be able to turn off my brain and go on for the ride. But immediately, the director sinks our deepest senses by introducing the symbolism of twisted highways and the dichotomy of the "inner self" against the "public self" (someone's "mother tongue" against one's "secondary language"). Furthermore, he dives boldly into the theme of racial / national stereotypes. An interesting departure, eh? <br /> <br /> WRONG. This is how far away. These interesting topics are just mentioned again except for the epilogue-like fake epilogue that seemed to be the way the director struggled to get back on the subject. It reminded me of a meandering speech that is not going anywhere, but the speaker ends up saying, "So, in conclusion, I hope you see how this refers to my original thinking!" <br /> <br /> Furthermore, as other reviewers have pointed out, the cynical stroke of stereotypes betrays itself. If the point is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes, then why did the director introduce an English brat who speaks English as a caricature of prejudices? Why did the director portray the American as a Neanderthal (literally slamming his chest and making monkey noises at one point) while Europeans tolerate him with a certain amount of supercoleness? Why is the English girl the one who sinks into uttering insults (calling the French "frogs" and slaughtering the French language) while all the others are above all this? The answer is that this is not a deep or well thought film. It is simply the response of Anglophobe to Anglophiles. But in reality it is not different from the prejudice that tries to ridicule! Now there is a funny irony to consider. <br /> <br /> OK, aside from philosophy, artistic skill and socio-political commentary, I was still very bored with this film. There is a very funny gag that involves fooling one of the girls' boyfriends, but other than that I was barely entertained. The only reason I looked at it until the end is that I'd like to brush up on my French and Spanish. (See, we American monolinguals can be stupid, but we try).
