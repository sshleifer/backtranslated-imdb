This film started off great; the first 30 minutes are very funny and smart with some interesting characters. This is the good news. The bad news is that the film becomes too repetitive and then becomes decidedly stupid. <br /> <br /> What we end up getting is a Santa with "magical" powers with a lot of New Age baloney thrown into the mix. It is simply ridiculous and hardly the kind of "Christmas movie" I would expect from Jim Varney's "Ernest". <br /> <br /> To be honest, he still had a fair amount of laughter and is free of bad words but not really a movie I could recommend
