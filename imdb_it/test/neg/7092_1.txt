The last time I checked, the Nazis didn't win World War II, not that you were warned. After all, the Third Reich was rather large in issuing orders and demanding cold and robotic obedience from the population, and this is more or less what we are fascinated with today. But the way orders are delivered has changed. Instead of being barked with a German accent through a megaphone, they are disguised as expert advice and float under your nose every time you turn on the TV or open a newspaper. There is a continuous humming in the background, a middle-class message of self- improvement, whispered in the wind. <br /> <br /> "You eat too much, eat the wrong things, drink, smoke, don't do enough exercise, you probably can't even * beep * correctly, you'll die if you don't change your ways, your health will suffer, not you will respect yourself, I look at you, you hurt me, I pity you, I hate you, we all hate you God hates you, you don't understand, it's so sad, what you're doing to yourself. It's so sadly sad. "This is the mantra. And it goes without saying that the people who act are regularly depicted as saints. Last year, the media fell to its knees to give Jamie Oliver a collective blowjob for his series of school dinners, where he fought for healthier food in school menus. Given the slap reaction, you would be forgiven for thinking you had personally saved 5,000 children from the jaws of a lousy pedophile. <br /> <br /> However, the series was a huge success. In fact in telly terms there was only one disadvantage: it was not repayable. After all, when you saved every child in the nation from certain death, you can't really do it a second time. The only solution is to find a new threat, which leads us to Ian Wright's Unfit Kids (Wednesday, 21:00, C4), a weekly issuetainment program in which the former footballer and well-known enemy of grammar forces a group of young people overweight to take is part of an extra-curricular film. <br /> <br /> It is essentially a carbon copy of the Jamie Oliver show, with more sweat and fewer throws of pupils crushing fresh basil with a pestle: an uplifting fairy tale in which Wright shapes her a band of misfits in a thin, petty machine, able to fight apathy and numbness, confront lazy parents and try to turn the whole thing into a national problem that will see the mothers of the Range Rover dampen their panties with pure and simple sanction at the Conran store. Oh, it's just not terrible, what do these blob-some plebes do to themselves? It is not our Josh, you understand: he eats nothing but organic spinach and attends the lacrosse six hundred times a week. Bet you do, the little excuse yes, it's moving to see flaccid and uncomfortable children transforming themselves with a little simple activity ... but there is something in the message below "eat-your-greens" that really sticks to my goiter, in case you didn't guess. <br /> <br /> What happened to the CHOICE concept, you * beep * So a little jogging could increase your life expectancy - so what? This is equivalent to a few more years in the nursing home - whoopee. And besides, I'd rather die dead tomorrow than spend the rest of my life sharing a planet with a bunch of smug shots trying to survive each other. <br /> <br /> In episode two, video games and the Internet are identified as bad in the broken war: they make children too sedentary, see. Strangely, TV, which is equally sedentary, and unlike these two activities, actively encourages you to let your mind atrophy together with your body, escape without a roll. Funny. <br /> <br /> Listen to Channel 4 here - instead of forcing children to eat salmon or squat-thrusts, how about teaching them to think more expansively, so they reject cunning, the cajoling of programs like this? Or would it be too far away?
