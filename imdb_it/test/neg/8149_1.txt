With the little respect it deserves, I would like to say that this film was horrible. The filmmakers had good intentions, but the general quality of management and production value was obviously lacking. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good hard laugh and then waste another two hours of their lives living a truly painful experience. I'm surprised I even found this movie on the $ 1 DVD rack in which it was placed correctly. I thought it would be nice and that I could discover some incredible independent films - I was wrong. I wish I'd never seen this movie. My 3-year-old cousin couldn't make a worse movie. I'm glad I saw the movie because I can finally tell people that I've seen the worst movie ever made, and be sure.
