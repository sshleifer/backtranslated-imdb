This "remake" is a complete disgrace: so mediocre, cheap and prosaic, it would not deserve more than a couple of mischievous lines. <br /> <br /> He is also a crook, with a ridiculous script served by amateur "acting", you are always aware that there is a set, a camera, a fake, no direction, no suspended reality to allow you to deepen the plot. <br /> <br /> The claustrophobic and suffocating tension of the small spaces and rooms of the original Japanese masterpieces (Ju-On 1 & 2) are almost completely lost here in exaggerated spaces and environments. <br /> <br /> But worse still, the moral enormity and unbearable suffering, which both ruthlessly imparted to the original mother and the victims of children turned into relentless vindictive ghouls, is completely ruined by an absurdity total and a boogie-man style void. <br /> <br /> If the American public is not willing to read the subtitles and rises above the lowest common denominator, preferring to swallow this kind of condescending homage, instead, f Ully deserves this pathetic curse: the film itself .
