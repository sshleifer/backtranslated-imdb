This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> We should like him and cheer for an arrogant bank robber, pundit, shabby, played by Dale Robertson, and a hilarious comedy starring Linda Darnell, extraordinarily beautiful, in a red fireman's dress. It must have been sewn into that bodice! <br /> <br /> A film senator thinks that Native Americans and whites should try to understand, bigots, however, win the day. I could barely sit through the endless dialogue of bigotry emanating from the other mouths of the characters. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Wounded Knee and Dances with Wolves, there are few films that give a positive portrait of American Indians, and very few old westerns do. This is exceptionally negative in this regard. <br /> <br /> The love story between Robertson and Darnell pissed my teeth off as he swaggered in, forcing me to kiss her as she played the old hard to get the game. <br /> <br /> There are scenes that are unintentionally funny, such as the characters that obviously are not really in the saddle or on a diligence in different shots. <br /> <br /> A baffling and amusing incident in the plot is The character of Linda Darnell is doing everything to buy tickets for the stagecoach, only to then ask for a horse, a few minutes later, for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Another fun scene is when the stagecoach comes to a screeching halt at the sight of a cowboy hat lying next to the road, and not only, but ALL passengers pile up for a look-see . <br /> <br /> 1 star.
