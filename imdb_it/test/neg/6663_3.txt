While traveling by train, a woman (Stéphane Excoffier) ​​erroneously leaves a remote station when the train stops in the middle of the night. He soon discovers that a strange lone point man (Jim van der Woude) who does not speak his language is the only person in that area and that was the last train on that track. The man hosts her at home and develop an unusual relationship without words between them. <br /> <br /> "De Wisselwachter" is an overrated boredom, with a different but uninteresting story that doesn't go anywhere. I like Off-Hollywood movies, but this story is too absurd and eventually has no message. The sexual tension between the two protagonists is fun at a time but too repetitive. I saw this movie in an old VHS and the image is too dark; I don't know if the DVD would be of better quality on DVD. In the end, I was absolutely disappointed with this feature. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Homem da Linha" ("The Man of the Line")
