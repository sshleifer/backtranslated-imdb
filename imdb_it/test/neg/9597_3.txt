Although many Billie fans where I am happy with his work here, I have to go. As a socially pre-eminent member of the intelligent British set, his British accent is fundamentally non-existent and his line readings sound just like, well, line readings and his emulation seems trance-like and ponderosa. Basil Rathbone, usually a good actor, seems out of his mind and also speaks with a strange accent - in his case something Italian, even if we can't be sure. The screenplay manages to keep its precise ethnicity a secret. It is further hampered by the script that gives him one of those old film ailments, something to do with nerves, which requires surgery. The only real entertainment is represented by the illustrious Kay Francis who sports a lacquered bob with side curls in his role as depraved countess who shamelessly devours men, including Rathbone, and then spits them out. He pulls it out with his unique aplomb. She is the only living thing in this dead sea of ​​a movie.
