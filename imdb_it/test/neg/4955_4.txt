If there's one thing I've learned from watching George Romero's Creepshow, it's that if you run into a mysterious old cassette that someone has obviously put a lot of effort into hiding it, it just leaves you feeling good: there's probably something bad inside. /> <br /> Obviously, Professor Gordon Crowley, the character of Robert Englund in "Jack Brooks, Monster Slayer" is not a Romero fan, because he opens the old wooden box that he finds buried in his garden, only to find out ? "Surprise, you surprise an ancient demon who has his body (initially he does eat and vomit quite a lot). <br /> <br /> When the demon explodes from Crowley's body during the chemistry class and starts transforming the students in hellish and carnivorous beasts, it is up to the plumber Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) to try to stop the evil creatures, armed only with a piece of pipe and fed by a permanent hatred of all that is monstrous!. <br /> <br /> Jon Knautz's low budget monster DVD pack promises a fun run, offering chills of taste and spills of the kind you'd expect from your average 80s character (jerks, monstrous rubber suits, macabre blood and absolutely CGI-free!) and in the last 15 minutes, this is exactly what the spectators get: non-stop crushing effects, a stupid Jabba-style tentacled demon, and a very lousy monster! <br /> <br / > E It's a shame, therefore, that the rest of the movie's running time is around 70 minutes or more, mostly spent following Jack while he gets bored, everyday business: plumbing, visiting his shrink, going to the course chemistry and upset his girlfriend. If you think you could enjoy a movie that focuses primarily on managing childhood trauma and anger management, on buying replacement boiler valves from a hardware store and on the chemical properties of Sodium, then this is the movie that makes for you; but if it's a massive dose of monster you're looking for, then I suggest you look elsewhere!
