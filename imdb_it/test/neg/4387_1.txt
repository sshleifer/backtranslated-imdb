This was the worst movie my wife and I have ever seen. The only concession is that we didn't pay to see it at the cinema while we rented it on DVD from the video store. Simply - No mention worth mentioning (I just watched it 5 minutes ago and I've already forgotten it), annoying characters misinterpreted by two-bit actors and if this was supposed a comedy I'm still waiting to laugh. In fact, the only laugh we got is that we joked with each other and agreed that it was really terrible. <br /> <br /> Simply putting this film on was completely pathetic and I warn others not to waste their time. A parody of the name National Lampoon, Rating 0/10.
