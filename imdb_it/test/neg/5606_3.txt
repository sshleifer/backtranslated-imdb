This movie was really bad. I mean really bad. The scenes were like a parody and the special effect sucked a lot. And it was shot in 2003 !!! I think this was a waste of time and money and Michael Shanks made me laugh with his 'Shaggy from Scooby Doo' image. Don't waste your time with this image ... I really don't know what the director was thinking after seeing the final movie of this movie, but the fights were so unrealistic that it hurt my eyes to watch them. The "latex cat" fighters were like sheep going around the scenes and they looked scared as if they had no idea what to do on the scene ... I think this is a beautiful example of Bottom 100 image.
