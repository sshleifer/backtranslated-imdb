While killing Saturday morning, "Looking For Lola" arrived on HBO. I decided to give it a shot even though the description of the film looked pretty bad. It was even worse than I imagined. The film was incredibly incredible and there was absolutely no on-screen harmony between the main actors that I found myself shaking my head almost every 10 minutes. Between Mike Greenbaum (leading actor) in scenes in which he skips the bill in a luxury restaurant and where Lola (leading actress) allows him to use his boss's house to deceive his parents into believing he is rich, it was almost like that bad as he "daydreaming" about the people around him who make the macarena (it was HORRIBLE!) and the two actors eventually fell in love. I kept wanting to change channels, but I was trying to give him every chance to become a nice love story with a few chuckles. It never happened. In fact, it has become so serious that I decided to finish it, so I can claim to have seen one of the worst films ever made in its entirety, instead of being criticized for not having "given a good opportunity". The last scene in which Lola looks for a dance piece was the culmination of the film. He arrives late after getting married (even that scene in which Mike tells the priest to hurry up and then simply tears off the papers claiming that it is made in tune with the credibility of this film), and then somehow "convinces" the judges to take a look. The two male judges have already been discouraged by how late it is. But after looking at her open-mouthed on stage (ok, dancing well, but not too impressive), everyone joins the families of Lola and Mike, other dancers who were there and * coughed * even the judges. Bad, horrible, terrible. It was so bad that I had to write a review. Look at your own risk.
