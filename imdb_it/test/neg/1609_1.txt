I'll start by confessing that I tend to really enjoy action movies (military or otherwise). I'm a guy. But this bad one was terrible. I've seen it for free, showtime or hbo and I still feel like I've paid too much. It was a prolonged episode of general hospital. <br /> <br /> I gave a 1, only because 0 or 0.1 was not possible. How or why 59 others would have given a rating between 5 and 6 boggle in my mind. Unless they are all members of the cast or crew family. <br /> <br /> It could be, this film was so bad many saved ....... and as such, they were too little invented to disturb. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for repeating but the minimum of 10 lines seems silly, for what essentially boils down to a warning ......... hoping to save others the black hole of 2 hours, this film represents. Trust me, stare at a white wall, they will be more action.
