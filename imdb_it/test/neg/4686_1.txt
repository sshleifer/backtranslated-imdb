When I bought this movie, I expected to get a fun exploitative movie from the 70s. Instead, I had this festive book of amateur author Andy Milligan. Ah, Andy Milligan. With its tight editing, fast-paced rhythm and wonderfully famous actors, you could almost think you're watching ... one of his home movies! Seriously, I couldn't even stay awake the first time I tried to watch it. The scenes of boring people dragged themselves on an "on" and every time someone was killed, the film slowed down. Sometimes the speed also increased, making the characters' voices sound like chipmunks, which was probably the best thing about this movie. The script actually looked a little better than the film, and seems more suited to being in a soap opera than a graying sleeping pill from the 70s, in which the actors constantly stumble on its lines. The cover said "Their first cuts were curiously erotic ... but absolutely brutal!" Trust me, there is nothing "erotic" about this movie. Oh, we can see characters that look like too big cheese flakes, but that's all. And as for "brutal", well, the viewer is more brutalized with this movie here. It's another thing...
