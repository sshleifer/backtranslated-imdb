OK, I've seen the Hershall Gordon Lewis films before, but this really takes the cake, it's really gory and gross, not to mention disgusting about the way strippers are made, I'm talking about bad acting that makes piano 9 look like hamlet space, the only thing that saves is the late great Henny Youngman as owner of the strip club, yes take my wife ..., please. The strippers are really sexy for 1972, I think they used the same plot again in the Roger Corman movie; stripped to kill in 1987. I had fun with the first maniacs of HGLewis 100, which was a mini masterpiece, but a bad acting, no prizes here, but know that this is a splatter film that opened the way for Friday 13, I have seen. In a disturbing scene a half-naked stripper has her ass spanked with a tender flesh. Enough! morbid stuff here.HG Lewis strikes again. 2 out of 10.
