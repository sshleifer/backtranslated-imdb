This film is probably one of the 3 worst films made in history. I rented it by accident, without reading reviews, and wow, I regret it. He really has no plot, he doesn't really follow the vampire genre. Simply terrible god. Watching this movie can contaminate your enthusiasm for vampire movies. I felt like the writer / director / producer continued with this binge of drugs and had hallucinations and tried to recreate it on film. All the while I wanted the film to end .. but the ending was even more struck. <br /> <br /> If this review can only save a person from looking at this shit, I felt my time spent recording and writing this review was worth it.
