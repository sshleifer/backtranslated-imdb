Steven Seagal is back! Here with his third film released this year. Obviously, as a fan of once having become increasingly unhappy, I can say that it is not surprising that this is rather lame. First the film made headlines due to apparent production problems due to Seagal. He showed up late on the set, changed the script, the crew, etc. And generally it caused problems for the director, Don E Faun Leroy (his lack of talent his problem enough!). This also happens in their second collaboration with the upcoming Mercenary which promises to be just as bad as this junk. This also marks a major turning point in Seagal's career because this film is the first of his to really dig the repertoire. There was a bit in Ticker but this movie takes the biscuit. They borrow pieces from The Order (a film by Van Damme, Seagals' biggest rival in DTV movies!) No code of conduct, undisputed, and even an entire action sequence from the little-known Peter Weller, played by Top Of The World. It is interesting to note that the pursuit of the car stolen from Weller's epic, made almost 10 years ago and, ironically, probably cheaper than this junk, is actually the best action scene in the film. I was shocked enough when Dolph Lundgren had a brief time in the action video world, which fortunately escaped. Seagal is currently the leader of the DTV action market, with Van Damme and Snipes its main rivals. Seagal still manages to sell films and for the life of me I don't know how. Surely the fans must have been bored of this terrible, wishing a return to characters like Above The Law. The story here is totally lame. In reality the film has so many holes in the plot that it doesn't care to think. For example, at the end of a film there is a little girl that Seagal apparently knows in an orphanage to which she gives a necklace. Because I don't know but we never see it in the rest of the film, or we hear it mentioned. Seagal has a girlfriend in this film who at the beginning of the film is with a psychic and becomes obsessed with visions, which at the end of the film are never explained and mean nothing. The film is so ridiculously glued by a series of nonsensical paps that it becomes headache inducing .. This is by far the most stupid movie on Seagal! Seagal himself is more wooden than ever, but to his credit he was not nicknamed in this case as far as I could tell. Seagal still feels the need to talk as if he were a gangsta rapper, making me want the days when he would wear his Brooklyn / Italian-American accent, in his first classic films. He also has a painfully double not funny act with Treach, which I assume is a rapper. It's funny how the producers seem to think that the Seagal combo, in addition to the hip-hop star, seems to work, because his DMX team in Exit Wounds was his most successful film after Under Siege. Clearly if nobody has heard of the rapper, it won't work. This is still an action film and therefore the action itself must be judged. Unfortunately the action that did not come from the NU Image back catalog is strictly routine. There are some small fighting scenes with some classic Seagal aikido, but when 90% is performed by his stunt double, which really has a lot of hard work in this film, it doesn't impress much. There are also some standard clashes with guns that actually have only a pretty violent and bloody squeak. All in all this is a painfully boring experience and once again I still have the same verdict: Seagal has lost it! I keep asking the old question now, "why do people still watch his movies?" This is all very well and good as a question, but the sad bastard who continues to watch his films in the deluded hope of being able to do something good again. Chances are reduced, unlike Seagal's ever-expanding waistline. * 1/2
