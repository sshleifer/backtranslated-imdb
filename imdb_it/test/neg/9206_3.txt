After the success of Star Wars, interest in science fiction films has increased. This was one of those economic attempts to cash in quickly. <br /> <br /> A group of spaceship survivors land on a planet inhabited by stop-motion dinosaurs, where half of them are systematically killed (people are not dinosaurs). Porn movie level. Cheap special effects, even for the time, even if it seems that there has been a great effort. <br /> <br /> The costumes were pure 70s, as were the hairstyles. Ah, the 70s. I expected a nightclub to break loose at any moment. <br /> <br /> Nothing really recommendable in this film.
