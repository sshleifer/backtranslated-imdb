What a waste. John Travolta and Scarlett Johansen deserved better. To start at the beginning, JT was horribly misplaced in the head. The role required someone who could convince a destroyed anti-hero, someone who could look haunted and defeated. Billy Bob Thornton would have adapted to the bill, or even Al Pacino, but JT is too alive and seems to enjoy himself too much. Also, surely someone who crossed the mill to the extent that the JT character would suffer some physical effects? The character presented to the public seemed as if it could start as a tight end for the Oakland Raiders. Scarlett has a little less in terms of role. Where was the pain and the conflict of what should have certainly worried development? And as for the "plot" ... well, nothing makes sense. The characters jump from one mood to another apparently without cause - and certainly without explanation. Even the rhythm of the film leaves something to be desired, or rhythm. This is a very slow film, not that I have anything against slow movies, as long as they go somewhere. The pace picks up only towards the end, when it goes from a slow direction to a frantic race to fill as many clich√©s as possible tired. In this it happens - the only thing missing is something that involves a small dog. 3 out of 10 for this only for Gabriel Macht's performance - he was the only cast member he was a) well cast and b) able to convince in his role. All in all, a terrible disappointment and a waste of a couple of hours.
