Now, let me see if I have this, a crazy serial killer is going around killing real estate agents ... okay ... what's wrong with that scenario, I can live with it. <br /> next, a slasher with slaughtered tax inspectors? Traffic cops sliced ​​to death? Should we feel sympathy for people with empty and superficial properties, obsessed with money? Um ... no. <br /> <br /> Sadly, seriously, it's not a very well made film with poor acting and raw effects, the climate scene is particularly silly. You can almost see the director shouting "action" at the stuntman as he falls through the window glass. <br /> <br /> As another reviewer rightly said, after starring in "The Fog", this was the nadir of Adrienne Barbeau's career. So I was happy to see that she had rekindled it by becoming the voice of Catwoman in the Batman animated series, while watching the extras in the Catwoman movie live. NB: not really the terrible film that was invented, however. <br /> <br /> But this is a bad movie, think of a poor episode of "Kojak" or "Streets of San Francisco", and you'll have an idea of ​​what's on offer here.
