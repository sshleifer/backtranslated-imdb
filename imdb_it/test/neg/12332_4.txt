"Love Life" explores a culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay man. I found the argument convincing, even if the conflict was a bit forced and too easily solved. For example, Thomas falls for Joe a little too quickly and comfortably for the plot. There are many errors of continuity: another user commented on several cars in the garage, Joe's glasses ... what struck me most was the fact that Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene . In the end, I found myself more involved in this film than moved. Stephan D. Gill has a very nice body and shows everything quite a few times with pornstar and exuberance skills, and often even acting ribs. Many times, it seems that the film will become a complete porn movie. Stephanie Kirchen does a great job, but her lighting moment at the end was a bit stained for me, as I was in the mood for a nice shower puzzle at the end of this movie.
