This is really an exercise to make you shudder. Dressed as a tribute to firefighters it contains silly scenes of "we're just a bunch of wacky guys" in the middle of the parties "my God can be really dangerous". Mostly it's just stupid. You can't believe for just one minute that the real firefighters do this. It is so terrible that I could not bear to look sometimes. If my daughter had not rented it and then insisted on seeing it until the end, I would have had no choice but to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The fact is that I'm a fan of John Travolta. Every interview I saw raises my opinion about him. I think this was strictly for money. I'm sure he'll be happy when he forgets.
