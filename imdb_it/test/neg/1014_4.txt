The third episode of the series sees Paul Kersey (Bronson) becoming vigilant to take revenge on the thugs who killed his old friend. I don't know why this film pushed me to do it, but it worked somehow. I found myself rooting for Bronson to clean the floor with those punks. Every time one of them blew away I felt good. This film is not taken seriously, but what if it did? There is a good accumulation for the fireworks finale in which Bronson is furious. But as far as acting and plot are concerned, it is not measured. If I lived in that neighborhood, I'll get out as fast as I could, but people seem to be asking for trouble. I know that there is that mentality that we must save our roads, but here there is a limit. I had to give him a 4. Surely there are good "blow 'em away" scenes but that's it. At that time, Bronson was 64 years old. I'm sure that if those thugs really wanted to, they could make their way with Bronson. Bronson takes the place of a Schwarzanegger or Stallone in this film. This film gives you a sense of joy. The common man can save the neighborhood, save the day. To sum up, this is far from being the original Death Wish, but it's pretty good if you're just looking for an hour and a half of shooting.
