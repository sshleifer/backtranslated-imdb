This film is disgusting beyond all limits. It's unbelievable - a bad loathing on the part of Jaws and other (better) shark movies. Really bad - everything is really pathetic. History is pure shit, actors are bad, effects very cheap, no creativity whatsoever. It seems that some debilitated children took Jaws' script and arranged it randomly, then his parents took their 8mm camera and shot the movie with their neighbors. Music is really inappropriate, just a bit of "elevator" music, insipid and overly optimistic when nothing happens, so a little less optimistic when the shark is around or when children get depressed (again listen to music of the elevator VERY NOISY). Carlo Maria (the author) should be so ashamed that he should ask him to delete his name from the titles !! The film is the perfect demonstration of how crappy music destroys ANY scene that should be electrifying. There is a big difference to Jaws though: At the beginning of Jaws there are comments about stupid people trying to kill the shark with dynamite. Well, there's an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite. When this doesn't work, the boys take a *** BIG LOAD *** of dynamite and spend 1/4 of the movie placing explosives in some sunken ship. This is a truly original way to catch the fish I have to admit! They use so much dynamite as if they try to kill a battleship (I would say Bismarck warship class) or dig another Panama canal. This is simply amazing. I'm glad they didn't try to use the napalm flame thrower or the tactical nuclear strike to eliminate this bad, bad shark of about 2 meters. Well, there's a lost Indian native mystic (who looks like a German pensioner) even in this mess. This is not a movie, this is an example of how bad the films can be! As a warning it is useful. But the public should be protected from this crap. Most Italian movies are bad, but this ... this one is really great in the worst sense of the word.
