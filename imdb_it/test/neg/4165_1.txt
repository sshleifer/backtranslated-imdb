At first I was excited about this film and I expected it to be a combination of Equilibruim and Farenheit 451. Unfortunately, I was continually disappointed by the lack of depth and interest in the plot and subplots. In the middle of the film, I enjoyed teasing the characters and scenes to avoid having to turn it off. I liked the premise of a future with fused cultures and separation between having and abandonment. What could have been a shrewd and intelligent look into the future has turned into a semicircular sci-fi plastic film at midnight with horrible acting, cheap sets and a free final shot of Tim Robbins' vagina. Perhaps he should stick to his socialist political ranting - it was all downhill from Shawshank.
