I'm a video store employee, so I try to see the movies we're about to publish every week. I have no problems with this; in fact, I think it's a privilege. Not so with this movie. . . After an hour and a half of our hero complaining and snarling his way through scene after scene, I was really wondering if they planned to get to the point. I felt like I had to be paid for seeing him at home, in my spare time. And if I knew there was another time to endure, I could have given up at that moment. I didn't care about the characters, the shots were insignificant, and Ford made kisses look like a thankless task. Even the score was incongruous and jarring. What a waste.
