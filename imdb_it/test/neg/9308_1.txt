Yahoo Serious is like a $ 3 bottle of wine - it had no substance to begin with and simply worsens with age. This film shows that it is completely toxic. We can only hope that this is his final film and that his serious lack of success will diminish his chances of obtaining funding for possible future initiatives. It is right there with "Lightning Jack" and "Les Patterson Saves the World" as the most abysmal example of the Australian comedy imaginable. How tragic it is that with so many infinitely superior talents in Australia, Yahoo is being offered these vehicles to express its school playground comedy child brand. And to think: he was 7 years old to invent the script. Real genius!
