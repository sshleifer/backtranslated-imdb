I finally saw this movie last weekend. What a disappointment. It barely reaches the "made for TV" level. Given the list of actors, I would have expected something substantially more sophisticated. The film lacks a good story, well, actually any story for that matter. It has no credibility, rather much predictability. Save yourself money and time.
