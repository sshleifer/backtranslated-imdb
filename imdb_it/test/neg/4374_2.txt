Chuck Norris plays as Danny, a cop who captured a backbreaking serial killer when he said the killer escapes, Danny knows he is the only one who can stop the terror. However, Danny hides a secret, he knows that it was pure luck that stopped the terror and even more luck that Danny survived, now a final battle is fought but Danny is ready? Right there in my description he says what's the problem with this movie. Norris plays a lousy hero who still suffers from psychological trauma. In the hands of a better actor, this concept would be interesting and could be a great thriller. In the hands of a Norris thriller it makes it simply ridiculous and hopelessly non-heroic. On board also Steve James of American Ninja and Ron O'Neal of Superfly, but any attempt to develop the character is defeated by the atrocious script. Furthermore there is almost no action and I have always preferred a Norris film with more fights and fewer words. Given the evaluation on this site, I don't have to be alone. <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
