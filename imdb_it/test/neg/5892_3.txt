This film was very disappointing as several elements of the book were mistakenly made. The main plot is the same, but there are several flaws that hurt the film. <br /> <br /> 1) Boobie Miles is injured at the beginning of the story in a Texas Tech preseason game. This means that he will get nothing during the season and Chris Comer will show up earlier in the team. <br /> <br /> 2) The match against Marshall was lost to Marshall. The team represented how Marshall was actually Midland High one of the main rivals of the Permian and here is the proof: Marshall High is the scarlet color and Mavericks silver, Midland High is the Bulldogs colored purple and gold. Look at the shirts and see who it is. Even the real Marshall High roster is Black, the team shown was racially mixed as Midland High. <br /> <br /> 3) Permian only loses one point in the district game at Midland Lee. Midland Lee lost to Midland High and Midland High lost to Permian. These are the teams that organized the coin toss as such. <br /> <br /> 4) Boobie returns to the team as a reserve for Chris Comer and, after losing the playing time in the Midland Lee game, leaves the team completely at half time and never stops on the sideline or back to play. <br /> <br /> 5) Brian Chavez was a Tight End and Defensive End who wore the # 85 not as Tight End and Strong Safety. In addition, Boobie wore # 35 and Ivory Christian wore # 62. <br /> <br /> 6) The coaches end up appreciating Chris Comer as a player more than Boobie because he has better lifting ethics and runs more straight as the staff also prefers, this is partly why Boobie leaves the team. <br /> <br /> 7) Dallas Carter is played in Austin at the Darrell K. Royal Memorial stadium where the UT plays in the state semifinals not in the state finals. Carter wins the state title but is forced to give up due to an unsuitable player. <br /> <br /> The acting is done quite well, but if you read the book, you will see that these defects are quite true. I'm also tired of hearing all the PC hypocrites out there complaining about the Dallas Carter football team's performance. The team according to the book is large, monstrous, talented and black as the film shows. People say it's a racist representation but by reading the book, you see a true representation of the team. The plot is very upset, giving this film a score of 3.5 / 10.
