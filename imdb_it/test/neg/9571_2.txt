This very forced attempt to merge Robert Altman and Quentin Tarantino (which has been enormously overrated) is neither informative nor fun. The character development is arbitrary and incredible - especially in the final scene of the hooligans and the little boy, as other reviewers have noted. Also, a couple of funny moments aside, the film isn't as funny (black humor or anything) as the director seems to think it is.
