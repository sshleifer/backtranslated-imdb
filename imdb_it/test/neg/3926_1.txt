Performance is better than the evaluation I gave to this work, simply because I will not support a film that shows any child or mentally challenged person how to get, cook and inject narcotics into their bodies. <br /> <br /> This is a disgusting film, which serves no purpose in the world, but to fascinate and attempt to legitimize the narcotic lifestyle. It supports convincing performance, which adds to my disgust. What were these people thinking ?! I couldn't enjoy a movie like this. Just make sure that someone who has never used drugs, think about it, and who has and has redeemed, consider the return. I'm surprised he doesn't make every clean wanderer see him fall off the wagon. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good about this "movie", which stands out more as a How To Get Strung Out Drama document. This is the epitome of what's wrong with Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Absurdly disgusting. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 1.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon:.
