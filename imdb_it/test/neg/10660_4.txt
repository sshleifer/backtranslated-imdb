I don't like Himesh Reshamiya. I don't even like his way of singing. But his songs are a craze in India, especially among the common people. Now when did you try to become an actor ?? that was a big joke! What courage must gather as much as possible in the best moment. I never wanted to see this movie. But one thing has changed. The film becomes a super-duper success! After 2 weeks, Aap Ka Saroor cashed a collection at the box office of 14 crores ?? compared to Apne who collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks. If I can sit with the absurd Sivaji of Apne and Rajnikant ?? Should I also give this film an attempt to figure out what things this movie has produced that made it a big hit? The story is about the true singer Himesh Reshamiya (HR) who went to Germany for a concert and falls in love with Riya (Hansika Motwani). A German lawyer Ruby (Mallika Sherawat) loves Himesh. Now Himesh is arrested for a murder. Himesh's mission (in the last 40 minutes) after escaping from jail is to prove himself innocent and find the real murderer. <br /> <br /> Let me say that Himesh has nothing in him to become a hero. He tries hard but fails miserably. He is pathetic. I was thinking about what the movie could have done so much? Let me find something positive. <br /> <br /> First, the saving grace of the film is the script to the point where Himesh escapes from prison. (But after the film's nose plunges into unbearable stupid limits) Secondly, the film's tracks are good, catchy, crowd-drawing numbers. Third, Mallika Sherawat ?? she looks beautiful and she also acts well, like the second woman. I can imagine Mallika fans coming to see the movie just for her. Fourth, is the film's cinematography pleasant? especially the German locations, they are a pleasure to watch for the eyes. Fifth, is most of the story a love story between Himesh and Riya ?? with clich√© dialogues that would probably connect to the crowd of young people. Sixth, director Prashant Chadha did a decent job of covering up Himesh's pathetic acting skills as much as possible with shots that didn't need Himesh to do much. <br /> <br /> The heroine Hansika Motwani looks like a hero of the low-budget film. Raj Babbar is wasted in a small role. Overall the film is below average. <br /> <br /> was I thinking during the movie ?? and if the same script of the film had been made with Salmaan as the main protagonist. I think it would have been a much better deal. It could be so I would have given the movie 6 out of 10. But now ?? (Stars 4.5 out of 10)
