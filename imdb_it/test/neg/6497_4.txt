I saw this self-centered "effort" in reaching an epic status film in the company of several members of the native Russian family. Five people gave 5 different reactions, from Mikhalkov's adoration to my cynicism. <br /> <br /> I saw a movie that looked like Mikhalkov who took a lot of money for "Canal +", put some in his (and other) pockets and turned the project into a group of cinema students. I have counted at least 4 different "styles" in the film. There is no way that the director himself is responsible for these different scenes. Compare these for yourself: <br /> <br /> · The cadets who polish shoes with a dog. <br /> <br /> · Railway station scene (greeting Andrei). <br /> <br /> · Outdoor panoramic photos. <br /> <br /> · Ormond speaking through the keyhole. <br /> <br /> · Initial attempt on the Grand Duke and subsequent chase scenes to bring Andrei back to singing to Figaro. <br /> <br /> · Fencing sequence <br /> <br /> Julia Ormond is faster than superman. Knowing his late transfer, he arrives all over Moscow in just one minute to say goodbye to Andrei. The native Russians felt that the impression given to Russian life was "caricature" and not history. They called it "tourist postcard" in Russia. They were all proud that a Russian director / producer / repairer managed to enter the "big time" and be able to waste over $ 30 million of other people's money, perhaps putting some in local pockets during filming. <br /> <br /> If you want to "think" you've seen Russia go and watch this movie. Drink coffee before you go.
