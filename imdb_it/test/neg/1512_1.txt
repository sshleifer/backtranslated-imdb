As a Christian, I found this film completely embarrassing. The actors sucked, the screenplay sucked, cinematography sucked and the story was so typical. I could not say that this is a great testimony tool, because I would be too embarrassed to show any of my unsaved friends. Hollywood has much better things, and it's because they invest the best in it. Christians have worked hard and think it's OK because "it's for the gentleman". In the old testament, people spent huge amounts of money to bring offerings to God. David (or Saul ... I don't remember) spent what would have been about $ 50 billion in money today to build a temple for God. But these days, spending what seems to be around $ 30,000 at the top to make a "testify" movie with people is simply pathetic. It is the person, not the product that affects someone. Don't waste time trying to convert your friends with this waste of an hour and a half. If you want to make a positive impact with people, show them films like Matrix, American Beauty, Braveheart, etc., movies that have something to say and that actually give you inside you.
