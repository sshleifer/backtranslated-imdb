This film tries to be more than it is. First of all, acting is horrible. You have to overcome incredibly bad delivery lines and terrible emotions. The plot is quite interesting. A shipwreck occurs (apparently because it was made with balsa wood and arches), and a couple of boys are on the ground. If this wasn't bad enough, there would also be a guy named Count de Sade. He lives in fear of pirates and has become completely mad. However, he has a great slave, a young woman and some dogs. There is another woman who does not speak and his wife, who is a leper. However, things go wrong because these men have to deal with this madman. He is arrogant and loves to pose and deliver the lines. The rest of the film involves an escape attempt. It has an ironic ending that I will not reveal and that saves the film. I wouldn't worry if I were you.
