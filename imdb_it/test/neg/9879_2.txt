From the creators of Underworld, we have by far the worst werewolf movie ever. It is basically a reconstructed version of Underworld, but it lacks vampires (not a big problem), interesting effects (a big deal), and in general all that can be done to produce a decent film dealing with lycanthropy (the biggest deal of all of them!). A chocolate maker from the twenty-five werewolf named Vivian is currently residing in Romania since her family was hunted down and executed in America years ago to be werewolves. There, he belongs to a small company (or pack) of werewolves and is apparently chosen to unintentionally marry the pack leader, Gabriel, whose son - a British-accented toad - takes the responsibility to hunt out of the pack. Apparently they have been discovered in other countries before and want to stay established in Romania avoiding negative attention, so obviously this activity is considered prohibited. Vivian ends up falling in love with an American artist who does not realize her involvement with the group of bloodthirsty predators. When they end up discovering the secret relationship, things get complicated when someone is killed and the human is forced to participate in a deadly tradition in which he is released into the woods and hunted - giving the pack a chance to turn into their "wolfy" themselves. This really consists of a big jump before they light up and land like a wolf. Very cheezy effects. The whole film is like a domesticated Underworld with some drippy and romantic montages and very little action. Looking at this in the theater, I couldn't wait for it to end. A terribly boring disappointment. To avoid!
