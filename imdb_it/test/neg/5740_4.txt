I suggest that in the future any film made by the Sci fi channel and subsequently released on DVD should say that it was actually made by such a channel, since I wouldn't buy this stuff if I had known this. Not that this was bad, but when you disappeared for commercials in the middle of your movie, this ruins the flow of the film. This in turn makes the film a little more boring. This has had an interesting history, yet the light and extremely generic soundtrack has distracted one from the film like most bad actors, with the exception of Dien and Linda Carter. The story, the vampires are on the attack in South America, obviously the rules of the vampire movies are not in effect, which usually are not in any of the vampire movies I saw lately with the exception of the Blade trilogy. A group of soldiers is sent to fight the team, another team is sent to meet the team and track down the ex wife of one of the soldiers ... because it's not just his wife, who knows how part of the plot doesn't go right where. Still we get an interesting boat ride to some beautiful jungle landscapes and lots of blood. This fact, however, does not save the film from being a way of joking in its presentation and seemingly boring at times. I don't know if it was the blood of the CGI, the smoke and all that CGI must do, even if the old effects look better and don't cost much more. I mean, cheap Italian zombie movies could make a bullet hole without CGI because we can't do it now?
