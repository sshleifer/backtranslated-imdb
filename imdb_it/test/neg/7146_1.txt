This film infuriated me for the simple fact that it was only done because Shepherd was gay. The men who murdered him are clearly evil. What happened to the poor man was really horrible and a tragedy. However, where was Hollywood when four white religious children were executed, after being forced to perform a series of sexual acts on their killers and each other, by two evil black men in Wichita only two years ago? Celebrities only attract the camera when a political purpose is needed. Furthermore, Laramie is portrayed in a poor light by this pseudo-documentary, which of course is not surprising because it is the hobbyists who must be educated by omniscient and enlightened Californians. Still, it's always a pleasure to see Laura Linney.
