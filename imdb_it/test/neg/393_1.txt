I have only one word: focus. <br /> <br /> well. <br /> <br /> IMDb wants me to use at least ten lines of text. all right. we discuss the points of maximum attention. I don't know for the rest of you, but in my first year of film school we were taught many useless crap, like "one day you will become famous avant-garde directors" - but they also taught us how to do this crazy thing called FOCUSING the lens! It was amazing! give it a little touch and wham! everything is as clear as a bell. the person who fired on what he found Alice needs to learn some things about the finer points of focus. also lighting. this film is not only completely out of focus, but is also lit up like someone's basement corner. <br /> <br /> it doesn't even let me start the rhythm or the plot. they could have cut about ten seconds from the start and end of each single shot. <br /> <br /> but who cares anyway? there is not enough lurid in this film to compensate for the total lack of regard for the film's best friends - FOCUS, and LIGHTING. <br /> <br /> words for the essays.
