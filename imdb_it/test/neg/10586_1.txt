It is not unusual for Hollywood to like pumping bad movies. Occasionally, a handful of good movies come out of them while the majority sucks only the biggest ass. Moreover, it is not surprising that those bad films are rebuilt from old television series. "From time to time a surprise opens with" The Fugitive "(who saw that the Best Picture oscar nom arrives?), But for every" Fugitive ", there is a McHale's Navy or some other totally non-original film with no plot or interest, the Mod Squad, in my opinion, enters my top ten of really bad films, in which Hollywood should be sorry for having produced what it could have being a good movie. We are moving in the middle of a story that seems to make no sense, wasting talent and dialogue is just bad. In reality we don't know who the hell these characters are, and we could give a fake answer about what they are. Instead, you are expected to automatically know who they are and what they will do.There is a particularly bad riff, on the line "I'm too old for this s ** t", it's just stupid. Something my friend has verbally noticed when we were calling loudly for the film to end. It's just an insult to Hollywood cinema. Degree: F-
