I knew I had been for a LONG 90 minutes when the opening voice above mispronounced the word "scarecrow" (it sounded like Scare Crew). And of course, 90 minutes later, after watching a horrible drama, a boring drama, the scarecrow's fists never get close to their goal, but "hit" anyway, Ken Shamrock "acting", and the most stupid ending illogical, that I saw in my life (Ok, no, I take that last one again, in about a week). After overcoming all this, I wept openly that I could not just go to Lacuna at Jim Carrey and completely erase it from my mind. The thoughts I could have had that director Brian Katkin could have made an OK movie, given the right circumstances I had after seeing "Slaughter Studios", have completely and completely disappeared from my mind. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Tara Platt and Lisa Robert become topless <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand (available until to 22 September 2005)
