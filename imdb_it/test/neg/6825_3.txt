When I recounted these events that took place a few years ago (hard to believe that this actually happened) I thought, here's a base for an interesting story here. Many secrets have never been discovered, the horse has never found, the main conspirators have never been captured etc. <br /> <br /> However, this film seems to be distracted by the study of the character, and very little attention has been paid to the plot. Some other questions are raised, however, why why in this film will Mickey Rourke be in this movie? It's nice to see the rocket career has taken off again, but must mention the mention of this garbage. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the topic, do an internet search on the subject, you will be more polite and I would dare to say more amused. Avoid this.
