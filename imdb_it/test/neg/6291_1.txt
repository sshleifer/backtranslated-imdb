The film is an adaptation of a Japanese story by the respected author Yukio Mishima. It simply does not transform the transition into a credible story about English and Americans. <br /> <br /> The story moves slowly, especially the part where Miles and Kristofferson are separated and the director fills with the clich√©s of a bow of the ship that cuts through the waves and the small route line that it fills up on the maps, while their letters are heard in overvo. The film moves so languidly that I even quickly forwarded the scenes of sex and masturbation which, although long, are neither really passionate nor erotic. The film reached a certain notoriety when Kristofferson's wife divorced him for extra-curricular activities with Miss Miles during filming. I guess they enjoyed the sex scenes, but it's not exactly the same for a viewer. <br /> <br /> There are no characters to hold onto. The sexually frustrated widow is unlikely, the boy is detestable. Kristofferson is quite lovable, but he doesn't have the acting skills to bring much to the role, although maybe we really don't want to get too involved with him, considering his final destiny. <br /> <br /> As for the boy, well, he finds himself in a bad crowd after his father died, and they help him to plot a little evil against the man who enters his mother's life. This is really a bad crowd. They don't just shop up and smoke drugs, nosireebib. They carry a mickey in a cat and enliven it. This is shown in gory detail. But of course this is just a practice, so they can do the same thing with Kristofferson! <br /> <br /> So the film moves mainly slowly, without characters to relate to, and when something happens it is inexorably morbid. <br /> <br /> The ending is as unsatisfactory as any movie you will ever see. <br /> <br /> All this could have made sense if the Japanese venue and the cultural context had been maintained. As it is, it is simply abysmal. <br /> <br />
