First of all, let me make it clear that I'm a big fan of bad science fiction, especially when it comes to the giant monsters that beat the city. But this is so incredibly lame that I don't even like it to be bad. Apparently they haven't radiated enough money from the budget by skimping on props (the only thing we have to indicate the size of the alien girl is an oversize novelty pencil, available at Spencer's Gifts for about fifteen dollars), they also decided not at the expense of the concept or plot. The monster looks okay, in my opinion, but it doesn't have enough interaction with the backgrounds, ie not enough destruction to satisfy most fans of the genre. The general rule of the giant monster movies is: if you don't have a lot of fake buildings to destroy, then it's better to have another fake-looking monster to fight with. This film has neither I can not present my last complaint about the film without giving away the ending, but suffice it to say that the origin of the monster and the method found to get rid of it, simply do not hold water. Not even like most of these films. Salta.
