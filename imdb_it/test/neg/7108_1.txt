My poor Tank Girl, they ignored everything about you. Why does it have so little to do with comics? I would have liked a film that followed the plot, or at least had the right characters. <br /> <br /> WHY WAS THE TANK OF AN American GIRL? It's Australian, damn it! Not even she lives in a post apocalyptic war zone, she lives inland with Booga as a savage. He does it because he wants to live that way, not because he has to do it because Malcolm Mc Dowell is acting like an idiot. And why is he looking after those children? The only children in the comics end up being violently choked by her, it's terrible that they turned her into a lame mother figure. <br /> <br /> And my poor girl Jet and Sub Girl! In the comics, Jet is a sarcastic prankster and Sub girl is ... another sarcasm with a strange sense of humor. In the movie Jet is this little sub thing and Sub is this old middle-aged witch. And Booga neither appears nor acts in any way like what it is meant to be. Even if perhaps warm / human love was too much for the US box office? Even the humor was so lame. Whatever happened to everything about the Smiths and that brilliant jargon they used all the time? What kind of line is "Will it take long? I don't want to lose Baywatch". Even programs for small children can come with better material than that.
