So many people shot Platoon and Born On the Fourth of July among others, calling them "leftist propaganda films". Now it's my turn to make a political shooting in a movie. For me this film is very impressive on certain religious beliefs and on its political opinions. <br /> <br /> Acting and writing were a little cliché for my taste. Mel Gibson seems to like playing in these useless violent films and proves it once again by collaborating with his partner Randall Wallace for another. In this whole movie there was this prototype garbage "Tell my family that I love them" or "Tell Ronny to pray before going to bed". It was so overburdened with these lines of waste reconstruction that I felt I had to vomit. How about that scene where Gibson's wife goes to do laundry and this "no color" applies to what to put in the washing machine. It was in the mid-sixties that she was blocked by a rock that did not notice the racism that surrounded her. Another scene is that Gibson's daughter asks him what war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter. <br /> <br /> The director showed everything perfectly. The countless scenes of Gibson and his family or praying soldiers. I'm fine to prove it once or twice, but after a while I wonder if the movie is trying to get something in my head. How many scenes with the American flag at its best were shot with melodramatic music. The director also seems to have won a sort of victory in Vietnam. What exactly won them. Cinematography was the worst, with slow-moving scenes that see the American flag in distant scenes scattered everywhere. I love America but movies like this seem to enhance every little thing we do. <br /> <br /> This may seem like a rambling and maybe it is but I can't stand it when a film like this makes people who are not religious not so patriotic that they will agree with whatever their country has a ugly. This film is narrow and limited to me in so many ways. For me he says that if you are not a Christian you are wrong. Does God or Jesus want people to kill? I don't think so. For me this film was offensive. In the beginning this film was fun with the countless clichés and overcrowded scenes, but then when I looked at what he was trying to say or not about this movie, it was really frustrating to watch it. I think it's my fault that I chose to watch this movie. I hope no one takes this comment in an offensive way because I'm not criticizing religion or patriotism, but some of the narrow-minded people who are so in both and who clash anyone else. <br /> <br /> If you want a real representation of the Vietnam War Watch Platoon, Born July 4, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter or The Killing Fields. Even Full Metal Jacket, which I absolutely hated, was a better representation. I read a quote that, in context, states that a true patriot disagrees with everything the government or the country does, but questions it when it is wrong. A true patriot loves their country too much to see him do bad things.
