Opening with a movie clearly reused by "Kit for Cat", "Tweety's S.O.S." fails to live up to that classic cartoon. Instead, we get an example from the series of Tweety and Sylvester by Friz Freleng in its most generic form. Unlike the Road Runner series by Chuck Jones, who tried to introduce new jokes to the same scenario, the Freleng series seemed happy enough to recycle the lines as long as the characters were in a different place. 'Tweety's S.O.S.', therefore, basically equivalent to "this time let's put them on a boat". It is not a completely weak cardboard. There are some good jokes about mostly grandma's glasses, but they are overtaken by the gags you can see reaching a mile (the seasickness routine) and everything is built on another one of the final ones in which someone other than Tweety says "I tawt I taw a putty tat", a joke that worked well once but has diminishing returns. "Tweety's S.O.S." will probably appeal to children who love virtually any cartoon, but for big kids like me who are looking for more of the same tired gags it's definitely to be avoided.
