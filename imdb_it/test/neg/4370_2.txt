One day I thought to myself ... what's the worst thing that could happen today? I answered myself with a simple, "Oh, it's already happened. I rented Killjoy / Killjoy 2" on DVD. Well, what is there to say? The budget was not big enough to rent a police uniform, the film cuts out sex scenes and death scenes. There is a funny phrase that I can remember, and acting is much worse than the first. It seems that there are no lights on the "set" (the woods somewhere) and the clown killer known as Killjoy (which makes Leprechaun seem like the Exorcist) is not spectacular at all. This time, it's not played by Angel Vargas and has completely changed as a character from a mad irritating clown to a different kind of mad irritating clown who says "BABY" a lot. Somewhere between Freddy Krueger and a blade of grass ... lies this version of Killjoy. Somewhere between a pile of earth and a pile of s, lies Killjoy 2. Evil is underestimated. This film has no ransom, except the song at the end of the credits ... which offers some fun at leas. Killjoy 2 is not even a film, but also an exercise in tension. Killjoy 1 is at least good enough to be considered the worst movie I've ever seen. MINOR SPOILER ######### Let me describe one of the scenes of supernatural killings. A girl is locked up in a wooden hut (maybe an outbuilding?) When Killjoy peeks through a hole. He has small, chatty teeth (like the ones you can buy at Spencer's Gifts) and does something with them (maybe he wraps them?!). Then he holds them in his hands and says a terrible line (which can't be written on IMDB). From what I have gathered from this scene (not from what is shown in the film) the teeth went into the outer toilet and killed the girl in an interesting but inexpressible way, and then returned to Killjoy. If I were in those teeth, I would have run. Run away from Killjoy so he can never get his hands on me again. Killjoy 2 is hopefully the last Killjoy that we will have to endure. Even if fans of other films would say they are very bad, I think this "movie" could unify the human race and create world peace if it were promised that this film and everything that reminds us of it would be destroyed. I give it 2/10 - simply because the creators managed to get the images moving.
