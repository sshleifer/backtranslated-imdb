First of all, I am critical of this film because I had really high hopes and instead, this film sucked. <br /> <br /> * possible spoilers * (if you haven't seen the TV series) Where to start? ? Well, let's start with quality. The film was barely better than the original TV series and the two combat scenes were very well done. However the CGI was horrible. <br /> <br /> Then there are the holes in the plot and the questions that still remain after the whole movie has been said and done. This film does not close as a positive conclusion for a very large universe known as FMA and returns only to expand the universe more before leaving us with nothing but our imagination to decipher what would happen in the future. <br /> <br /> And then there's the biggest blame in history. Addition of WWII and Hitler ... WHY ?? The series was perfect ... and he didn't need Hitler. He didn't even need Germany. <br /> <br /> In general, the whole movie was tightening in what could have been a real FMA movie and, if I was the director, I would have cut CoS to pieces and made a new one, plus "end", end.
