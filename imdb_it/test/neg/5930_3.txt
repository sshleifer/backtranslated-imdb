This film was OK, as far as movies are concerned. It could have been made as a crossover in secular films. However, it had little to do with the Left Behind books on which it was supposed to be based. The main premises of the story have been removed and new important premises have been added. <br /> <br /> What disappointed me most was the way Nicolae was played. It was shown with supernatural powers that he did not have in the books at this point. The antichrist is not Satan, he is not omniscient and not omnipotent. <br /> <br /> Faith and beliefs were portrayed in strange and surreal ways that seemed to make the movie simply silly. <br /> <br /> Non-believers who watch this will have more ammunition to mock Christian beliefs.
