"Blame it on Rio" is a 80's romantic comedy, with more than one eye full of sex during its 101 minutes of execution. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns two middle-aged men in crisis, one of whom is sorting through his divorce, the other deals with the possibility of that same perspective. Both good friends, they decide to take a vacation in the former Rio de Janeiro, each with a daughter by their side. Complications occur when one of them is involved in the other's daughter. <br /> <br /> This potential riot of a story is quite fun and there are some good jokes, but it never becomes fun, as it might have. Even any attempt to seriously handle the moral issue does not work, and perhaps director Donen should have remained faithful to the humor of the situation. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, but what really spoils is Michelle Johnson's horrible performance as the naughty little temptress Jennifer. While he uses his body to full advantage, it's the only thing he has. Michelle's acting ability leaves much to be desired. No wonder we haven't seen it in anything else. <br /> <br /> Friday, 7 January 1994 - Video
