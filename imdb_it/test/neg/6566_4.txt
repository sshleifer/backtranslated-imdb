I don't think I can add much more to what has already been said about this film. However, I can offer a small memory of seeing ST-V in the theater. In the last (terrible) scene, as the camera detaches from the field and it seems likely that the credits will start spinning at any time, the audience seems to get up in unison. Normally, for a film like this, at least some fans have been watching until the final disclaimer. As people exposed, I remember hearing ridiculous and cheerful jokes, just low murmurs. <br /> <br /> I remember reading a film review in the local newspaper where the critic said it was so bad that only Trek fans would like. What an idiot. The fans were the best suited to take it off first! <br /> <br /> Worst favorite scene: target shooting on a Voyager space probe, through a periscope no less! Space must be a much smaller border than we thought.
