A ridiculous film, a terrible editing job, the worst script, a ridiculous acting, a completely incomprehensible story ... <br /> <br /> If God decided whether the films should continue to be made, judging by this the entire global film industry would have died ... <br /> <br /> A wonderful film to show that cinema should not be made by people who "think" they can make films. <br /> <br /> I still wonder who those two gypsy girls have been in the film for over half an hour and we are never presented ... <br /> <br />
