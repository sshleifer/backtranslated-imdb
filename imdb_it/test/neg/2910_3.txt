After the Japanese attack of World War II on US forces at Pearl Harbor, "The Eastside Kids": Leo Gorcey (as Muggs), Bobby Jordan (as Danny Connors), Huntz Hall (as Glimpy), David Gorcey (as Peewee) , Ernest Morrison (as Scruno) and Bobby Stone (as Skinny) want to serve their country. But both the US military and the Navy reject them as young people. Still wanting to "throw down about a million Japs", the "boys" attack an Asian employee, who turns out to be Chinese. The unfortunate incident, however, causes the gang to help discover some really disgusting Japanese and Germans. <br /> <br /> If "too young" is defined as "under twenty-one", only Mr. Jordan and Mr Stone would have been rejected for military service. But it is possible that the recruiters have been turned off by the office manners shown by Mr. Gorcey and Mr. Hall. "Let's be tough!" it was created during what the script accurately describes as "open season on Japs" - for this and other reasons, it hasn't aged well. It is a useless effort, but the regulars behave well, with Tom Brown moving the plot along, like Jordan's spy brother. <br /> <br /> *** Let's Get Hard! (05/29/42) Wallace Fox ~ Leo Gorcey, Bobby Jordan, Tom Brown
