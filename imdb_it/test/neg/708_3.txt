This movie was hard for me to watch. Stan looked very old and sick compared to what I remembered, and Ollie was heavier than I remembered in another movie. The most difficult thing, however, were the gaps in the script / production in which I found myself asking myself: "How did they get from here to there ???" It took almost half of the film before I could face the dubbing of non-American actors - this too was a distraction. <br /> <br /> Although I miss great actors like Laurel and Hardy - will there ever be great actors like those of the old studio age ??? - this film helps me to understand why the actors sometimes "bow" in their best moment.
