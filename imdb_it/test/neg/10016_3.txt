Many people are standing in front of the house and some women are crying ... Men who are in tight groups and speak in low voices ... a couple of guys come in and are discussing how sexy the daughter looks today ... soon you will know that someone at home is dead ... The wife of the deceased is worried about preparing food for so many people, her friend sitting next to her gives the idea of ​​simplifying things by preparing simple roti sabji ... One the son of deceased is talking to someone on the cell phone, the daughter is busy with makeup ... her mother suggests her to wear salwar kameej, but the daughter is more interested in looking good when so many people will visit their home and therefore prefer jeans and a t-shirt over salwar kameez ... another son asks his mother to finish all the kriyas and also tells her that he shouldn't expect to come from the office soon ... So the camera slowly focuses on the dead person ... the white cloth covering the face is shifted slightly due to the wind, revealing the face ... His Anupam Kher ... suddenly the alarm rings and rises from the bed ... Is it his dream or a flashback? U won't get an answer until the end of the movie ... Well, this is the comedy by wat for director Dibakar Banerjee !!!!! Later you discover that this scene has nothing to do with the real movie and therefore makes it all obvious that the film described above was a dream. Is it a film comedy? Well, it should belong to that category ... But it really doesn't! there is nothing that can be associated remotely with comedy in the film !!! More over the director gives the message that nobody will get justice from the police !!! so everyone has to cheat the tricks !!!! or forget justice !!!! The music of Bapi-Tutul and Dhruv Dhalla is fine ... There is not much to say about other areas ... The evil script destroys everything ... not even Anupam Kher's performance can make it at least a vase of paisa. ..
