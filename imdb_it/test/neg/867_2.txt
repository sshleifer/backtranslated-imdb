Mom starts at night in the middle of nowhere, in what looks like a wooden building in the desert. A pick-up pulls up and an angry father brings out the slutty daughter Virginia Monroe (Claudia Christian) and leaves her there, but she's not alone, while the dark figure of Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) watches her from a short distance. Virginia tries to have a conversation but as she cuts a cigarette under her leopard print, high heels and high heels, Nestor grabs her by the throat and drags her away into the darkness. Nestor then breaks it, turns into a monster and begins to eat its entrails. Virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer who has Lieutenant Carlo Hendrix (Art Evans) and the baffled LAPD, or at least that's the message that a local television journalist named Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas MIller) is telling his viewers . Clay lives happily with his pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough) and then his mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) has a free room that he decides to rent for the dark "blind" sunglasses that Nestor wears. Unfortunately for Emily she accidentally wipes out Nestor's sunglasses which reveal that she has strange colored eyes, Nestor turns into a monster and bites Emily turning her into a flesh-eating monster just like him. Nestor takes Emily to train her, they find a homeless tramp (Rory VanSaint), kill him and eat his guts, but Emily Clay's son has witnessed everything and has to choose between doing what's right and his love for his mother who now happens to be a grotesque bloodsucking and carnivorous monster! <br /> <br /> Edited, written and directed by Patrick Rand, I thought mum was a pretty horrible film. Looking at some of the other comments on the announcement of IMDb and the genre that has been given, it seems that many seem to think that the mother is a comic horror. Well, now I can tell you that I didn't see any comic elements in mom because there aren't any, unless they are very thin. The only thing I can deduce is that people see the comedy in the current situation that the mother presents, that of being an old lady turning into a meat-eating monster and the predictable problems and emotional anguish that it causes to her son that he discovers. There are no jokes (apart from naming a prostitute from Beverly Hills (Stella Stevens)), crap humor or anything even remotely funny in the film itself and, as far as I could see, it is played completely straight for all the 90 minutes of running. So, since there's no comedy in mom, this means there's a lot of horror right? Wrong, mom sucks and is painfully slow to look especially after the first thirty odd minutes that consist of Nestor turning into a monster a couple of times, biting Emily, showing her how to look for food and Clay finding out. Up to this moment the mother was moving at a fairly decent pace, she had some special OK make-up effects and she had interested me, unfortunately the mother runs for another hour which is basically the emotional shit suffered by Emily's Son, the eventual breakup of the his marriage and he being torn between love for his mother and the fact that she is a monster eats meat. This part of the film is incredibly slow, boring and dull as flat water, even if it has the courage to resort to a scenario of reversal of roles where Clay tells his mother to go to his room and stay there closing the door behind self, telling her no and putting the bars over her window so she can't escape her room. Mom's script totally ignores the origins of the monsters and asks us to accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should, no matter how silly an explanation may be, I think some background for the monster would help. Technically mom is insipid and inexpensive, although I can't say she's badly made, it's very mediocre stuff with nothing that impresses particularly or something I could tease to pass the time with. The special effects of make-up on the monster are OK, but they are used in very fast flashes, they flash and you will miss them. Don't be fooled by any fancy video box like me, the monster is only three times maximum and everyone is in the first thirty minutes. There is not much blood, a severed arm, a short eating bowel, a burned body and a drill in someone's arm is all we get. Acting is fine, but, please, Mr. Brion James, what is this hint of doubt? At least James had the sense to know that he was crap and had reasonably decided to be killed at the beginning of the proceedings, all the others did not expect the black lieutenant who was also a black police officer in Fright Night (1985), but yes Can you Recognize it from Die Hard 2 (1990), did you create Mom & Die Hard 2 in the same year?! Talk about the opposite ends of the spectrum! Overall there is nothing with which I can really recommend mom as a horror film and it is certainly not a comedy for me. Very poor, very disappointing and once again I was fooled by imaginative video-box works with lots of photos of attractive-looking monsters. Definitely one to avoid.
