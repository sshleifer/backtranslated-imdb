I know my summary looks very tough, but this film has a very limited appeal. The average Joe out there would have had difficulty attacking this movie. The entire film is composed of animated recorders that do their work and dance on mobile registers. All this is done with bright and artistic colors and the film could be fantastic to show to customers in an art museum. However, unless you really love this kind of art or you are a Canadian who loves movies on your homeland, then probably this will be almost impossible to finish. I have a pretty high tolerance for this kind of thing and even I had to force myself to look after a couple of minutes. I can respect the work done, but it is not convincing.
