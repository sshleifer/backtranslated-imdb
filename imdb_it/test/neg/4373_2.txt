Police officers Logan Alexander and Debbie Rochon escort five young black delinquents and find themselves stuck in their sticks when their van breaks. After a deadly clash with a white trash quack with a rifle (played by the director), the survivors take refuge in the house of a blind voodoo priestess. One of the guys uselessly uses a spell to call Killjoy, who finally shows up halfway through this boredom in a subdued and bigger make-up job, a little fatter that seems to be slipping out of his head from a moment to other. Then he proceeds to kill the stupid characters while he spits out some of the worst one-liners he has listened to since Hee Haw was canceled. <br /> <br /> Acting "teenagers" is terrible, dialogue even worse, the FX stinks and seems much cheaper than the first movie. Although I liked it in his previous Troma movies, Trent Haaga (trying to imitate Jim Carrey here) is horrible and irrelevant to the hyperactivity that overwrites Angel Vargas in KILLJOY 1 (which at least had some stupid laugh). <br /> <br /> Yet another nail in the coffin for the Full Moon studios, whose reputation as a fun world-wide franchise has completely vanished since the days of TRANCERS / PUPPET MASTER.
