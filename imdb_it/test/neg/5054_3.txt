This absurd film was about a "Goodie-two-shoe" girl who wanted to be Valedictorian, but finds her obstacle in the name of the teacher Mrs. Tingle. Katie Holmes, who plays this "goodie-two-shoe", faces "the greatest dilemma of her teenage life" when her classmate arrives with the final exam champion who should help them nail the test of Mrs. Tingle. Ms. Tingle arrives, captures Holmes, her classmate and her best friend with the champion of her final exam. Convinced that the three have planned to cheat the exam here, Ms. Tingle is excited about the opportunity to ruin Holmes once and for all with accusations that can take away any chance for Holmes to overcome his class. And the classmate, who apparently has his eyes on Holmes, has always wondered why he never gave him the time of day (he's an idiot)? Feeling desperate, Holmes and her friends visit Mrs. Tingle in the middle of the night to try to dissuade her from believing that Holmes was planning to cheat. Everything comes into focus somehow when the classmate points a bow and an arrow at Mrs. Tingle, threatening her to do things for Holmes. Mrs. Tingle fights but eventually ends up with Holmes and her prisoner friend. <br /> <br /> During Mrs. Tingle's imprisonment under Holmes, they do everything to tie her up and gag her in her bed to blackmail her with false images that they took to the unconscious Coach in bed with Mrs. Tingle. I found myself creating when the children were taking refuge in Mrs. Tingle's house, devouring food and going to do her private work. At one point, Holmes found Ms. Tingle's graduation book and purposely changed the vote in her favor, decreasing the degree of her challenge for valedictoriano. The end took place as a childish attempt to bring back the comedy that was moderately early in the film, resolving itself with pure irony, disgust and absurdity. <br /> <br /> This must be the most unlikely and evil character that Holmes would have ever played in his entire life. I wanted to help Mrs. Tingle really get rid of digging a hole for Holmes. She was manipulative, selfish and conniving. He even slept with his classmate despite the enormous interest of his best friend for him ... and he didn't like it. From trying to ruin his ranks of challengers by taking Mrs. Tingle's grade book to take his best friend's man, you'd think Holmes would get what he deserves in the end, right? Unfortunately, he gets everything his heart desires, proving that being evil, manipulative, selfish and whining can get what you want. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Tingle had to be the character you didn't like. They didn't take me to that point once to believe that it was this woman who had to be "taught in this lesson". He was like any other strict teacher who also gave valid reasons for his resentment towards the next generation. Personally, I felt that his views on young people were validated each time by Holmes and his friend's actions. I kept hoping he could be free to call the police and nail Holmes. They kept her tied up in bed, ate her food like a bunch of pigs, drank the woman's wine, messed up her personal things, and suppose she believed she didn't deserve to take a bat for each of their heads? And the classmate must be one of the most obnoxious characters in the film's history. Forget the idiot, we need a new word for him that is not in the Webster dictionary. He brought the biggest problems in Holme's life, making things worse when he entered Mrs.Tingle's house, uninvited by Holmes, and he recorded Mrs. Tingle with a bow and an arrow. I was thrilled whenever Mrs. Tingle had a chance to slap him, or to stifle the would-be best friend. <br /> <br /> If you are a teenager out there and want to see when the manipulation of a teenager and doing what is wrong can get the world, see this film noir, caricature, caricature and unintentional.
