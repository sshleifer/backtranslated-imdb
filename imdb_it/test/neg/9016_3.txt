WARNING: SPOILERS Dear Roger, <br /> <br /> During your illustrious career, you have made a wide range of entertainment, some good, some notsogood. "Night of the Blood Beast" falls into the latter category. It's not as terribly terrible as saying "The 10,000-leagues ghost" or, perhaps, "The Dunwich Horror". However, one of my biggest criticisms of this film is that I could have done it faster, better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the preface and the titles. Roger, the rocket sequences seem like something from Disney's "Man Into Space", not so good, of course. The futuristic missile resembles nothing in contemporary 1958. Why didn't you just use a Vanguard, Atlas or even Viking vanguard? Better yet, why not dispense entirely with the launch and start with a shot of space and the capsule floating in it? This is what I would have done for you, Roger. Second, why did the spaceship crash on its return? Even a middle school physics student could have told you, your astronaut would have arrived on earth in more crunchy and widely boned. I would have shown that your astronaut was "possessed" by the monster (perhaps using that big "negative / positive" stuff you used in "War of the satellites"), losing contact with the earth and landing in the desert. This would also explain how "blood beast" could impregnate your astronaut during the tremendous heat of re-entry, but it will still be destroyed by fire. Even with these nonsense. The first half of your movie is pretty good. If I had spent some money with decent music, it would have been as good as a mediocre episode of "Outer Limits". But, once again, your writer describes Ed Nelson as the designer of the landing system, so he gives him some stupid dialogue about magnetism. The biggest problem of the second part of "Night of the Blood Beast" is Michael Emmet. He is as terrible as the doomed astronaut. You should have fired him on the spot and replaced him with Ed Nelson. You could have combined Nelson's responsibilities with those of John Dunlap and saved the cost of an actor. I don't know if you actually paid one of these people; but, at least, you would have saved the cost of catering for three meals a day. I had also abandoned the "burned parrot" costume and spent the extra money using the trick to make the astronaut the "blood beast". Maybe it was a little too close to "The Creeping Unknown" for you, but it would have helped the pace of the second time immensely. if you're going to have a "blood beast", wouldn't it be a good idea to show some blood? Yes, I know the title comes from the embryos in the astronaut's blood, but Kowalski could have done a MUCH better job for you if he poured some chocolate syrup around. After all, it looks like black and white blood. What did it cost you, maybe two dollars? I would have also used some close-ups. For some reason the tasteless dialogue and bad acting don't seem so bad in close-ups. Watch the 70s TV series and see what I mean. Oh, in closing, Roger, a note for your writer. It is not possible to use a fluoroscope to show some poor schmuck full of alien embryos when it HAS NO ELECTRICITY. Remember, did you fry the generator in the first reel? Oh, and I almost forgot. Roger, can't you afford a fake knife? You know, the kind in which the blade enters the handle. I had one when I was 9, which is also the year in which the "Night of the Beast of Blood" was made. It costs maybe another couple of dollars. I think I knew enough to make you a better movie. I KNOW I know enough about it now. So, Roger, if you decide to do "Night of the Blood Beast", or if you're looking for a writer / director who works with you on ANY OTHER PROJECT, I'm your man. I will work cheaply, because I would really like to make a movie for you, Roger. <br /> <br /> I give "Night of the Blood Beast" to "3". SPECIAL NOTE: If you like watching kitsch movies like "Night of the Blood Beast", the DVD I bought for $ 3.99 was of excellent quality. You can also get "Night of the Blood Beast" along with many other awful horror / scifi movies in places like Bestbuy for about $ 6.
