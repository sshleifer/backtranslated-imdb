Being a fan of bad movies, I was thrilled to find a package of cr @ ppy horror on Best Buy today. The set was cheap and included a terrible movie called "The Dark" that I remember seeing in the theater. <br /> <br /> The remaining 2 were equally bad. "Creatures from the Abyss" is probably the worst in the group. Since they were all bad he is not saying much. But his stupidity, bad acting, terrible effects and delayed plot have made this game very fun to watch. I was rolling on the floor with each new development of the plot. The discovery of the abandoned ship, the missing crew, the knowledge that there was something terribly wrong !!! It was great !!! Of course, everyone's favorite scene seems to be the sex scene. OMG!! I almost lost it !!! Between this and the "monster cam", I must say that I really enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of bad movies so I had fun, but in all honesty, I had to give the movie a 1. WAS FANTASTIC ... But if the garbage is your bag, at least rent it. .. (YES the word game BAD was intentional)
