This well-intentioned film falls a little short, and unfortunately in too many areas. <br /> <br /> The scenery is gorgeous, with views of north-central Vermont that provide the setting for this mid-century story. Quebec Bill tries to return to his past as a whiskey to save his farm. <br /> <br /> Going back and forth between scenes of magical realism and direct actions, this film rarely reaches its peak. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson as Qu√©bec Bill looks pretty crazy, or are his lines; or his cross of Yankee and Quebecist accents. However, it simply looks like a header. His dialogues with Gary Farmer's Coville character shine, though. William Sanderson's Rat Kinneson is solid. Charlie McDermott shows real potential as a young Wild Bill; but his part is not big enough to carry a scene and never steals it. Luis Guzman shows up on Lake Memphramagog (with a beautiful performance by actor of Lake Willoughby) as a monk with a boyish accent and hood: who knows? And then there's Cordelia di Bujold: an oracle like her namesake, channeling Yoda while intoning lines like "You'll marry a Quebec woman!"?!? Too strange and far from enigmatic enough. <br /> <br /> The end becomes really unstable. Again a bad mix of magical and concrete realism. And Yoda never gives an answer that we can understand.
