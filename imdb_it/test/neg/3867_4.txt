Well ... there were some fantastic creamy facial shots of Marlene, along with her "shocking" gender parade dress (in addition to her "transmogrification" from ape to the human being not to be missed); but, in general, the generally unconvincing plot and the dated acting - not to mention the less engaging melodies that flowed from Miss Dietrich's "baritone" voice - were not good for ensuring Blonde Venus a permanent position in the Pantheon my mind. Cary Grant - still at the dawn of cinematographic childhood - seemed as if he had always tried to "find himself again", while Herbert Marshall was probably never MA Herbert Marshall from the day he was born, until the day of his death. Of course, from a historical point of view, Blonde Venus was fun to watch, as long as you were able to set aside ... "high expectations".
