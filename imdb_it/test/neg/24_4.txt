"Bloody Birthday" is a low-budget, strange and sometimes funny horror film, similar to "Mikey" or a less intelligent version of "The Good Son". <br /> <br /> Set in a small Californian city, three children are born at the height of an eclipse, where planetary alignment means that they are somehow born without emotions. Ten years later, our three little psychopaths commit suicide, taking out their parents, siblings, teachers and anyone else who irritates them. Only a girl knows the truth to stop them. There are no explanations as to why children from all over the world born at the same time are not so twisted but are there! <br /> <br /> For a slasher film, it is very domesticated in terms of violence and I suppose you highlight the problem of launching childish characters as murderers, since there is only so much that you can expose young actors. Instead, it is fun and a little creepy to see three ten-year-old children plot murder and carry out their plans using guns, knives and crossbows. The main reason he doesn't get ridiculous is because the child actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they cleverly play the little innocents in front of prying adults while they show their dark side to the girl who knows the truth. <br /> <br /> The "Bloody Birthday" is pretty mediocre like a horror movie, with few scare and little blood, but since it has the shock factor of having children as murderers, it's a bit unique in that way. One to see if there's nothing else.
