Sorry, folks, but all of you who say this is a great documentary ... and that prize won at Sundance ... well, you've all been deceived. I heard for a few years how I had to see this documentary and finally I saw it. Maybe in 1999, when it came out, and the TV reality didn't have such a dominant presence in the industry, this movie would have seemed fun. But Mike and Mark are obviously playing themselves, Mike and Mark. Sometimes they are funny and some of the lines seem wrong, but mostly they don't sound real. I'm the reality version of Jay and Silent Bob. Yes, people are real, they're not actors, but it's staged, it's an exaggeration of themselves, and it's so obvious that it's hard to believe that so many people think it's the real deal. I wasn't fooled so it was really a bit boring. Slightly funny, but I don't miss it much if you miss it.
