In this film, we are invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who is not likeable at the beginning. So what's the point of making the film? To prove that it would have been better not to have had IN COLD BLOOD - a book that I admire, incidentally - for keeping the integrity of our hero intact? Almost. He behaves at the party at the beginning of the film in exactly the same way that he behaves after his triumphant reading of the book, so his degradation is a matter of degree. Should we worry enough about Capote to take his claim seriously that he and the murderer Perry Smith are kindred spirits, with the first one who had all the breaks while the second one didn't? Mr. Capote's fear didn't touch me at all, I'm afraid, so if that was the central idea that was wasted on me. But even if I could understand why the filmmakers visited this useless project, the awkward plot would have bored me again. Hoffman gives a performance without emotional effects, while Keener and Cooper are so fascinating and interesting that I was wishing for more than them. Grim beyond imagination.
