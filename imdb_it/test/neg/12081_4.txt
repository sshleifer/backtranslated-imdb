"Hardbodies 2" is harmless, with no purpose and less plot. I would add "without mind" to that list, but the expedient of the film in a film, although it has not been done very well, helps to dispel the label a little. The scenery has changed from the beaches of California to the Greek islands, and the only cast members returning from the first film are Sorrells Pickard (the bearded) and Roberta Collins (who at one point falls into a mud, bringing back memories of her classic catfight with Pam Grier in "The Big Doll House"). All the other actors are new, but apparently Brad Zutaut should play the same character (Scotty) as Grant Cramer in "Hardbodies". This sequel is devoid of the energy and charm of the first film, and does not come close to it in the "hotness" department. Obviously Brenda Bakke and Fabiana Udenio are both very nice, but Teal Roberts' team - Cindy Silver - Kristi Somers is unbeatable. "Hardbodies 2" is not the worst of the genre in any way, but if you want to see only one of these films, the original is the one to get. (* 1/2)
