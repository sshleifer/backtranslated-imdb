Of all the screen adaptations of E.R.Burroughs that Doug McClure starred in the 70s, this is the most elegant of all. It's so elegant, you can savor the dust of the sets and feel the heath of the lamps at the top. This sounds like a very, very large budget school game, or, in effect, a very low budget action film that it actually is. On many occasions it has been said that this was the last of the genre voices, and I hope it was. The genus did not die peacefully, but in horrible agony, among a lot of smoke, fake blood and bad sound effects. Peter Cushing must have heard him again, a mad professor whose shirt remains snow-white after gentlemen have crawled through the slimy holes of the underworld. What a sport it was to accept a part in this mess and bring it so bravely. <br /> <br /> Shot entirely on a sound stage and accompanied by the soundtrack of the then trendy, now unbearable synthesizer, the main anti-attraction of this film are the cartoon monsters. Yes, there are always monsters like this in a Burroughs adaptation, but they rarely manage to be so completely ridiculous, helpless or lacking any credibility. On some occasions, during the high action fighting scenes in which Mr. McClure heroically attacks creatures, you can almost hear the hollow and empty sound as his head beats against the side of a triplodactocryptosaurus. Fortunately, animals explode and go up in flames the moment they stumble and fall. In fact, there is a great deal of unmotivated explosions that the film (and genre) draw towards the end. And the beautiful Miss Munroe loses her evil accent. <br /> <br /> The triple bill, currently on the market, presents this film plus two others: The Land That Time Forgot and The War Lords Of Atlantis. The first two are pretty strong, especially the first one, with a lot of money invested and occasionally even fascinating script turns. Don't expect any of these qualities from this movie. You get drunk with friends and shamelessly laugh at what you see. After all, even the producers have not been ashamed.
