Eugene O'Neill is hailed by some as the leading American playwright, but for things like The Iceman Cometh, Long Day's Journey Into Night, The Emperor Jones. Strange Interlude was an experiment he invented where the characters on the stage look to the audience and say what they think and then resume the conversation. It was a nine-hour production with a break for dinner on Broadway, so you can safely assume that he was sacrificed a lot here. <br /> <br /> For the screen the voice concerning thoughts is used for all characters. It is probably a more suitable technique for the screen. Sir Laurence Olivier did very well in his version of Hamlet. But Bill Shakespeare gave Olivier a much better story than what O'Neill gave his players in this case. <br /> <br /> Players such as Clark Gable, Norma Shearer, Ralph Morgan, May Robson, etc. Most of their films are much more animated than Strange Interlude. The story takes place over 20 years. Norma Shearer is a young woman whose intent is killed in the First World War. Start playing a little, although that part isn't shown in this version. He meets Alexander Kirkland and his friend Clark Gable. He also has a perennial suitor, Ralph Morgan, a friend of his father's Henry B. Walthall. <br /> <br /> He marries Kirkland, but is then warned by his mother May Robson and has shown that madness gallops in that family to mention another literary work. Since Kirkland wants children and Shearer and Robson think the Kirkland train will slip on the track if it doesn't get one, Gable is recruited for breeding purposes. Obviously you can see all the complications that this can cause and O'Neill explores them all. <br /> <br /> Gable is so terribly discontented in an O'Neill production, but he was an emerging player at MGM and did what he was told. Shearer does what he can to raise a very sad story, but at first it seems defeated. The best in the film is probably Robson who puts a little bite into his dialogue. <br /> <br /> Strange Interlude filmed for 426 shows on Broadway in 1928-1929 and starred with Glenn Anders and Lynn Fontanne in the parts of Gable and Shearer. Perhaps no one could really save the film because two years earlier, Groucho Marx had ridiculed the material in Animal Crackers. After seeing what he did, I don't think the film in public took him too seriously. <br /> <br /> And since it's not O'Neill's best, neither am I.
