As she goes out in search of water, a young psychic woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney) comes across something else. He discovers a trunk that has been buried for centuries on his aunt's ranch. Instead of the treasure his aunt hopes for, the trunk contains the head of Gideon Drew, a devil worshiper beheaded by Sir Francis Drake. By telepathically checking the hired hand that opened the chest, does Drew's head unleash in a murderous madness in search of the rest of his body? also buried on Jessica's aunt's farm. While Jessica is certain that she feels the presence of evil, can she put an end to Drew's plans and be in time to prevent it from becoming intact? <br /> <br /> I thought I was quite familiar with most of Universal's horror output before 1960, but this is a Universal movie from the 1950s that certainly isn't mentioned. While The Thing That Could Not Die is not what I would call a "good" movie, it has some things to do. First of all, the film has some interesting ideas and is actually rather ambitious. Director Will Cowan, both fortunately and intentionally, is able to give the film a nice atmosphere from time to time. And the special effects involving the head are certainly disturbing. But the whole project is canceled by acting. I'm shocked to learn that none of the alleged "actors" in this thing ever appeared in anything else. You would think this was a "well done" type of film for most of those involved. Kearney is the worst offense. It's horrible. Also, The Thing That Could Not Die may have been a bit too ambitious for his sake. Given the budget and other limitations, the film could not have aspired to its highest ideas. Finally, the film ends rather abruptly. Just like things are starting to get interesting, The End. What is it?
