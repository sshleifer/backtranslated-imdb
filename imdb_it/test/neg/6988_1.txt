I've seen and watched this film since it started playing about an hour ago, and I have to say, it's an hour of my life that I've lost and I'm not coming back, Acting is crap and screenplays need a serious look , and whoever wrote them must be slapped, maybe the TV will explode and it will get me out of my misery ..... The only good thing about this movie is that for boys and girls it has a bit of good taste, even if most of which I would like to disappear, with regards to the film, the special effects like sh * t, Dante? those who think that a boy dressed in tight leather pants and a half leather jacket is scary, looks more feminine than most women in this film, Dante's voice is pathetic, nobody finds it scary or frightening. Please, TV, please blow up !!!!!!!!!!
