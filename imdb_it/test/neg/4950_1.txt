I don't know why this got decent reviews as it could be the weakest horror comedy I've ever seen. Englund is only for a cameo and his performance is as useless as most attempts at jokes (and scares). The management is terrible and the acting is worse. It seems that every year the producers are trying to create another Evil Dead but these weak non-original attempts are simply treading on the memory of a true classic horror. <br /> <br /> If its directors say "this is not a remake but it is a return to the past of the 80s (which in my opinion is not original - Hatchet) or people trying to connect this with other classics of horror, it is still misleading and will not compensate for the lack of scares, horror, comedies or even a decent movie for this. <br /> <br /> AVOID ALL COSTS !!!
