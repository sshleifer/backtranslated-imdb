Coach Preachy or Straight Sappy. It's bad writing combined with even worse acting. You can choose to drink the Gatorade of this special after school, but I didn't, not even on the 20th philosophy of Toby Robbins / Islander, a motivational moment. It's too seductive to be fun and not significant enough to be informative. I have respect for the coach and the program of which this film is inspired, but the move itself is horrible. As someone who played rugby for almost 20 years in the United States, I had hoped for a better rugby movie (even one that has something to do with rugby). And I can tell you that the Haka played by a group of Haoles and Islanders is not intimidating (just like when it's played today by the All Blacks, guys really, everyone has seen it, it's time to put it aside). If you want real intimidation, get in line in front of a group of South Africans (the real inmates of rugby who watch their eyes). This is a fake and poorly made film about being a genuine and good person.
