I saw this cartoon accidentally on television one night when I couldn't sleep. It didn't help at all. I found myself staring at the ceiling, trying to forget that face. I could easily never see this cardboard again, simply because of that face. <br /> <br /> Now, don't get me wrong - I love fairy tales and nursery rhymes as much as anyone else. But this twisted and terrifying version is simply disturbing. It is above all the cruel laughter and exaggerated characteristics that terrify me, and I still have nightmares because of that. Please, I urge you not to let your children see it. It's far, FAR too scary. Please, keep it away.
