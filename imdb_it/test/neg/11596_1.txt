Thus, Wynorski redoed Curse of the Komodo a second time, this time replacing the interesting characters of the original with a group of hideous environmentalists / anticapitalists. And adds a Cobra. Most of the film is spent listening to the hypocritical characters chattering about the evil capitalist piglets, while at the turn of this patronizing ride there are flashbacks of what happened on the island before they got there. DNA experiments have been conducted, critters have started to grow, people have talked to each other without coming up as morally superior jerks, etc. Needless to say, it would have been a much better film if they had made the film's flashbacks and forgotten about the best bigots. To forget it, there are a few short scenes scattered here and there where the holiest one has chosen one by one, but they probably include less than 2% of the film. The main event that brings together our title characters against each other takes about a minute and is as exciting as watching the previews for the latest Dino-Crisis video game. <br /> <br /> Acting is rather bad overall, even for this type of film. Half of the actors seem to be more interested in pronouncing each syllable of each word than to speak their dialogue in any credible way. <br /> <br /> Actually I did everything until the end, but it is one of those films that I would like to have recorded and then seen later, because there are many parts that need to be forwarded quickly. Overall, I give this effort to a star, it has absolutely none of the elements that make a B-movie fun to watch. It's really a sad day when you can honestly say that the creators of this movie could have learned one or two things by looking at Boa and Python.
