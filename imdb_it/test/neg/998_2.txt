Starting with a tear-jerking poem and images of American missiles, starving children and mutilated Palestinians, I quickly realized that it would not be an objective documentary. 5 young men convicted after the clashes in Gothenburg were interviewed and gave a very confusing explanation of why they had to wipe out the city center and then (oh my god) they actually paid for what they did. I kept watching and many questions were raised, was the process done correctly and the agents have the right to do what they did? A lot of questions asked ... and then dropped. No interviews with judges or ongoing documents on the trial ... nothing. <br /> <br /> In short: nothing new from what every Swede has seen on TV hundreds of times - just poor propaganda.
