This film was pathetically terrible. The sound was terrible, the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating. If you have a life, don't see this movie, because you want to kill yourself. This movie completely rips Blade (which is undoubtedly a really nice movie ... or trilogy I should say). <br /> <br /> I don't care who the actors are, this movie is just awful. I watched 10 minutes and I had to come to my computer to comment on how absolutely ugly this movie is. I really don't know why my family is still watching him ... oh wait, yes I do. They laugh almost relentlessly for stupid action, dialogue and acting.
