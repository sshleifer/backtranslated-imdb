This film was in a box set with another 20, of variable quality, and I can safely say that this title was right at the bottom of the heap. <br /> <br /> It makes no sense to go through the plot, what was there, identifying what was wrong, why I don't have all day and life is too short, which reminds me, I just lost about 85 minutes of mine looking at this tripe. <br /> <br /> The acting was fiendishly evil in a way that made it fun, even if only, while comical elements like the two idiot cops must have made all Laurel & Hardy fans moan. One of the few funny moments was when the main character made a joke about her former plastic friends T * ts, which would have been okay if I didn't have to watch them while they were moving on the screen. <Br /> <br /> The least I can give is one, and probably deserves it for having Heather Thomas, since she was definitely sexy and shapely, even though her acting was as bad as everyone else.
