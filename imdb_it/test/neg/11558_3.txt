this was done in that beloved age known as the 80s and filmed in my hometown of New York City. actually, this has become one of my favorite science fiction films. Oh, of course, it really stinks to hell, but there's so much to tease, laugh and have fun that becomes more tolerable after each viewing. <br /> <br /> For example: <br /> <br /> Try to find the similarities between this and ... well, OK, there's nothing as bad as this. Well, except FuManchu Castle. <br /> <br /> Sock-shaped puppets can be dangerous to your health <br /> <br /> Create supense by describing through the voice rather than showing any image <br /> <br /> Having the "Valeria" viciousness (beautifully interpreted by Angelika Jager) offers some of the most exciting lines ever! <br /> <br /> Many men and women in post apocalyptic fashion (also known as leather bikinis, linen cloths and dead animal fur) <br /> <br /> Be horrified in the end! <br /> <br /> I left to get a salad. Toodles !!
