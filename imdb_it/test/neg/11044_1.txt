This film was one of the longest movies that have seen the experiences of my life. While I like how the director, Chan-wook Park, managed the revenge, the move as a whole was TERRIBLE. Oldboy has a billing of only 1 hour and 55 minutes, but it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. I will say that the English dubbing was done very well and the film was easily understood. I heard that some scenes were unnecessarily long and many dialogues were repeated. Also, if you have an aversion to annoying voices, avoid hearing about Hye-jeong Kang (she plays Mi-do). If you are looking for a movie to kill time and make yourself feel morally superior to others, then look ahead. If you don't want to watch a movie full of incest, bad dialogues, unnecessary fight scenes, coarse torture scenes and confusing flashbacks, then this isn't the movie for you.
