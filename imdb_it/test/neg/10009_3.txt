Cage plays a drunk and gets a critical praise. Elizabeth Shue She actually has to make a love seen with the most attractive and overrated piece of dung in Hollywood. I literally vomited while watching this movie. Obviously I had the flu, but that doesn't mean that this movie didn't contribute to vomiting in kamode. <br /> <br /> Because Nick Cage can't play something that can really pull off like a bad actor. Nick Cage who is brilliant in his role as a bad actor. No one can do it better. <br /> <br /> The search begins with Nick's contract with Lucifer or it was Lou Cipher of "Night Train To Terror".
