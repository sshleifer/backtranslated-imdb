BLOOD CORRIDERS <br /> <br /> Proportions: 1.66: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (black and white) <br /> <br /> London , 1840: While attempting to formulate an anesthetic solution, a dedicated surgeon (Boris Karloff) becomes addicted to narcotics and is blackmailed by local bodysnatchers. <br /> <br /> Riding the tails of a Gothic revival occasioned by the recent success of Hammer's THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1957), Robert Day's CORRIDOR OF BLOOD is a strange mixture of historical dramas and theatrical performances by Grand Guignol. Producer Richard Gordon drew Karloff away from Hollywood - where his film career had gotten stuck in a track of B movies (VOODOO ISLAND, FRANKENSTEIN 1970, etc.) - for a couple of scary shockers in which good men are hampered by circumstances outside their control. In GRIP OF THE STRANGLER (1958), he played a novelist who comes across a horrible secret while searching for a series of murders in recent history, while in CORRIDORS OF BLOOD, he is a drug addict who falls prey to a gang of criminals from the publisher of East End pub Francis de Wolff. Minus a horror film that a melodrama from the ghoulish clippings, the film hides its commercial bets by including a number of bloody shivers (a affected leg, a face destroyed by acid, etc.), but the narrative is mainly motivated by the Karloff's altruistic pursuit of an anesthetic formula that will alleviate the terrible suffering of patients during surgery. <br /> <br /> Produced under the title "The Doctor from Seven Dials", the finished film was unpublished until 1962 due to the indifference of the MGM distributors, at that time, the co-star Christopher Lee had obtained an important film recognition, despite playing a small but significant role as "Resurrection Joe", a sinister Cockney thug who kills carefully selected clients of de Wolff's sleazy pub and sells the remains to local doctors. Lee filmed this glorified cameo before THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN catapulted him towards international celebrity, which explains his limited time on the screen, even though his intense performance is one of the highlights of the film. Adrienne Corri (VAMPIRE CIRCUS) stands out as de Wolff's accomplice in crime, and there is a feast of familiar faces in secondary roles, including Francis Matthews (DRACULA: PRINCE OF OSTEZZA), Betta St. John (THE CITY OF DEAD), Finlay Currie and Nigel Green. Superb art direction (by Anthony Masters) and cinematography (Geoffrey Faithful).
