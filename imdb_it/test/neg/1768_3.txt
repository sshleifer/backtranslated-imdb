An unfortunate sf / horror adventure that takes itself too seriously, memorable only for (a) the beautiful Mathilda May who wanders naked through chaos and (b) terrible distractions. It has some slightly macabre effects and surprising moments, and some unintentionally funny scenes, but it's mostly a waste of time.
