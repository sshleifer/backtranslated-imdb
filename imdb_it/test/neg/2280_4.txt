This is the first recorded effort to put the sound into a film, and the oldest that is obviously still in existence. This historic film is the opening segment of the "More Treasures Of The Archives" DVD. <br /> <br /> It's just a 15-second clip of a man playing a violin in front of a huge recording cylinder. Next to him are two men dancing. Towards the end, another man walks on stage. William Dickson, the director of this experiment, is the violinist. This "film" has had several titles over the years, but the sound experiment was not a real success. It took more than 30 years from this point to synchronize the view and the sound to the point where something could be released to the public for entertainment. However, this was a start, no matter how primitive it came out. <br /> <br /> For more technical information and the history of this process, see the other review here of "Boba Fett1138".
