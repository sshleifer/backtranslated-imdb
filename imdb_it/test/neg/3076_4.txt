What an uninteresting insect-mixture. It may have been something more but no imagination seems to have entered the script or direction. A man is framed for murder by his wife and lover. The conspirators do a fairly complete job of making him look guilty. But the man (Richard Thomas), whose psychiatric records reveal him as "stable" and "unimaginative", manages to escape from prison, beat him in the conspirator's beach house and secretly record a conversation between them revealing his guilt. Then he accidentally leaves the recorder with all the evidence on it in the sea water, but manages to recover it. Show a lot of creativity and improvisation skills for a boy without imagination, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> The tape is now damaged, but it is enough to bring down the wife's lover and he sobs his confession. Bad people are punished. Good people are saved. <br /> <br /> Location shooting is impressive. The beach house is nothing but a wooden exterior thrown on the ground of the Fort Fisher Battlefield on the Cape Fear peninsula. The house was demolished immediately after production. <br /> <br /> It's a nice place. Unfortunately, it's a little hard to see because someone seems to have shot every scene through a pair of tights stretched over the camera lens. It's all very confusing. And for all the natural splendor of the position, the viewer never gets a real sense of the place, of how the sand feels, of the texture of the gray bark on the scrubby evergreens. <br /> <br /> Acting is ok but artists don't have much to work with. The best interpretation, as often happens, is given by Dick Olsen as a squalid but not unpleasant defense lawyer. Virginia Madsen radiates infidelity with every beat of her eyelashes. Ted McGinley is in his range as a weak immoral. <br /> <br /> The musical score neatly mixes the disturbing with the mysterious and is effective. If you want to hear the original, from which he was robbed, rent "Vertigo" by Hitchcock and listen to Bernard Hermann's suspense theme. <br /> <br /> I can't think of any particular reason to capture it except for total boredom
