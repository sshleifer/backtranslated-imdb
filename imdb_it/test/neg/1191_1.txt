I'm right in thinking that I went to see the same movie as everyone else ... this film was terrible. I am a fan of all 3 gentelmen league series and have always respected the originality of the writers, even when the format changed in the 3 series. However this film was a blatant half effort, the plot was extremely poor having the characters entering the real world made this film more like the last action hero. There were about 5 moments in the film that caused a slight chuckle but the rest of the time I wanted would end. This would have been better as a 10 minute short film on the DVD .. it was more of an explanation of what they were going to do, and it seemed that some of the writers disagreed about the fate of the characters and made a joke of killing him in first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> If you are a true fan of the gentlemen series, you can hate this movie. If you look at it only because there is nothing better on TV, then you will love it. <br /> <br /> someone supports me !!
