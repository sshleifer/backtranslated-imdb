Every time I see a movie like this, I get sick in my stomach. When I watch a movie I like to see what I see in everyday life. While crossing my day I see blacks, whites, Asians, Latins, etc. How do you make a film and don't even think about the possibility that other ethnic groups will pass you by? I'm sure they didn't do it on purpose, but they pay attention. I don't care if it takes place in Kansas or Central South. All I saw was a black mark. This was typical in the 1980s. Hey! is 2007, with all the rappers, singers and athletes working as actors, Thomas Haden Church could have paid more attention to his cast. Shouldn't actors be more liberal?
