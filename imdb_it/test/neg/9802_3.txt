Since I was finishing the book, Mrs. Dalloway 'by Virginia Woolf, I was happy to see that it was on one of the channels of the film last weekend. What I have encountered, however, is a boring, incomprehensible and senseless film. You can't totally blame the movie, it tried the best it could with the material it had, but when the starting material is Virginia Woolf, and it's almost entirely written in stream-of-conscience style with long periods of internalization and a small real dialogue, one would surely think that there should not be a movie made from it just because a movie can be made from it. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave, who plays the title character, does not deserve any blame for the failure of this film, nor for any of the other actors. It is simply a film that cannot be intelligently created by the story that Woolfe wrote, and should not even be attempted. Don't watch the movie, read the book. <br /> <br /> --Shelly
