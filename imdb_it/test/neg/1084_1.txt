I'll say it again ... one of the worst movies ever made and it was made by the director who made one of my favorite films, "Excalibur". I was surprised to see that he got a grade above six. This movie sucks. It looked terrible. Looks like they were shot in 18 days and Boorman must have slept when he directed this. Arquette did nothing. Simply terrible, rotten, unbearable and probably the only flaw in Boorman's celebrated career. <br /> <br /> 1/10 !!!!!
