This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The plot revolves around a man named Luther who wears metal prostheses, bites people on the neck, and walks around clucking like a chicken without flapping his arms. He also thinks it's a chicken. <br /> <br /> Sounds strange, doesn't it? Well, for me, the person is more bizarre and strange, the better. More gore, better and so on. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the commission deciding whether they want to release this maniac from their institution. They say he created some prostheses in prison that he used to bite people on the neck. He also laughs like a chicken and THINK he is a chicken. <br /> <br /> If I had a patient like this, I could never have released him. <br /> <br /> First, Luther goes to the supermarket and attacks an old woman on a bench and leaves. Then, he sneaks onto the back seat of a woman's car and she drives to her house. <br /> <br /> While at home, Luther ties the woman to the bed. When the woman's daughter and her daughter's boyfriend return home, Luther hides. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, a policeman arrives at the front door and asks about his mother. You can clearly see that her daughter is frightened by her mind and cries but the officer keeps asking if everything is okay. She replies that all is well. The officer eventually gets into the car and leaves. If I saw a woman crying constantly and being afraid, I would at least want to enter the house to investigate a little. <br /> <br /> Even the ending is stupid. As the woman enters the barn, she starts fooling and gets Luther excited, so she starts walking, waving her arms and making a noise like a maniac. Finally she shoots him and sits for a minute before pulling out a little more. <br /> <br /> Then roll the headlines. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most STUPIDEST movies I've ever seen! Nothing happens at the woman's home! ANYTHING! <br /> <br /> Sometimes I like movies on the field, but this really bores me. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Good idea, bad direction!
