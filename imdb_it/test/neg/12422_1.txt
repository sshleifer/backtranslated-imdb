The legendary pop star Steve Alaimo ("Don't let the sun take you to tears") plays an unlikely series car driver whose career hit the skids (ha ha) because he constantly crashes into his car (or how he complains , "I" I'm tired of being run over by every fat monkey who gets behind the wheel ".) He falls into a nasty crowd of spiritually inept Nazi motorcyclists, unlikely named Jeeter, Banjo, Fats and, uh, Linda. nicer than the group, took a surfboard at the back of the skull and now communicates only through grunts, a sort of Harley Davidson Leatherface. <br /> <br /> However, Steve is tricked by the police to capture the vile criminals in the middle of one of their bank robberies.The gang only steals the banks for "kicks, man." I guess they give money to charity. Steve constantly fails, motorcyclists get fatter, and it never comes that way bold because it is co yes boring. This film seems to have been filmed with a paper towel soaked in grease. Not since "Necromantic" has a film so trampled on my soul. <br /> <br /> The boy who plays Fats has continued to direct "Deranged", Ed Gein's biopic with Robert Blossom. <br /> <br /> In any case, in summary: Wild Ribelli: Hilarious on MST3K, terrible everywhere.
