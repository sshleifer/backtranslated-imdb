The only saving factor of this film was the fact that it was on TV for free, and that it probably helped the Romanian economy. In addition to this, Hallmark must re-evaluate this division of their empire, and perhaps keep their films more oriented towards bizarre love affairs between cancer-stricken hemophiliacs in Mississippi. Going into details about how unreasonable this film is would make it merit to be memorable. It wasn't. I remember the act of looking at him, there being some vampires (some of them teenagers) and some bad dubbing. Anyone who has worked on the dubbing track of this film must be transferred to another sector of the company ... perhaps the catering service, for the deaf. If you have the opportunity, watch this movie, just because it makes so many other really negative films worthy of an Oscar appear in retrospect. Then again, if you actually finished with the profile of this movie, I guess it might be too late ...
