Imagine a wild remake of The Defiant One with a black girl and a white girl attached to each other. Set the story on a Caribbean island where drug dealers reign and the revolution has arrived. And having the black woman come from the stable of the ladies of Huggy Bear and the white woman be a watered down Patty Hearst and you have Black Mama, White Mama. <br /> <br /> In those waning days of the drive-in theater this object must have been a great success. All the hot buttons of the seventies are pushed into this. Although they both better fill their clothes and get some whistles from the males in the audience, no one will ever confuse Pam Grier and Margaret Markov with Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis. All right, Halle Berry and Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> Margaret and Pam are prisoners where the guards and the guardian look lascivious to the new fish that arrives. Margaret is a wealthy girl of the state who has embarked on the "revolution", while Pam is your high-priced base girl who is serving the local drug boss and she's tired of it and tried to leave the island. <br /> <br /> Margaret's revolutionary comrades are silent about the bus that transports them from the women's prison to the city, but they are lost in the escape. Both have their different programs, but like Sid and Tony they can't agree on who is the first order of the day. It makes some interesting moments when the police, drug dealers and revolutionaries look for all these two friends in the chain. <br /> <br /> Just so you have no misconceptions at the head of the revolutionaries and Markov's kanoodling partner is named Ernesto, played by Filipino actor Zaldy Zshornack. The entire casino was filmed in the Philippines, where its film industry was starting. <br /> <br /> Beautiful photography of locations in the Philippines is all that Black Mama, White Mam has to recommend. But if you are a fan of bad tricks of exploiting black, this is one for you.
