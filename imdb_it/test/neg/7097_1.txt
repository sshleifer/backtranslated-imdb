This is a funny movie. I suggest you rent it, buy a couple of liters of rum and invite the entire crew for this. My favorite parts were.1. the shootings that were so well choreographed that John Woo himself was jealous, .2. The wonderful special effects .3. the Oscar-winning acting and .4. The fact that every single gangsta in the movie seemed to make a bad imitation of "Scarface". I mean, Master P like a Cuban godfather! This is a revolutionary territory. And with well-written dialogues that include lines like "the only difference between you and me Rico, I'm alive and dead", this film is truly a masterpiece. Yeah, for sure.
