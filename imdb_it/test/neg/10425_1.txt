"Wired" should be considered one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen. Writing and directing show an extraordinary lack of imagination and I am sure that most actors continue to shudder whenever someone mentions this film. <br /> <br /> It does not even work as a tribute to Belushi's unique talent, or as an accurate account of his short life. <br /> <br /> A useless mess without saving features.
