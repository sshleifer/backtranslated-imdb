Political messages are generally made on television, so if you are a big fan of environmental correctness, look at the content of your heart. Most people go to the movies to be entertained, not sold some crazy political nonsense. The hook here is the cast of the big name. Unfortunately the sum of the performances is equivalent to a whole film that has not gone anywhere at all. The two best performances, Chris Cooper and Richard Dreyfus, have a minimum screen duration. In short, "Silver City" is to be avoided as entertainment. It is nothing more than a non-documentary, a political exponent exponent of illegal immigration, pollution and any number of other causes that do not belong to anyone except on the small screen. - MERK
