I watched this movie only because I had the impression that I would be treated to a cheese horror movie. I mean, look at the coupon: "They are upside down men! And worse ... they are still alive!" Do you scream cheesy horror movie? And then there's the title itself - "Screamers". What a perfect title for a horror movie, I thought! Unfortunately, I was not aware of the fact that the real title was, correctly translated, "The Fish Island". <br /> <br /> So, about an hour after seeing this, I realized that it wasn't a cheese horror movie anyway - it was an approximate "adventure" story about slimy fish-men of Atlantis. "Inverted men"? No. There was nothing like that. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Damn you, misleading tricks! I want back those 81 minutes of my life!
