My wife and I watched this movie because we plan to visit Sicily and Stromboli soon. Fortunately (or unfortunately) the landscape and the seascape (complete with tuna) are the only credible members of this cast. We were expecting a well written and well acted movie, but we were disappointed. His only redeeming grace is an extended and remarkable fishing sequence full of authenticity: thundering tuna, nets, wooden boats with long oars and passionate fishermen, if superstitious. <br /> <br /> The sequencing of the film is seasoned, its dialogue stilted, and the acting goes from rigid to completely "over-the-top". A scene in which Bergman points out how his macho, native and naive husband, his ferret on an "innocent" (but apparently already deceased) rabbit would be perfect for a Monty Python skit. <br /> <br /> When the volcano blew hoping for a merciful end to suffering (ours and the casts). Unfortunately, the film continues to flutter, eventually staggering to a melodramatic and absurd ending. Unless you are really interested in tuna fishing in the old days, pass this effort.
