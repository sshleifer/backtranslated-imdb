Who's thinking about the store here? How could a producer / manager / director of the network let a member of the group attack the most fake plastic palms in the history of cinema in the sands of a Canadian winter beach and try to involve him like the tropics? Those trees were for real palm trees what a pink K-Mart Christmas tree is a real fir tree. And who let Dermot Mulroney go in front of the camera with painted gray hair that wouldn't have passed the rally in a school play? And none of the genes who did quality control on this thing think of correcting the (excellent) Canadian actor when he said gaz instead of gas? All those involved in this slug of a "film" - writer, director, actor - have not only done a good but brilliant job elsewhere. I walk too fast between events and mortally slow inside of them, devoid of any emotion except the obvious, the expositive and the artificial - perhaps this seems only one of the worst Lifetime films because of all the Red Carpet hype with which it was presented. And I say this as someone who loves life. What do you give, people? <br /> <br /> All this said, the work of a certain actress in a certain critical turn in the film (and if you've seen it you'll know exactly what I'm talking about) was so brilliant that the film would have gotten a 10 from me if that was the whole movie. Unfortunately it was only about five seconds.
