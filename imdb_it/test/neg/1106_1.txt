I generally love this type of film. However, this time I found myself wanting to kick the screen. Since I can't do it, I'll just complain. This was absolutely idiotic. The things that happen with dead children are very beautiful, but real people are absolute idiots. I am a grown man, rather large, and I can defend myself well. However, I wouldn't do half the stuff the little girl does in this movie. Furthermore, the mother in this film is reckless with her children, to the point of being neglected. I would not be so angry with her and her actions because otherwise I would have enjoyed the movie. What number was, take my advice and advance quickly through everything you see them do until the end. Furthermore, there is someone else who gets tired of watching movies that have been so obscure movies. More, it is difficult to see what is being filmed. As a public, we are impossibly involved with on-screen actions. So why the hell can't we have a night vision?
