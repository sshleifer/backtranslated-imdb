Ugh. Unfortunately this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. None of the characters are sympathetic remotely, which makes this movie difficult to watch. They are all in their thirties who do not take responsibility for their poor lives. I managed to get past the half hour of the film, so there's a chance that things will improve later, but I doubt it. I can't imagine five addicted people like them being able to remain friends with each other for ten years. <br /> <br /> Also three sex scenes in the first half hour were disappointing, since they had no relevance to the plot, and were clearly a free (failed) attempt to bring some life into this film otherwise boring. <br /> <br /> Save your time and money, and skip this movie.
