Horrible writing, directing and acting! The writer / director has portrayed the southerners, particularly the law enforcement agencies of the South as ignorant, backwoods, homophobic and racist (a very popular but ignorant stereotype that the film industry loves to perpetuate). Acting (or exaggerated) and writing turned out to be amateur and with a limited budget. The plot is the same old Hollywood story of mediocre racist and homophobic rednecks who are ultimately defeated by the enlightened "Newwww Yoke Ceety". <br /> <br /> I grew up in the small town of Louisiana where this film was shot and could not wait to see the film, but was immediately disappointed during the first minutes of the film. The beginning of the film depicts a gay bar located in the "swamps" of Louisiana. What a ridiculous concept! There are a lot of gay and gay bars in southern Louisiana, but there are no gay bars in the "swamps" or small towns of Louisiana. Then we are introduced to the sheriff who uses the phrases "homuh-sex'l" in the worst drawl of the south and performances that have never been exaggerated. Then there is the scene where the local police are watching porn at the police station. I could go on to the incredible performance of the genre or stale stereotypes or ridiculous scenes. <br /> <br /> This director and his crew were welcomed into this small friendly town and showed true southern hospitality. The citizens of Lake Arthur and the state of Louisiana had to be insulted and degraded in the final assembly. The good people of Lake Arthur were excited and in love with the fact that "Hollywood" was in the city without knowing that in the end they would be portrayed as ignorant, racist and homophobic louts in a low-cost amateur movie directed to the DVD. My advice: skip this or watch it on Cinemax late at night if it ever turns around.
