The third and final big screen of the popular ITV sitcom of the early 1970s, HOLIDAY ON THE BUSES is just as strong and coarse as the previous two efforts, and looking from a point of view of three and a half decades later, it's really upsetting that only one film has been produced in this franchise. <br /> <br /> What constitutes the plot surrounds the adventures of Stan Butler (Reg Varney), its director Jack (Bob Grant) and their carefully autocratic Inspector Blake (Stephen Lewis) after the layoffs from their regular jobs at the bus depot. They all find work in similar positions in a vacation camp with Stan's family (Doris Hare, Anna Karen, Michael Robbins) that he follows with him. <br /> <br /> British cinema enjoyed a deserved and considerable high quality reputation in the 1960s, but much of it was due to the financial support and American guidelines that unfortunately ended with the rise of 70's. Subsequently, well-known national titles (GET CARTER is among these very few exc has become as rare as Mick Jagger in a stable marriage, and UK cinema has taken the road of economic budgets, squalid and witty sexual comedies (the CONFESSIONS series, AS PLAY WITH ME) and flaccid and elongated versions of various television programs, mostly sitcoms (this is one of many horrible examples). Only DY'S ARMY and PORRIDGE came out quite respectably in this sense, the bizarre success of the first ON THE movie BUSES (it was the biggest box office hit of his year in 1971, absurd to think now!) Led to two more sequels. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the TV series itself had a cheerful, mature vulgarity , not PC that was reasonably tolerable in the form of a half-hour sitcom, but extended up to three times that length, patience beyond imagination.It is ironic that HAMMER FILMS has produced this effort as a practice. it resembles a horror film in the literal sense, with ancient puns, banal, poor foolishness and terrible, squalid production values. <br /> <br /> A chance to send the cheesine ss of the British holiday camp is completely wasted here in favor of the above elements, and it is more bizarre, if not gruesome, to see the obvious 50-year-old Varney the beak-beaked, long-toothed beak Grant that manages to immediately enchant young women in their twenties, while constantly laughing at their bravado and limping jokes. The presence of Wilfrid Brambell (of STEPTOE AND SON) who makes love with the elderly Miss Hare does not even help things, and even if the film lasts about 1 and a half hour, it drags on to an interminably depressing degree. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this was the last film in this trilogy of film tragedies, and the TV series ended in the same period, with a sequel (DO NOT DRINK THE WATER, which was brutally critically injured and ignored by the public) after 1975. Most of the main actors involved were not seen much later, but the most affected was Bob Grant. Faced with depression and other mental problems for many years, he committed suicide in 2003. A sad tail to a sitcom that was the most popular of his era (it hasn't aged too well), and should have stayed that way, rather than the three highly successful economically but artistically desperate hybrids who have diluted happy memories and the occasional merits of its TV counterpart. <br /> <br /> RATING: 2 and a half out of 10.
