During this film, I kept thinking why did they ever do this as a "documentary", but not include the actual footage of the people who were interviewed? Of course, it would have been like any other documentary, but it would have been up to the directors to find the meaning of the film to be delivered. <br /> <br /> Using a series of well-known movie stars (many of whom apparently asked to be there) to portray "real" people gave me the feeling that there was a predetermined message to deliver, and the director he was so intent that real people could not be trusted as well as actors and tried scenes were used. (Yes, I know this was also a comedy, but a documentary should be a documentary.) I really found myself discouraged by the various stars, and I waited for one of them to leave the character for a moment and say "I'm a good person because I'm in this. "<br /> <br /> This movie could have had a much more powerful social comment if it was more objective or we saw Matthew Shepard and his killers as people rather than symbols. (The very superior "Boys Do not Cry" had an adamant view of those involved - good and bad.) Instead, The Laramie Project gives an almost unstoppable conference that someone's sexuality should be accepted regardless, and little else.
