This film was so ugly that it looked like a movie of origin. In one scene, the camera tilts very slowly and gradually downward, then returns to position. The sound is crackling and occasionally dims again. In another scene, the camera man is barely visible in a mirror. <br /> <br /> Then the scene came with instructions on how to knock down a curtain ... which, believe me, has been going on for years and was completely irrelevant to the plot. Most of the scenes dragged on with conversations that were not entirely relevant. In my opinion these were just to fill the film and make it longer. Even with these added scenes it was very short. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing was the severed head, which seemed quite realistic.
