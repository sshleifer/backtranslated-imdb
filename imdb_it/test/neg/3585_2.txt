Egads. <br /> <br /> I used to think that Keannu Reeves was the worst Hollywood actor. I'm not sure anymore, Willy offers Keannu strong competition with his performance "I'm made of chalk" in this film. Combine this with the fact that there is almost no plot, and not a single nice character, and it is quite difficult to recommend this turkey. <br /> <br /> Natasha does her best, but even Julia Roberts failed to save this film from the darkness. <br /> <br /> Avoid it unless it is really late and there is nothing else. - Oh hell, in that case, just read a book.
