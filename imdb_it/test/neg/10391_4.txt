A girl named Isobel becomes possessed by a demon. The local priest (who previously went out with Isobel's sister) must try to save her, but the biggest problems concern the family's suspicions rather than the demon in their daughter. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Ethan Wiley, the writer of "House" and the writer / director of "House II". I loved the first film and I liked the second one even more, so you would think it would be a success. Alas, this seems to have been thrown together by first-year film students. Dawson Leery could have done better. I thought of blaming the new writer Ellary Eddy, especially since the idea is not original (are they trying to cash in on "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" fans?), But Wiley should have been able to do his magic. br /> <br /> Also, you'd like to think that veteran horror stars Jeffrey Combs and James Russo would help this movie. Russo (who plays the bishop) barely shows up, and Combs has a great sheriff role ... for the five minutes he's on the screen (but I love the mustache). So, no help here. <br /> <br /> After seeing "The Exorcist", all other exorcism films must be compared to the default classic, right? And demonic possession in this film was not at all scary. Absence of head-spinning or paranormal activity. Just a girl with a deep voice and a trick that runs off. All the "demonic" stuff centered on the father who accused everyone of sleeping with his wife. As another reviewer wrote, "you have a lot of Isobel bouncing on her bed as if it were a trampoline, hidden in her closet, and jumping off a barn. Yes, it's Chuck E. Cheese gone crazy." This sadly sums up the scope of "evil" in this film. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie about family members who make accusations and shout at each other while their daughter is in another room, this is the movie for you. But if you don't mind me saying that, you have a horrible taste in the movie if that's what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to focus on the father who accuses a cowboy of sleeping with his wife (who did not, but slept with his daughter) and of the veterinarian who slept with his wife (who could, but deny ). And then you have a gardener who attacks the girl possessed with a crucifix and tells the family to call an exorcist, but once the priest arrives, the gardener declares he doesn't believe in God. What was the Bible quote you were doing five minutes does? <br /> <br /> A film of horrible exorcism. Horrible examples of what Combs and Russo can do. And such a sad presentation of the director after the film series "House" has become classic. I would like to pretend that Wiley did not take part in making this film ashamedly derived and not original, uninspired. The power of Christ forces you to avoid this film as if seeing it was a capital sin.
