"Opposing Force [1986]" was not as good as "Dr. Strangelove" and was not as good as "The Bridge on the River Kwai". Hell, it wasn't even as good as "GI Jane", which is pretty sad. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a basic ethical problem: in a simulated situation of prisoners of war, how far can you go before you start breaking the law? What exactly is the law in such a situation? How can you simulate someone's torture without torturing someone? Can you intentionally inflict pain? How about breaking bones? Fake executions? Sexual abuse? Severe blood loss? Real cannons with bullets? Death? Somewhere there is a really confusing line that divides "acceptable" from "atrocious". <br /> <br /> Now, what could you do if you were in such a training program and the lines between simulation and reality start to fade? What could you do? This film attempts to describe this dilemma. I found it interesting to see the types of tactics used in "resistance training". I have a brother who went through the USAF POW training program. According to him, he was technically quite close to the brand. <br /> <br /> The film has a pretty good premise, but it doesn't have a particularly beautiful story. I was wondering if it could be based on some real event, but it became evident that it wasn't when the explosions started. They must have changed writers three-quarters in the film, because it takes a real extreme turn and turns into a somewhat useless shooter with many distracting explosions. <br /> <br /> I found it to have a rather unsatisfactory ending; again, a bit useless. I wondered what was the point of the whole thing - I'm beginning to suspect that there simply wasn't one. It could have been much better with just a little more history with the fireworks.
