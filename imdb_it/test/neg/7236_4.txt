This is the sequel to Octopus. <br /> <br /> Pff ... OK. Lots of archive material, but pretty good. I'm surprised they actually had a giant robot octopus that really didn't look that bad! I was actually quite surprised by this. <br /> <br /> The film overall was simply fun. He never explained how the octopus has become so large, and is not connected to the first one. But it was still fun. <br /> <br /> The ending of me and my friend laughed. In practice, after blowing up the octopus, the two main characters throw a bomb and five explosions, most of the videos, appear on the screen! We joked that they went to the dollar store and bought a "five missiles in one toy"! Believe me, you have to see it believe it! Overall just a stupid fun. It is worth giving a chance, to buy if it is cheap.
