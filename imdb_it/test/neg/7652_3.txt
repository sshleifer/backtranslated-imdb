Very disturbing, but cleverly crafted and scripted and intelligently directed with a good eye for colors and details. Mary Beth Hurt, Sandy Dennis and especially Randy Quaid are unusually good. The story centers on a boy (Bryan Madorsky) wondering where all the leftovers they eat every night come from. The strange behavior of his parents (Hurt, Quaid) causes the school psychiatrist (Dennis) to get involved. It's a creepy cannibal movie. But it's not bad. If you like Hannibal, you'll like it. If you don't like parents, stay away from the movie. Only tips for Cannibal Lover and Haters. <br /> <br /> R rating for themes for strong adults and graphic violence.
