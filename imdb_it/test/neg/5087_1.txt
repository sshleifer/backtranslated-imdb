Apart from the beautiful images thanks to New Zealand filmmaker Alun Bollinger, this film is not worthy of being seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is so fragmented and lost that it is difficult to know what is happening at any given time, and just when you think you will follow, the management changes again, like a lost bipolar puppy dog. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is horrible, based too much on extremely emotional pieces that try to force the audience to feel a certain way, as if the instruments acted like a tail sheet of emotions ?? 'feel sad here'; 'feeling shocked here'; 'feel scared here'. Furthermore, the repetitive samples used repeatedly leave the audience on the verge of laughing. <br /> <br /> Are the days of the silent film over, where the musical instruments were the only portrait of the voice ?? but you wouldn't think of it while watching River Queen. <br /> <br /> The voiceover was so overused that one must wonder if this film really needed accompanying images. It could easily have been a radio game even though even then it would have been difficult to follow the plot. <br /> <br /> And the ideas stolen by Jane Campion on The Piano are too obvious not to be seen. Not only are the shots on the beach and in the forest almost identical to those in The Piano? perhaps some of this is due to Alun Bollinger's work on the latter? but also the out-of-field feeling and the levels are surprisingly close. And who could forget when the character of Holly Hunter has wings cut, in the shape of her index finger cut by Sam Neill. Do you remember when Wiremu amputated his "trigger" and surprisingly even with an ax? I thought so. <br /> <br /> All in all I can't recommend this film for viewing, unless you wear some headphones and you just think about the scenario.
