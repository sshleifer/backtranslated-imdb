Corny and some really bad acting, but for a Golan-Globus movie that talks just like it. I saw this movie in 1985 mainly because I liked sword and witchcraft movies (what was I thinking?). Arnold plays the role of a great gentleman who tries to make sure that an ancient talisman is destroyed before the world explodes. Film producers love to launch the kind of Playboy women who can't perform in low budget films. Brigitte is the master of Sony and Arnold in wood like Lord Kalidor. There is also Sandahl Bergman (who was in Conan's original film as Valeria) here plays the evil Regina Gedren, an obvious field to his role as Conan. And then one of the most irritating child actors on the screen (ernie reyes) in the role of Prince Tarn who should have been slapped and sent to bed. What an irritating little laugh. Some of the sword fights are not bad but the music really sucks. The special effects are cheap and seem very 70s, like the explosion of the evil queen's castle at the height of the film. <br /> <br /> Overall a very low film, but movie fans might like it for its campiness.
