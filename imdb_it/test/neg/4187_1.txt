Well, you make me fall sideways. I have not seen a movie at home so badly since 13 or abysmal SECONDS or HALF CASTE. Someone should take this guy's Sony Handycam! This film shows that just because you can shoot a movie on the camcorder for $ 20, it doesn't necessarily mean you should. <br /> <br /> I remember that one of the things that Robert Rodriguez wrote in his book, "Rebel Without a Crew" was that when you decided to do a function without a budget, you have to use all the assets you have available. . Rodriguez says you should make an inventory of all the places and props you can beg, steal and borrow from your friends. Robert Rodriquez was a friend of the mayor of some Mexican city, so the mayor allowed him to shoot anywhere for free. What you got in EL MARIACHI was a film that seemed to cost much more than the real budget. <br /> <br /> I am sure the director of this film has a copy of that book, and he has taken it to heart. In this case, he was apparently a friend of a boy who owned a cornfield where they built a haunted house every year. It looks like a good location for a scary movie, but it's hard to keep an interesting cornfield for 90 minutes. Not a single episode of the CHILDREN OF THE CORN series spent more than a few minutes in the cornfield. Hitchcock spent only about ten minutes in one at NORTHWEST. Give a nod, man ... the cornfields are not a compelling cinema. It would have been nice if the director had had more friends with more locations, because this thing gets pretty boring after the first 15 minutes. It seems that the film cost about $ 30 (or whatever it cost in admission to the cornfield maze). Apparently he couldn't even find anyone who could act in his film, so he taught himself. Big mistake. Here's a thought, if you really want to make a movie, get an actor. So, as far as assets are concerned, it seems that the cornfield labyrinth is the only thing the poor boy has had. Maybe he thought it was enough. In fact, I'll go out on a branch and say that I thought it was enough because the film, before capturing the coveted honor of being the sequel to DARK HARVEST, was simply called THE MAIZE: THE MOVIE. Perhaps he is already designing THE MAIZE: THE MUSICAL or even THE MAIZE: THE MINI-SERIES. <br /> <br /> Our Jack-Of-All-Trades (and yes, the Master of Nothing part of that saying is certainly appropriate here) plays a psychic father who knows when bad things will happen. Think of the character from the DEAD ZONE, but not near an actor like Christopher Walken or even Anthony Michael Hall. The psychic dad has the premonition that his two daughters, who are in the corn maze with mom, will be killed. He rushes to save them. From that moment on, the whole film went on to watch Pyschic Dad rush into a cornfield, looking for his two daughters. Find the two little ghosts of THE SHINING girls, and help solve the mystery of their murder. <br /> <br /> Shot on a $ 200 Handycam. The director is self-taught. Modified on iMovie. Improvised history If this is not enough to keep you away from this catastrophe of great calamity, consider this as a last warning ... THE ENTIRE FILM takes place in a field of wheat, bubbles and ghouls. Here is Ghoulie Guru's advice on how to save some money and still feel like you've seen this movie. Next time you see a cornfield, stop the car. Grab a flashlight and run in there for about 90 minutes.
