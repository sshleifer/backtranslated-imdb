This is the situation of the emperor's new clothes. Someone needs to say "This is not a funny and original film, (etc. Etc.), It's a lower film. Don't waste your money". The film is trash, and the people in it are embarrassing lower trailer. They are only too realistically themselves. They have no lines, they do not act. The American Dream is not to create poor quality films or something poor and of poor quality; it is to achieve something of quality and, therefore, of success. Only people who desperately try to praise a movie not made in Hollywood (can't have been made in Hollywood, right?) They would try to put any kind of quality on this film. It's worse than "Ed Woods", another film about a director without standards. These films should not have been made and you shouldn't go see "American Movie".
