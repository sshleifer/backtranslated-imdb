if I could evaluate it to zero I would do it, coming from someone who likes the shock / exploitation films of the time and Waters in general I must say that this is useless. <br /> <br /> It does nothing, nothing is needed, an idiot with a camera and the impulse to demonstrate his intelligence by rebelling against social standards is all this. <br /> <br /> It is completely amateur, both in principle and in execution, it makes no sense, its typing for the taste of disgusting, obscene with the intelligence of a Neanderthal man, is useless. Someone said that Waters was probably "giggling" about all the bad press and the disgust that others gave with this movie, but why? If I had made a short film that depicted a man in a bathroom taking a sh * t for ten minutes in a row he would surely have received the same accommodations, but why should I be proud or "chuckle" at this? <br /> <br /> It may be because I am so unintelligent that I have to resort to this so I can say "HA! Take that censorship and the mainstream! I'm so sick rebel do what I want and film it!" No. <br /> <br /> The waters should not be proud of this mess, water fans should not watch it, it is useless, that is without any use. <br /> <br /> It doesn't do it also fits the criteria of art for art. <br /> <br /> I like or defend this film is defending something that has been designed on purpose as an anti-culture to push for the mainstream public, in modern terms this film is the main topic of the films. <br /> <br /> Useless and obsolete. A Poser film that requires it is recognized as a rebellion.
