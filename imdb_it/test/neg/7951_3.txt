Have you ever watched a movie when, after its conclusion, your left is reflecting on what the hell it meant? Good, say hello to "Scream, Baby, Scream". It's not that the story is complex or something like that, it's just that you play in three completely different ways ... 1. A funny drug movie from the '60s ... 2. A very exaggerated soap opera ... and 3. a horror film (with little from "Scream"). To my surprise, I discovered that it was written by one of my all-time favorites, Larry Cohen. Well, I guess even the best ones have to learn through trial and error. <br /> <br /> Reproduction very similar to something from H.G. Lewis (only with fx minor), this "bad" movie has its advantages. For most of the short running time there is a nice jazz music to listen to, and there are a couple of memorable scenes ... one of those where a group of kids decide to experiment with acid and take a nice ride in motion along the zoo. The camera that the director uses to indicate that their hallucinatory state is simply delayed, but fun. Trust me when I tell you, there's no need to run out of the house to take this!
