Anatomie is not very particular in the horror genre, in fact it's not even scary. It reminds me of his American cousins, the horror slashers. It's just a copy of any other slasher horror and like a German movie it's just too American with nothing to add. <br /> <br /> Actually Anatomie is too predictable and boring, the plot is not intact and consistent. There are stupid scenes that don't even fit into a genre of horror movies. Fun sex scenes with pop music and topless women in underwear. Why do they need to have everything in one movie? They should have made a cheap German adult film. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie to anyone because it's too boring.
