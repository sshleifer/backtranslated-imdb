If any film has ever made Italians seem Italian, that's all. <br /> <br /> Duke Mitchell - what A A HOLE. Duke Mitchell, I'm on your grave. Seeing how virtually every person killed in this cowardly Mimi film is black or some other racial or ethnic minority, it is hard not to convince himself that in the end the boy owes his loyalty to the Ku Klux Klan or skinheads. Awww, but don't shoot the black kid in the elevator in the opening sequence, so it means it can't be all bad, right? MISTAKEN. Typical sentimental tripe with a flat head. <br /> <br /> While understanding why some people might be affected and even to some extent admire the audacious and totally non-PC audacity of the film (it is certainly shameful of its own odiousness and sense of self -involvement), but this does not change the fact that the main character, Mimi (and, by extension, Duke Mitchell), is an absolutely repulsive human being who does not earn a comma of empathy or interest, especially since Duke Mitchell is a BORE COMPLETE as an interpreter. But what do you expect from a guy whose main claim to fame (apart from this dog bitch in a movie) was a second choice Dean Martin impersonator?
