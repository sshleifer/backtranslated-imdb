Anyone looking at "Alien vs Predator" had to know that the conventions of the "Alien Quadrilogy" were not exactly adapted for the film. Among some of the unusual elements, the rapid growth of Aliens is apparently a matter of minutes, Aliens with extremely long tails and so on. However the idea of ​​the Predator species that provides the impulse to build cities and temples to create a hunt for warriors would be so attractive that I could not resist. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that the end of the film would be not the impetus of this sequel, and unfortunately I was wrong. For those who have forgotten how the first film ended, the dead Predator blew up an alien through the chest that carried the traits of both species. <br /> <br /> For this film, I'm going to go through a list of "good" and "bad" traits. <br /> <br /> The good: many fantastic people, especially men. <br /> <br /> The Bad: Many wonderful people are chewed by both the Predator / Alien mutant and the Predator. <br /> <br /> The Good: An interesting idea of ​​the planet Predator. <br /> <br /> The Bad: an inconsistent scale of a city. It is a small city without many opportunities, but with a very sophisticated sewer system (read: big city) and homeless. Is it a small city or a city? The police are a sheriff and three deputies, or so I counted. <br /> <br /> The Good: Um .... <br /> <br /> The Bad: Why do these mutant aliens / predators grow so fast? Within five minutes, they seem to grow to full size. I mean come on ... what are these things ... Chia Pet Aliens ??? And while we are on this subject, why is it that an alien inside the body of a predator changes, but an alien in the body of a human is not? Does this make sense? <br /> <br /> The Good: Still thinking ... <br /> <br /> The Bad: Why should only one Predator come? And because it pours acid on all the remains of the "Aliens", but decides to kill a nice vice, and then peel it and hang it upside down. I mean, so much for being incognito! <br /> <br /> The Good: Ah ... I'm stuck. I imagine there are a lot of loud sounds! <br /> <br /> The Bad: How to procreate these changed Alien / Predators? Apparently they find a pregnant woman and in a type of kiss movement, they deposit several children in the woman's body. Yes, just what you'd like to see, eh? Pregnant women who have their bodies explode into mutant aliens, as if the previous way wasn't bad enough !!! I mean, there's not even an Alien Queen. <br /> <br /> The Good: Did I mention that the guys in this movie are great? <br /> <br /> The Bad: when a bomb destroys buildings, how does a helicopter survive the explosion? And how unpleasant it is for one of the passengers to scoff at the pilot "I told you not to crash!" I mean, given the nuclear fallout, when he wakes up in the morning, he won't have any hair !!! <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think you received the message. Alien / Predator mutated burst into Predator's corpse, grow within a couple of minutes, kill all the Predators and crash into the earth. More mutant aliens / predators are created, while A MYSTERY Predator comes to earth to destroy this new mutant species. The predator kills humans. Mutant Alien / Predators kill humans. Humans kill humans. Suck in being a human in this movie, eh? <br /> <br /> If you are hit by many shots and bumps, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you liked the first one I suggest you skip this sequel.
