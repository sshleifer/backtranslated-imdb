First of all I must say that I liked the first Underworld movie. I was intrigued and curious to learn about Vampires and Lycan and so on. In this last part (hopefully) of the series I'm sorry for how pathetic vampires are. At least in the first part you had tight skin clothes ... now vampires seem to be besieged victims of a pest control problem. They look and behave like arrogant and white humans. <br /> <br /> Some ideas were clean ... everything with human nobles was interesting. Too bad the acting was abysmal. Even the slave was feasible. <br /> <br /> Other things strike me as pathetic. Spoiler now. Castle walls that can be jumped in a few steps? Enemies that don't attack during the day? Big and bad old vampires that take years to join the fight and then run away from a young lycan leader after about a minute? Werewolves approaching their enemies? Lycans breaking into the armories ... for what? They don't use axes and swords or armor! Can a vampire so inept manage to have almost everyone against him? Romanticism is so unconvincing that it is sad. <br /> <br /> So I don't recommend this movie unless you find it online or buy a cheap movie ticket. Some actions are OK for OK. Certainly vampire armor and weapons are interesting. Otherwise a very weak script that has been put together badly and uses all kinds of inane twists.
