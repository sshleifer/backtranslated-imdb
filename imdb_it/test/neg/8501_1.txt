How did this film arrive at the Berlin Festival? I understand that he entered the Panorama section, but still. <br /> <br /> This film features: <br /> <br /> 1. No plot 2. Horrible recitation. 3. Atrocious videography. 4. Some of the worst graffiti ever captured in a video. <br /> <br /> The only decisive argument that takes into account most of its acceptance for festivals is the presence of that old expectation: homosexuality. That's right, the only thing that happens in this film is that an artist scratches with another and rips it. Then he feels weird and they have a boring old break-up conversation that you might expect to hear from your first crush in middle school (with phrases like "You kissed me first, friend") Oh, and anyway, this isn't a crying game ... you see the gay angle that comes in the first ten minutes of the movie. Apart from that, mostly it's just cheap labels, undercover cops with poor costumes, some skateboards and a train ride. <br /> <br /> If the topic is interesting to anyone, I recommend looking around the web for some underground graffiti videos made by real graffiti artists. There are many out there ... and they're a lot more fun than this shit.
