From the portraits of Andy Warhol in the films I Shot Andy Warhol and Basquiat, this is the kind of film I would have imagined that Andy Warhol could do: airy, illogical, snobbish, amoral. The plot of the film (almost non-existent) which is sometimes incredibly incredible is compensated by the crude and realistic cinematography of the film. The film has a way of being unreal, but dictates reality to the viewer. The only interesting part of the film is the development of the relationship between Joe and Holly and everything in it should be seen as a characterization device. There are a couple of comic scenes that I admit are funny, but Trash is actually just a study of the characters of people who are not involved, which is slightly funny if you don't mind looking at nudity and i.v. drug use.
