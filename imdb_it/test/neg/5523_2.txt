Every year the company called Nu produces a couple of "action-packed", "full of suspense" films. This little nugget, called Shadowcaster III (Until I visited this site I wasn't stingy this is a whole trilogy), it's a great example of the good work the company is doing. Frank Zagarino is as bad as ever and does a great job as an almost skeletal android (?), Schizophrenic (??). I won't waste any more words since I don't want to reveal the terrifying plot and ruin a couple of fantastic laughs. <br /> <br /> Rated 2/10 (Revard for those hard-working Tehnicians. putting this kind of garbage together must be unsettling.)
