This is the worst movie I've seen to date. 85 minutes of terrible acting, (half of the cast seems to suffer from Asperger's syndrome) horrible wigs, strange tricks (including tidal lines around the wig areas) and more holy than those with a dialogue more holy than what makes you want to vomit. A comic aspect of this film, if you have the patience to see it, is the overwhelming number of costume changes that the unlucky cast takes from one scene to another - this film was supported by a producer of desperately ambiguous casual clothes random? Was the cast paid with clothes for their efforts? They certainly didn't deserve to pay with something else! This shocking effort of a film offers a rambling storyline in the first half, which merges into an equally irreconcilable arch Christian Biblefest in the second. The entire cast and production team should be burned at the stake, or at least crucified!
