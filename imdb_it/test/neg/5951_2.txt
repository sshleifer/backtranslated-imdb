I totally agree that the re-enactments kill what might otherwise be a great show. I have to admit I saw 1 or 2 episodes last season and it was not at all clear that it was reorganized. But when I caught an episode recently, it suddenly jumped on me and I lost interest immediately. Then I noticed the disclaimer at the beginning before an episode that followed. Someone followed the show enough to tell me, they actually did "acting" and re-edited more artificial parts on purpose, or I just didn't notice it before. I'm usually pretty good at perceiving this stuff, but the recent episode was so obviously artificial that I almost tripped over it. Now I have no interest in looking and I gave up this completely. It simply has no real value if it is all scripted and recited. And at least lately, it seems VERY badly scripted and played. The comment above which tells who cares if they are all re-enactments, I do. Without visual truth, this is just a bunch of "you know what happened this guy once". It is better to read the information in a book.
