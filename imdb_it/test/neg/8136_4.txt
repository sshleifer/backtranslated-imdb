Of course I disappeared in the movies. Neil Young's movie "Heart of Gold". <br /> <br /> There have been many great concert films over the years. The best is "The Last Waltz" by Martin Scorsese who filmed the Band's last concert at Filmore West. A phenomenal concert and a phenomenal film, that is if you love rock and roll and you feel like you were born into it and you were part of the music, and you could be in the band if you had a better guitar and someone would show you the chords and the one with a few agreements and a text or two you could change the world ... as you can imagine I felt all five of my soul of twenty-four years. <br /> <br /> Neil Young was in "The Last Waltz". They had to digitally, before the digital actually, had to manually scrape a large sticky cocaine rock that came out of his nose so in the film there is a bright light that is not the star of Bethlehem hanging over his lip and under his narice ... is a famous piece of rock and roll history. <br /> <br /> But "The Last Waltz" was released when the band and Neil and all the others were in their thirties and "Heart of Gold" was shot last year when Neil is sixty and the his band looks like they are in their late 90s and the whole movie could be used visually by the Christian right and the DEA in the same way that those Ohio State patrol movies of drunk driving hazards were used when I was in high school showing dead teenagers hanging front windows or dangling from trees or bloody in a ditch. <br /> <br /> Close your eyes and it's a terrific concert, open them and look at the hidden portrait of Dorian Gray. Case in point, the ethereally beautiful Emmylou Harris who literally came out of the darkness to sing with Neil and from the darkness to the light that appears to be a ringed spectrum completely blown off the river in front of Rivendale. Spectral, like a ghost, a nose that does not appear in nature and is not an advertisement for plastic surgery, eyes that make the buttons on the dolls look real and the ability to express any emotion, human or otherwise, forced by the illustrious indulgence against Botox. My mind faltered ... porcupine ... Peru ... Jack Daniels ... living hard for decades ... my god ... sweet Emmylou Harris whom I saw singing for free at Fred's Boulder, a face for 2000 years the dead Pharaoh would not have accepted. But the voice, as pure as a thick bottle of Boulder beer produced by the waters of Boulder Creek and I closed my eyes and heard the ammmmmbbbererrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrssss (a tribute ... you must use a tribute at least once in each film review ... to Fred's Burgers on Boulder Mall and Steve Martin's Pink Panther). <br /> <br /> It would have been a terrifying concert sitting in the dark in the Auditorium Ryman, perhaps twenty rows back. But close up, in the foreground, it was a medieval moral drama that represented the horrors of indulgence and the consequences of a sinful life. <br /> <br /> The theme of the concert, engraved on the landscape, A Prairie Wind ... the last song, massive guitars (I counted eight) and wondered if the irony was at stake. I don't think so. A native American bassist, a solo guitarist who appeared and dressed like Buffalo Bill, a pianist whose face looked like the face of the screamer in Munch's The Scream, the flea singers (actually matron singers, for the more remembering one of the lost youths of senior United flight attendants who continue to beat friendly skies) dressed in full-length dressed denim clothes ... no, it was played straight. <br /> <br /> None of them had seen, I would bet, A powerful wind. <br /> <br /> It will be a nice CD, and would be happy to tell tales of hippy dippy Boulder when Neil was a Canadian long-haired singer whose indecipherable text seemed to reflect anguish and loss, universal feelings like now. <br /> <br /> But only in a dark bar.
