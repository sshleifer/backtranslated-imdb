This is a film by Toilet Pictures. If the name of the production company is indicative of how stinky a movie is, then that would be it. I think I'm not a real fan of horror films, not that I'm a chicken, but rather only this year, I wasn't really scared of what was offered so far, both from the West and from Asia. 9:56 is not a different premise, but a poor one, based on clich√© techniques (do I think these are the only tools available on the market?) To try to arouse some moments of strong heart-pounding. <br /> <br /> If -jin (Ko So-young) is a solitary career woman, who one day notices that some apartments in the condominium in front of her, suffer blackouts simultaneously at 9.15 pm everyday. No, it's not a voyeur, but a series of unexplained deaths in the neighborhood, including one that meets itself in a subway, begins to drag it deeper and deeper into the mystery surrounding these deaths. <br /> <br /> With horror film, there is always a pseudo-logical explanation in the film about how spies occur. This is just the most interesting thing that happens in the film, the undoing of the "Truth", even if it is not going to take expert film lovers to guess the plot halfway. Which of course makes it a very unsatisfying experience watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There are a myriad of characters like the girl with a wheelchair and the neighbors who take turns taking care of her, as well as a schoolgirl, detective, a boy with mental problems and a spooky commuter of the train. But following the formula of the genre, these people are usually there as fodder for the deaths, or in this case, useless characters of red herring whose sole purpose is to mislead the public, without convictions, or add little to forward the plot. br /> <br /> And don't let me start with the techniques used here. Quick cuts, sudden appearances, long ghoul hair (ahhhhhhh, so passe!) That cannot move properly, an abundant amount of blood as if flowing down a mountain for free, and the list goes on. But the credit for the sound engineers to have created sounds of crushing bones from ear piercing whenever the ghosts move, even if it looks like a pony a trick. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this, even if you "are a horror fan. It's a complete waste of a promising premise, and in the end, you feel like you've just been teased. very long and painful to bear.It is time for innovations in this genre, otherwise a film will seem easily another, with ugly monsters with long hair that move in a fun way but with the ability to make sudden appearances accompanied by loud sounds. , and someone can oil those doors while they are there too.
