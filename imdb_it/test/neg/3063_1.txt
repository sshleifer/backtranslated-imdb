Some people might remember Mrs. Russell from films like "Black Widow", which has had a certain appeal and critical acclaim. Boy, he must have really needed a rent check when he signed up to make this dog. <br /> <br /> Yes, there will be those who love gratuitous violence and nudity. But you have to sit down and ask yourself, in retrospect, what someone owned to spend money and time to do this in the first place. I just saw this movie in one of the "HBO's", and I can't believe they took it. <br /> <br /> In 1996, Mrs. Russell did not have the physical appeal she made earlier in her career. But, come on! Have his game Ma Barker ??? His "sons" all seem to be his brothers. It is also disturbing that you think there will be incestuous relationships (thank God there is no hope that it will not count as a spoiler). With Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano added to the cast, this is B-movie 'straight to the video' all the way. <br /> <br /> The scenes between Purvis and Ma Barker, both in person and on the phone, are a primer in a terrible, terrible acting. Oh wait, I forgot the terrible and terrible writing, too. Gypsum this from experience. A bad experience.
