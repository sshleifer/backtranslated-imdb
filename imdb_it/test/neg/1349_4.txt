I've never seen the original film that others have commented on, so my point of view is this film without comparison. <br /> <br /> I found the message of the film, if you only care about yourself, everything will be fine with the world, everything will be all right, your lovers will love you more, your friends will respect and appreciate you more, your employers will want you more, they will pay you more and even your own children and parents will love you more. <br /> <br /> I find this message reprehensible and totally false. <br /> <br /> Congratulations on the very entertaining birth scene at the end; there's not a mom out there who won't laugh during that scene. <br /> <br /> Overall a very disappointing movie plot. I didn't find myself cheering for anyone in this movie. I thought they were all pathetic and self-absorbed individuals who didn't care about what happened to them and which is not a movie that people want to see.
