I can't believe some of the soundtracks this movie is getting on the IMDb website! Have I been released with the naff version of the special version? Edited by Dewhurst, produced by Bernard Matthews, this film should be hosted in Battersea. I'm sorry for all the references centered on the United Kingdom, but if you're elsewhere and you have no toenails to cut or you don't have a collection of beer mats to catalog, then this movie could be worth only 90 minutes of your rest of life provided you don't have the paint to watch the drying). The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and assembly are surprisingly dried up. What the hell is Irons doing in this movie?
