It seems that the people involved in this film are filling the ballot boxes to increase their ratings. The good news that apparently only 18 people saw it. I guess I'm doing 19th. I have no involvement with the film and I don't know anyone who did it and I am a long-time historical user (check my record of ratings and reviews for the past seven years), so I promise I'm giving an honest and impartial opinion. It comes from a passionate 30-year-old horror who has also appeared in a couple of low-budget movies. <br /> <br /> In addition to a couple of interesting video effects, "Frankensteins Bloody Nightmare" is inconsistent, boring and technically imperfect beyond reason. Apparently it was shot on silent media and the audio was then nicknamed; most seem to have been recorded with a tin can and a piece of string, however. More than three quarters of the dialogue is incomprehensible. I looked at this from beginning to end and I have no idea what the story was, or even if there was one. It seems that the director is mainly impressing with long panning shots of the table corners and dead black spaces that do nothing but fill the film. It would be a problem if one is actually developing a storyline and making a film that has a certain sense of rhythm. In this case, however, the rule does not apply. It doesn't matter how the scenes are shot because they don't add up to a story. <br /> <br /> Watching this video is an exercise in futility at every level. Whatever the people who have worked are writing, and are still trying to influence the charts here on IMDb, this is just boring stuff. <br /> <br /> This is honest truth. If you're thinking about spending your money or time on this, think again. It's easy to find something better because you won't find much worse. <br /> <br /> And this is the impartial and untamed truth.
