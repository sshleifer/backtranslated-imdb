I saw the first few episodes a little while ago and I felt that I couldn't take it anymore. The horrible fighting scenes are the worst I've ever seen in my life. About a third of each episode is dedicated to Flash Gordon and his "powerful" fighting moves. I know that the fighting choreography of that era is not exactly up to today's standards, but it's ridiculous. They don't even try to make it realistic. Flash Gordon, who hardly resembles a fighter, uses his slow drunk movements and bare fist to knock out four or five boys with knives, guns and other weapons. Give me a break! There is also a scene where he does a similar act while he is in the water. Basically, each episode has scenes similar to those. As for the rest of the episode, there is not much else to remember. Basically I saw him out of curiosity about what science fiction looked like 70 years ago.
