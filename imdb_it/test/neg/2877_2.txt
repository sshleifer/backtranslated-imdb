The basic plot of 'Marigold' boasts of a romantic comedy in which the film industry is held as a backdrop. An American actress Marigold, played by Ali Carter, remains stuck in India. Worse, she's without money. She decides to play a small role in a Bollywood musical, so that she can earn enough money to return to her nation. Here he meets the Indian choreographer Prem, played by Salman Khan. Basically, the film fails at the script level. Only by defining a film does a Hollywood company not guarantee a quality cinema. Marigold stands out as the best example. The art direction is weak and obsolete. Musically, Marigold turns out to be a real disaster. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's is far from being recognized as a decent listener. As a result, Salman offers his most amateur performances to date. Ali Larter is good and has an immense presence on the screen. Performance is good too, she's good. <br /> <br /> You can also find good reviews on this movie at http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=36310
