I've never seen a movie that frustrated me more than Lord Of The Dance. Frustrated because it could have been fantastic. Frustrated because the dance could have been stunning. Frustrated because women could have been wonderful. How could I know ?! When your eyes moved to the area of ​​interest on the screen and focused appropriately on the spot to be admired, the insane editor moved the shot! I completely agree with the other comments here about the creepy lighting and the terrible camera / editor work. It makes me nauseous just looking at ten minutes of this would be a spectacular movie. <br /> <br /> Give me the opportunity to get a front row seat for the live concert and I'd be there at a stroke! <br /> <br /> Nicholas T
