It is an enigma to me as to why this film of a film was released. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is horror and there is a good dose of nudity, but for god, the value of production is the lowest I have ever seen, the equipment used is worse than normal domestic equipment, everything is lit up, giving everyone an amateur look, bringing your thoughts to the worst home videos in the United States or to any other show called. <br /> <br /> Please, is it true? too much to ask that you really make an effort when you expect to waste 90 minutes of people's lives watching this? You really should have done some short projects because it's obvious that you're a bunch of amateurs! 1/10
