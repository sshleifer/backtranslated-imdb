I have to agree with the other two comments. I waited over a month to see this great new show that A & E was making a hypothesis. What a disappointment!!! The show is pretty much all about Ryan Buell. His off-screen voices are encamped, not disturbing. It looks like he's talking in a can. Starting from the second episode, which lasts about 30 minutes (if you make the commercials come out), it is chased or followed by something that can be demonic. He can't say the name, every time someone needs to pass on that name, he writes it on a piece of paper and delivers it to someone else. Not particularly informative or funny or believable for the rest of us. Why can't he say the name? ... presumably would give the demon more power. Funny, I always thought demons wanted to hide their true identity. If you know the exact name of the demon, it is no longer easy for you to throw it. Now the next episode, which is airing soon, is titled "exorcism". So does Ryan need an exorcism already? Not to mention that it could not happen, but the show has so far given no proof or proof of anything. I can tell Ryan that if I were a small child, hell if I were an adult, and someone gave me a small bottle of holy water to chase away something that terrified me, I would look for help elsewhere !!! Beyond that, if you don't use holy water and blessings, etc. In the right way, don't you risk further infuriating what is already angry with you? I'll probably watch tonight, but if these episodes are as ridiculous as the first one, it will probably be the last time I'll watch it!
