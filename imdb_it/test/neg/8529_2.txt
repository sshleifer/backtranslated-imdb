My Take: Yet another terrible PG-13 horror film with predictable scary tactics and a derived plot. <br /> <br /> The spirits move. The walls creak. There is something wrong with the basement. These, along with many other clich√©s of the horror film infest the walls of another house in the country in Sam Raimi's THE MESSENGERS, a terrible pastica of the most predictable scare tactics launched on a wildly recycled plot by a better (and some once, even worse) horror films of the past. <br /> <br /> When the Solomon family moves to an old farm in South Dakota, in another attempt by dad (Dylan McDermott) to reconnect with the family, especially with their ex-drunk-daughter Jessica (underrated Kristen Stewart), in the thinnest campaign of their Chicago home. The horror occurs when Jessica begins to receive small surprise visits from the poltergeists of the house. Thinking it's a teenage girl crying the wolf, her parents don't believe her. How could they? The real horror in THE MESSENGERS is waiting for which horror movie will be wilder afterwards. Will an angry pack of crows want more than family crops (a direct rip-off of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, THE BIRDS)? Will the haunted house with a history dating back to THE AMITYVILLE HORROR or POLTERGEIST? Or will the grotesque ghosts drawn from your family's recent horrors like THE RING and THE GRUDGE? Heck, the movie even manages to snatch a scene or two from some really bad horror movies like AMITYVILLE 3-D and the mediocre COLD CREEK MANOR. Maybe all the Pang Brothers really wanted to make a B-level horror movie, but did it have to be so bad? Couldn't they get the best out of it? Avoid it. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: * out of 5.
