I saw the first episode and discovered that it was a very wooden performance. <br /> <br /> I saw the original of his early days on Big Girls Blouse until the last series on Channel Seven. Kath and Kim have been a great documentary and humor is something that most people get. <br /> <br /> However in this American version I found it boring, Molly Shannon is fashionable to be Kath Day, Kath's wardrobe should be blocked in the 80s with her frizzy permanent. While the figure of Selma Blair who embraces the clothes is not as good as the one worn by the original Kimmy. I also found that Selma seemed to swell her belly a lot, it's obviously a (Australian) size 12 where Kim should be (Australian) a size 16/18. <br /> <br /> The exchanges of Molly and Selma is obviously so scripted and there are pauses where there should be no pauses or breaks are a bit long, as someone suggested that there could be a trace of laughter in there during those breaks. It is as if Molly and Shannon were not used to each other, there is no Mother / Daughter chemistry. <br /> <br /> Phil agreed that he had the eccentric air around him like Kel. However Craig was handsome and not the sweet and simple humble Brett of the Australian version. I discovered that it was like watching a bad theater show. The acting was more or less wooden and the exaggeration of Selma's expressions took the funny out after ten minutes. Especially his sulky scenes. <br /> <br /> To sum up, I find this show a waste of time, the script was obviously silenced for the Americans who most of the commission says prefer the original. If NBC wanted to show Kath and Kim, why didn't they pay producers the money to screen the original. <br /> <br /> All I can add is Magda, you are a clever cookie to not allow producers to use your Sharon character.
