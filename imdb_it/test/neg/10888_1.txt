This film must be classified with "Welcome to the Jungle" and "The Hitcher" and "Dream Catcher" for pure divinity. You have the most irritating heroine in gore history who spends most of the time sobbing, crying and screaming - all the time in the most horrendous service bathroom ever staged. Because you spend so much time in this horrible bathroom from hell is never explained. Even when the usual killer truck driver is trying to kill her, she refuses to leave the toilet. When a policeman on a motorcycle comes to his rescue, the murderer driver runs on the legs of the policeman while the heroine watches. Instead of grabbing his gun to protect himself, he drags the poor sloppy into the toilet and closes the door. Then the policeman orders her to blow her brains out of pain. He does - while crying, sobbing and moaning - and opens his neck. Then - the policeman, still alive, begged her to shoot him again because he is still suffering. He says it while the whole back of his head is on the floor. The sobbing crying heroine shoots him again. The film goes on like this, none of this makes sense. The heroine is so nasty that you really want the killer to turn it off soon. I saw this movie on the Sci-Fi channel, so it didn't cost me anything to watch, but I still looked, for the sheer fascination of how a movie could end up terribly ugly.
