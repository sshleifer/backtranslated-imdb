The author of "Prince" manages to take an excellent cast, a decent story, a mediocre script and carefully assemble them into a boring, monotonous and amateur monotone. Despite a strong central interpretation of Frank Nasso, the Prince, this rambling film wanders aimlessly from one scene to another, painfully disintegrating in the hash. The result brings a sigh of relief at the end where tears of joy should be. A sad waste of time and talent and a good example of how NOT to direct a film. <br /> <br />
