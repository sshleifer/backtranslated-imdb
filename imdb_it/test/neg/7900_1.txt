This film was simply horrendous. How could anyone like this movie, and for those who liked it because of the jokes, they should really look in the mirror and wonder if the stereotypes are not bad. Ignoring the face of racial stereotypes, it was simply horrible. He never had his moments, if he paid tribute to the 80s, "Aereo!", He needs to pay a little more. Terrible attitude, terrible script, even for a film with Mo'Nique or Tom Arnold. This film was bad from the beginning, but people could have seen it all, with the thought that the plane would crash. One of the worst movies ever, stay away.
