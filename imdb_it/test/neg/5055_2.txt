Did I hear that this movie was bad ?? They even warned me that it was terrible, but for some reason (probably Katie Holmes) I still saw it when it was released on national TV. Watching Kevin Williamson's film means torturing! His scenarios are not funny, certainly not scary and not the least creative. Teaching Mrs. Tingle breathes the same irritating atmosphere of her brainless series "Dawson's Creek" and is probably also meant for the same target group. Even before the credits started, 5 people already wanted a hug and declared that gloomy phrase "I love you". There is nothing better as the soundtrack is full of annoying pop / rock and the plot is ultra-thin. Three students on the brink of graduation are caught cheating by the worst teacher in school. Every high school has a teacher like that, you know? To save their skin, they try to convince Mrs. Tingle that it was not her intention to cheat, but this attempt is horrible. The typical high school humor is completely lost on me, the overdose of feeling is pathetic and acting (with the exception of Helen Mirren) is abominable. Am I sure Katie Holmes can act? is this a fact proven by his role in "the Gift" ?? but he urgently needs to stop accepting roles as a frivolous girl. As mentioned before, the only positive comments go to the brilliant casting of Helen Mirren as the shrew. It's like Kathleen Turner in 'Serial Mom'! The role fits her perfectly and you can't imagine anyone else playing it. Besides this, this is a avoidable teenage nonsense.
