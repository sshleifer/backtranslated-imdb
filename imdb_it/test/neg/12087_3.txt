THE GOVERNESS is a moody period piece, the meandering story of a Jewish woman who, on the death of her father, leaves for Scotland in 1830, posing as a gentleman to get work to support her family in London. <br /> <br /> Rosina - or Mary, as she defines herself in a not too thin piece of symbolic writing - is a child without a rudder, a worldly person with the dream of being an actress. You form an alliance with your employer and by chance solve a crucial problem in your research with photography. Stunned by success, they begin an uncomfortable and uncomfortable relationship while her lover's eldest son falls in love (and inexplicably) in love with her. And as a child, he can't understand the consequences of her actions - in the end, betraying those he deceived to make a living for himself. <br /> <br /> Many say this is something of a feminist manifesto, but I disagree. Whether understood or not, this film is in tune with me only if I consider it a warning. In the end, Rosina's biggest disappointment is the truth - that she lied, it happened on a way to help a man who wanted to be both her father and her lover, and ultimately contributed nothing but destruction. As such, the end of the film gives me the impression that none of what he did, no one who used it, made her happy - and that's exactly how it should be. <br /> <br /> Did I need a film so long and long to teach me this lesson? Not at all. On the contrary, had it not been for an excellent photograph, a unique soundtrack and my hope of achieving its success, I would not have been confined until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver fans will probably be disappointed with its erratic performance, but may wish to see it anyway; I doubt that young Jonathan Rhys-Meyers fans will be able to stay awake for the gain they expect, and I can't help but think that this has too many cultural details to interest, even to photography enthusiasts. The 3 points that rewards the film are exclusively for his visual style and score. Based on their other work, I assume that the actors' interpretations are so disappointing because of a poor script and a worse direction, but in the end they are insignificant.
