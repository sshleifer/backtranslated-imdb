Never mind a thing. I'm a HUGE fan Bruce Campbell, I have the Evil Dead series, I have the action figures and I saw Bubba Ho-Tep. I'm a fan of crazy and laughable horror movies and I can appreciate the whole thing "it's so bad it's good". <br /> <br /> I wish I could say the same about this movie. I watched this film with great expectations, I wanted it to be good, campy, something of the BC that we all learned to know and love. It started out quite promising, but after the first 20 minutes I kept looking at the rest of this excuse of a movie as if I had just been hit with tranquilizer darts. <br /> <br /> The idea itself is not bad; two men don't get along, both killed by the same psychopath, half of a man's brain is transplanted into the other's head, they argue, they disagree and the play follows. <br /> <br /> What killed me is how extremely boring and boring it was! It had potential, even if the field moved much better than it was. The plot was boring, even the bizarre magic wand of Bruce couldn't make it. <br /> <br /> Word cannot even correctly express the ridiculous robot that Bruce's wife's brain ends up being put into. Easily the ugliest robot I've ever seen anywhere (even for a B series movie). The whole idea is stupid. <br /> <br /> What the hell was going through Bruce's mind when he turned this steaming pile out of me. Because Ted Raimi didn't go running to his older brother to ask him to slap Bruce and not to mention the lessons on how to make a funny movie on a budget is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Too bad for you Bruce !!!
