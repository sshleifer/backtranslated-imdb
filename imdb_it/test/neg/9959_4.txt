OK, I saw George Zucco in at least four distinct horror / suspense films recently as I made my way through various 50 pack collections, and I have to say the boy had a limited range, but he was good at what he did. It wasn't Karloff, but the PRC was lucky to have it. <br /> <br /> But the poor boy was stuck in some kind of horror movie ghetto, and he wasn't good enough to take them to the next level of interest .... not with the discussion - No scripts, direction and budget to which he worked. This is the case here. <br /> <br /> This film is, well, slow, heavy and not very exciting for the most part. The "heroine" looks set to be a rent-a-center version of Judy Garland, the "hero" is as bland as white rice, and the poor guy who plays the monster doesn't even get a good transformation scene from the deal. Its make-up effects are not scary at all - it looks like a slightly brighter version of a farm hand, that's all. <br /> <br /> It is not a total waste. Zucco looks good with the camera, chews the scenery and manages to transmit some speeches set in a terrible and forced way, without blinking or losing the flow. There are some black and white shots that don't suck here and there. <br /> <br /> So all in all ... this movie has helped some "C" and "Z" level players to pay the rent for another month, and it never sinks below a certain level of compromised quality. Watch it once if you like George Zucco, or simply feel the need to see every wolfman themed movie ever made.
