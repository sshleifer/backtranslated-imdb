First, this is NOT an adaptation of a book by Stephen King, short story, novella or other. From EW's website, and their review of the show when it was first shown, "... never writes to his audience, and never betrays contempt for his subjects. His first original work for the television, Stephen King's Golden Years '' (CBS, July 16, 9-11 pm), is no exception. "<br /> <br /> The series apparently would have been (as others have mentioned) a series in progress, which is why we never saw the finale after the cliffhanger they left us. But this has never been made clear to the spectators who have remained to wonder how it will end? <br /> <br /> When the series came out on videotape, she boasted that she had the "ending never seen before!" She should have said "the ending that should never be seen!" <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The ending was the only significant modified part for the video (although some parts of the whole were left out), and this changed the end was what destroyed the story. For example, rather than our two intrepid FBI agents who realize they have been labeled bad and fleeing The Shop's evil Jude Anderson (as originally broadcast), Jude simply approaches them ... And the they shoot. Bang, dead, and no real emotion to talk about in the scene. Ditto on the piece with Harlan and his wife leaving. Considering that the original finale left us with a spectacular cliff-hanger, in the video, they simply come out of the cock-doodie's car. <br /> <br /> *** Final Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> It was a sad ending for a pretty well done mini series, and it makes the video completely not worth buying, or even rent. Sincerely, save your money and your time.
