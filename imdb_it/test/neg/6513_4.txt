New Year 2006, and I'm looking at Glimmer Man again. Say what you like, I find Steven Seagal's movies funny. Like many comments, good fight sequences - I particularly liked his phone response to the restaurant saying how much it would be closed for restoration. A bit like Schwarzenegger's humor in previous action films - although this tended to be self-deprecating. <br /> <br /> But what I like here is Brian Cox. One of the most versatile actors around. Too bad for his hand and his foot, but so much for having endured a long interrogation - he must have rejected that class at the "farm". <br /> <br /> As the films progressed, I wonder why the ever-thickening circumference of Seagal its movement? It doesn't matter, it's entertainment!
