QUESTION: How does a film deserve two different titles like "The Librarians" and "Strike Force"? <br /> <br /> ANSWER: The film is terribly ugly that the directors could not even decide on a title !!!! <br /> <br /> This film is a mixture of martial arts, death-vendettas, melodrama, romance and other clich√© film techniques. The story focuses on a group of vigilantes called The Bibliarians, directed by Agent Simon (WIlliam Forsythe). The group is excited to find a nefarious, multi-language, pockmarked creature named Marcos (Andrew Divoff) who captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of southern Florida. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds looks like a cameo in this film, and his scene is completely foreign to the action. Burt offers a long monologue in one of the most bizarre gossip I've ever heard. This may have been Burt's attempt at an Irish dialect, but the overall effect is a kind of perverse imitation of Marlon Brando in "The Godfather". <br /> <br /> Also in this film appears Erika Eleniak, who infiltrated the most intimate circle of Marcos' bizarre world. Erika's character kicks off her alliance with Simon. The librarians and Erika will become a powerful attack force against evil in a film that was delivered directly from the editing room to the cable TV converter box.
