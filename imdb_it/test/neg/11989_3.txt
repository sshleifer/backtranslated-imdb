I am deeply disturbed by some posts that I am reading on the boards of this film, people say that in reality it is a good movie! Just because this movie is the best of Uwe Boll to date doesn't make it a good movie at all, there's no way to hell! Far Cry is a cliché mess full of bad acting, bad direction and an uninspired story with a poor script. This is the first pure action movie of Boll, and the people in news flashes, action films are not too difficult to achieve because for a simple action movie all you need is explosions and battles of pistols scattered around a fragile texture. doing this. House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark and Bloodrayne, all horror games adapted to Boll films are much worse than this (they have no salvific qualities). Far Cry boasts two things that make it even better: two great leads and a couple of well-made action sequences. Til Schweiger is quite as good as Jack Carver, and Emmanuelle Vaugier is a strong female protagonist. The usual big Udo Kier is passable as the bad cliché and the supporting cast are damn bad. Towards the end of the film there is a surprisingly tense sequence of chases that was a shock considering that Boll was behind the camera. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the rest of the film has an incredibly cheap feel, with a bad CGI, lame and lame clichés around every corner. Oh, and the worst of it leads to a sex scene I think I always have a scene. Not only do the two know each other alone for six hours, but for him it is enough to say that he warmed up while he was in the army posting his comrades. He already had her clothes removed simply by telling her to do it. Then he took it off and went to bed because he was afraid of hypothermia. <br /> <br /> However, to sum up, this is a bad movie. It's a senseless action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you're totally bored. You could probably do worse than insert it and look at it, but personally I'd say watch a classic action movie like Die Hard or Predator and stay away from this derivative chaos. <br /> <br /> 1½ / 5
