The title is a misnomer: the film barely describes a year of the so-called "marquis divino". It was a difficult time for him because he was threatened by the guillotine: the quiet joys of the reign of Terror. <br /> <br /> Historically, the background is rather sketchy: "the supreme De l'etre party", Robespierre's failed attempt to create a secular religion, his downfall, a paradise sent opportunity to show the machine Dr. Guillotin's left at work (full speed). <br /> <br /> As for Sade, it is a mediocre affair: he is waiting in a former convent with other nobles, a golden cage if you compare it to, say, to Marie Antoinette or scientist The fate of Lavoisier, and exchange futile conversations with a young virgin about death, love and other curiosities. There is the obligatory "bold" scene but you have to be patient because it is a long time before it reaches the screen. And anyway, according to today's standards, can we call it bold? Cy Enfield's "De Sade", which has one of IMDb's lowest scores, is at least fun, and Keir Dullea was a more credible Marquis than Auteuil's age. And he characterized John Huston.
