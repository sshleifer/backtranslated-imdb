I'm not surprised that so many people have fallen for it. When I was watching this movie, a couple of spectators next to me sobbed whenever they "supposed" to sob - or at least to feel "touched". Like when Hunting said he didn't love the girl. Like when the character of Robin Williams (I'm sorry I forgot the name of his role) was repeatedly repeating to Hunting "It's not your fault" (oh Lord, just thinking about that scene gives me goose bumps). I wouldn't have cared less about what happened to the characters. Many people sobbing for Hollywood characters who can't even relate (think Titanic; Yuck!) ... but actually made me just shudder and want to get out of the theater. I imagine that I simply have to refuse to be psychologically and emotionally manipulated by all this. <br /> <br /> I am not the one to be condescending ... those characters are, and without reason because they are unreal. Worse, nothing is new or surprising. Even the character of Robin Williams is all a clich√©. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1 out of 10. Probably not so bad; it's just pretty mediocre ... but so many people went to the other extreme and gave it a 10, so I thought that a single balancing vote wouldn't hurt.
