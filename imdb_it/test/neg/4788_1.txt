With the plethora of repetitive and derivative sitcoms intertwined in autumn, summer, winter and spring, it's nice to see a show that stands out from the lot in more than one area. <br /> <br /> 'Earl' has an unusual approach. This is not about the "everyday reflections of an eccentric family" (zzzz ..) nor about the other boring things you see everywhere in the sitcoms. The show is about this little white rubbish thief (Earl) who scratches a lottery card and scores a lot of time. Just then, 'Karma' took him away from him. In extraordinary time, he learns that that unusual incident was probably due to all the bad things he did, so he leaves on a mission to correct every mistake he ever made and has all his actions on a piece of paper. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant premise for a sitcom. Fortunately, he landed in the right hands. Performing the show produces extremely satisfying results: you get an innovative comedy that is really fun and really touching on many occasions. You can't help but fall in love with the sincerity and firmness of Earl, the simple mind of Randy, the good heart and observations about life, the wild and showy personality of Joy and the sweet and cold behavior of Darnell that fascinates him very easily . <Br /> <br /> When you combine show innovation with its genuine humor, good heart, interesting characters and well-written dialogues, you really have a keeper. With shows like this (and the incomparable "The Office"), NBC is obviously somehow. Have they finally released a cubicle or two for quality assurance? Let's hope. And we hope that more quality shows like these will occupy the line-up; shows that we will ensure that we television viewers and NBC executives stop crying for the past days of the golden days of NBC (Frasier, Seinfeld, Friends)
