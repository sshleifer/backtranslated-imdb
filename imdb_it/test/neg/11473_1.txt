I had heard that this film was elegant and intriguing, but I found it annoying. It's been a while since I saw it (and I hope I don't discover that all my memories are wrong and I am unjustly condemning this film), but my memory is that the filmmakers tried to portray Leopold and Loeb as victim of an anti-gay society, and that somehow caused their horrible crime. I totally disagree with this point of view, and I think it is unfair for both homosexuals and for Bobby Franks, the real victim of history. I can't imagine why anyone wants to claim those two as martyrs. I also thought that L & L were portraits a little more sophisticated than they actually were - after all they were teenagers living at home. The film places them in a sort of fantasy world that seems to have been marked by Morrissey. I have just read an interview with one of the filmmakers implying the film's anachronisms, like the button the phones used by the characters were meant to "add the Brechtian distance". They certainly do, but it seemed very annoying. <br /> <br /> Apparently a number of people found this film interesting, but I would have preferred a less "elegant" and more realistic examination of the part of homosexuality it might have played in the Leopold & Loeb case.
