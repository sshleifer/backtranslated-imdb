Perhaps the worst movie of the existing genre. It was announced as a comedy, but it is simply tragically pathetic. I don't think anyone could have gotten anything more terrible and irritating if specifically requested. The humor in the toilets is much poorer, I would even avoid watching the trailer. I just went to see it because it was announced that if you like Monty Python, you're bound to love this. Anyone who wrote this was biased or seriously unbalanced. I am still baffled about how one can honestly believe such a claim. Rarely, I leave the cinema, it really takes a lot for a film to have that effect on me: it did it in just 30 minutes.
