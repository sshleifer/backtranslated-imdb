I don't know if this type of film was as clich√© as it seems now. <br /> <br /> Considering how many "Bad News Bears" movies were already released in 1980, however, I think this type of film was already a tired idea. <br /> <br /> A former football player is partially paralyzed in Vietnam and is confined to a wheelchair. The Chicago Bears offer him a public relations job but he wants to train. At the same time, his minor nephew is captured for armed robbery. We have been told that he has already been arrested more than a dozen times and now faces a difficult time ... which turns out to be less than a year! <br /> <br /> Of course, the child is actually a good guy who only needs a tough male model in his life. The same applies to all children in the detention facility. Yes ... even the one blocked for attempted murder! I'm sure you already know what's going on, so I'll try to keep the rest of this brief. <br /> <br /> Our protagonist becomes the coach of the boys' soccer team. It overcomes the cynicism of criminals and earns their respect. His team faces a local high school team (yes, right!) And their butts are kicked. Now determined more than ever to prove himself a worthy coach, he asks for a rematch. Will these disadvantaged and discarded children with gold hearts be able to improve enough to win the revenge? The horrible execution of soccer sequences ruins any chance of excitement in this film. "Coach Of The Year" should be penalized for roughing my brain. 1/10
