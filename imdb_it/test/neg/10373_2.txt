Being a homosexual who lived through the period of time examined in this tedious documentary, I was eager to see how the topic was handled. Unfortunately, the directors have wasted what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed light on our collective gay story. This film only concerns itself with the period within New York City, ignoring the rest of the country. While I spent a fair amount of time in New York at that time, I can assure you that there was a gay life outside of Manhattan! The men interviewed here are the same "A-list" queens who thought they were better than anyone else during the 1970s, and here they are again, in an attitude of nostalgia and launch. The film should have at least tried to deal with wider topics, such as race, age, the thriving gay "caste system" based on wealth, body image and the rise of "clones", the discrimination of subgroups at inside the community, and the ability to grow decent mustaches (which is very important in the 70s!). Alas, we have not presented any of this and the memories of the interviewees are no different from my memories. If you were there in that decade, you'll have fun with the archive photos and grainy home movies from the bars and nightclubs we haunt. If you weren't there, this movie would undoubtedly seem boring. It should have been much more, but unfortunately it is not. Two stars for jogging in my memory ... I still miss going to the Anvil!
