Last fall (2001), I took a film lesson that was taught by the director of this film (Mark Hoeger). His vast knowledge of cinema, his ability to dissect any scene from a film and his Oscar winning in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent director. When he mentioned during one of his lessons that he had just finished directing a movie called "Full Ride" and was in post-production phases, my interest was moved. However, that would be the last I would ever hear of that movie. Until last week ... <br /> <br /> Last week, I saw on a TV list that "Full Ride" was going to be shown on the WB network. This immediately raised a red flag, as I can't help but associate WB with teensploitation shows like Dawson's Creek, Charmed, etc. PLUS, the fact that Full Ride would be released directly on TV was not too flattering in itself. But anyway, I put aside that time and sat down to watch the creation of my former film teacher. After two hours and I started filming, I thought a lot about what I had just seen. What I had just seen was a typical WB quality show stretched for two hours. Indeed, it seemed as if this film had been made for the sole purpose of showing only on the WB network. Criticizing this film will basically be how to criticize a typical WB show. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The characters are superficial, the story is clich√© in every sense of the word, the scenes are completely invented and the development of the character is forced and incredible. This film screams 'not original'. <br /> <br /> The main character, Matt Sabo, is a hot-shot on the wrong side of the tracks (literally) that plays football in high school when he is fullback, but then goes off into a life of crime. He is offered the chance to get a full-price scholarship instead of going to prison. Of course, without much choice, he agrees to play football with a star football team, but he is not excluded among his colleagues because of his lack of team spirit and bad attitude. <br /> <br /> Then love comes in interest. Obviously! Where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest? It comes in the form of Amy Lear (played by the beautiful Meredith Monroe). Actually he is a nice character, unlike the always so abrasive Matt Sabo, so we almost applaud him when he rejects him at the beginning. But obviously the inevitable will happen. She falls for him, changes her attitude towards everything, and everything looks good and happy. But now it's time to get into conflict! <br /> <br /> Earlier in the film, Amy makes it clear to Matt that he doesn't want to score with him, because it would be "shameful" for her and her mother. This is a lot for Matt's dismay, and for his soccer buddies (yes, they eventually get hot with him) who bet he wouldn't get one. But, of course, Matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides it's not all about the nookie. Here is where the exciting plot thickens. If you don't want me to ruin this surprise, then jump. <br /> <br /> [START SPOILER] <br /> <br /> Matt finds out from some local guys that apparently Amy Lear is always looking to score with a guy every year by the All-Star team so she can try to use it to escape the life of his small town by working in a coffee shop (which is disconcerting in the first place) and get to the big city. Suddenly realizing that he was used and that his love was a fiction, Matt is tempted to return to a life of crime and leave the football field before "the big game". Amy tries to reassure him that she's really in love this time, but he's too tired to buy it. So what will Matt do? Will he take it back? Or will he come back to steal the gas station and be a complete idiot? I won't ruin the super-ultra-amazing ending for you. <br /> <br /> [END SPOILER] <br /> <br /> So, if I somehow get you pumped for this movie, please realize that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm. This film is an uninspired version of "Varsity Blues" or "Summer Catch". And this is not saying much. There is almost no comedy to save it and the characters are too superficial to worry. So what's left for you? Not much. <br /> <br /> What I didn't like most about the film was how much of an unflattering painting painted by Hoeger of Nebraska through this film. He seems to be trying to capture the essence of rural Nebraska and adolescent life in small towns, but his approach is too stereotyped and superficial. The great hopes of the characters of being part of the "big city" and the actions they take to do so are very exaggerated, and further cement the Nebraskani stereotype as a group of madmen who live in agricultural communities. I'm not sure if Hoeger's intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight, but I think he ended up with a very shameful product. If Hoeger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light, he would have to take a note or two from Alexander Payne. While Payne simply chooses to use Nebraska as a backdrop for his films, Hoeger integrates it into the Full Ride plot and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he is shooting, that he ends up churning out a superficial junk that would seem to come from outside the box. If Hoeger really lived here, you'd think he'd know better. <br /> <br /> All in all, I am completely disappointed with Hoeger's first great film, and I hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a bit of originality to create something different and inspiring.
