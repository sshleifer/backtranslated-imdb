I saw it in the theater a couple of decades ago and the fuzzy memory suggests that I liked it. However, seeing him for the second time two things stand out: (1) very poor acting by Michelle Johnson, and (2) very poor music in everything. <br /> <br /> It's not like all the music was bad. Some of the Brazilian music was fine, but the soundtrack and others that made their voices vibrate were reminiscent of the worst pop music of the 1980s. Johnson's voice sounded wrong, perhaps dubbed. This was a distraction. <br /> <br /> On the positive side: (1) The story is not bad, (2) it is interesting to see a young Demi Moore, (3) Valerie Harper never looked better, and (4) Johnson seemed rather attractive in various stages of disarmament.
