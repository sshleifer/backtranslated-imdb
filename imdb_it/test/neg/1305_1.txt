This film follows in the footsteps of The Riddle for a British cast to star in a really terrible movie! Poor cgi effects, poor editing, bad direction, a cast that I hope was well paid as this will be a nail in a coffin of careers. <br /> <br /> Nigel Planer should have worn his Neil wig once again with a laugh at least! <br /> <br /> It was like a particularly long and complex episode of "Torchwood" but without the fake Canadian doctor of the camp ... he had the same excessively dramatic music, but, perpetually repeated, in a vain attempt to increase tension . <br /> <br /> Oh humanity!
