I had high expectations of this film (not like it was an apocalypse now or an 8 1/2, but high enough), and when I saw it on the cable, they were all shattered. Beginning with acting (poor, almost mediocre, an astonishing waste of good actors and talents) and the story itself: since when does a team of 5 men go on a so-called "hot" zone? Suicide? It's a big mistake, which is expensive for the film. Very good actors play very badly here, like Sean Penn, who recently repeated the irritating way of talking about "I am Sam", and Michael J. Fox, who wastes a good opportunity to beat Charlie Sheen in "Platoon", performing just "average". But the most annoying character was Diaz (played by John Leguizamo, another stupid waste of great talent from the director), who was a kind of cheese, scared and insecure, even more irritating than Jar Jar Binks (yes, you heard ) The battle sequences are average, the only one that really stands out is the opening sequence, with Michael J. Fox trapped by his feet on a VC.Mr. tunnel. de Palma has a weak job here, and if it weren't for films like "Scarface" and "The Untouchables" (these excellent films), I'd consider him a "bluff" director: too much publicity, bad shooting. <br /> <br /> 3/10
