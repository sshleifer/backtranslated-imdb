Of all the adaptations of the books by Alistair MacLean, I feel that this qualifies as the worst, but don't blame MacLean! It would seem that all that this film shares with the novel is the same title. We have no suspense, no sense of omen of mystery, no chance to empathize with the main characters. We spend the entire duration (or at least I did) waiting for Charlotte Rampling to get rid of her clothes (for Charlotte, this seems to take a long time!). Still, a taste of Charlotte Rampling's tits can't really save this disastrous movie. MacLean was once again hunted in the eaves to withstand the sniping of those bitter hacks and gatherers who would seem to blame him for all the evils that hit the attempts to shoot his books. Poor old Alistair must have crawled into a corner and moaned when it came out. At least "Bear Island" - which also uses the name Maclean but apparently none of its novel - was a bit exciting. Excitement is awaiting final credits here.
