Hedy Lamarr, who may have been held by more men on screen than any other actress, is again Kent Taylor's lover, playboy of society and general throughout the rat. On a boat from the Yucatan after Taylor gave her the brush, she tries suicide. But Dr. Spencer Tracy saved her from drowning in the Caribbean. Tracy is rather the handyman doctor. I guess he never heard the word specialist. He runs a clinic in Manhattan for the poor and his journey was a secondary activity in medical research. Lamarr and he marry and she tries to introduce him to her world and also becomes a partner of the Louis Calhern society doctor. Of course Kent Taylor returns to the scene and the inevitable occurrence of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Watching I Take This Woman, it seemed to me that the writers were heavily influenced by Boys Town, the Oscar-winning city. Unfortunately his role as Dr. Karl Decker is not a band-aid on what he did as Father Flanagan. Maybe they were trying to give Father Flanagan some romance in his life in this movie, so to speak. Tracy and Lamarr didn't get along very well. In fact this film was nicknamed The Retake This Woman because the original director Joseph Von Sternberg came out of the movie, presumably because Lamarr wasn't working for him like Marlene Dietrich did. She did Lady of the Tropics and then MGM returned to shoot this film with their contract director Woody Van Dyke, known for the speed of his productions. And a new supporting cast has been introduced. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, both Spence and Hedy had better roles in store for both.
