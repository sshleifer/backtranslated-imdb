Oh Sex Lives of the Potato Men, which demon devil created you? This is a movie you watch, you smile a little during runtime and then when you tell others who have seen it, you can't help but smile while you talk. But it's not that Sex Lives of the Potato Men is actually a funny movie that inspires you to smile when you talk or think about it, it's just that the film is so bizarre; he is so offensive and he is not shameless in his attempt to go through a mild laugh to have sex and sex in general that you simply can't help but make your mouth laugh in a smile. Keep in mind that what follows the grin is a sinking of the head; a consequent shaking of the head and an increase in the index finger and thumb in both eyebrows as you gently rub them in an attempt to remember your time by looking at this basket. <br /> <br /> But this is what the film is, it's rubbish; it is very brave and shameless trash but no-less trash. Anyone who has invented this idea, put it on paper and then spread it in the sector trying to do it, must be very brave or very desperate. It is strange to have a film that is decidedly "on" something, but which in no case has a decisive narrative. This follows that idea that most European cinema is artistic and its stories are ambiguous and open and the themes take precedence over most other things. In Sex Lives of the Potato Men, the same situation and technically the same joke are repeated over and over again and this is an idea that consists of: "sex is a very, very funny thing". These ideas are perhaps better suited to an American film, so it's no wonder that after some time watching this movie, things start to feel a little out of place. <br /> <br /> The film begins and ends in the same way, creating a sensation of a circular journey; a circular journey that has gone absolutely nowhere and absolutely nothing has been achieved. Three guys sit around a table talking and no. Their leader joins them and the conversation is limited to any crude and disgusting story, situation or scenario that anyone can think of. The strange thing is that every time a man says something bad, the other makes a face, but he has an equally dirty story to give in return creating a contradiction in what these men find to cross the line and what they don't do . The men are Dave (Vegas) and Ferris (Crook), two people joined by Tolly (Coleman) whenever the film deems appropriate to cast a third face to break some dirtier jokes or break some particular stories. They are employed by Jeremy (Gattis), a man who has deeper problems and problems, but questions on which the film is more interested in exploiting for the sake of humor than studying. <br /> <br /> So what is the situation on Sex Lives of the Potato Men? The three or four men are in crisis and for the duration of the film we will adopt the role of the unfortunate fly on the wall as we witness what happened to these people during the period of about a week. If the humor that revolves around Dave and Ferris is disgusting and repulsive, then for Jeremy things are just ghostly. It all starts in an innocent way and there seems to be a female that he likes and one that he likes equally in return, but when the essence of Jeremy is simply a stalker it creeps in, that's when the jaws fall. Jeremy's character is used and transmitted in a way that makes unrequited love and stalking in general just a "fun" look. Jeremy sits in his apartment listening to classical music and writing letters of abuse to Ruth (Davis), echoing a sort of psychotic character more associated with Hannibal Lecter who writes his letter to Clarice in 2001 by Hannibal. But whatever sympathy we might have for him at this point is made absolutely false when, later, the true origin of their relationship is revealed. Suddenly, we as an audience feel betrayed feeling a mite sorry for him previously and for whatever reason he did do what he did in the first place, he just looks cowardly and unpleasant. Saying what would spoil any little surprise lurked in the film. <br /> <br /> Quite sad as, in one of Jeremy's letters, he writes about something or the other exclaiming he has "No artistic vision?" just a big mess. "I hate when the words spoken by the characters echo to the movie they are in. Sex Lives of the Potato Men does not explore someone's psyche or the particular interest in a fetish or because they feel the need to go around having sex as much as possible, use them only as a front to accumulate jokes and ridiculously little fun situations. Rather than having group sex and exploring what drives a person to look for it, it makes a joke (tickets with numbers!?), rather than getting into the mindset of a sadomasochism fan, the film has someone hangs from the ceiling of a cellar and warns everyone of "salt and vinegar on the way" as it reaches its peak. Ferris covers his face with disgust and the camera fades to the next scene without much confusion. or relief that the film had no public abroad. This is a section of British culture, indeed of the British mentality that I pray will be confined to our shores and ignored accordingly.
