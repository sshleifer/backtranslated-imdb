The only reason I checked this movie was to see the "first" Kim Bassinger. That, and the fact that my TV guide said it was a "compelling suspense", and was a three-star hotel. The evaluation must come from the man who wrote this drivel because the only suspense in this film was whether or not I would have finished it. Robert Culp turns into what must be the "disaster" of his cop career that is not even close to being credible. At one point, EVERYONE is suspicious, including a frail older woman. If you want to deliberately watch a poorly written, poorly interpreted film ... then take it. It could make you appreciate the good films by comparison. I wish I had that hour and thirty-six minutes back.
