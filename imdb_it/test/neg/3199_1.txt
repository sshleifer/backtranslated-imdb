Most likely one of the biggest celluloid wastes in the last 100 years. Not only does he suffer from a painfully disjointed (and enormously predictable) script, but he is clearly a carbon copy of Alien II. Within five minutes I correctly predicted who would die and who didn't (and in what order). The special effects are laughable; there is a scene in which a crew member is overwhelmed (unconvincing) by two Krites that look like a pair of teddy bears, and the bare humor is misplaced and terrible. There are better things to do with a remote video recorder than using it to watch this movie.
