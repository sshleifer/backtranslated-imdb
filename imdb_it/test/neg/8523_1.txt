Spoiler with explanation of the plot: a poor family is thrown in the middle of the war between the wicked (who comes out of nowhere, and without questions ...) who went wacko, and Casper the friendly ghost who is trying to avenge his death . With each frame the film becomes increasingly predictable, a great disappointment. Finishing the completely silly seams, it has nothing to do with the film itself, I think someone has run out of ideas or get to the point that the film is like that or the other, so it might even have a stupid ending. Waste of time, resources and money. The actors' game is very poor. If you think of dialogues, you may find that family conflict is artificially forced by poor communication between the characters. Some scenes follow one another randomly. In summary: boring, predictable, poor, pathetic. Waste of time and money.
