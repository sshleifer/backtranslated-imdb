I saw this cheap DVD, and I took it for a laugh. I also recently found "The Octagon" on DVD and bought it for reminiscing, seeing it in the theater as a pre-teenager and loving it at the time. The problem now of "turning back" to these American karate films, is that since then I have seen so many action films from Hong Kong and Thai, where the fighting scenes are long, fast and stunning. I'm thinking in particular of fights like Jackie and Benny "The Jet" at the end of "Dragons Forever", or the circular duel of Tony Jaa from "The Protector". Hollywood kung-fu offers are not just "filmed well", and even make someone of certified ability, like Chuck, sometimes seems embarrassing. And what's worse than a fight that goes in slow motion? So you know it looked poor at normal speed, so they slowed it down for effect. It really highlights how ridiculous an opponent is while standing and just WAITING to be kicked in the chest. <br /> <br /> Poor Chuck has no intensity in this film, nor does he project any straight threats. Compare it with his former co-star Bruce Lee, who had charm and aptitude to burn. When Bruce stands against opponents one could almost see the air around him crackling with what was about to happen. In "Breaker, Breaker" Chuck seemed to accidentally kick people, with total nonchalance. When the judge comes to see him in prison, and condemns him to death, Chuck is staring with a sad look, and I thought "OK ... he's doing that thing in focus 'third eye' and is about to grab the judge by the throat and get out of this ", but it does nothing but look with a doe look. Terrible. And while the DVD case gives you hope, listing an execution time of 1 hour and 5 minutes, it is actually 1 hour, 25 minutes, so there are still 20 minutes of pain. <br /> <br /> For a great fighting action, go see Jackie Chan in the first "Police Story" .... the fight in the mall at the end is pure gold ......
