The emergence of Quentin Tarantino and his dubious influence on characters like Guy Ritchie could have unleashed the wave of terrifying British gangsters that we have been left in inheritance in recent years, but one of our most famous acting exports only serves to perpetuate the cycle lending his considerable name to the garbage in this way. I only hope he took a moment to consider before choosing this project for the same reasons of personal gain that he admits to employing often. He is not only suffocating his talent, but perhaps the promise of future originality from British films. <br /> <br /> None of the characters in this film are funny or even remotely realistic, and the dialogue consists of the usual empty threats and colorful language. Caine does not give the material more effort than it deserves, either. If this were to be in the style of a tragic fall from grace to "King Lear", it would have been a great help if I had been concerned about the ultimate fate of the principals, instead of simply wishing that the quicksand of life would get bogged down and dragged almost immediately . <br /> <br />
