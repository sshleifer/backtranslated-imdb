I just watched this movie on DVD this morning and I was so disappointed that I thought it was a good joke for the audience. In other words - the creators have planned to make the play non-dramatic. However, in the end I realized that Mr. Tony Giglio was sincere about this film. It's a shame because: dialogue is ridiculous, acting is poor and lifeless, history is a fairy tale! Poor Ryan Phillippe: despite his efforts, his character in the film remains probably his worst performance! What to say about Jason Statham - lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role that is an imaginary fiction ... For this reason I vote: 3/10
