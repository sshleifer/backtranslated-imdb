WARNING!! This review may contain spoilers. The back of the box is misleading. He says all this shit about children telling ghost stories, which they do, but then he implies that they will all be killed by some killer in the woods. This does not happen The stories they tell are a bit interesting, especially the one with the dog and all that it licks, but most are rather boring, the monsters in the woods, a dumb girl and the main one, the whole movie.
