The MTV animated science fiction series "Flon Flux" comes to life with Charlize Theron playing the title character, a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the walled city of Bregna, 400 centuries into the future. For her last mission, she was sent to kill city leader Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), but discovered secrets along the way. <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux falls into the category of good premise, mediocre execution. Interesting story but the film was a bit boring. A lot of people say this is one of the worst films of the year and it's not at all true. It could be a disappointing film, but at best it is an average film. I've never seen the cartoon version of the movie, so I can't compare the two. It's probably better because they have the chance to explain the story more. The film is not so confusing, but it is easy to get lost if you are not familiar with the material. The acting was ok, nothing special. Charlize Theron gives a good interpretation and seems dedicated to the film. The rest of the cast also offers decent performances including Jonny Lee Miller, Frances McDormand and Marton Csokas. There are also several interesting characters in the film, including Sithandra, Aeon's friend. <br /> <br /> The problem with Aeon Flux is that it takes itself too seriously. It carries the same serious tone throughout the film and this becomes a bit tiring. There is no humor and the film gets a little boring at times. This is the same problem that Elektra had. Because the film is so serious, the dialogue seems trivial and the serious scenes seem forced. The action scenes are pretty good, but that's not what the movie really is, so don't expect just an action movie. The turning point in the end is not amazing but it's still a nice ending and better than other thrillers released last year (Hide and Seek). The costumes are a bit strange but they still look beautiful and interesting. Even the images were done well, so the film looks nice. So the film could be a case of style over substance. Interesting to look at but it may not hold your attention for a very long time. In the end, it's not the best film around but it could be a decent rental. Evaluation 4/10
