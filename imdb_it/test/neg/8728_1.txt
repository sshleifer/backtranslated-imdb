I agree in many parts with the fairly thorough review already published on the subject of the miniseries, and I agree that it has its pros, not just its cons. For example, the original film manages to cut off most of the intermediate and final sections of the novel in a single montage, including the discovery of Gurney Halleck and the love story of Paul Atreides and Chani, who, reading the novel, is a disguise , probably born from the shenanigens cutting study of which the other reviewer writes. This was one of the great failures of the original film, and the miniseries, to his credit, includes many of the original plot lines that were cut off from Lynch's film due to the expansive nature of Herbert's novel. <br /> <br /> However, this in itself is a double-edged sword. Rather than completing a transfer from text to celluloid of the novel, the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plots, absent from the original novel. Likewise, although this is certainly a more "full" account of the Dune plot, it is also a pause from the heart and soul and the main original vision - that of prophecy. Where are the internal monologues that characterize Herbert's writing and show what are the different characters who are thinking, without the need to suddenly change point of view, or to expand words or monologues spoken useless and drawn up? Gone. Much of the original anguish of Paul's decision to choose jihad or death, the choice to fulfill the prophecy or to distance himself from it, certainly the most interesting aspect of the novel itself (and one that fascinates people who are far from the science fiction fans) missing. <br /> <br /> Without prophecy, what is the point of Dune? It is simply a more educated and learned version of Farscape or Andromeda. How sad is all that is provided to us. Lynch's film was flawed, yes. But an imperfect film could lead to a correction by another director, who has taken some of the best points in Lynch's film production and rejects some of the more overwhelming aspects of the style, while restoring the plot. Now this story will probably never be translated into film again, and I find this heartbreaking.
