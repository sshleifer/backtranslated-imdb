I don't even understand what they tried to do with this film, I really mean. Did you get this guy to run away from a bunch of cats, because he's dead, but to be really dead, this girl has to shoot him? And do they leave a corpse even if normal people can't see them because they're dead? The screenplay already has a hole in the size of Nebraska, so you have the main character played by Susan Paterno who straightened her lines with a monotonous, boring voice and with so little emotion on her face that she could even act like a female robot terminator . It's absolutely horrendous and I don't even understand how I managed to see it until the end of the film. The end is as stupid as the whole movie lies to you, and with absolutely no reward in it for the viewer what ever. They could also have called this film "the little movie that could choose choo-choo ka-choo".
