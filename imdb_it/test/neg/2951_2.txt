We were waiting in line to see The Good Girl, an excellent film starring Jennifer Aniston, when a lady invented this twenty-dollar mocking cheapo for the MANNA SKY AD. "Come see this movie!" she said. "You will like it!" <br /> <br /> Then the film's director introduced us. Now this should be our first clue. I mean, in how many cinematic situations do you have the director of the film standing out in the lobby asking people to see it? "Is it a Christian film?" I asked, I really don't care in one way or another. I love Jesus. No shame in this. "No!" he said defensively. How disgusting. <br /> <br /> This film is BAD. So bad. And not only for the obvious Christian agenda, but for the terrible dialogue, the acting that alternates between wood and overexploitation, and the obvious lack of a publisher. The film is too long. If it had been an hour and a half, then maybe (just maybe) I shouldn't have visited the suicide prevention center after seeing the movie. <br /> <br /> Actually, chin. See, after an hour of this garbage we sneaked into SWIMFAN. At least with SWIMFAN we know it's garbage before going to see the movie. We know we are preparing. And SWIMFAN has warm, half-naked people. The only half-naked thing in this film is the desperation of the stars involved whose obvious lack of scripts is far from hidden. And the actress who robbed the nun? It's called personality. Take one. <br /> <br /> People who ruthlessly implored the sale of tickets in the lobby told me that if I liked MY GREAT GREASY GREEK WEDDING, then I would * love * (their emphasis, not mine) MANNA FROM THE SKY. Right. More like, "If you like GLITTER, you will love MANNA FROM THE SKY." And Mariah could actually outclass any clown in this movie. If that's not an insult, then I don't know what it is. <br /> <br /> I have bargained enough. Go see independent films, but don't see the bad ones. This is definitely one of the bad ones. MANNA FROM THE SKY needs some divine intervention.
