Ok, I agree with all Barney haters on this site. I think Barney and his friends are all ugly and ugly and the show is very thin and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But the thing that struck me most is the way Barney introduced Gays, Lesbians and Bisexes. shows when you talk about same-sex parents and relatives. It would not be so much a problem if the creators of this show did not use so many derogatory stereotypes of homosexuals. I mean, not all homosexuals wear mascara and love purple and pink colors, and not all lesbians are ugly and virile with a breast that bends towards the abdomen. As a bisexual woman, I think it's terrible for a children's show. If this was South Park, I wouldn't mind, because South Park is for people who can distinguish fantasy from reality. A lot of people who watch Barney are small or disabled children who normally cannot distinguish fantasy from reality. <br /> <br /> And now that I think about it, Barney looks like a bad gay stereotype. Let's see, he doesn't have a girlfriend, he is pink and he wears sequined clothes (yes, it's true). If you claim to be for the rights of homosexual and bisexual people, then stop making a mockery of yourself in front of people you don't know better. If Barney turned black and ate fried chicken and watermelon at the same time, the show would be taken out of the game before you knew it. <br /> <br /> I give this show a negative one in five. Don't show your kids crap so hateful. There are shows for children out there that are so less offensive.
