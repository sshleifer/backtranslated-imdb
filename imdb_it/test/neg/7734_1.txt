It is impossible to avoid comparing "Hero" of Zhang Yimou to "The Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" by Ang Lee. They were both big-budget Chinese kung-fu films with a breathtaking cinematography of the Chinese landscape and a cast of super stars. But apart from the obvious, there is actually nothing else to compare. `Hero 'fails to reach almost all the levels that really matter, proving that big-name stars, beautiful scenarios and action effects are no substitute for the artistry and vision of a director. <br /> <br /> All the previous advertising campaign before the Hero premiere has done nothing but make its failure a spectacular one. Long-awaited, "Hero" attracted many spectators when it opened in theaters in mainland China and Hong Kong, making it an instant hit at the box office. However, although the script liked government censorship, the Chinese public reached new heights of caustic criticism and sarcastic wit to express their disdain. The online critics, both professionals and amateurs, proclaimed the film "ideologically disturbing", "from the point of view of deep servitude", written "by an amateur historian or someone with ulterior motives". An article was simply titled, "Hero, you make me sick!" <br /> <br /> The deepest failure of the film is in the plot, which is not only morally reprehensible, and based on unforgivable historical fallacy but - the worst of all for a film - it is boring! All the blockbuster epic films are known to take some liberties with the facts of history, but "Hero" goes beyond the artistic license to unforgivable ignorance when it attempts to glorify an emperor as brutal as Stalin or Hitler. `Hero 'does not compensate for this lack of moral compass by having fun or having fun. Instead, it is a sad attempt to be "deep" and is limited to being pretentious and a preacher. <br /> <br /> Although historians agree that the First Emperor of China was ruthlessly violent, Mao Zedong was known to have admired this ruler - no surprise, given Mao's tyrannical rule. Likewise, the communist government of Beijing sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the First Emperor and his iron fist methods, so they were particularly pleased with Zhang Yimou's latest work. Tony Leung, one of the protagonists of "Hero", in an interview pointed out that the Beijing government had done the right thing in 1989 by crushing student demonstrations, because it was necessary to maintain "stability" in China. For these observations, Tony Leung received shocked criticism in his hometown of Hong Kong, but simply declared the film's underlying message out loud. <br /> <br /> Director Zhang Yimou said his goal was to overcome the values ​​of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kung-fu novels and films, to reveal a superior wisdom. Unfortunately, his version of "wisdom" turns out to be: THE OPPRESSOR IS RIGHT. In China, where thousands of years of historical reality rammed this message, art was the last sanctuary in which the individual could actually find freedom from this tyranny. The great popularity of the kung-fu novel can be explained by its ability to provide an escape into an alternative world: one in which kung-fu warriors roamed the country in search of adventures and a struggle for justice, free from fear and winners against any adversity super human skills. Only in the novel the individual has ever conquered institutionalized power in China, and only in the novel have the oppressed found their champions. Going against this tradition of the kung-fu hero, Zhang Yimou did not go upward to a higher truth, as he had hoped, but down to the level of government propaganda. No wonder the government has been so happy. <br /> <br /> Some movie lovers might secretly ask themselves: "All moralistic judgments aside, is it at least funny?" Fortunately, the answer is a resounding "No!" Because the same story is told repeatedly with only minor variations, it becomes boring to watch. Furthermore, the three conflicting versions of the same story only serve to confuse the development of the character, as it leaves the viewer little precious time to feel sympathy for any of them once the "real" version emerges. <br /> <br /> The film is not without beautiful images. However, all the scenes fall flat because they do not connect or improve the plot. The use of different colors to distinguish the separate versions of the story is simplistic and artificial, and cinematography appears self-consciously rather than truly beautiful. Great for a trailer, but a disappointment once you're there to watch the entire movie. <br /> <br /> For those in China who showed contempt for the unreal kung-fu of "The Crouching Tiger", much was expected of Hero. 'Jet Li, who plays the lead role, is a true kung-fu artist who earned national titles before starting his career as an actor. His previous films revealed limited acting abilities, but many hoped that Zhang Yimou could use the supple movements of Li's body to full effect while projecting him correctly into a role that would not involve his acting skills. But it didn't have to be. `Hero 'attempts to go beyond the kung-fu genre, so there are not many fighting scenes, and Jet Li expects him to perform a difficult act of acting: an inner transformation that leads to deep wisdom and self-sacrifice. As the casting director should have expected, Li fails miserably. Meanwhile, the only fighting scene that reveals a real kung-fu skill is the premiere of the film, between Li and Donnie Yen. All the scenes that follow are a disappointment, so "Hero" fails to satisfy, even at that level. <br /> <br /> Although most of the public outside of China is not aware of the distorted history of the cruel First Emperor, it seems even more unlikely that they would accept Zhang's version of "Chinese wisdom", which is far from it. Perhaps the only time an audience from a "Hero" screening was seen smiling - instead of yawning or frowning - was at the special screening for Chinese government officials. <br /> <br />
