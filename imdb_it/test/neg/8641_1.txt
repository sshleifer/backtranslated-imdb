This film is absolute garbage and continues to deteriorate further towards the end, very prolonged! <br /> <br /> The plot is confusing and tiring, the actors have a could not care less attitude (maybe they were paid in advance - bad move, or they knew they would not be paid), and the sets were inform yourself, boring and cheap. I fell asleep twice and actually decided not to worry about the last 5 minutes, since I thought the actors had fallen asleep alone. More irretrievable life time wasted! <br /> <br /> If you have to watch it, take it to the bedroom and forget about sleeping pills once. But maybe you need an antidepressant instead! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's okay if the celluloid degrades.
