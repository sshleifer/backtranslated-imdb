Besides the fact that this is just an abysmal movie (imagine giving a video camera to the average high school acting club) people who think there is something "real" in this legend must grow. This is the 21st century. Guess what: ghosts don't exist. Most people learn from their mother when they are about 5 years old. You guys really need to grow up. <br /> <br /> The fact that a fraud was perpetrated about 2 centuries ago does not make a fraud any less. The fact that a large number of hillbillies inbred by Tennessee believe that it does not even do it. Go to college. Or at least finish high school.
