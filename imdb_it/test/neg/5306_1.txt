I saw a show at 12.45pm last night and went out for 20 minutes. inside, but there was nowhere to go! Bold product placement, youth script, so much wasted talent, gay blame ... what didn't they do? The film is also insanely long (we went out at 3). As a person who rarely pays the full price at the cinema, imagine my disappointment for $ 22 for this self-indulgent and petty nightmare (plus $ 2 parking). I woke up today feeling still depressed, and I couldn't shake it all day. I love Vince Vaughn, and he seemed immediately lost in this thing, as I was. When Cedric the Entertainer is the high-water brand (such a funny little man that he must call himself "the Entertainer" so you understand what he thinks he's doing), you have a serious problem. Furthermore, the appearance of Robert Pastorelli is disturbing, because he died almost a year ago (10 March). This should give you an idea of ​​how long they have polished this asshole. This film is evil. We only stayed to make sure they didn't give Robert an "In memory", which they didn't do. Save yourself! Save your money! Save your soul!
