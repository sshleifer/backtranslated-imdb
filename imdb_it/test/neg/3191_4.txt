I don't usually watch Hollywood dribbling, but I was dragged along with some friends to see this, which turned out to be fun in places but totally devoid of originality. Don't worry, you won't have to think - the Tarantino plot leaves enough obvious clues for us to correctly predict where this is happening about fifteen minutes before each "breakthrough" - I sat there worried that the movie was building well enough for a movie of Hollywood but that would have no place to go to the climax. And the boy realized my fears: YMCA couldn't save this, but Liv Tyler almost did. I guess being male and in my twenties was helpful, but it really made me look good - obviously it didn't have to do much if it didn't look absolutely amazingly sexy, but what he did did well! McCOOL'S will certainly not fall as one of the great Hollywood hits (or should I say "shouldn't" because the mainstream American film industry isn't going anywhere at the moment, and hasn't for at least a decade, unless the odd hit like AMERICAN BEAUTY , TITANIC and SAVE PRIVATE RYAN, and even those have big flaws), but if you're a teenage male, do yourself a favor and see Liv - she's a hot girl. Rating: 5/10. See also: anything by Quentin Tarantino, any American teen movie in the last ten years, anything with sex as the main strength.
