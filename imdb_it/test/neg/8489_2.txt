I liked this movie, not a good one, but not the worst ever made. However, everyone else says it's one of the worst movies ever made, I thought it was okay. There are a lot of immature jokes. Sometimes he wants to be fun, but he fails. <br /> <br /> The story is OKAY. It might be a little difficult for the younger audience to follow, though. <br /> <br /> Acting is pretty bad. Jamie Kennedy is a horrible actor in most cases. Sometimes it's even ridiculous. Alan Cumming is probably the best actor here. It's funny when it should be, but some of his jokes are terrible. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the worst thing about this movie I hated was the voice of Tim Avery when he is possessed by the mask. The item is HORRIBLE. Moreover, the scenes in which it is found are so little fun, that they are almost unbearable. I'm sure they could have cut it out, and it wouldn't have affected the film at all. <br /> <br /> In general, you can live without seeing it. It's a good movie to watch if you have nothing else to look at, though. They could certainly have gone without doing the sequel, but it's a decent effort. 4/10
