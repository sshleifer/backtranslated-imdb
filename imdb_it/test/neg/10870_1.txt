This movie is so ugly that it's funny. I saw the Hell Ride who thought it was a comedy, although I couldn't tell if they were actually taking the p * ss, or if this was indeed a serious attempt to do something decent. I noticed that it is not listed here as a comedy, so they must be serious! Practically it seems to relate to a band of pensioners who ride motorcycles that shoot each other and exchange the most exhilarating dialogue imaginable. A scene inexplicably has two characters that destroy bottles on each other, then they show each other 'get out of jail for free' cards they made! Also check out Vinnie Jones's accent, where the hell does he want to go?!? Oh, there is also a lot of naked girls, who for some unfathomable reason no longer want anything but having sex with these dark leather bedrooms! The guy who wrote it and directed it, a Pee Wee Herman double with a Greeshan 2000 beard and an orange sunbed tan, for some reason put himself in the lead role, maybe that's part of the joke, I don't know . Actually, the more I think about it, the more sure I am that this film is a little bit. It is produced by Quentin Tarantino and it is possible that he published it in humor as a laugh. It's a total rip-off of Tarantino's style, but done really badly. It's still a lot of fun, and I think in both cases it could become a cult classic, or from being a fun parody of the Tarantino / Rodriguez style, or something that's very involuntarily funny. It must be seen to be believed.
