Another film from the hilly Swedish country, which is always the northern part. If black people were shown this way, there would be screams about racism and for good reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a farce and one should laugh at the clich√©s of the "clever" farce. But it's mostly tiring. A gangster comedy, with the bad Russians (as always) and the bad (and stupid) Finns. And the stupidest of all is of course the Norwegian, according to the Stockholm prejudice. <br /> <br /> Andreas Wilson is the only one who tries to make a performance that reminds us of reality. This isn't funny. This isn't even exciting. A burlesque too rough to get you interested in some way.
