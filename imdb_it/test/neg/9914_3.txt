If you thought Day after tomorrow was implausible, wait to see it. <br /> <br /> Okay, the premise of most disaster films is usually a 1 billion event, compounded by other circumstances. In this case, the uniform is the union of two huge storm systems. Just far enough. Oh, but resist, no, the "event" is sabotage and the subsequent destruction of the electricity grid. <br /> <br /> Next launch in a lot of elements of human interest - in this case a cheating husband, a psychotic gun- armed master, a rebel daughter, a hacker with a point to prove, a senator who seeks to push an agenda, a reporter trying to defend himself from "the man", and a pregnant woman stuck in an elevator. <br /> <br /> Finally, add a handful of tasting events to add excitement. <br /> <br /> If the director tried to adapt to more insignificant plot lines, there would have been less time for the real disaster, which, given the pitiful state of computer graphics, was almost certainly the intention. <br /> <br /> Gosh, if you can't even model a truck convincingly, you really shouldn't be taking twisters, exploding power plants, destroying Las Vegas, or destroying oil stations. <br /> <br /> In case you haven't already realized how scary this film is, let me add that three villains are killed in separate and totally ungrateful, implausible ways, that they have more moralized that good movie. I have no problem with the first-month students who write tired, trivial, cliched-soaked scripts, but for god's sake, that doesn't mean that nobody should turn them into movies! <br /> <br /> Can make apocalypse 10.0 not sufficiently scary. Avoid both.
