The brilliant genius of the Australian comic Barry Humphries had a rare failure with this irregular and occasionally unpleasant comedy, which was removed from the release after a few days. The drunk and drunk diplomat, Sir Les Patterson, accidentally sets fire to an Arab potentate at the United Nations and is assigned to his small town as a punishment, arriving just as a coup puts a new leader (American soap star Thaao Penghlis ). Sir Les, with the reluctant help of Dame Edna Everage (both played by Humphries) almost unwittingly foils a scheme of the new leader to release a deadly and disgusting virus similar to AIDS on the Western world. Joan Rivers has a cameo as President of the United States, with her plaque that reads "President Rivers"! Extreme bad taste mixes with slapstick and Humphries' usual satire in a movie that is more fun in its many fun parts, than overall. Dame Edna's TV series fans may be baffled by the presence of another Madge Allsop, unfortunately, one who lacks the wonderful magic comedy of Emily Perry in the role. The film was written by Humphries and his third wife, Diane Millstead, and directed by the same Mad Max, George Miller. For the diehard Humphries fans like me, essential. Everyone else, be careful.
