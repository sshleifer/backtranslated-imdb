I enjoyed the Masters of Horror Series until I came across this pile of infant manure. <br /> <br /> This piece of anti-Bush propaganda disguised as a horror film looks like an episode of the original Batman made by Michael Moore. Political satire should be intelligent, but this pulls a ten on the scale of the simple with all the style and credibility of a L. Ron Hubbard film. <br /> <br /> In his heartless, senseless way, he accuses the Republicans of stealing the elections, going to war for no reason, and treating the military and guards like a simple cannon fodder. It also takes a blow to the second amendment and to religion. All that was missing was Cesare Romero as the President who chuckles with joy at how he orchestrated 9/11. I think the ending should have been the moment when we "support our troops", but I think they would be more offended than happy with all the effort. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the Hollywood elites are in their homes in Malbu fighting each other on their shoulders for this "concise" work while the uninformed anti-war drones acclaim him as a genius. <br /> <br /> It's time to get ready with the new foil hats for kids.
