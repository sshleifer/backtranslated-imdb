Do you know those films that are so unspeakably bad that you have to laugh? Half-caste was not one of them. That sounds good, right? But no, it is not. It's not a bad attempt in a horror movie that is fun to watch because it's lame, or not well acted, or has bad special effects or anything else like that. No, Half-caste is simply boring. They don't even try to be scary until the last 20 minutes are like that. It's just the kids who run in the African countryside and are climbing elephant dung for the first 75% of the movie, and it's not even funny. But the last 20 minutes are HILARIOUS. I have no idea what happened, but it was really fun to see that CGI leopard take the throat out of all those white guys that I couldn't distinguish anyway. If you fancy a bad horror movie, don't rent it, because you'll go to sleep before you get to the fun stuff. If you accidentally rent this movie, I advise you to fast forward to the end and to skip any daylight scene. You will not miss anything. You will have no idea which character is or exactly what is happening even if you look at the whole background.
