OK where do I start? I saw a screening a couple of weeks ago and I was shocked at how bad this movie is. Of course, if you love Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres (bad acting) and you think they are the best TV shows on the air, then you'll surely love this movie. I personally like George's work very much and he is very talented, but comedy is not his forte. Some people are natural in comedy and I'm sure it's great and fun to work with him personally, but he's not able to play it on the big screen. It was a nice movie, but would I pay $ 12.00 to see it? H & LL no !!!! Now that I've seen it, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone to spend their money. George, man, I love you but please don't do comedies anymore? This script is missing a lot, a great concept, but it didn't.
