If you are a pretentious person, it would be a good idea to brag about your intellectuality by saying that you really like this movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, don't disturb yourself and take a look at something beautiful. <Br /> <br /> This is the stereotypical movie for snobs. The plot would be very silly if you could see it from beginning to end. It is just presented in a messy way as an attempt to make it difficult to understand and make the film an intellectual aspect. <br /> <br /> Mullholland Drive is not pleasant to look at. You would rarely understand something the first time you see it. And if you do, you'll probably be disappointed because it's not a big deal.
