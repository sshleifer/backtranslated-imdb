This film is of interest to fans of the famous rock band "The Band" in which singer / keyboardist Richard Manuel appears in different scenes. It seems to me that the film may have been shot a few years before 75, judging by Richard's appearance. Interestingly, Jones would later star in The Band's Levon in a much better film "Coal Miner's Daughter". However, you really need a special reason to survive this tough art film. Alas, the famous and sensitive Manuel would commit suicide. I never felt like it ended up in a movie. Four of the five members of the band will appear in another bad movie "Man Outside".
