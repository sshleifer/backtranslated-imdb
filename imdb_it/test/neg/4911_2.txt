weak direction, weak plot, insignificant music, I wonder why Udita Goswami is there in the world of cinema in the first place? he tried to reveal much of his talent (mostly skin) but failed to impress. <br /> <br /> the music was not so impressive, just a song "Jhalak Dikhlajaa" was worth listening to ..... <br /> <br /> Aksar, the title? Well, they tried to justify the title of the film in the end, but it didn't make sense ... <br /> <br /> There were many unwanted twists in the story, which made it more boring. however if someone is a fan of Dino Morea, please go ahead and watch it.
