STMD! it is not a terrible film, but it is quite forgettable. Lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in everything else, so it is likely that you come out of a vision with headache or eye strain. The special effects are imaginative, but obvious. The free nudity essential for teen slasher films is there, of course, along with the archetypal teenagers, but the whole film doesn't freeze. What was needed was a more engaging dialogue and a more ironic humor. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend that you use your time watching this movie. I often make a nod to a film based on a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor, but unfortunately they are missing in this film.
