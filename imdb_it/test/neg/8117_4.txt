Almost everything Stephen King has ever written seems to have been turned into a movie or TV series; in fact, I'm surprised no one has tried to make a mini series from the boy's shopping list. Let's face it, if they did, it couldn't be less interesting than Children of the Corn. <br /> <br /> Based on one of King's many stories, this 1984 horror movie sees Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton play a couple on a long drive that comes across a bad situation when they run into the sleepy town of Nebraska of Gatlin, where all the adults were murdered by children who worship an ancient evil that lurks in the cornfields. > <br /> Although director Fritz Kiersch manages to create a fair amount of atmosphere at the beginning (after Hamilton's silly song and dance, but before meeting the mad Isaac, the head of the murdering boys), he blows it up completely with endless and bumpy scenes in which Hamilton and Horton are hunted by the half-murderous pints of the city. Courtney Gains, like Malachai, a violent redhead, manages to look really threatening, but the rest of the children are not in the least threatening; as a result, many of the film's "scary" moments fail to work. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, when we finally see the evil force that inhabits the field around Gatlin, the film descends into a mass of terrible 1980s optical effects that probably looked pretty good for almost 25 years ago, but it seems really ridiculous nowadays. <br /> <br /> Corn kids might be interested in King fans eager to see how the writer's work has been translated to the big screen, but your average horror movie fan will be the most indifferent.
