It is a strange and bizarre film and does not deserve a better grade than David Lynch's! The special effects are badly made, the actors are decidedly bad actors and in this film it is not a race that is the minority of a planet and tries to fight against the dominators, but it seems to be a crazy film, which pays homage to the of sect organization. It is certainly not the will of Frank Herbert, the author of the epic of six episodes! Take a look at David Lynch's, this is the perfect tribute to the novels!
