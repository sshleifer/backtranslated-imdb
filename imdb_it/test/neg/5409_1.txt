If you like to have a few fleeting glimpses of neckline on some attractive women, there could be a second or two of enjoyment from this movie. If you like to see badly designed and executed "action" scenes, there are many. If you are blind and deaf, I advise you not to have this movie in your presence. It's definitely the worst or very close to the worst movie I've ever seen. And there seems to have been money spent on this. Talk about throwing money away! As a publisher, I hope that the "editor (s?)" Of this "film" is never authorized to edit a film, a book or even a post-it. As a writer, I hope the author (s?) Is never allowed even near a broken crayon. You'd think he's not recommending you to see this movie. Not like that. Tape it (so you can stop the pain when needed) and educate yourself about how bad a movie can be.
