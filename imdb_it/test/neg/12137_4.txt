Boring as hell and kind of a chick flick. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a commercial agreement, the romantic nature of a night and the uncertainty and pitfalls of true love. <br /> <br /> Many of the reasons in the story resemble other recent KST films (for example the English patient), but they have much less appeal. <br /> <br /> After the first semester - Now I started checking my watch, wondering if I would be home in time to catch Leno on TV. <br /> <br /> I passed the "Gladiator" to see this!?!
