I can not believe! Were they crazy about making a movie about Connecticut in southern California? For God's sake, there's Palm Tree everywhere. In one of the opening scenes a boy says "Welcome to Connecticut" and throws a newspaper, the newspaper says something like "Greenwich Herald". Greenwich Connecticut does not have a "Herald" has a "Times" as in "Stamford Advocate AND THE GREENWICH TIMES". (Referring to the newspaper Stamford, Connecticut). Maybe the filmmakers should have done a little research, I mean, my god, at least have the name of the right newspaper, or films in places that seem at least as distant as Connecticut.
