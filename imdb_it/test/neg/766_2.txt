Tom and Jerry transport goods by plane to Africa. But being white men, they are worried that they are not safe, so they wear black faces to fit. Once they wear it, they adopt the black dialect and live their new characters fully. They crash into the ocean and use the wing of the plane as a raft. Before reaching the earth, they suffer the advances of an octopus that is too affectionate and the most serious danger of sharks, a swordfish and a whale. Once on the ground, they are frightened by fantastic creatures and dive into a cave. Inside it is even worse when they encounter living skeletons in the black face. And once you get out of the cave, things are even worse than when they are discovered by cannibals. <br /> <br /> "Plane Dumb" is a particularly neglected effort by Van Beuren Studios. An example: a lion, unknown to Tom and Jerry, enters the cave before them. But the animators must have forgotten about it, because the lion never appears again. Another example is the ending which is not an ending: it is just an arbitrary stop. <br /> <br /> According to a YouTube poster, the comic "was originally intended to present the voices and caricatures of a popular" Negro "comedy known as Miller & Lyles. But Aubrey Lyles died of tuberculosis before the session recording was completed, and co-directors John Foster and George Rufle were forced to rework the animation into a "Tom & Jerry" story. <br /> <br /> They shouldn't have bothered. The raw animation and the poorly executed gags make the film a loser from beginning to end.
