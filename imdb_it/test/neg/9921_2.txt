This was a sordid and sad disaster. I needed a shower when it was over. Something like this happens: some socialites are killed and a homicide detective is assigned to the case. He discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society and makes friends with a colleague of the group who could have relevant information. Since the detective is an attractive woman, she is obviously excited and intrigued (which reveals a lot about Hollywood and her psychosis about women). What is surprising is that none of this is very sexy or interesting, just depressing and disgusting. Ellen Barkin gives a respectable performance as principal detective, and Julian Sands provides involuntary laughter as a cross-dressing psychiatrist, which is why he escapes a one-star rating.
