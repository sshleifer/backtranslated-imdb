This movie is bad. Very bad. In absolute terms, bad. <br /> <br /> The dialog box jumps off the screen and projects you in the face with its completely artificial lines and defecates your ability to detect even traces of subtlety. <br /> <br /> Racism is bad. Racism in Los Angeles can be particularly negative. I live in the city of Angels, I can attest to it. The terrible thing about bigotry in Los Angeles is its insidious nature. It insinuates you with a wise look or a swallowed word. Up to the limit of a punching fight, he almost never arrives and says "because he had to be black!" <br /> <br /> I can see clearly enough that the car jacks are black, the detective's companion is Hispanic, the DA is white. As long as there is a film flowing through the projector, I can let the images, the music and the words bring me to that conclusion without limiting myself to telling me the conclusion. Emote characters, and we read between the lines to make connections and conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a partnership and trust between director and audience. That trust is raped by this movie. <br /> <br /> A good movie takes you in directions like an audience, and guides you with directions to get to a point. This movie hits you with its point and insults you and your intelligence along the way. My unanswered question is: why do we, as a society, say collectively, "thank you?"
