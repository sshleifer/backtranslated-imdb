You can sit in total astonishment in this chaos of a movie and have fun in some of the raves that people have given. The biggest problem seems to be the director's inability to decide whether it is black comedy, farce or a combination of both. It runs everywhere looking for a direction and has some absolutely embarrassing exhibits that could be better suited to a bad sitcom. What a pity to see the talented talents of Dianne Wiest squandered and the always irritating Jane Birkin is so exaggerated that she is more annoying than usual. <br /> <br /> Perhaps many of the positive criticisms are due to the "bizarre". The "French nature of the film", therefore, is labeled "intelligent" or "ingenious". It is neither nor is it a bad tripe that leaves a rather rancid aftertaste. Merchant-Ivory should stick to serious things as they certainly have no understanding of comedy.
