I jumped for joy to learn this finished show. The characters on this show were extremely irritating. None of them had the quality of a ransom. Damon Wayans is probably the most reliable. Kisha Campbell is ... Kisha Campbell. It's just as annoying as Martin. <br /> <br /> Even children are very annoying. The older one is an idiot, the older girl is a marmorosa and the younger one is frustrating to hear. I think I liked the smart kid. But that's all. <br /> <br /> He did the world a favor by ending. <br /> <br /> We pray that Wayan never plays another show ... NEVER.
