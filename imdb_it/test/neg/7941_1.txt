The original "Assault on Precinct 13" is gritty, witty and - perhaps the most important thing - short. This remake is mercilessly filled and chatty. Worse still, the African-American hero of the first film is here replaced by the handsome white boy Ethan Hawke, who makes this "Assault" less progressive than the 1970s. God, I miss John Carpenter and his unlikely plot and his strange sense of humor. I also miss his B-list actors, who are better than the Hawke championships and the company. <br /> <br /> I can't say I worry about the new villains in this version - they extend the lack of credibility that history has ever had to the limit. The female characters are useless, the criminals are all generic, and Gabriel Byrne gives another one of his bored performances. Music is also completely wrong - it's a bland action that actually diminishes tension. Simply terrible.
