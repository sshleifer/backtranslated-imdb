WARNING!!! SOME SPOILERS POSSIBLE FROM PLOT, AS IF IT WAS POSSIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Ok, if you haven't understood the plot yet, I'll give it to you. Two couples head for a campsite, but a masked clown killer shows up and causes all sorts of chaos. <br /> <br /> Now it's time for me to give some advice to these couples. <br /> <br /> 1. Never ever go to the camp nicknamed Camp Blood by the locals. 2. Don't have sex or find out in front of the killer. 3. Don't hunt down the killer if he runs away. 4. Don't shout bad words at the killer. 5. Make sure your mobile phone works before you go camping. 6. Everyone must carry a sharp or dangerous weapon and always carry it on itself. 7. Wear loose, comfortable clothes and wear a good pair of running shoes. No tight and binding clothing and no high heels or sandals. 8. Wear glasses or contact lenses if you need them so you don't stab the wrong person. 9. Always carry your car keys with you. 10. Turn off a campfire when you go to bed. 11. Watch your passage. If you stumble on something, you're about to break a bone. 12. Check the rear seat for unforeseen circumstances. 13. If the killer has you cornered, at least make a fight. <br /> <br /> And guess what? At least one, but usually all four main characters break all these common sense rules. They are the most stupid characters ever to match a movie. <br /> <br /> Now for some brief comments. This slasher film had a very limited budget. So four of the 7 or 8 low actors play more than one role. Acting, writing, direction, sound, lighting, camera work, plot, editing, etc. They are all at the end of the line. But like the classic film JACK O, this works on a nasty boozo, it's very funny and fun. So rent this and have fun and laugh. My vote: 5 out of 10.
