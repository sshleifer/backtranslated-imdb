Well, after the clamor surrounding the film and after Surya labeled the film as PATH-BREAKING, I went to the cinema expecting something big. Boy was disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characterizations of the film are so strange! Which wife would do what Kundhavi (Jyothika) did? An idiot, coo-coo? And what was the point of her standing in the rain with her baby (Baby Shreya) after she and her husband had quarreled? What was the purpose of that scene anyway? To start a vulgar blow "Maaja Maaja"? Not only was the song not aesthetically canned, it was not simply necessary in the script. NOT NECESSARY TO ALL! Secondly, the first half had virtually no history. The entire first semester was a FREAKING resistance. Each scene in the first half of the film had no meaning with regard to the true story of the film. And besides, how did Aishwarya (Bhoomika Chawla) suddenly change so radically? And why did Gautham (Surya) and Kundhavi lead a happy life together after six years, even though they were so unhappy about getting married to each other? What if Gautham loved Aishwarya as he claimed he did, because DID even married Kundhavi even though it was his uncle's death wish? WHY? This is the question you keep asking while watching the movie! And how right is the Aishwarya finale? After all, was Gautham's first wife? Krishna, the film's director, claimed to have worked on the script for this film for two years, but his script is full of flaws and leaves the audience completely irritated! Thirdly, Krishna's unimaginative images of Rahman's marvelous are disappointing. Surprisingly, the editing of Anthony (usually superb) for the song "New York Nagaram" sucks! The whole song seemed to be a presentation made on Microsoft Power Point! "Munbe Vaa" Rangoli's choir was wasted showing Gautham PLAYING SOCCER !!! Who wants to see the crazy guy play soccer during such a beautiful choir?!? What's more, the whole movie only needed two songs. Munbe Vaa and Kummi Adi. The rest of the songs including "Machakari", "Maaja Maaja", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal" are not necessary. Rahman's good efforts are simply wasted on a stupid movie directed by an amateur director! Fan of Rahman, ask why Rahman moves to Bollywood. After examining the way his songs are performed in Kollywood, why would he want to stay here? The most irritating thing is that after Krishna decided to include Machakari in the film, the song was cut in half which really, really annoys. <br /> <br /> Surya looks beautiful in her new clothes except those during college scenes and packs in such and such a performance. His expressions during all the songs in which he was presented do not match the way the singer sings the songs. Was Jyothika even acting in the film? All he did was SHOUT! Would you call everything that cries acting? One of his worst performances ever! Besides, her new hairstyle is not good for her. It looked much better to Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu. His costumes during the song "New York Nagaram" are far away. Bhoomika Chawla is simply beautiful during the film and does justice to her role. Vadivelu's comedy is ANCORANTE. When one looks at him, one would like to be able to slap him in the face. It is Santhanam who is the thief of the show during the comedy scenes. And why the hell did he make Sukanya agree to do such a tiny role anyone could do? And why is his makeup so heavy when he has the perfect complexion? Music by A.R. Rahman is simply fantastic. "Machakari", "Munbe Vaa", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal" deserve a special mention. The cinematography of R.D. Rajasekhar is OK and not as good as his previous films, although the scenery of the song "Kummi Adi" deserves a special mention. Anthony's editing is really very disappointing. The film is so terribly messy and could be severely cut. <br /> <br /> Krishna's direction sucks. The dialogues (A.C. Durai and Krishna) are too trivial to digest especially the part where Bhoomika professes his love for Surya. The script and script (Krishna) are horrible. The film moves in the most uninteresting rhythm ever. And Krishna's script is full of unexplained sub-frames. <br /> <br /> And for heaven's sake, why was there so much publicity in the film? You call him Pepsi, Maggi, Suzuki. Was the film's producer (K.E. Gnanavel) low-budget or simply desperate? Overall, Jillunu Oru Kaadhal is a wet squib. With such a title, one would expect a love story that warms the heart and cools, but what ends up is a painful love story. Really, really disappointing.
