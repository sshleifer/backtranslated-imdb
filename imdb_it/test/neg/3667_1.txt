<br /> <br /> In Japan and elsewhere in Europe the new technology allows filmmakers to bypass the closed store of Hollywood's mainstream and avoid Ed Wood as visible low-budget production values ​​to produce compelling films. What a pity that in the UK we can find examples like "Avatar" (name of many video games) in which brain attempts are made to imitate so many movies - and game consoles loved by teenagers without girlfriends - which in turn are cheap photocopies of clichés abound like testosterone-powered kangaroos. Find out about the synopsis: <br /> <br /> "Set in the futuristic London of 2024, it tells the story of a team of stereotypes of virtual reality viruses that clash against the definitive Internet virus." <br /> <br /> Go back and read that quote again - avoid laughter - and try to find a single original idea in it. This should have seemed a tired and sad concept in 1993, it does not matter, 2003. Ah, but there is more - the "final virus" has already caused the arrest of aircraft, the control of the air traffic control center, etc. It was developed from a "childlike genius" and manifests itself as a stupid imitator of Lara Croft, a lean, athletic and muscular woman, who makes a big joke of snarling martial arts and cod coming out of the playground - the living product of fantasy adolescent. Oh, and she is accompanied by "Predator" sound effects to emphasize her remarkable powers. <br /> <br /> The whole has a "futuristic" vision of extraordinary originality - the Lloyds building filtered with AfterEffects seems a bit green. The budget really shows - something that should not be on this day. Overall, a useless mess of cheese, ham and cliché that Roger Corman would have left on the cutting room floor in his most shameless and desperate moments. Too bad that such alleged labor of love produced nine minutes of wasted celluloid. <br /> <br />
