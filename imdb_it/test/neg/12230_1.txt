Do all spoofing movies require pure stupidity and the lack of ANY kind of intelligence of any kind for humor? Is there even just one genuinely funny parody movie? All I see are zero quality movies that look like a year when a couple of high school students got bored with a video camera. These films are not funny, they are not intelligent, they are not funny, they are just useless in every way imaginable. <br /> <br /> The Comebacks was a film that tried to hide its horrible level of garbage by not calling itself "Sports Movie". It's the same thing though. There are some different writers for these films, the Wayans have made them, Freidberg and Seltzer have made others, and I'm sure there's another one. I can't even tell the difference in direction or humor to be honest, it all seems like they were the same people writing and directing them. I can't say if the Comebacks were made by the people who made Scary Movie or the guys who made Epic Movie, or someone else, they're just the same jokes from everyone else. <br /> <br /> If you have ANY shred of taste or value for humor, don't see this movie. If you have self-esteem, don't worry about seeing it. If you have ANY respect for the making of a film, don't even think about watching it. Don't see it in any discontinuity, in an abandoned theater that can still carry it, not rent it out, don't order it on Netflix or Pay-Per-View, don't edit it and don't even look for free on OD. Avoid it like the plague. <br /> <br /> The only plausible reasons I can see to watch this film are the following. <br /> <br /> A. Masochism. If you like torturing yourself, there are very few better ways. B. See a first example of why avoid ANYTHING that says "Fox Atomic". C. You will be paid considerable amounts of money. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't really look at the whole thing if someone offered me $ 100 to do it. It's just a mindless mental collapse torment. <br /> <br /> You could also see Zohan.
