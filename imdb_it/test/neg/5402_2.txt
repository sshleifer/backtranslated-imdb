A lot of people who have seen this are confused, of course. The original title of "Cottonmouth Joe" would put things in a better perspective for much of the viewing audience. I personally experienced the condition of cottonmouth (often accompanied by a really bad hangover after a weekend bender) and it is really very similar to the film Skeleton Man - a dry and mushy film that causes regret for recent choices and begs for a hot shower . <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the choice of "Skeleton Man" for the title was developed by the distributor (probably the work of some intransigent Hollywood with no studio exec who didn't understand it) and not "Cottonmouth Joe". Those of us who have seen the film know that the Skeleton Man is actually Cottonmouth Joe (a skeletal-manish appearance, not a true Skeleton Man). The deception of the people who market this film is unforgivable, and for that alone, I cannot give this film a high score. Imagine this: when future directors come together to create the true and definitive Skeleton Man movie and need a title, they will be totally screwed and we are all, as fans of the genre, much diminished by this. <br /> <br /> Cottonmouth Joe may have become an icon of horror film right next to Madman Marz, Black Claw, Mansquito, Humongous, "Nature Boy" Billy Conners, Morty the wooden doll, Boogen, Eegah , The beast of the moon, Bloody Bill, the Assassin Assassin, Mickey Rooney, and so on, but will always be remembered as a fake skull with a sword and with the face turned towards the side of an aspiring horse skeleton. <br /> <br /> It's too bad.
