My phrase paraphrased above the slogan on the back of the DVD box sums it up: this film was much more horrible than horrible. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've ever seen as long as I can remember. My wife accidentally rented it thinking it was Tom Cruise's version. The ridiculously raw special effects on the menu screen should have made us miss them. Free nudity already in the opening scene made us more suspicious. <br /> <br /> But as the film progressed, we were numbed by the clumsy acting - over and under-acting - non-continuity in directing and editing, trivial writing and raw special effects. We gave up after half an hour or less; after starting so badly, it certainly could not improve. <br /> <br /> Since I disregard reviews that deal with a product without giving details, here are some examples of the particularly difficult moments in the film, even if they amount to spoilers: <br /> <br /> - The main character says goodbye to his old son, while the latter is about to run away with his mother, the latter pungent because it is their wedding anniversary, but the lead does not come because of sudden business. The son asks, quietly worried, "will I ever see you again?" Perhaps it should come as a premonition, but instead presents itself as an incongruous behavior for a child of that age in that situation. <br /> <br /> - A huge alien spaceship crashed into the earth and sits in a huge crater. A crowd of people is nearby, scrutinizing it uncomfortably, but otherwise it seems generally unaltered. A woman finally says "it's already normal!" <br /> <br /> - After this ship has devastated a village and its inhabitants, the lead and a spectator, now alone near their homes and trying to load their cars for an escape, exchange something like this , in a quietly puzzled tone: <br /> <br /> "What was that thing, anyway?" "I don't know ..." <br /> <br /> - A crowd trying to evacuate on a bridge is blocked by the military, since part of the bridge is destroyed. When an alien ship fires at an explosive, the crowd starts to escape, apparently just because a manager told them so, not because they are scared or in any kind of real danger, not to mention unusual circumstances. <br /> <br /> And so on ... writing about the film is not up to the actual experience of seeing it. But please, PLEASE save the annoyance, even if your morbid curiosity is tickled! The film is so ugly that it can't even be enjoyed as an involuntary humor (against, for example, "Solomon & Sheeba" by King Vidor with Yul Brynner wearing a wig). Life is too short to waste the vision of such nonsense. There must be something more productive and enjoyable to do, like walking with a dog or cleaning a bird cage.
