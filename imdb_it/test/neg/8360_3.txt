In the real world of art, Elizabeth Wurtzel is the queen of sexy drama that every guy wants to do, but no guy wants to wake up beside him. Her screen portrait artist, Christina Ricci, is the ugly girl with artistic aspirations who desperately wants every and every guy, but no boy will touch her. That's why, in Prozac Nation, the unpublished 2001 film of the homonymous best-selling novel by Wurtzel, there are immediate problems. OK, the problems start before Ricci's loathing, which has the emotional range of a thimble - is it any wonder if, by far, his best acting was in the Addams family movies? First of all, it looks bizarre - with large eyes and a swollen forehead, which make it look like the fetid Starchild of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Secondly, she always plays bitch. But thirdly, it is the way in which films try to make a boy look like he is attracted to her. In a scene from the movie, his friend Ruby (Michelle Williams) and Liz walk through Harvard, and all the boys' languages ​​are shaking Ricci, not the super-cute and sexy Williams. Hello ??. Now the reality check ?? This material has implored Andy Warhol's treatment. Here is his version of the film. A five-minute shot of a hypodermic needle. A five-minute shot of Wurtzel's hairy pudenda. A five-minute shot of her sleeping naked and stoned on the bed. He gets up, gives the middle finger to the public. Cue credits. See, less than twenty minutes to distill Wurtzel's entire life. And, oh yes, Warhol's movie wouldn't have launched Ricci. Even Michelle Williams would have been better, and after seeing Ricci's pale breasts, I would have taken anything that Williams or any other child had had to offer me cinematically. Ricci is almost the kiss of death for a film, and the way he is working is a mystery. Think of his performances in mediocre or bad films like Woody Allen's Monster, Sleepy Hollow, and Anything Else - even with Jason Biggs, and now imagine another actress in his role, and immediately the movies might look better, if not exceptional. It is the female counterpart of banal, wooden actors, millionaires like Tom Cruise and Leonardo Dicaprio.
