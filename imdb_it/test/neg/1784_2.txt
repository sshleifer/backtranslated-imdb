If this film had been made two years earlier, it could have been much better. But unfortunately, it was made in the decade that he had no idea how a horror movie should appear or act. When I first heard about this movie, people on IMDb classified it as a sequel to Cheerleader Camp. Oh, how wrong they were. Yes, there was Betsy Russell but Uma Thurman was not. I would really like to find the person who started this whole sequel entry. I'm sure many of us would do it anyway. I will leave nothing because frankly I don't remember how this movie ends! I'll just tell you to watch a horror movie on the field ... The Burning with Jason Alexander, Fisher Stevens, Holly Hunter and the Fast Times geek at Ridgemont High. A word for the essay - Just because a horror movie has the word field in the title, doesn't mean it will be worth seeing. Oh, and another thing, ANY FLICK HORROR MADE IN THE SPRING AT MID 90'S HAS NEVER ALSO BEEN CONSIDERED REMOTE GOOD!
