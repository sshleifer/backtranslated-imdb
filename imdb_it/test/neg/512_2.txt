I think vampire movies (usually) are evil. Although the film itself is not that good, I still like it because it has vampires. But this stinks. It really gives a bad name to vampire movies. <br /> <br /> For starters, convenience really shows. I don't usually care about low-budget movies: one of my favorite movies of all time is El Mariachi, which only costs $ 7,000, but I hate it. Even actions do a lot of crap, using an "elegant" camera that causes a headache. <br /> <br /> There's not much more to say than not watching it. I bought it for Â£ 1.50 because it was an ex-rental and I feel cheated by my money, even for that low price.
