This so-called movie is horrible! Actors cannot act. There is no plot. I think they have to start from scratch and film again. I hope they can correct the acting defects in this film. I'd like to see the trailer after shooting it. Perhaps there is hope for this. I'm not going to hurt my feelings, but I think high school kids can do a better job. The wardrobe could have been much better. Sorry, but that didn't do it for me. I usually like the trailers on this site but ... I can't find this funny. I hope they take the good criticism because I believe they will get much more from others with regards to this film.
