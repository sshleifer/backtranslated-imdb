Let me state this from the beginning. I DO NOT hate this show. Actually I like some aspects of this. In fact, when I started watching it, I quickly became attracted to it. I was just starting to get out of the "anime is for kids" stereotype, and the mature elements of the show intrigued me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after seeing the whole series and some of the films, I can say that my general layout has changed, and falls into almost all the pitfalls that plague "bad" souls. Seven or eight friends and I started watching this series on TV. In the end, only a friend and I were still watching and none of us liked it. <br /> <br /> Allow me to explain the plot for you. You can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know. Kagome is an average high school student who one day falls into a magic well near his family-run sanctuary. When kagome leaves the well again, it was transported back in time to the feudal era of Japan. Meet many other characters and form a group of five or more companions who undertake a journey of revenge / justice / groping in a case of characters =). Overall, they are trying to recover the pieces of the fragment of a sacred jewel that increases the power of the demons that use it. <br /> <br /> While there are many, MANY secondary stories and narrative arcs, there were not enough material neighbors to occupy 167 episodes. The only arc of the story that is interesting enough to watch is still a bit boring (the band of seven). After the sign in the middle of the series or maybe even before, it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen and the one who made the series decided instead to insert dozens and dozens of filling episodes. <br /> <br /> These episodes have little or no impact on the story, and rarely even on the characters. In some cases, some characters that have played an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time. Many episodes follow exactly the same cookie clipping pattern as previous stories. Inuyasha shoots the enemy with the wind scar. Windscar deviates. The characters startle in horror. The enemy discovers he has a barrier. Characters have spent three episodes trying to kill the enemy before Kagome finally throws them at the sacred arrow and turns to dust. <br /> <br /> Also ** GREATEST SHOW: THE CONCLUSION WILL BE REVEALED ** the lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you've put 83 hours to life. <br /> <br /> ** GREATER SPOILER ABOVE ** <br /> <br /> The animation itself is above average and in some cases excellent. Even so, re-used animation cells afflict most action scenes, and it is very difficult to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same boulder has flown past a character five or six times in a row. <br /> <br /> the brighter side anyway, all the characters are very well developed and the love stories between some characters are really captivating. Furthermore, character designs (appearances) have been brilliant and sometimes among the best I've seen, particularly with the band of seven. There is absolutely no shortage of Cosplay opportunities here. Even so, I found myself hoping that a character would die just so there would be some sort of movement in the plot. And a bit of humor in the show between the characters is used again and again. A special joke (sit boy) is found in the first five episodes, and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining 162 episodes. <br /> <br /> Although there are some positive aspects of the show and it's easy to see why it has a huge following, the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan fans drooling over Sesshomiru and InuYasha. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Definitely worth checking out, but it's not worth looking at the whole series. The first 30 episodes are very intelligent, original and fun for everyone. But after that, it becomes simply boring and boring. Watching a TV show should never seem like a chore, but somehow this series succeeds exactly. Don't expect much from "InuYasha", because you will only feel disappointed.
