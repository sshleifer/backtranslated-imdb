Horribly ugly film refers to a croupier who wants to be a writer and to the accidents that make up casino life. It moves at a snail's pace. Boring, boring, boring! Virtually everything about this film is amateur and unconvincing - with a noteworthy exception: the performance of Clive Owen, who is like a Rolls Royce purring in a slum. A suggestion for the casino sequences was supposedly provided by a professional, but judging by the way they are managed they were completely ignored by the director. While the casino staff may very well be a different breed from the rest of the world, they are not nearly as cunning and witty as the characters featured in this script. Bets and spikes are thrown into the script in an attempt to provide a convincing background, but they would appear to have been noted on a list on a cocktail napkin. For anyone who makes their living in the casino industry (as the writer wrote in the last forty years), this is a representation of their poverty-stricken world that, even in the most remote and obscure places in England, has NEVER been so eager! A shocking and offensive mess of a film that trudges, limps and trudges along an idiotic and unconvincing ending. American critics loved it.
