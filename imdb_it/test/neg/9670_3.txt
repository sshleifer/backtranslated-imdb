After seeing Shootfighter 1, and the buckets of blood spilling, I was ready for another exciting trip of open-handed cardiac massage and chiropractic in a cage. But nooooooo, this was like Barney's version of the first movie, with that motto of Karate boy. At least Bolo Yeung still pulls the loot, although he needs to make more movies like Bloodsport and Caddyshack.
