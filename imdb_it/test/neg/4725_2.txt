The following "review" is one from the wrong side of the tracks, which means two things: you will hear nothing but praise from me and not be fooled by my judgment. I could also tell you that this review does not contain spoilers, but technically ... this is a lie. <br /> <br /> Well, ... Screw the review. I'm just wandering around a bit. It's been a while since I had so much fun with such a bad movie. And if you can't enjoy this piece of madness, you simply don't have a sense of humor. First of all, this film had to be taken seriously, and this is the main aspect from which the fun comes. History? A doctor's son is terminally ill. Dad decides that a limb transplant should be the only way to save his son. So, in the style of a mad doctor, he decides that a gorilla's heart will do the trick. Obviously, the heart of the gorilla is "too powerful for a human", so the sonny-boy turns into this horrible Ape-Man who immediately frees himself and continues to kill and rape (because it is simply what any horny beast would do, not it's true?). The make-up of our Ape-Man is hilarious. There is simply no other way to say it: the boys' faces look like an asshole! I'm talking about human excrement here, the dark brown guy! Very beautifull! Even the blood in this film is wonderful: apart from the actual footage of an open heart surgery, we also have incredibly false (but rather unpleasant) effects of blood and blood: a beheading, a gouging of the eyes, a tear in the throat, the scalping of someone's skull, ... It's fun, and it's actually quite incomprehensible why NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APE ever made it to the infamous Nasties video list in the UK, because all the bad things portrayed in this movie are just too much ridiculous to be taken seriously. Oh, and there's even a bloody monkey running into it. So, needless to say, the HORRIPILIAN BEAST HUMANA is a much more accurate title for this terrifying and convincing science story that went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> When you do not try to shock bloody violence or casual portraits of female nudity, this film manages to be a lot of fun with ingredients like meaningless dialogues, cheap cartoon sets, plot stupidity and incredibly acting bad. Just a few random examples, perhaps? Set information: you can clearly see that the set designers have repeatedly used the same walls, doors, windows (etc.) to create different different interior sets (for example: one side of the hospital room - the side of the window - where it lies the girl in the unconscious struggle, seems suspiciously similar to the side of the basement laboratory window from which Ape-Man escapes: even the set designers took one of the side windows of the laboratory, made it a little bigger and just placed in the conference room of the hospital: all the walls of each building are the same as the gray ones; ...). Then there is the setting of the park. Clearly filmed in a studio, it is possible to see (on several occasions) that the grass is free. Whenever there is a little struggle / fight / rape, the grass moves and moves and you can see the gray cement from the study plan below. <br /> <br /> Only a few random lines coming out of the actors' mouths: <br /> <br /> - In the conference room where all the doctors are discussing the disappearance of Unconscious Wrestling Girl (a disappearance that would obviously mean bad advertising for the hospital), Dad-Doctor intelligently pronounces "We are in a difficult situation". <br /> <br /> - During the same debate a colleague-doctor cleverly comments "A sleepwalker! Every sleepwalker gets up", thus providing a solid excuse for the disappearance of Unconscious Wrestling Girl. <br /> <br /> - After our investigative investigator, through the incredible process of his logical deduction, concludes and tells his superior that the killer must be a half-man / half-beast, his superior replies that it is absurd, adding the phrase "It is more likely that recently, more and more, you are looking at many of those images of terror on your television" ... Truly one of the best lines in the film. <br /> <br /> Other sources of laughter: <br /> <br /> - The two scenes were the doctor-dad and his assistant Igor abducts the gorilla from the zoo and the Unconscious Wrestling Girl from the hospital - these well-considered kidnappings are like taking candy from a child. <br /> <br /> - Dad-Doctor talks a lot with God, right? <br /> <br /> - Sonny-boy calls Daddy Dad on more than one occasion. <br /> <br /> - An old lady screams "Aaargh !!! A dead man! A dead man! A dead man !! A DEAD MAN !!!". <br /> <br /> - The plot breaks off periodically to bask in scenes of struggling women, just to go on again and do nothing with that concept. Of course, the Daddy replaces Sonny-Boy's gorilla-heart a second time with that of Unconscious Wrestling Girl, but do you think something spectacular happens afterwards? Like Ape-Turd-Man breasts growing or something, trying to rape men this time? Our main wrestling life (Norma Lazareno) does not even participate in a climatic struggle with Ape-Turd-Man near the end of the film ... But Ape-Turd-Man begins to show a certain maternal love towards the end. .. almost (and I say "almost") in true KING KONG style (ie the upper part of a building and the people on the ground pointing and screaming). <br /> <br /> Ok, I think it's enough now I chipped more than my two cents here Vomitron's Rational Rating for this sleazy hilarious piece of dreck: 2/10 Vomitron's Rating From the Wrong Side of the Tracks: 8/10 Go see this movie, folks, it's worth it !
