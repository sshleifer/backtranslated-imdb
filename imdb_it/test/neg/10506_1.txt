I hope the people who made this film read these comments. The choreography was horrible, the plot was void, and the actors where such low power rangers appear 5 stars for this junk. <br /> <br /> Combat scenes in which so slowly you see the actors who expect each other to perform the next move. Video cameras and poor lighting could not cover the economic effects. The lightning was simply stupid. The weapons resembled something of a final fantasy game, and the double bow and arrow were as boring as anything I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Next movie you decide to try investing in some wireless microphones, better scripts and proof actually spend some time in your stunts. <br /> <br /> Honestly there are TV shows that always play at night and are thrown together in a few hours that look better than this. <br /> <br /> Attached to martial arts (unless it is as poor as your way of acting) then resume quilting.
