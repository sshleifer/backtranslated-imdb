Corny and horrible, I wasn't surprised that this short-lived show didn't make it. I remember fondly when Tales From the Crypt tried to reuse these trivial episodes as if they were really scary. Coupled with bad acting and lousy music, I was surprised that this poor show was ever conceived. It has never manifested itself and one can be grateful only for this circumstance.
