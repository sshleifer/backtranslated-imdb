I went to see this movie to kill some time. I remember Cole Hauser in "Tigerland", and although his acting is wood, he plays a "leading" character hard. Me too. This film was about a group of young scientists and divers exploring a cave in Romania that needs to be immersed to see. The start scene was very interesting, with a group of Romanian or Russian men exploring the cave in search of the loot. 30-year flash forward, and we have a team of divers called by some scientists and their crew to explore some caves for unknown scientific purposes. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of clich√©s, useless speeches. Women are too hot for their work, let's face it. I hate to watch the lips of these women talking about the boys drinking beer at the pre-cave exploration party. I mean, it was like we were in a bar with brothers and sisters talking about the opposite sex - not a group of scientists and divers. Each character had a ZERO personality, with the possible exception of the scientist, who at least was not one of the young and beautiful. Therefore, acting, although in a workmanlike manner, was not stimulating. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was pretty bad. At one point in the film, Cole Hauser ("Jack"), the head diver - his irises turn into the wireless symbol of Cingular, and remain that way. We are led to believe that, since he was scratched by one of these monsters, he is turning into one of them. Quite right. But first of all, no one says the obvious thing for him: "What's up with your EYES, man?" No. Everyone has just talked about how he "changed" and that he should no longer be the head of the group. And then this guy says "see how it's not HUMAN". Eh? If they really believed he was a fucking monster, then why not act like him? Instead, the group splits into two: those who go with Jack, and those who go separately, I think they consider him a monster. It does not make sense. <br /> <br /> The best scene of the film was that this blonde woman climbs a cave wall and is attacked by this goblin. His scream really sucked - but he fought like crazy to free the goblin. <br /> <br /> The photograph was fine when the camera was STILL. But every action sequence, the director has found it useful to confuse us with flashing bubbles, flashlights, dark space, god knows what. I would like them to show us a scene once in a while. Just because you move the camera everywhere, the movie doesn't do SCARIER, people. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been much better if the following changes had been made: <br /> <br /> 1. each actor was replaced by someone who looked real. Let Cole Hauser be the protagonist, it's OK to let it be beautiful. I'm getting tired of seeing 20 top model scientists. Give me a break, people! <br /> <br /> 2. The cinematographer was fired and replaced by one who just pointed the camera and sat quietly. This could be the director's fault, I don't know. The Jumpy camera (as in Constant Gardener) is aging, folks. <br /> <br /> 3. We have seen the goblins devour people. What about a little blood? There isn't much else in this film. We could barely see the creatures - I felt a little ripped off about it. <br /> <br /> 4. The finish was rather lame. During the epilogue, the sexy British scientist has a secret ... guess what is it? It's a little tinned. The ending would have been better if they had all died instead of Black (Morris Chestnut), who seemed to breathe a little compassion in his character only with his worried expressions. All the other actors had no expression. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 4 out of 10, because after all, the acting was without obvious errors, and the concept was quite original. I'd like to see Cole do more military roles - he's good at it.
