this film is what happens when people see how in this particular blair witch project and they say to hell that people run around with cameras, recite thematic documentaries I can't do it and start with a lame idea make up a terrible script and get a group of actors without talent and start shooting a movie. the plot is that in Africa there is a half race of men like animals that hunt and kill humans, the locals think that it is a demon or an evil spirit, but our wild group is in Africa to have some proof of what is proper. There is no need for more words on the plot this movie gets a 1 out of 10 and I'm trying to find something good to say about this movie, but after a long time I don't think anything is zero zero.
