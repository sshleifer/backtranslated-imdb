This film has good jokes, but the vision of Dillon, the less than masterful personification of Rourke, left me alone wanting to see the original. I like Marisa Tomei but it's not Faye Dunaway. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, in my opinion, the number one rule of the film is to make the main character someone you care about. You may not LOVE the character, but you should worry about what happens to him. This is achieved in Barfly with the exhilarating fighting gag with Eddie the bartender. The main combat in Factotum is when, completely unprovoked, approaches the character of Lily Taylor in a bar, hits her on the ground and calls her a whore. <br /> <br /> The whole thing didn't work. Once again, some big lines - some fun laughter - but like a movie overall it's a failure. A mediocre attempt to reinvent something that was brilliant, and it cannot be overcome. The next? Let's have breakfast at Tiffany's with Kate Hudson.
