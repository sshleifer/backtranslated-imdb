If you read Errol Flynn's autobiography, My Wicked, Wicked Ways, you will see that this film is full of poetic license. Not that it makes much difference, because Errol Flynn was quite generous with a poetic license in the autobiography. No need to worry about spoilers, since there's nothing to ruin. <br /> <br /> For me it would seem more sensible to use the story of a fictitious Hollywood actor; then you could go out and find a better actor than Duncan Regehr to play it, and you shouldn't worry about the audience saying things like, "But he didn't have a mustache in Captain Blood." Another failure of this film is that it shows Flynn as a two-dimensional character. Flynn was an intelligent, well-mannered, well-read man. This film focuses only on its funster image. <br /> <br /> Regehr is a disaster. The rest of the cast struggles with their scripts. Hal Linden is OK as Warner, and Barbara Hershey makes a credible Damita, although Lili Damita didn't think so. <br /> <br /> The best thing to do with this film is to forget it and let it gently slip away into oblivion. So what I'm writing this for, I can't imagine.
