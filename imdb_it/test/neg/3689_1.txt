There are good movies, and there are bad movies, and then there's Moscow Zero, a film so terrible that it makes spending an month alone with an insurance salesman an interesting alternative to entertainment. <br /> <br /> With an incomprehensible plot on the gates of Hell that open into a labyrinth of tunnels under Moscow, the film is a mess of repetitive and absurd blows of a little girl crossing tunnels, red lights floating, and strange shadows on the walls, none of which serves to mount any fear or tension, but instead arouses the reaction of "here they are back with the girl (or the lights)" from the viewer. <br /> <br /> Directed by María Lidón, who for reasons that I can only conclude as shame, was announced as Luna, the film sees the participation of Vince Gallo in the role of Owen, an American priest who travels to Moscow in search of Sergei (Rade Serbedzija), friend and colleague who disappeared in the tunnels. He enlisted the help of a number of local people who, with the exception of Oksana Akinshina, are all played by Spanish actors who try with little success to accent Russian accents. <br /> <br /> Along the way they encounter members of a sort of underground religious mafia covered in leather directed by a burly Val Kilmer, whose career seems to be in such a free fall that it has resorted to appearing in disgrace like this, and the henchman Sage Stallone (son of Sly), who seems to have been hired just so the name of Stallone can be included in the tent of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to watching the crew try to navigate through the tunnels with the help of a comically drawn map, and the repetitive blows of them followed or evaded by a pale girl, not much else happens. The dialogue usually changes between English and Russian, with actors alternating frequently in each language, and entire conversations are pronounced halfway through one and a half in the other with the only apparent reason to feel like them, adding a frustrating dimension for the spectator, beyond and above all trying to understand the madly crumpled story. <br /> <br /> The only thing Moscow Zero is right, however, is the title, which could only have made a more accurate description of this film if the word Moscow had been omitted.
