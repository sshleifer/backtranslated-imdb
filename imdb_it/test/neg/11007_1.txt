John Madden's cinematographic interpretation of Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton fails to do justice to a great literary piece. While the plot is maintained, the elements that give the young person his soul are skewered and all in all lost in the film. Madden fails to convey the innocence and the overall tragedy of the relationship between Ethan and Mattie, turning it into a moral tale instead. The sign is missed and the lost point in the added details and in the poor dialog box. Zeena (Zenobia) in the book is almost completely the antagonist, the least understanding figure of the books, in which in the film she can be almost sorry, even if it is a stretch where you feel bad for this sick woman who is betrayed. The book describes Zeena's tyrannical control over the house and Ethan more accurately. The film just ticked me. The addition of the fox was useless, as was the scene with Mattie trying to kill herself. He was just misinterpreted and done. Cinematic errors: the elusiveness of Ethan in the church dance scene, the interactions with Denis Eady, the addition of love scenes, fox scene, shop scene, saying his plans allowed, lack of demonstrations of emotions and Ethan's inner thoughts, introduction of the priest to an unnamed engineer, let Zeena know of the growing relationship in which, in the novel, the reader never knows what Zeena thinks or thinks. Only too many defects and bad management decisions.
