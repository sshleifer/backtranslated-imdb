Drama? Yes ... historically accurate? Not exactly! .... This film distorts the details of the del Bibles by placing Lot in meeting the Noah during the construction of the Ark. Fascinating time travel for Lot made in part by NBC! .... being Lot was not born until 2136 BCE, 234 years AFTER the flood water (2370 BCE) .... It's like having George Bush meet William Shakepeare! And what's with this guy selling Noah's sales and nicknack's items? <br /> <br /> You can make a movie based on dramatic historical facts, but don't twist it to put people where they weren't ... especially when it comes to Gods Word.
