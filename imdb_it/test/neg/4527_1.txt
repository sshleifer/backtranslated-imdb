This film is in the same league as Ishtar. A lot of wasted talent. Who let this bomb escape? When Sigfried says an example needs to be done, referring to a nuclear bomb, I said "Please let this theater be it!" Do not waste time. Not even a free rental is worth it! And where did they get these shillings to fill the comment section on IMDb? I can't believe that anyone who has ever seen the original series has enjoyed this smell. Steve Carell is not a physical comedian. If they removed the "comedy" and made an action film out of it, they could pass. What the hell was the purpose of the dance scene? Furthermore, jokes and fat references were without taste. This film has never lost the possibility of going to the lowest common denominator and the scenes just ended, it seemed, as if no one thought them. Just awful! Save time, if not money and let this movie pass!
