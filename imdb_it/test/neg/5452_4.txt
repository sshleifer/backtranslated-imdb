AALCC informs us that 14-year-olds can be rather hateful and bad. For those who don't know, the film performs a public service. Otherwise, it's a lot of flashy videography with little or no reason to be. I will allow the work with the camera to be sometimes surprising, but also that it can be madly self-indulgent at other times. Actors take up screen space and screen time, but do not calculate as irresistible human beings. I suppose the email that flashes across the screen means you have to figure out which character has that moniker, but I simply couldn't say enough differences to do it, and I really didn't care anyway.
