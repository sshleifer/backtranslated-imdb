This film contains the rating of 7.0 on IMDb, so even though I heard something rotten in its synopsis I decided to try it. What a waste of 100 minutes. First of all, the 1980s were not a good decade for the crime and thriller genre. Most of these, at that time, were badly done with the silly plot (if they had any), so there are very few that can stand out, and even if they were good they are still not very good. The Hit, however, suffers from everything that made the images of the crime stupid. He has a poor character development, unlikely plot and has not been written or directed in a decent manner, and when you have such shortcomings acting does not help. Stephen Frears has often tried to emulate the French new wave in the production of English-style films and the two do not match. <br /> <br /> First of all, Terence Stamp is 10 years in hiding because he testified against some of his former crime associates. He hides in Spain, of all places. Eventually he is captured and, after being abducted by a group of stupid Spanish thugs, he just needs to escape at some distance from the two hit men who should take care of him. These two are John Hurt, who should be hard boiled, cold stone killer, and Tim Roth (in his first role) as the devil's apprentice. They do not kill Tim immediately, first they eliminate the "three Amigos", they should not have hired them in the first instance, and then, they drive Stamp in Paris, because one of the companions who testified against wants to face him. OK it's possible. But even if Tim was such a dangerous figure that they had to hire four men to overcome him, they didn't bind him, they didn't make him incapable in any way and they went around with him, as if he were one of his friends. The stamp is not opposed and happily goes to Paris to be shot, not using half a dozen possibilities, these "professionals" offer him to escape. It seems that Tim Roth is just a bully kid, giving the idea of ​​a great crime leader who unites him with a tough henchman like John Hurt, even more unlikely, especially on an important job like that. But as far as John Hurt is not so rigid, he spends twenty minutes of the film, killing or not killing the totally surplus Australian, played by Bill Hunter, whose sole purpose in this film is to present his beautiful lover Laura Del Sol (who he says is 15, but looks more like 25), and whose role in history and acting skills suggests that she was offered the role, only on the basis of being the lover of the director or producer at that time. After much discussion, Hurt kills the Australian but takes his mistress with him for no apparent reason. Then he wants to kill her, but Roth with his "subtle ways" persuades him not to do it, so she kicks him, bites him and scratches him for the whole film, remains faithful to that deeply buried human side of him. > <br /> Do you have simple and idiotic scenes, like when Hurt and Roth block the car from the outside, trying to prevent people from going inside?!?! In any case, the film drags on. Tim Roth falls asleep, watching Terence Stamp with his gun on his chest, and Stamp just waits there to watch the waterfall. Then the whole mess of a plot gets to the point where everything we've seen in the last hour and 20 minutes comes out of the window. Let's sum up, the whole point in not killing Tim right away (except for having a movie) is taking him to Paris, so his former partner is having one last word with him. And the point where he doesn't run away is that he's ready to die, saying "It's just a moment, we're here, then we're not here, we're somewhere else ... maybe. And it's natural to breathe, why should we be afraid?" But my friends, here is where the twists, Hurt kills the man while he's still in Spain, and we ask why worry and go around for days, he could do it in the first 15 minutes, and that contrary to his philosophy Stamp he is very afraid of being killed, so we ask again why he didn't run, and he had many chances. Even Roth is killed, but he shouldn't be in the movie, and Del Sol, well, she promised a role in this movie purely for romantic reasons (sexual laws), so she remains alive again, she also attacked Hurt for the film 15th time in the movie. He killed all the others, but not her, he must have the maximum appearance on the screen. a shoe string budget and show it, but when not n we have storyboard and card characterizations, it shows even more. And yes, Fernando Ray appears and goes through the film as a guest star, with only one audible line of dialogue. Terrible
