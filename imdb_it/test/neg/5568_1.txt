Really! Here French cinema has hit the bottom, and compared to it, the least attractive of American teenage horror films, the likes of "Friday thirteenth" "Freddy" and co are masterpieces of the seventh art. <br /> <It is even more exasperating since there were exciting original elements: the forêt de Brocéliande and its legends, the Druids and King Arthur, were all precious elements for a dream-like fantasy and horror film. Alas! Film, as rightly pointed out by a user in a fake forest, near Paris, the film is fake horror, fake Celtic history, false vestiges - you should see the professor (Wilms who was a magnificent M. Quesnoy in "the east way a long fleuve tranquille) scream for the "priceless scrap", which the production probably bought in a dime of fake characters, fake excavations ... <br /> <br /> The boys dressed as druids are unintentionally very funny, as well as the girls who seem to be experts in the martial arts. And what can we say about the professors? of the monster? At ten years of age, he would write a better screenplay than this grotesque farce. br /> <br /> Word to the wise: Maurice Leblanc wrote a wonderful story about druids and old ceremonies in his Arsene Lupine saga called "l'île aux trente cercueils". A miniseries it was made 30 years ago. Avoid this "Broceliande" junk and try to see it instead.
