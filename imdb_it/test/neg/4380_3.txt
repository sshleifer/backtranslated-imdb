This is simply another bad movie by Chuck Norris. Norris plays a cop on the trail of a serial killer of twisted women. He put the boy away three years earlier, but somehow the boy crosses the bars of the hazelnut house where he finds himself using what looks like dental floss. Then the murderer escapes in a cleaning van and drives him on a 400-foot cliff and survives to pass the time in a theater being renovated. The Irishman Jack O'Halloran is the best thing about this movie, but like in Superman II, he doesn't say a word. Somehow this should make it more threatening. Ron O'Neal of Super Fly fame and Steve James are wasted respectively in the role of the mayor of the city and Norris' partner. The film also contains the idiotic subplot of Norris and his girlfriend who has a son out of wedlock; it's so 80s. Coupling the "serious" turn of Norris with exaggerated musical signals that signal every upcoming scene in a predictable way, the film becomes a task to sit on. Accumulation while looking for the killer in the theater is interesting enough with Norris crawling through the shadows to discover the hiding place, but the final fight is disappointing after the start in such a promising way. It's another disappointment of Cannon Films, and it sounds like a movie made for television. * of 4 stars.
