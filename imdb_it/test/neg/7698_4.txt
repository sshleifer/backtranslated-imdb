Nowadays, Ridley Scott is one of the best directors and producers and can command huge sums for helming films, especially because he has films like ALIEN, GLADIATOR and BLADE RUNNER to his credit. So from this partial list of his credits, it is obvious that he is an incredible talent. However, if you look at this effort very quickly that you made during film school, you would probably have difficulty saying that it was destined for greatness. This is because, despite having a good job and style, the film is hopelessly boring and non-addictive. However, considering that it was not meant for general release and was just a training ground, then I am willing to look at it in a charitable way - hence the score of 4. <br /> <br /> By the way, this film is part of CINEMA 16: European Shorts DVD. There are 16 short films on this DVD. Most are not great, even though it contains THE MAN WITHOUT HEAD, COPY SHOP, RABBIT and WASP, it is an extraordinary DVD for short film lovers and is worth buying.
