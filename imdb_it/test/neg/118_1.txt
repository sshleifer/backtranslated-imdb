Honestly horrible movies, awful editing, horrible lighting, terrible dialogue and scrapbooking script. <br /> <br /> Lighting is so bad that there are times when you can't even see what's going on, I even tried playing with contrast and brightness so you could see something but it didn't helped. <br /> <br /> They must have found the script in a basket, the development of the character is just as horrible and while you hardly expect a lot from a Jean-Claude Van Damme's film manages to reach a record low. You can't even laugh at that cheesy. <br /> <br /> Direction and editing are also terrible, the entire film follows an extremely tired routine and fails at every corner while mumbling through the plot that is so weak is just unreal. <br /> <br /> Not much else to say except that it's really ugly and nothing like the previous work by Jean-Claude Van Damme that you might like. <br /> <br /> Avoid as the plaque, frankly, did not allow me to condemn this "film".
