I must say that I am a big fan of these "Last House on the Left" scams, even those that most people seem to hate are often held in high regard by me; but one of these films that I didn't like very much was "Night Train Murders" by Aldo Lado, and unfortunately it would seem that the trains and The Last House on the Left do not mix, given that Terror Express is another weak off-beat. Something that this type of film really needs is a blatantly resounding lead character; and while Terror Express offers three potential candidates, none of them comes forward and becomes this villain, leaving the most important area missing. It started really well, when three young people on a passenger train started to slightly irritate the guests on board. This leads the public to believe that there are others in store, but unfortunately it never really starts once the scene has been set. From there, the trio ends up "taking over" the train and using their new power to terrorize guests and rape women. <br /> <br /> It must be said that there is a good deal of sleaze in this film, which will be appreciated by many spectators; but there is almost no blood. The director Ferdinando Baldi seemed to think that he could get away with replacing the blood with sex scenes, and he could have gone too; if he could film a brutal sex scene. The idea that these men took the train by force exits the window once it reaches the sex, because the people you would expect to be powerful and strong seem too eager to show their women a good time, and despite this sequence very "domesticated", none of the sex is particularly interesting. Since most of the film is taken up by these sex scenes, this becomes a huge problem. Movies like this often lack style, suspense and credibility; but you know you're looking bad when you're bored. As one might expect, none of the acting is up to anything; and the three central ones in particular stand out for being rubbish. The direction is lacking in style and there is little tension or suspense; making it difficult to take care of what is going to happen. Overall, this is a pretty nasty example of an exploit film, and I can't recommend it.
