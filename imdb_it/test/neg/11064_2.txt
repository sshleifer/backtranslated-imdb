when I sat down to watch this movie I thought it might be slightly good. but no. it was an OK movie, not good, but not bad for the most part, but then it gets to the end and loses all credibility. they should have just died. they didn't leave the last part, it didn't make any sense. if they had something at the beginning they started a plane crash yes, but we didn't, so it didn't work. the first bit is OK and I give him credit, but the rest is just a bad plan and not necessary if you're thinking about going to watch this movie. DON "It's horrible to go and rent something that is really worth watching. 2/10
