We are in the not too distant future, globalization seems to have reached the highest point, languages ​​mix together (even if English prevails over the rest), races have merged, human cloning is a fact and the whole territory seems to have been divided into two zones: the one for the valid and the one for the invalid ... a new and courageous world (in the style of Aldous Huxley) in which people are genetically stored and blood relations are severely prohibited (for health reasons this is code 46 of the title). In this environment two souls who are not destined to meet fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Winterbottom has had an important history, with a fairly large potential. A beautiful recipe that ruins giving it such a slow rhythm, narrating it in such a tired way, removing every emotion ... The cold is all that the Code 46 transmits. Coldness and boredom. Not even the presence of Samantha Morton and Tim Robbins (both interpret their roles wonderfully), nor can the visual and sound power of some sequences do anything to save the film. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Code 46: what could have been and never was. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
