This was terrible, mean and full of the worst racial clich√©s and stereotypes I've seen in a while. Seeing Hayden P trying to act in "ghetto" was painful (hello, a pair of trousers with soles and some braids that don't make you "knock down" by homosexuals). Solange Knowles almost makes faces during the entire movie. Most of the sequences seem to have been filmed in cardboard boxes ... what was going on with the finale ??? And poor Rihanna was simply exploited to get people to see her "act", which she can't. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this film doesn't even deserve a star. Please put this tired franchise to rest. Or at least make the next Bring It On IV: Cheerleaders vs. Freddy & Jason.
