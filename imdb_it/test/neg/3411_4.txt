The first of the three Aztec Mummies films is the only one that, as far as I know, has never been completely dubbed in English. The film was cut and used in pieces by people like Jerry Warren in other films (he combined it with another Mexican horror comedy with Lon Chaney to make Face of the Screaming Werewolf and appeared in Attack of the Mayan Mummy and elsewhere .) The longest of the three films, a good part of this film is the next two films that use this as a basis for flashbacks. The plot of this film has a scientist who conducts a past life regression experiment that makes his subject travel back and discovers hidden rooms in an Aztec pyramid. The group, in addition to a sinister figure known as Bat, hopes to use the information to discover the hidden treasure. Instead they discover a living mother who has other plans. Long and long lasting, this film does not have much action to support its 80 minutes of execution (even worse, the mother does not show up until an hour). Probably the last of the three films, it's easy to see why this film was cut to pieces, it's the only way to model a film that doesn't induce sleep. Watching the movie last night I found myself struggling to stay awake. It was a big blow and I found out that I ended up crawling to the point where the mom showed up. Given the choice, I would make a pass and watch the second two films.
