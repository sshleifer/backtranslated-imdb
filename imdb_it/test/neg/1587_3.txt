(Spoiler) "Cash Crop" is something similar. Less fortunate farmers gain ground to make ends meet. The DEA agent is blowing into the city. Farmers hide the dish. The DEA agent leaves the city. End of the story. <br /> <br /> This film features solid performances by second-level actors, mediocre direction and such a scenic script ... but it has no stories. And since history is the foundation of every drama, "Cash Crop" is a total failure. Too boring to recommend.
