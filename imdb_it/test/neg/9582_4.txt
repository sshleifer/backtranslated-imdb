I can't believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic. I am a million miles from being an expert and I will never climb a mountain; but also the basic knowledge gained from reading Into Thin Air, and from the observation of Everest Beyond The Limit and other Everest documents, made this film become more and more ridiculous as it went on. At the beginning there is a good climbing film; and when the head of the billionaire mission asks at the beginning of the film "How much experience over the 8000 meters do you have?", I was encouraged to hope that this could be a crude and accurate man-against-nature odyssey. Instead you have a group of climbers who zoom in on a mountain without acclimatization; climb with goggles in full sun, and are barely short of breath, performing miraculous feats of resistance. Only near the top is suggested a little fatigue, to dramatically accentuate the physical feat of climbing such a monstrous peak, almost like an afterthought. If you don't know mountaineering, take a look: prepare yourself for some cliché heroes (even if they are no more clichés than a hundred other passively deviant gestures), and a cliché result. I developed a minor fascination with the high mountains and couldn't wait to look at K2; but apart from some extraordinarily beautiful landscapes, it was a disappointment because it was so far from reality. I can imagine that some experts were employed in the making of this film, but then they were conveniently ignored in the search for the heroic and sadly fantastic plot. Also, you would look a little tit if you said "welcome to the death zone" at 200,000 feet.
