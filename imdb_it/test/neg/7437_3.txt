This was ok, but really a bit disappointing because I expected more laughter. Considering the plot and the lead actor (Bill Murray), it should have been a lot more fun than it turned out. Only a part of it really made me laugh, like when Murray lost control of his seed and was accelerating his way at a strange angle. (You have to see it, to appreciate it.) <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was anything but nice people. Just look at a taste of the names: Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yecch! McConaughey's role here as "Tip Tucker" was simply annoying. He was the worst. <br /> <br /> Other than those people, the film has had some fascinating moments, but overall it is not recommended. It's another Disney flop.
