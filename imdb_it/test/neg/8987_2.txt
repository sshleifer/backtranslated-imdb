First of all, let me say that I have no idea who Nora Roberts is. So the book may have been great, but the film is not. <br /> <br /> I spent my whole life living in the Peidmont region of North Carolina. I've never heard ridiculous southern accents like those in this movie. I lived in two small towns in the NC and Charlotte and Raleigh. Occasionally you'll meet people with a strong southern accent, but I've never met a city where everyone spoke like a bad imitation of Gone with the Wind. <br /> <br /> In response to Gore_Won of the atheist community. Your comments reveal more about your deformed psyche than about the movie. If we were to extend our imagination and pretend that there is something realistic in this film - which is not there - then the truth is that bad people like Tory's father will always find some justification for their actions. The author chose religion as a counterpart to Tory's supernatural abilities. Your assumption that "the true character of the Gospels" causes a man to beat his daughter is the most perverse and uninformed interpretation I've ever heard. Before you start spitting on the Gospels, maybe you should read them first. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Dialogue is flat, unnatural and incredible most of the time. In particular, many of the things Kade said to Tory are inappropriate and do not match the mood, context or how they are said. <br /> <br /> The "exciting touch" at the end of the film is lame, predictable and lacking in credibility. Some have even claimed that Jacqueline Bisset does a wonderful job in this film, but the truth is that her mother's bitter character is also a stale, predictable and one-dimensional character. Is it Bisset's fault? I do not know. <br /> <br /> If you have a choice between watching this film and a twenty-year replica of the Muppet Show, I recommend the Muppet Show.
