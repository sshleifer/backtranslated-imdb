If you want to have a truly traumatic experience, then this horrible film (if you can consider it that way) is for you. A worse film than the postman, sizzle Beach USA, Batman and Robin, Kazaam, fair game ... well, you got it right. This film directed by French television, Patrick Sebastien (Jerry Springer with an IQ of 25) can really be considered the worst film ever made. I hope that Troma or someone in America will distribute it, so that the United States can experience the French stench at its value.
