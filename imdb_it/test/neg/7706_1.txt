So many of these types of movies these days. This zombie movie falls into the main category of "cheese" unlike the more refined dawn of the dead and the day of the dead. In all honesty, those 2 films were the main studio releases with big budgets behind them. But they were also good films. A low budget film can still be valid if they only stop accepting and using the worst scripts in circulation. Anyone who has written this film must have been drunk all the time. <br /> <br /> This film had such special effects and a very uneven plot. The only substantial difference compared to other films of this type is the time required for people to turn into zombies. In this, it seems that it only takes a few seconds to die and turn into a zombie. Yet with the ease with which this "infection" spreads, you can have zombie blood all over you and not even appear to be at risk of infection, and believe me the people in this are covered in blood. <br /> <br /> the main problem I had is that our 2 main stars were sometimes turning around dozens of zombies and they didn't bite. When all the others turn into incredibly fast zombies these 2 were swarmed by the zombies when they were even unarmed and they were able to get out without problems. Our hot chick star survived a missile attack on the building where it was. At that point I was laughing out loud. Unarmed, having 10 zombies on her and a missile hits the building, but can she get out without a scratch? OK sure .... <br /> <br /> Even those who advised these people on how special forces behave, of course, never spent time in the army. They should have watched a movie like Blackhawk first to get at least an idea of ​​how they behave in combat situations. <br /> <br /> A soldier was a private SPECIAL FORCES fat overweight. LOL that was good. Another kept going up towards the zombies thinking they had survived, even putting the weapon down at some point. These guys are there to fight the zombies and behave like the soldiers in the film Stripes. Special forces, lol ... <br /> <br /> Then they get to the point where they try to explain the zombie girl in the gum room and everything gets very confusing. The explanation is confusing and does not even follow the first film. It didn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the anti Bush jokes. The military lady at first told them that the order fell from the vice president to the president and in the end was the vice president from a "secret location" to give the orders. This was the best part of the film for me.
