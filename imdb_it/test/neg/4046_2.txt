This film was so terribly horrible that I couldn't get over the whole thing without turning it off, it was just so bad! When I looked at it I kept thinking that it looked like a really cheap movie made in the 1960s or something with those terrible looking special effects, but then I realized that this was just realized in 2001. <br /> > dialogue and acting were really horrible and the plot was almost non-existent. I didn't think anyone would go back to making movies that looked so cheap and old, I'm not sure they did it on purpose or if they really didn't have any budget for this movie. It really looks like it was shot with someone's video camera at the home of a local or something. Maybe they thought they were retro or something like that but it looks really very vulgar. <br /> <br /> I really don't know how anyone can ever enjoy watching it. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 5 *.
