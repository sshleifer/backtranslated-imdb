boring, horrible piece of Italian Euro-junk of a scientist who seems to spend most of his time wielding beer (that's what makes him American, right? Our scientists spend most of their academic life out of their minds, sure - all the really great theories come from), that is studying something (called dolphin, fish migration patterns, who knows). He hears a strange sound through his headphones, proving that his radio is picking up a station in Jamaica. At the same time, a girl from Jack Skellington with one of the worst, most bleached manes of terrible 80s hair that has ever been my pleasure to witness is trying to calm the dolphins in the Seaquarium she works at, as they are apparently shocked by the amount of fish she has released lately. The beginning of the film was a very little colored plot of two annoying people, very Italian, whose boat is attacked by something invisible underwater. The plaintive woman is never seen again (the best part of the story), and the corpse of the boys is found without legs. The idiot, an alcoholic scientist (who has an inexplicable English-American-Italian accent) and the girl with hay hair begin to theorize that there is a sort of giant monster lurking under the sea off the Italian coast ... err. .Florida. <br /> <br /> He uses the help of an electrician to install an underwater microphone, so that the monster can sing with karaoke. This guy has a beautiful girlfriend, his only disadvantage is that she pronounces Peter "Pey-tah", but for some reason he is sexually attracted to the anatomical skeleton with frizzy hair, a situation that lets his eyelids flap. <br /> <br /> Dubbing is horrible, the editor is a space, and the plot is generally a yawn. There's a bit of how this strange scientific corporation genetically engineered this giant shark-squid-barracuda creature for some reason that doesn't make sense, and a slightly unpleasant fat-haired guy goes around killing women, always without an apparent reason. A stupid sheriff and his vicious attendant are on the trip, along with a scientist (who we know is intelligent because she wears huge glasses). Once the woman scientist takes on the huge, terrible monster (yes, right, Ed Wood's giant octopus was more credible) with only a small handaxe, and she wins the race. Hurray for the thin little women, who obviously make the best monster hunters! <br /> <br /> The solution to the giant's problem is to blow up half of the Everglades, leaving a dead zone for several miles in every direction. To hell with ecology and the environment, right? We have to kill this giant monster! In the end, the electrician and his broom love to ride at sunset on his Vespa, which is o.k. since he passed his colleagues' death and is not very upset that his girlfriend was beaten by the madman with greasy hair. Hooray for true love! Wait a minute, there's nothing strange in all this ...
