I classify this as the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> If ever a film existed that I wanted about my enemies, it would have been this. The plot is ridiculous, there are only 2 characters, and the coincidences between these characters put a strain on beliefs. <br /> <br /> These factors have contributed to making this film extremely boring. <br /> <br /> My wife and mother came out in the film for about 15 minutes. I imagined that a film so boring and slow * should * have an interesting interesting twist, and was rather disappointed when nothing exciting was materialized. <br /> <br /> I thought briefly of sending the contractors a bill for my 2 hours of life lost.
