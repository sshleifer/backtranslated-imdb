Father Brown's thesis is that a good dose of Roman Catholicism will solve all the problems of life. I don't mind a bit of proselytizing, but sometimes this gets a little ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some good actors have played Father Brown over the years, Kenneth More and Barnard Hughes are two good examples. Alec Guinness plays it in this film and does it all by himself, but you have not seen any great demand for Father Brown's future films. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you are a committed Catholic this makes perfect sense. It is much more important to capture the thief and convert him to your religion than to see him brought to justice. <br /> <br /> But that's what was asked to accept here. In reality there is a preliminary story before the main action of the film. Guinness in clerical dress is captured trying to postpone the stolen items that one of his parishioners Sidney James had made during a robbery. <br /> <br /> This is the story that gives the local police and obviously this is something that James confided in him so that he cannot break the confessional. <br /> <br /> Now go to the bigger game. The master thief Flambeau, played by Peter Finch, stole a cross entrusted to Father Brown and is said to belong to St. Augustine later in the day. But Father Brown is more interested in convincing Flambeau to return to his faith than to see him brought to justice. Then he confuses the cops so he can carry out his mission. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but this whole thing has been too much for me to swallow. Father Brown hate to say he was guilty of obstruction and should have been arrested. And he had no obligation not to reveal anything he knew about Flambeau, the man had not come to him as a penitent in search of acquittal and spiritual advice. <br /> <br /> Author G.K. Chesterton, a noted Catholic layman in his time, finds this very reasonable. Taken to its logical conclusion, we should replace all police forces with an army of priests. <br /> <br /> Guinness borrows from his Reverend Ascoyne D'Ascoyne of Kind Hearts and Coronets and Barry Fitzgerald in Going My Way to create Father Brown. Although Brown is much more careful than the other two. There is also a bit of Colonel Nicholson in this portrait. In The Bridge on the River Kwai, Guinness also played a character whose rather strange interpretation of the rules made him lose sight of what was important in the situation in which Nicholson was. <br /> <br /> Father Brown is a funny guy when he solves the mysteries and makes the authorities look stupid. We liked Brother Cadfael doing it in a medieval context and the American public loved Father Dowling played by Tom Bosley some years ago. <br /> <br /> This film should have been entertained.
