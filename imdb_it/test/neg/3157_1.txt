I don't understand. I just don't understand. "Barney and Friends" has been condemned by millions of people over the years, and I will admit, I was one of those lambasters. Every child watching this show does not realize that what they are looking at is just a piece of junk. Barney is very annoying and very selfish. Add Baby Bop, and it gets even worse. Add B.J., so you have a very scary TV nightmare. So get the kids. They are old enough to know what Barney is trying to teach! What are they doing there in the first place? It would be fun if Barney and his friends appeared on the Jerry Springer show. This would certainly be one of the wildest moments in television history! Even more significant is that this show marked the beginning of the end of public television as we knew it, since we saw less and less of the most informative and interesting public television programs broadcast in the 70s and 80s. What a BIG difference a selfish son of a gun makes. When this show leaves PBS, a big sigh of relief will be felt among millions of people, but a huge dent has been made in the annals of television history. A message to Barney himself: you may not realize it, but YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED. <br /> <br /> In other words, there are other choices. Better choices
