I was very disappointed with the quality of this documentary. The content is poorly produced, poor quality videos and, above all, terrible sound. There is very little about how Bruce Haack produced his music and virtually no example of direct connection to contemporary and contemporary electronic music. The interviews of people who knew Bruce Haack are mostly inarticulate mumbo-jumbo. Too much yak and not enough Haack. Although I have a serious personal interest in electronic music and have above average attention, even for slow and / or difficult topics, I fell asleep watching this documentary and had to see it again to see the parts I slept on. If you look at this, make sure you're configured, before looking, like Alex in A Clockwork Orange. Bruce Haack deserves much better than this. Shame on the producer and director.
