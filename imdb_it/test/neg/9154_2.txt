THE DAUGHTER OF THE MEMORY KEEPER in the form of a novel by Kim Edwards was a very successful bestseller and was probably presented in more reading groups than any other novel during its dissemination. So what happened when the novel became a TV movie? Perhaps it's the mediocre downscale script (oops!, Teleplay!) By John Pielmeier who constantly galumphs along in a clumsy pedestrian way eliminating any sense of credibility to the story. Perhaps it is the cut and paste direction of Mick Jackson that lacks the delineation of rhythm and character. Perhaps he suffers from the cinematography of an unaccredited source or the "liquid tears" soundtrack by Daniel Licht. For any of these (or all of these) reasons, this novel on film survives because it represents an excellent opportunity to educate the public about the abilities of those born with Down syndrome. And for this it is worthy of attention. <br /> <br /> Dr. David Henry (Dermot Mulroney), a successful orthopedic doctor, is married to the beautiful Norah (Gretchen Mol) and their lives have changed since their pregnancy. On a stormy winter night in Kentucky, Norah goes into labor and Henry runs to a nearby clinic where David gives his wife (the doctor is caught in a snowstorm) with the help of his old friend, the nurse Caroline Gill (Emily Watson). After delivering a perfect son (Paul), Norah continues to be in labor and (surprisingly ...) delivers an unexpected twin girl (!). David and Caroline immediately recognize that the girl (Phoebe) is a 'mongoloid' (this is before the use of the term Down Syndrome) and David, having a history of losing a little sister due to a birth defect, decides to send Phoebe in a mental hospital for the mentally disabled: Caroline has to make the delivery and Norah is informed that the second twin has died at birth. <br /> <br /> Caroline follows the instructions, sees the conditions of the "house" where Phoebe must be deposited, withdraws for the horror and decides to keep the child. Helped by a friendly truck driver, Caroline changes her solitary existence and the mothers Phoebe, finding a new life in her truck driver in Pittsburgh. Norah insists on a formal funeral for Phoebe - a fact that profoundly disturbs David's psyche, and Henry's life continues with his only son Paul, leaving submerged pains for lack of Phoebe's presence. Norah gives David a camera ("peoples lives are like a camera, that's where they live - in a room captured for a while") and David becomes obsessed with photography. Norah mourns, drinks and loses David's attention as David traces the existence of Phoebe with Caroline - sending money and letters to Pittsburgh. Paul (Tyler Stentiford of Jamie Spilchuk) grows up, discovers his mother's infidelities and gets angry about his father's lack of communication and understanding, and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician, and off to Juilliard. Meanwhile Phoebe (Krystal Hope Nausbaum) matured into a very suitable young girl, and the way Henrys's failed marriage and the healing atmosphere of Phoebe and Paul's life combined with the courage that sustained Caroline's struggle Gill is the conclusion of the film for gaining acceptance in the world for those born with Down syndrome. <br /> <br /> The cast of famous actors tries hard, but only Emily Watson is able to resurrect a believable character from this squishy script. Jamie Spilchuk demonstrates a young actor with many promises. Dermot Mulroney and Gretchen find it difficult to shape the empathic characters from the banal lines that are given to deliver. The film is a disaster, but the message on the acceptance of children and adults of Down Syndrome is important. Grady Harp
