This is what Disney Channel shows to the stupidest children of posts. It suits him well. It's not funny, acting is the worst I've ever seen in many years, there are more stereotypes than actors, and all of this show makes you moan and roll your eyes. Do you want to know why? Not only is this show a waste of broadcast time, lead actress Selena Gomez looks like a pig. Jake T. Austin's character needs a Ritalin. David Henrie's character needs to visit a strip club and be wasted. Furthermore, the writer of the show is inconsistent. In one episode, the security guard is called "sir" by a character and referred to as a woman by all the rest. <br /> <br /> Hi? It's called rereading and modification. Do it sometimes, Disney. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen the promo for the new "four bloodsucker saga"? Disney wanted its version of Twilight vs Harry Potter. Except for a million lamers. The Wizards of Waverly Place movie ?? Think about it for a minute. The family goes away on vacation and the 16-year-old daughter wants independence from her parents. SAME PLOT from The Proud Family Movie etc ... <br /> <br /> What's worse are all the Emmys and ALMA. And most of the audience is a bit of age 4-13 (and not teenagers of life). how many more years? before selena gomez show her tits? <br /> <br /> and the Disney shows are all disgusting .. the writers of cretins..hack show.to destroy the minds and wallets of today's youth ..
