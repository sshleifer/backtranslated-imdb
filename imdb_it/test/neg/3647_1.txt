Do a little research on making this film. Something as simple as a Google search. It was funded by the US Army and promoted just in time for the elections. It's a great idea, but I'd much rather see a DOCUMENTARY, not something modified by the Bush Administration and tell its reality. The timing of the film's release, its tone and the fact that MS & L promoted it raised questions about the intent of the film. "According to MS & L CEO Joe Gleason, he and his colleagues also deliver targeted messages on the war in Iraq to specific constituencies," wrote Eartha Melzer. "Is the left-wing art house crowded with one of those constituencies? Is the government hiring documentary filmmakers to propagate the US population?" No one involved in the film is willing to say who initially put the money for the film or how they ended up represented by the army PR firm. "
