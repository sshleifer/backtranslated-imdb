A film by Wes Craven presents since 1995, directed by Joe Clayton and starring Lance Henriksen. A group of scientists saves a dying man who finds him in their stranded desert outpost sending him with their experimental virus, of course, one of their colleagues goes overboard and the virus turns the man into an almost unstoppable monster with them trapped inside. Lance Henriksen plays the morally offended researcher who leaves the project before all this, but returns after receiving a request for help to save the man (pre-unstoppable mutation of the death machine). <br /> <br /> Deciding to combine two trips in one brings his family with him (they will go on vacation afterwards) and proceeds to give them access to the top secret government structure, thus placing them in the midst of inner chaos . In case you can't say it, this is based on the viewer to work a little and put aside some petty details (see: major and brazen). <br /> <br /> Overall, however: Watch-able with mild pieces of fun. Note: the Outpost is commonly known as the "Mind Ripper"
