Hellraiser: Bloodline is just such a film. I think it's the fourth installment in the Hellraiser series. <br /> <br /> I lost the beginning, and all I remember from there were some topless women and a box-shaped thing on a computer screen. But, using my wits and intelligence, (and the Info button) I soon discovered that the villain (Pinhead) was released by Pandora's Box, which, I believe is a direct gateway to hell. <br /> <br /> So anyway, Pinhead somehow gets out of the box and terrifies the "Toymaker" family. And this is all. Oh, and not to mention the random tortures of various people crossing his path. Yawn. <br /> <br /> What happens mainly in this film is that Pinhead captures the child, and then releases the dog to his wife, and then kills a person at random. Then the husband comes, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? Because failing is because Hellraiser: Bloodline is too trivial to be scary. Watch the minions of Pinhead's creatures: a little dog that seems to have been turned upside down, two men with connected heads and bodies (two Siamese twins in a horror movie?) And someone who should be a princess of some sort. (I have not seen the previous films.) Now look at the main villain. His name is Pinhead. Isn't it the name you call someone when he's stupid? He has pins in his head and hooks that come out of his fingers, and he has blue skin. I suppose he would be a decent criminal if he didn't have such a petty name and a trivial speech. Somewhere in the film, two cops come up and say "Don't make us suffer!" Pinhead answers "Pain? How dare you use that word! I AM pain ??" blah, blah, blah, blah blah. It seems a bit clich√© if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Don't forget the final half of the movie. The characters (and the audience) experience more torture when Pinhead attacks a futuristic madhouse. Some people we don't recognize (maybe it was in the previous films, I don't remember them at the beginning of the film). This scene is basically something played over and over again: <br /> <br /> A guard goes to inspect a mysterious noise. <br /> <br /> Some other guard: "Oh no! It's down, I'm going to check it myself!" <br /> <br /> After he dies, the same thing happens again. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) Here's the thing I didn't understand. In the film Pinhead is supposedly sent to Oblivion at the end. So, how do you get back for four more movies? Are they prequels? Why didn't he die in precedents? Damn. Producers need to find an idea for a different series. (END OF SPOILERS) Hellraiser: Bloodline is bloody and full of torture scenes, but has little thrill or scare value. Forget it. The bad special effects with the bad guy all the rest make this more of a snooze-fest than a good horror. <br /> <br /> Good: Well, some people might like topless women at first. Furthermore, Pinhead's voice is quite beautiful. I suppose if you like ultraviolence, you might like that too. <br /> <br /> Bad: none of the above reasons makes this movie a great movie. Sumptuousness and repetitiveness are rather bad. And who calls their bad Pinhead? <br /> <br /> Feel free to send me a private message regarding this comment.
