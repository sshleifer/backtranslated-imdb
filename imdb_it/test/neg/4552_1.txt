Ok let's start by saying that when a Dutch movie is bad, it is REALLY BAD. Rarely something with a little quality comes (Lek, Karakter) here in Holland but not often. It costs! are about 4 girls going to Spain to go on vacation, celebrate, get drunk, fuck (you know the drill). It also concerns the world of Clubbers or Proppers. Pro who is trying to lure the crowd into their club. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how long it took to write the script, but I suspect somewhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes because you're looking at a bunch of random scenes for 90 minutes. Nothing, and I mean that nothing is credible in this film. What happens with the plot is almost too reductive for words. Suddenly the film turns into a sort of karate action. With a one-on-one fight with "the bad guy in black" and click on car chase scenes through a water car (it may be more substandard). Even the words character development and casting are not familiar to the creators. <br /> <br /> After seeing "Traffic" 3 days before this, I fell from pure brilliance, from a work of art to that. This is film making at the saddest. And don't start with a low budget. Because even with a low budget you could write a better script. It almost seems like the filmmakers were too busy celebrating themselves to make a decent movie. <br /> <br /> However the chicks in the water eventually made it a little, but otherwise, don't waste your money on this garbage.
