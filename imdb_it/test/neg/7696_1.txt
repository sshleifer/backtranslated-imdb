This is the fact that this is the first Saudi feature film to be shown in cinemas, but not in Saudi Arabia, for one simple reason: we have no cinema in our great kingdom ... not just a cinema! The government prohibited the opening of cinemas after Islamic extremists OR the religious police (or both) asked to close it in the late 1970s and early 1980s ... accusing the seventh art of encouraging sexual relations wrong and things like that. I see a powerful reason why we don't open cinemas !! .. we have many video stores throughout the kingdom, we watch movies on TV from some satellite channels, we can install the channels set "Showtime" and after all the movies in general it seems harmless in many ways .. I know many people how they go to the countries neighboring only to watch a couple of movies .. Personally I went to Bahrain several times just to watch movies in theaters because watching it is a lot of fun unlike watching a movie at home. The Saudis pay for the most expensive movie ticket in the world, we travel to watch movies while the rest of the world has cinemas in every city. This is one of the problems we are having !! .. <br /> <br /> The film is produced and presented by Rotana Filmed Entertainment, which is a large company belonging to the Saudi magnate Alwaleed Bin Talal (the eighth richest man in the world). <br /> <br /> The title of the film is a word literally means "how are you?" but it is also a slang which means "that happens!", sometimes used as a jargon to say "bad" about something and is sometimes used as a jargon to politely tell someone to do business and not interfere in someone's business other. Anyway, I think they meant (how are you) and (how are you!) At the same time, I could be wrong anyway. <br /> <br /> The male actors are from Saudi Arabia like Hisham Abdulrahman who is very famous and has a certain popularity after winning 1st prize in performances in Arab reality more like "American Idol", he works in some television programs like the Arabic version of "Cash Taxi" .. the other famous actor is Khaled Sami who is fun and has a great sense of humor .. other actors like Mishal Al-Mutairi, Turki Al-Yusuf and Ali Al Sabea are less famous and work on some TV series shows. The actresses are non-Saudis and have done a great job talking about the Saudi accent .. Jordanian actress Mais Hamdan in the lead role and actress Emeriti Fatima Al-Hawsani .. not that we don't have Saudi actresses but we are few and not < br /> <br /> A Saudi critic "Rja Al-Mutairi" who writes for Alriyadh Newspaper (the most popular newspaper in the kingdom) wrote about it saying: "We do not expect much of the first Saudi feature film. It was born in unusual circumstances , so we can't judge him according to the usual standards like no other film: it is a fact that the film had a huge financial success in its first days of opening only in the Kingdom of Bahrain, it talks about a Saudi family (interacts) with controversial new issues within Saudi society such as: women drive cars, superficial thoughts about the arts, the protection of society by a certain group and the differences between being conservative and being an extremist, the ide and they're good but you feel you're lost in the middle of the movie. One of the advantages of the film is the beautiful soundtrack by Rajeh Dawood which was good but sometimes does not match or expresses what is in the picture. Turki Al-Yusuf did a great job .. his performance was the best along with Mais Hamdan .. the biggest loser is the main actor Hisham Abdulrahman who passed behind the supporting actors Mishal Al-Mutairi, Ali Al Sabea and Khaled Sami who did a good job within the limits of their roles. <br /> <br /> after all, "Keif al-hal?" even with all its disadvantages it is still an OK film and it is an excellent first step for Rotana .. and the film has become the talk of people and streets which is a golden goal to make a strong debate within Saudi society on films in general until they become aware of the importance of the seventh art and other arts "<br /> <br /> PS: there is another Saudi director" Abdullah Almohaisen "claims to have directed the first Saudi film entitled "Shadows of Silence". <Br /> <br /> I haven't seen the movie yet .. I hope I was helpful.
