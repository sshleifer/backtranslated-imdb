I remember seeing the very first Underdog trailer last March, I also remember that at that time I was smiling too much to myself. Of course, it was a rough idea, but I honestly thought that at the time the concept could work, couldn't it be worse than cats and disappointing dogs could be? Then in December and suddenly I remembered that the film realized how much the film was supposed to be sucked, the fact that it was delayed in the UK made it inevitable that it would be terrible, but the horrendous reviews made me realize it was almost impossible for the film is fine. However I swallowed my feelings and today I went to see the film with a friend, when I entered my screen I was mortified, it was the first time I saw a movie with a friend and they are the only two on the screen! I didn't know what I was going to endure. Underdog says it is horrible, it really is. Imagine how bad you think this movie is and then you prepare yourself for a movie even worse, it's as pathetic as the movie. While aiming to entertain children, it looks like an embarrassing disaster that seems to offend children rather than allowing them to enjoy the movie. Things cannot be helped by the fact that the story is beyond the lack of brilliance, the acting is generally poor and the film only looks like a boring, boring and definitely boring Saturday cartoon! After a short five minutes in which I thought the film could be passable, the film suddenly seems to die and then limp towards the final already marked. I'm just amazed that the film was ever released, it's an embarrassment to Disney, hell is half of their video sequel is better than this! What is even more terrifying is the fact that the ending leaves room for a sequel! <br /> <br /> So, let's move on to acting (crack the knuckles). Okay, let me be honest Jason Lee is decent, his voice fits the dog, and if he was given a decent script he could have done the performance work. However, with such a shady script, he seems to be in trouble. In many ways he reminded me of Bill Murray at Garfield, Murray did what he could with what he had, but what he had was not enough to make it acceptable. Then we come to the human actors, and also to most of the atrocious. Alex Neuberger plays Underdog's friend, Jack. My biggest concern is that someone would even take it seriously in an audition. The scene where he gets to fly with Underdog is perhaps the most deserving scene of the last few years just because his acting is so poor. Not once did I believe he was a real person, in fact part of me is still convinced that he was a robot created specifically for the film! James Belushi seems half dead in the film, he has nothing to work with, no decent line, he just seems to wander around the set waiting to become relevant to the plot, which writers try to do towards the end but do it in such a poor way it's ridiculous. Fortunately, Peter Dinklage is the film's only saving factor, as big as Dr. Barsinister and seems to have a laugh in the role. Steal every scene he finds himself in, even if it's not difficult when he shares the time on the screen with the extremely annoying Patrick Warburton. The rest of the cast is even worse, in particular Taylor Momsen, he just needs to finish his acting career right now! <br /> <br /> Underdog also fails dramatically in terms of offering something like a fun scene. When the funniest scene involves Underdog biting a can and blowing up dog food wherever you know there is something drastically wrong. This could easily be ignored if the film had a decent action or a good story, unfortunately the film is even worse in both terms. The effects are so rare that any scene in which Underdog flies seems absurd, and the dog uses his powers with such a small effect that he often forgets that he has superpowers. What's the point in making a film about a super dog if the damn dog never appears super? The final fight borders on embarrassment only because its ten minutes of nothing, the dog flies, other things happen, some things are thrown around, all this is irrelevant because these things are happening for the sake of things that happen. Even the script is somewhat dubious and at worst a decidedly indomitable pain. When someone says "Look like an airplane, it's not a bird, it's not a frog ...", yes, you read that right, I just wanted to burst into tears there and then. Actually I wanted to leave, being forced to see if it could be less than that point, this happens near the end so it is not grateful. <br /> <br /> General Underdog becomes the worst movie of 2008 to this initial period, and is actually just as bad as Epic Movie in recent years. Fortunately for Underdog, Meet the Spartans arrives here soon and I expect it to be even worse. So, if you didn't understand the point of my review, avoid the movie at all costs, if you want to watch a movie with a dog, look at Cats and Dogs, buy a real dog if necessary, but don't see it!
