One of the reviewers wrote: "Good acting, good special effects, great position <br /> <br />. An even better ending." All I can say is "Ugh". This film was painful to watch. I would like to start by saying this: I am a Christian, considered extremely conservative by many people I know. So what I'm about to say is not influenced by the <br /> "Christian content" of the film. I will not beat him because he is a Christian. I'll give him a 2/10 because it's a horrible movie. The writing is bad, WAY too preacher, and much of the "preaching" stuff is simply irrelevant to the story. It just makes a bad script. If I agree with the writer's convictions of <br /> <br /> is irrelevant, it creates a good script that runs well, that stays on track and is credible. The acting was at most amateurish. But hey, when you throw amateurs, you get amateur performances <br />. Dirk may have been in "Survivor", but that show <br /> <br /> requires ZERO acting skills. Playing on his name and his reputation for selling units is in bad taste. Unknown casts that can act and you'll have a much better movie. The effects were HORRIBLE. The hail scene and the subsequent fall of the stars was embarrassing to watch. And what's so great about the finish? It didn't make sense. Yes, I know what was happening <br /> <br /> Tim Chey, but missed the target, great. I bought this movie and I expected a lot more based on the reviews and misinformation of <br /> <br /> on their website. And, even though I was hoping for something more, I got what I always get when I watch "Christian" films - a piece of ka-ka under budget, poorly written, pathetically performed, poorly performed. Maybe one day, someone will finally go on the plate with a well-written and well-made end-of-season film like Gibson's "Passion ...". 2/10 stars.
