This film was so terrible that I can't even describe it. I was amazed that I even sat in this pile of garbage. I could not believe that a film like this was even thought of. He was a serial killer who cackles like a chicken. He doesn't just crush a couple of times, he gasps non-stop for the whole movie. He even shakes his arms like a chicken that is even more stupid than anything I've ever seen. I couldn't believe this was released in 1990. I thought it came out in the early 1980s or something. So the daughter is not very intelligent because she protected the man's geek or chicken. The end gets worse and it's the worst ending I've ever seen. This movie is just chicken s ** t. I was laughing more than I was scared and I highly recommend going out and grab a bucket of fried chicken instead of watching this movie.
