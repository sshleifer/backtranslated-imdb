"Clubbed" promotions show a flashy film based on the 80s clubbing scene. What we end up with is a film with identity problems. The secondary plots end up taking over what the viewers would consider the main plot, so the focus on this film which is mainly about the "clubbing" ends up being left in the sewer. <br /> <br /> Boxing, depression, self-loathing, gangsters, bouncers and drug dealers are all hastily crammed into odd 90 minutes. In no less than 4 occasions I had to check the running time of the film, since the concern was growing that this film was destined to disappoint. <br /> <br /> The club scenes we see are dull and repetitive, with about 3 extras dancing in what is barely recognizable as a "club", barely capturing the atmosphere of the day. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie on the 80s club scene, something along the lines of what "Human Traffic" did for the late 1990s, forget "Clubbed".
