According to the blurb on the back of the DVD case; Jonothan Ross laughed until some wee came out. I suspect this has more to do with his being full of it. <br /> <br /> I've never looked at the series for one reason or another, so maybe I miss some essential clues. As for this film; I watched the first 45 minutes or so. I laughed once, smiled once, then searched for the newspaper while waiting for something else to happen. Anything. <br /> <br /> Evidently destined to be a surreal parody of post-Python life, grossly humorous, this is absolutely flat. There has been a series of comedy series on television in recent years, not the least of which were "Bottom", "The Fast Show", "The Vicar Of Dibley" and "Father Ted", each engaged in a group of bizarre but hilarious characters and sketches. Each of these could put this shit in a top hat. <br /> <br /> If the series was something like this movie; I'm surprised they got the money. Luckily it was one of those Tesco Bran-Tub purchases of Â£ 2 and is now in the local charity shop. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is; don't believe the experts, never pay a higher dollar.
