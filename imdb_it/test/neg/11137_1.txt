This was obviously the worst movie ever made ... ketchup was the starring role in this film and it would have been the only candidate for a prize ... because the plot, the actors and everything about this farce was absolutely horrible and ridiculous. I could have made a better horror film in my backyard within two hours with a camera using grass dummies as actors, even if the acting would have been better! Don't waste your time or money on this ... it's extremely poor and horrible !!
