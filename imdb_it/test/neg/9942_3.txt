This is one of many American attempts to redo an old classic British television program, which is more famous than this. From what I see no one of you has not mentioned or even acknowledged that you knew there was a TV of the 50s-60s called "Secret Agent Man" The original Secret Agent Man played the great Patrick McGoohan (The Prisoner, Braveheart , Ice Station Zebra, The Phantom, etc.) A man who was exploited to be the first James Bond, but refused because McGoohan was a very devoted man and considered James Bond's bed hopping and violent ways to be against the its values. <br /> <br /> This show was done in black and white, and it's a shame for those who haven't seen it, you're missing a lot. The character played by Mr. McGoohan in "Secret Agent Man" was called Drake, and after finishing with that show he went on to make the very popular, sometimes bizarre and controversial television series called "The Prisoner". The character he played in "The Prisoner" was that of an agent whose identity is not revealed is kidnapped and transported to an island where he does not know where he is or who is responsible for his abduction. What he knows is that his captors want to know the reasons for his resignation from the British Secret Service, and on this island the population has no names, but they are referred to by numbers and the Patricks character is assigned a number that is " 6 "It was claimed that his Prisoner character was actually the same character he played in Secret Agent Man, but McGoohan himself disputed this. <br /> <br /> Ofourse there is the unmistakable famous acronym that the original Secret Agent Man has generated. It was written by Johnny Rivers a famous pop musician from the 50s and 60s and from what I've read some of you actually think the song comes from this version of the show. You're wrong about this. It was from Johnny and comes from the original TV series, so let me help you clarify the facts. For those of you who complained that the show's name was stupid, well in England, it was actually called "Danger Man" and in the United States it was titled "Secret Agent Man". For such a stupid name the show did quite well when it was first broadcast. <br /> <br /> As this current show has little to do with the original, no main character named Drake in this, and I imagine they did their best to show this version of their version of " Secret Agent". But use the re-made version of the original song, so I can tell you that this show was actually designed to be a re-made version, even if inferior, of the original series.
