I was loaned this DVD by the director of a film I work with, in which I play an actor who plays Prospero. Knowing his style, I did not expect anything like a "classical" interpretation of the text. <br /> <br /> What I found sometimes is surprising, sometimes evocative, but often tortuous and boring. Like most experimental music, I find that in films like this, the building blocks of powerful film production are made, even if they haven't found their most useful form in a more coherent format. <br /> <br /> So we have a Caliban that is more of a clown than a threat, and that not even Miranda looks terribly scared (which is strange, since we know he tried to rape her at least once). A Stefano and Trinculo that are more annoying than funny. A strangely young Prospero that looks like Amadeus. And a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylized posture. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that I have no problem with the way Ferdanand or Miranda are portrayed. His rapt wonder and his somewhat strange innocence are actually quite appropriate. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying this is a bad movie, but an experimental one. One that takes enormous risks, but is thought of more for students of art and film and not just for anyone with an interest in the Tempest as an end in itself.
