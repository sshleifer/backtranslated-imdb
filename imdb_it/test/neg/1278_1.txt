Are you the living? OK, I think I'm an intelligent, polite, liberal and really in the movies. I like it a lot and I have a great sense of humor. I had the impression that it was a darkly painful comedy. They were paid for doing it, gasoline was used, electricity burned, food was consumed, sets built ........ why? I blame the current state of the world in this film and all those associated with it, I will even include the viewing audience. We are all to blame and deserve whatever happens. It's not funny, not much, everyone looks bored or boring. There are no conversations, the communication is minimal. There is no plot as far as I know. In fact, I just lost 89 points in a few minutes of my life. I will never go back again. The only message that came to my mind is that perhaps life is too short to sit and watch movies of people who don't do much ... and then die!
