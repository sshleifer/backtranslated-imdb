Terrible movie about a doctor who goes fishing and ends up catching a siren when he is thrown overboard. He takes him in a trap to bring her back with him. <br /> <br /> Glynis Johns, in the lead role, is really a foolish individual with a tail around. <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford is the nurse who should be so eccentric but we don't see eccentricity here. In fact, Miss Rutherford was not allowed to use her real comic gifts. <br /> <br /> Nice to see David Tomlinson in the film. He would reunite with Johns in the upper end "Mary Poppins", 16 years later. <br /> <br /> Miranda causes malice in those two boys, a neighbor's girlfriend and driver (Tomlinson) fall in love with her. > <br /> Ask any siren you happen to see, what is the best tuna, Chicken of the Sea! For this film, forget it.
