On Halloween, a city is terrified of a madman with a big pumpkin for a head. Bad acting, compromised above all by local talent and laughable special effects, makes this baaaaad unique. The B-Movie Queen Linnea Quigley seems embarrassed to be part of this and also her considerable charm that has helped so many of her other films not to be of help to this. Pass this tacky movie if you're looking for a good Halloween horror movie and rent "Night of the Demons" which also features Mrs Quigley.
