If you see the title "2069 A Sex Odyssey" in the video shop, PAY ATTENTION !! The cover has Tori Wells and three other 80s porn stars, and has a copyright from 1986. If you're like me (and I hope you're not) you'll think "80's porn? Tori Wells? Alright!" Hoax !! It was created in 1974 and has nicknamed the German stars! There is nothing inherently wrong with 1970s German porn, but it's not my cup of tea, and it's nothing like what the cover makes you believe you're getting. Once I got over my anger at the blatantly misleading jacket, I looked at it anyway. It's a bad, bad movie. Sorry, I guess I didn't get over my anger.
