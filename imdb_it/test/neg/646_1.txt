I thought about this movie when I saw the pluto nash ... because ... because both films have a strange behavior like a delayed robot, this film was made years before but probably written by a writer who drank the same coffee biotoxic or something. ..Whoa ... AVOID ALL COSTS, even to pay tribute to the late great Andy Kaufman it's hard to do here ... find another movie or just watch taxi replicas on latenight tv ... his character latka gravas is much more lovable ... TANK YOU BERRY MUCH
