Justine can't find the perfect companion to make her first time perfect. With a geeky friend in tow, enter a virtual machine to improve its appearance. When he sees the opportunity to create his perfect man, an explosion occurs and the results are left to your imagination. The problem is, how many obvious sexual beats are left anymore? How can this type of film be predictable? Some funny moments here and there, but nothing too outrageous or different from jokes in other films or even in normal life. If you liked WEIRD SCIENCE or "fish out of water" jokes combined with "gender identity crisis", then with all these 90 minutes you could enjoy yourself.
