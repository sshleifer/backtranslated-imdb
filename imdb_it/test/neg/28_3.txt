Rita Hayworth plays a dancer in the Brooklyn nightclub, Rusty, specializing in cheesecake chorus reviews; manages to put himself on the cover of a national fashion magazine, but his imminent success as a soloist (with romantic offerings in all) struck the boss Gene Kelly chewing the piece. Terribly tired piece of Technicolor cotton candy, with not memorable musical sketches (the two worst are the irrelevant flashbacks until 1890, with Hayworth portraying his grandmother). Kelly, as always, dances well but acts with false sincerity; when it is serious, it is unbearable, and for the rest of the time it flies on adrenaline. The script is a weight of lead, without even giving supportive players Phil Silvers and Eve Arden good jokes. * 1/2 from ****
