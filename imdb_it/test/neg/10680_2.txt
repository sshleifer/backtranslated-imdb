As the main "character" who likes to point out Lillith Silver - "you know everything about vampires". It is clear that this statement was aimed at the cast and crew, who create an extremely negative image of everyone's favorite bloodsuckers. According to the misguided director, the Vampires are all encrusted in white foundations and crammed in latex similar to a piece of meat in shrink film. With fangs similar to those of Bannana and a bad history of asthma, our main character Lillith creates a slapstick caricature of the vampire of "modern days". <br /> <br /> The plot consists of a collection of 9-year playstations written on a piece of paper, then mixed together to invent this horrible story. Lillith, our pale protagonist, is a vampire bounty hunter who makes a living by snatching everyone from the favorite Illuminati cult! Rather than incorporating the classic killer method of stealth and precision, Lillith sneaks in from an open window and then proceeds to bite her targets before shooting point-blank with a gun (which apparently leaves no bullet holes due to poor continuity ). PC Plod is then charged with resolving the murders, comes to the grizzly conclusion, but surprisingly obvious that Lillith is actually a Vampire and proceeds to hunt her armed with the usual vampire deployment tools including a cross, a garlic and a piece of pointed wood. Meanwhile, Lillith, who has got into the habit of rubbing her boss, is upset when an old nemesis kidnaps him and asks for a ransom to be delivered personally. As you can imagine, this does not go according to plan. Anyway, I'm not going to go through the pain of the following scenes, so I'll skip to the end. Lillith and his "nemesis" have a showdown, and after Lillith gets the victory it is revealed, with all the extravagance of someone being told they have cancer, that the two are centuries old lovers and the whole plot was a kind of twisted game. Yes, that kick in the balls was the real ending of the film. In my eyes, this line of a conclusion is the icing on the latex cake, and it seals this film in the crypt "Never look at it". <br /> <br /> With regards to film techniques, the film does not merely care about creating a style. The director tries to save his disaster from the brink of the abyss by throwing some close-ups and some multi-angle shots, but this is not the saving grace needed for the film. <br /> <br /> You might be screaming "but this is a B movie, it's going to be crap!" However, I have no mercy. I've seen some cracking B movies, like evil evil 2 and Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter, and so this misfortune can't hide behind excuses. The budget was low, this is obvious due to the lack of locations and good actors. Perhaps, however, if the director were more creative and spent less money on make-up and fake blood, he could have done something decent with this nauseating attempt. The squalid sexual scenes are of no benefit and simply served to give me some giggle at the obscene acting skills. Half the budget must have been paid to the female cast just to have the best parts looking for lesbian games. If I wanted to watch a vampire porn, I would have bought Muffy The Vampire Layer. <br /> <br /> The cast is bad, the story is worse and the effects are incredibly false. This film had potential, however its undertone and the embarrassing portrait of a classic horror character was simply his downfall. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh with some friends, I suggest you watch this joke. If you're looking for a more serious Vampire action movie, try Blade or Underworld to calm your bloodlust.
