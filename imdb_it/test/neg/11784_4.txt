Irwin Allen has put all his talents behind this: he is co-writer, producer and director of this "cartoon epic" on an atomic submarine and his efforts to reduce a ring of radiation that surrounds the Earth. The potentially exciting story fails to take off, despite an eclectic cast. Various players from Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine to Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden are interesting to each other and provide a touch of color, but this soggy sci-fi is rather poor. Good for some stray laughs, but Allen didn't seem to know the difference between a strong and solid adventure and campy nonsense. Later a popular TV series. ** from ****
