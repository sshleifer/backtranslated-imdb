OK, I have to admit that I liked House of the Dead enough despite its well documented failures. But this was the worst movie I saw from Demons at the Door. Compared to DATD the effects are far superior. However the plot is weak, the acting that reminds everyone's favorite, the porn movie, and the decisions and actions of the "characters" are constantly on the edge of the moralist. I want to try Uwe Boll's latest movie releases just to get a sense of perspective on HOTD2. I'm not suggesting that he really is the cure, more a case of a different illness, but when your senses have been insulted so abhorrently the only way is over. OK, here it is. I managed the ten line minimum limit and I won't waste any more time on celluloid waste which is House of the dead 2.
