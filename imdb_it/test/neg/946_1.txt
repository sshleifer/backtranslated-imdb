Synopsis: Kid is not accepted in any school. Create a "college" where he and his friends can celebrate using their parents' tuition money. <br /> <br /> Wow. A paean of ignorance. <br /> <br /> If you think we're all OK, man, then this movie is for you. Also, understand that: <br /> <br /> 1. Children have everything inside them - they just need to take it out. <br /> <br /> 2. The teaching really stifles the innate creativity with which everyone was born. <br /> <br /> 3. Someone else should pay you to follow your passion. <br /> <br /> 4. 300 adolescents can live together in harmony, provided they remove the restrictive rules. <br /> <br /> 5. Impromptu speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation. <br /> <br /> 6. If the Board of Education allows you to open a "charter school" with "non-traditional teaching techniques", it is because they have your best interests at heart. (Not that they are willing to let go of low-paid students who will end up working in fast food anyway.) <br /> <br /> This film is one of the genres of college comedy, such as Animal House. The model follows quite closely. The novelty, however, is a complete attack on higher education, not a parody of bad elements. The sympathetic insider, a professor who embodies the deserving part of university life, is missing. <br /> <br /> This lack of balance will lead this film to the last rows of Blockbuster. It is so unilateral, that I wondered if it was an ironic self-referential quote on the whole genre - for about a minute. The film has no deep meaning, no level, no introspection. It is as if they let some children who never went to class do what comes naturally. And what is natural is the name of the school: S ***. <br /> <br /> (I never thought I'd say this: go see something with Will Farrell, his plays can be surprisingly sophisticated).
