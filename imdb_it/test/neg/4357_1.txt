Killjoy 2 surpasses the first film by a little. The things that improved here were acting, Killjoy's makeup and history. This is more than a blood fest, it doesn't have supernatural elements like the first In this episode, Killjoy kills his victims in more normal ways, sets them on fire and doesn't shoot them with bullets left in his mouth. The only thing I didn't like about this movie, is that the ending was a little half-assed, in fact it was half-assed, they killed Killjoy in a very cheap way. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves horror movies. Seriously, the first film was good, but the second is better. 10.
