The story and the characters really do need work. The idea of ​​the world is quite orderly, but no one has bothered to develop any through exposure or through the plot. Despite the bad notes at the beginning of the film, it is logical that you do not use the exposure, since nobody is new in this world. And yet, when Matt Owens (Bill Paxton) and Byron (Bob Peck) wander off course and get lost, and are introduced to the wind worshipers and the fat, lazy and wealthy people of the museum, we don't get any real idea of ​​who these people are , or why we should worry about any of them. Smart movies have a way to develop it simply by bringing characters to life around the world. Simple things, like ordering a drink at the bar or talking about something in the past: they are the kind of things that make the movie world unforgettable, not endless shots of disgusting plans and cheap CG effects of someone trying to loop in a microlight. <br /> <br /> If this is too difficult for you, here is a little tip: lower the various positions. If everything is disconnecting because you're pulling up a lot, stay in one place for a while and let the characters talk a bit. All the superfluous shit should be removed. Get rid of the whole scene of wind worshipers. Get rid of the stuffy people in the museum. Get rid of all those flying crap unless you can make the wind relevant to the story. Have the whole thing on a big plane, or something. Make people talk about something that interests us. <br /> <br /> Hey, get rid of Bill Paxton. The film focuses on the character of Tasker and his relationship with the robot, Byron. <br /> <br /> In fact, the biggest problem with the film is that we don't care about anyone, because nobody takes the time to either explain their motivations or delve into their characters. We don't like Matt (well, because he's played by Bill Paxton, among other things). He is a rascal, who does not redeem himself enough, if not to let go of the android, Byron. And this action has even less significance than most because of three key points: <br /> <br /> 1. Byron is a murderer. 2. Byron is indestructible 3. Byron can leave whenever he's damn good. <br /> <br /> Let us try to look like Byron, because there is a kind of pathos there, but it is largely underdeveloped. All we have left is a robot boy who speaks with glassy eyes and who plays is a bit subdued and woody, a moment, and practically the next. We don't know why or how we develop emotions, but we know for sure that he killed someone. We do not know why he killed someone or the circumstances of this gruesome event, because it was not developed. We cannot feel pity for him if we do not know the story. All we know for sure is that it kills people. And he likes Bill Paxton. <br /> <br /> We do not hate Tasker enough (partly because he is played by the good guy Mark Hamill), since, however gruff and ruthless, he does nothing out of the ordinary for his character - an officer post-apocalyptic peace. Of course he kills Montclaire (Robbie Coltrane) and his team, but they are drug dealers on their way to growing poppies for heroin. And they shot him first. He does not kill anyone who does not intrude, or who does not physically try to hurt him first. This also applies to the final clash in the museum. Use some police brutality against a lazy amateur (F. Murray Abraham is wasted in this role), and everyone else is pointing a gun at him. <br /> <br /> I really don't understand what the problem is with Belitski (Kitty Aldridge), a Tasker partner. After only 10 minutes accumulated with Matt, she is ready to change position, despite her cries of loyalty, and despite Matt's rubbish talking to her and punching her. If it is love, then I will choose hatred every day. <br /> <br /> Really. Paxton's character is as lovable as Simon in "True Lies", or Pvt. Hudson of "Aliens". Does anyone fall in love with him in these films? No because? Because he is an idiot with a high mouth and a loser. Why put it at the helm of this movie?
