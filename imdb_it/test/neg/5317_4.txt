Incredibly stupid beating of the already talented John Hughes, who will soon make a film with the sperm of "Look Who's Talking" if his stars get younger. Recycle the formula "Home Alone" once again to produce this idiotic comedy, in which a child makes his way around Chicago while the inept kidnappers Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano and Brian Haley try to capture him, along the road enduring a very tiring laboriousness . If Mantegna and Pantoliano can't find a laugh somewhere in your film, then you're in trouble, but the film's laziness is more obvious in scenes where a crowd of people can't notice a child turning on the sidewalk. Absurdity.
