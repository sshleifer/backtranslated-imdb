This is a film with a wonderful concept, but a very weak writing. He should never have been released with at least three other rewrites (assuming there are). The story is held too well together and there are too many 90 degree curves in the story to make it a cohesive movie. It would be nice to see what a decent screenwriter could do with the story.
