this is only the second time I've been moved enough to write a review. unfortunately, both times they have been for films that can be described with different 4-letter words that can be defined as feces or excrement. the other film of this caliber was masked and anonymous. <br /> <br /> anywa, about the review .. there are several key things that don't go into this movie that I will describe below. <br /> <br /> 1) steven has lost the plot (ie in all his other films, the family / friend is killed.steven gets angry.steven kills people. eventually). <br /> <br /> 2) steven ran out of money (there was a good car chase scene in the beginning, but I think he blew up his budget on this and couldn't afford a decent screenwriter or editor . <br /> <br /> 3) steven no longer seems to be doing its job. instead, the fight scenes (from memory) 2 were turned upside down and back, so it was not possible to see his face. most likely a stunt double. imagine chuck norris. <br /> <br /> in summary ... the worst Seagal movie ever. the second worst movie I've seen in recent history, and I've seen a lot of bad movies.
