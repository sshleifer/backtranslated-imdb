Jerry Angell, owner of the finest zombie-horror trophy, returns for the undead action in the sequel to director Todd Sheets's atrocious Zombie Bloodbath celebration. This time, Jerry plays a deranged short hooligan who, along with his equally despicable crime buddy, some escaped prisoners, several teenagers and a group of screaming girls, comes face to face with a horde of slackers, carnivorous corpses. <br /> <br /> Obviously having learned to improve his craft in the two years following Zombie Bloodbath, Sheets offers another poor mess of a film that somehow manages to be even worse than the original ?? a business that I thought was almost impossible to achieve. The acting is evenly bad, the amateur and economic effects (most of the blood seems to be nothing more than a selection of scraps, offal and blood from the local butcher shop), the incomprehensible story (as far as I could understand, the zombies rise from the dead because a scarecrow commands them to !!!), and the frustrated charge direction of cheap-looking video effects and completely meaningless cuts to black and white. <br /> <br /> And as if that were not enough to convince you of the complete lack of saving features of this film, the simply morally amazing end should do the trick: the few surviving survivors stumble upon an abandoned truck that conveniently shows up to have a stock of carnivorous bacteria resting on its passenger seat ?? just the thing to dissolve the undead (but, strangely enough, it is not at all harmful to the living).
