Overall, this is a pretty bad film. But for $ 5 at PathMark, it was not a total waste. <br /> <br /> The whole scenario has to do with a boy who is with this snake-infected lady, presumably from a magical curse. Actors / actresses are not big names (although some seem to be on TV shows), so I won't do the usual Troy McClure thing. <br /> <br /> For a while, the film holds your interest as the couple jumps on a train and goes to Los Angeles to see a shaman who cancels the curse. There is also a bit of other weaves; like two women smuggling drugs. <br /> <br /> But the last 20 minutes prove to be a total disappointment. As violent and bloody as the entire film is, the grand finale is totally animated by the computer. <br /> <br /> I saw the unrated version that had a lot of language, blood, blood, violence, everything! The bonus features were OK. <br /> <br /> Overall grade: D-
