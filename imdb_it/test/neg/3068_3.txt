Recognizing the diner's image on the DVD's cover made me realize that it was a local film. The word Detroit in the title favored my suspicions and I did a little observation and yes, a local film was. <br /> <br /> So I got it. Someone I knew actually knew some of the producers / directors (I don't remember which one) and said that the producers / directors made sure that people paid in this movie. <br /> <br /> Brilliant! What a nice idea. Film producers take some capital to make the film, thanks to the cast and crew. So the investors (the cast, the crew, the others) get some of the profits, I'm imagining. <br /> <br /> Profits! <br /> <br /> Um anyway. This film totally disappointed me. The special effects were special as in special children who ride small buses at school. The acting was very funny, not intentionally anyway. There is a beautiful phrase in which a boy says "well, this bone will not be smoked!" as a withdrawal line. Unfortunately this is the only fun part of the whole movie. History? Well, I followed it for about 3/5, then everything stopped making sense and while we were there watching it, it suddenly ended. I mean like in ... no resolution of anything ... like they're running out of time. "Sorry folks, out of time, good night!" <br /> <br /> We sat there bewildered and whistled, and we threw another movie. Then about 20 minutes later a neighbor of mine appeared ... with one of the guys from the movie! We threw it in and he (the actor) gave us an ongoing comment, which was great because he completely ripped the movie! <br /> <br /> What more can you ask for ?? <br /> <br /> The most absurd scene for me was a motorcycle chase scene if it had been so dark that it could literally have been a boy passing by a flashlight and not a motorcycle. That and the jaw you fall face down is enough to make you howl. In pain! The zombies seemed less zombies than my colleagues. And I don't even work in the morgue. <br /> <br /> So, I suggest you see it if you can convince someone from the movie to come and give you an ongoing comment on all the things that happened behind the movie. scenes and make sure this person hates the movie because that just adds fun. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, give this a pass. Rent something like Feeders if you want a jaw droppingly in a funny movie ...
