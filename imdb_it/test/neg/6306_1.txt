Great Balls of Fire is the movie that shows someone that you really, really hate. It is an absolute torture of the highest rank and is probably used by the servants of a foreign power to extract information from captured intelligence agents. In the past I had fun with some of Dennis Quaid's performances, but in this film it's totally exaggerated. It does not cross the line too much, the rod crosses it, then it goes back to jumping over and over again. He struts and struggles like a bad acid trip. It is one of those rare performances in which you wish you could enter the film and beat the man to an inch of his life to do something really terrible. Did he desperately want to win a Golden Raspberry or some other prize for bad acting? This is the only conclusion I can find. Thanks Dennis, you've given us a bad performance for centuries. Where was the director who reigned in this guy? <br /> <br /> The opposite extreme of the extreme is Winona Ryder, she of the plastic characteristics and plastic acting. I came across a review of her acting style that compared her with a wax dummy. That was obviously an insult to inculcate dummies all over the earth, who could have had more humanity in the role of cousin / minor wife of Jerry. This brings out the confused message of the film, which being 100% okay to marry your cousin and have a child by the union. I can't see what is "ok" about it, but it seems that Hollywood thinks that incest for minors is hunky dory. It speaks of "family values". <br /> <br /> Another problem is the format. Is it a forward sign that tells the life of Lewis, or is it a musical? I'm not talking about music, I'm talking about the really weird scene where Jerry drives to school, starts playing a melody and everyone starts dancing like it's a Broadway musical in search of a Tony. Fantasy and reality are put together in a mix that doesn't work. But who really cares? I do not. And neither should you. You can't recover the minutes of life you would waste in this movie. So don't waste your time, it's too precious for something wrong and poor.
