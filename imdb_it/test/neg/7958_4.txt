Deepa again tried to bravely bring out a topic that nobody wants to talk about. The plot is OK, the cinematography is exceptional, the script and the acting are far below average. I imagine the blame is for the citizens of Uttar Pradesh in India, from which his original set was destroyed in 2000. This gave rise to a totally different cast, I just wonder what a spectacular movie it would have been if he had original Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das and Aamir Khan. Actual actors Lisa Ray (who is only good at fighting Bombay Dyeing sheets) and John Abraham are pathetic, needing basic acting lessons. Seema Biswas, Raghubir Yadav and Kulbushan Kharbabda saved the film as much as possible. The boy had done an exceptional job. Also the editing and the flow of the film are not something you would expect from Deepa. Big topic, send a strong message about a practice that is still quite rampant in rural India, but it is not up to the standards that Deepa has set on Fire and Earth. Watch it once ... when it's on DVD, don't worry about paying $ 10 to see it .... well, its release beats the average Hindi movie every day
