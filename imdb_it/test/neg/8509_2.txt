If you haven't read Tolkien's masterpiece; get ready for perhaps the best cinematic experience ever! If you still have ... After reading the books several times, for many years, I have come to love the characters and the story, and I feel I know him intimately. I have my personal vision of The Shire, Hobbiton and the character gallery. So for me the film was a disappointment. Why? Determine the appearance of the characters (inevitably), change the events, remove the important plot, remove the not too important plot. Great pieces of what makes the Lord of the Rings what it is, is simply ignored. Even the special effects of 2001 cannot do justice to Tolkien's imagination (and yours). Peter Jackson made an honest attempt at the impossible, and I don't think anyone else could have done it better! But the fact remains, I'm sorry to see the film. The next time I read The Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson's limited vision will jump forward, not mine.
