Doesn't this seem a little familiar? Oh wait, it's true .. 90% of the lines in this film have already been made in the TV series. What's the point in repeating yourself, could you ask? Is it for the benefit of Americans who have not seen the program? Were the writers left without inspiration? Or maybe everyone on the set suffered a sudden attack of amnesia and forgot they had already covered this ground? However, for someone who participated in the first three series, this was really boring. I had to turn it off during the part of the 'tablet that runs your green water' .. yes it's very funny, but give us something original for heaven's sake! Actually, if the best things you can find are Leonard Rossiter's Saturday Night Fever performances, you can forget about them. <br /> <br /> The boy who replaced Richard Beckinsale is a double, all right, but not half an actor. Personally I would have exorcised the role, as a sign of respect for him. Or even better, without worrying about making the film, and letting the hilarity of the TV series speak for itself. But no, they couldn't do it ... not as long as there was money to be made. Sad, really. 4/10
