Dean Cain, the only Superman, plays Max Hooper the super-thief. He can enter any company and steal anything for the right price. Unfortunately his latest robbery puts him in a skyscraper where someone else set fire to hide his attempts to steal the product. Now the thief finds himself having to be the hero who saves everyone in the building. Unfortunately the other thief is still in the building and the F.B.I. & CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY. I'm out waiting for Max. <br /> <br /> The movie is barely viable. Dean Cain is a fun actor and has done much better with more improved material, but here he has a weak script and a rather poor direction.
