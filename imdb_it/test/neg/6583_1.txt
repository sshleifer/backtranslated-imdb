Very similar to Final Fantasy, if you look at a still image - it doesn't look so bad. But when people start moving, it's absolutely terrifying. Irregular jerky movements, frightening lack of emotion, and the lack of a feeling of life in the face gives me the chills. The characters don't even seem ALIVE / organic. <br /> <br /> I saw a preview with my daughter, who really fell asleep! She was not engaged at all. For the record, I thought it could be easily involved in both Pixar movies and a series of "bad" 2D movies like Sinbad. <br /> <br /> Lighting is painful, giving children the appearance of holding a flashlight under their chin to a bonfire. The lip-synching is bad, even worse than Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> I also seriously doubt that Hanks played five characters ... this was a great distraction for the whole movie. The role of the conductor is disturbing, although in a way that I cannot identify. It reminds me of the false voice of my father's "phone" when he greets customers. I think this is why the multiple roles are distracted - you are perfectly aware that the voice is the same, but nevertheless distinctly different. It gives each character the feeling of being SHAKED, as opposed to being real human characters. The illusion of reality is broken by Hanks' multiple role-playing game. I've seen the technique work - at Eddie Murphy, but Hanks can't get close to just pulling out a voice, given the horrible animation. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't waste my money on this - wait for the rental.
