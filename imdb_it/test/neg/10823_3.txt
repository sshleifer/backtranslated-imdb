I rented this movie from Blockbust because of the cover and the title! Seems intriguing !! This film suffered from writing, it needed more suspense. The "monsters" needed more time to deal with. We needed them to have some sort of special power and certainly more "Oh Sh--" moments. The photograph did not bother me except for the scene in which a riffler explodes. There were too many close-ups. But apart from that the film seemed to drag on and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom. Overall, I would say that everyone has also spent a lot of time with writers. But this film is definitely below average rent. <br /> <br /> There are certainly better choices. I would recommend Anacondas 1 or 2 on this choice.
