This movie was Flippin Terrible ... I wanted those hours of my life back. For God's sake, it's a long way from this horrible snot movie at all costs. The title is not worth mentioning, but the rankings on this film are rather generous for a vomit movie like this. And where do I start? The stupid children of A ** in the film ..... The plot or the story zero? ... the college-college swat scenes / frat boy-esquire? Or the anguished and anguished VERY bad insinuations? $$$ # @% @! My God, it's NEVER finished! ..... I remember thinking that I would have preferred to kiss the floor of the cinema, then sit back in this one. <br /> <br /> But what do you expect? Most people with brain power to look at reviews will not be the target audience here, so GO SEE Pirites 2 again, or Jet Lee's, -If you're arguing about yourself. Look, this movie will cost you your soul, your money, your energy and your brain cells. LISTEN TO THE NOTICE.
