It was as if someone was trying to create a scary video game and a documentary at the same time. The historical aspect was great. Everything else was horrible, the thorns for the filmmakers other films that seemed to happen every other minute, the ghost hunting video was edited like a scary movie rather than an investigation, they had haunted house music and sound effects they would be distracted by what was happening. Thank you for losing 2 hours of my time! When there was evidence, he would have flown away! Most were just people talking about the place. The Ghosthunters Ghosts episode shows that he went there to absolutely destroy this show. I'm so angry about the sci-channel for playing this, I haven't seen it since it was broadcast.
