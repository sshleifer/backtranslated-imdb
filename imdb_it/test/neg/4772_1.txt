The ruins are for Turistas as Deep Impact was for Armageddon, a worse version of a slightly funny movie, except very much worse. One of the characters should go to medical school, so why are they all retarded? "you can't keep cutting". - the best line forms this film. This is a terrible film. I like horror movies, but I fully appreciate that many of them are terrible, but I had a bit of hope for this movie after seeing the reviews on IMDb. The situation they are in is stupid and the way they handle it makes them stupid. It's horrible, the only thing that makes it quite appealing is its fresh Australian backdrop, despite the fact that they spend most of the film in one place.
