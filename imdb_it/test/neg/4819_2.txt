New Orleans does not resemble how it is depicted in this <br /> movie debacle. Quaid's attempt to speak with a cajun accent <br /> (by the way, almost no one talks like this in New <br /> Orleans) is terrible. Plot = elementary and brainless. This image <br /> <br /> refers to itself as a mystery, but a mystery involves a gradual process <br /> <br /> in which a viewer is given clues and twists during a movie . There is nothing like this here. "Big <br /> <br /> Easy" tries to get by on trivial New Orleans stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled - the real Big Easy is not like the city <br /> <br /> that Quaid and Barkin scoff at.
