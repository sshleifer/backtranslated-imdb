A Chinese band attacks and wipes out another band at the beginning of the film. Unfortunately, the patriarch of the winning family is killed in the process. Strangely, and without any discernible reason, the gang urges a volunteer to blame the massacre and leaves until the police decide to stop investigating. Now, ONE MAN ALONE is responsible for around 50 deaths, besides me, so sending this boy away seemed silly, but this is the plot. Later, when this man returns home, there have been betrayals and intrigues that have led to nearly an hour and fifteen minutes of non-stop murders. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a Chinese martial arts film with a lot of plot, then you should probably skip this movie, like its practically continuous action and virtually no plot or character development - even when compared to other films of martial arts. I estimate that 80-90% of the film are fight scenes: endless fighting scenes that are reasonably well done using knives. Again and again and again, fighting scenes! If you want a film with hundreds of bodies, people are cut, kicked and cut, so this is the movie for you. The problem was that at the end of the film there are literally no people to kill and the film has really lost my interest !! After all it is not, but if you want to see ONLY the excitement and the action, then this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> By the way, this film is set in contemporary times and no one thinks of shooting the hero until almost the end. And, when they FINALLY do the logical thing, it's too late and the effort is really, really lame! Logical errors like this and the lady's suicide (why ???) make this type of film "turn off the brain".
