The few scenes that actually attempt a representation of the revolutionary struggle resemble a troop of shaggy Boy Scouts that meanders through holes. When Sharif or, please, God, Palance test themselves in a fiery oratory, they seem to Kurtz to swallow an insect. The demonstrations of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of Cuba full of smiling whistles in the ocean and a positively Vaudevillian hypothesis on how the Bay of Pigs came true. What does it leave us? A scene of comic dentistry; an excess of Hollywood peasants who turn to the camera as if it were a moving train; and, just to joke, a passley of homoeroticism that is not limited to Castro's maniac and incessant fellatio. Never trust a Medved, but even a broken watch is right twice a day: this is a HISTORICALLY ugly film.
