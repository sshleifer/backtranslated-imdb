If Jacqueline McKenzie and John Lynch were not such talented actors this movie would probably be even worse than it actually is. The story of two mentally disturbed people who fall in love and have a baby is interesting and worth exploring. on the negative side, the plot becomes more and more exaggerated as the story progresses, and the musical choices become increasingly bizarre, so much so that in the end I found myself laughing when I know the director wanted me to cry.
