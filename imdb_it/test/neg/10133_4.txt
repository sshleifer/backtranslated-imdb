Describing this film is a difficult task. On the one hand, it is an over-the-top spookfest for vampires, complete with cobwebs, eerie music, a hypnotic medallion and, of course, a coffin with a creaky lid. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is one of the stupidest scripts on this side by Edward D. Wood, Jr. Produced by the same people who gave us "The Bloody Vampire", "Invasion of the Vampires ", and the predecessor of this film, the modestly titled" The Vampire "," the film approaches the lack of logic that characterizes the other films. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is a sequel to "The Vampire", which I have not seen. But it does not matter ... it is easy to imagine what happened. Dr. Enrique, played by Abel "The Brainiac" Salazar, is confused when Dr. Marion, well-intentioned but ill-led, reports the body of his vampire enemy, Count Karol de Lavud (I suppose there is a rule somewhere that all vampires must be counted of some sort.) Dr. Marion complains that all the important doctors throughout history have had to resort to a kind of robbery to advance their medical studies, and hopes to use the corpse of the vampire to study phenomena such as the lack of a normal reflection of the vampire (at what point he holds a mirror up to the vampire and instead of no reflection, we see the skeleton of the vampire. ???). <br /> <br /> Enrique is not satisfied, and seems determined to transmit the events of the first film as pure fantasy and superstition. "This man was not a vampire ... I admit he liked to drink some blood, but that's all!" he states. There is also the fragile Martha, a part-time nurse and a part-time showgirl (!) Who seems to be the object of Enrique's affection. Martha escaped from de Lavud's clutches in the first film, and apparently Enrique spent a lot of time "healing her mind" and convincing her to think that everything she lived was not real. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you were the writer of this movie, you would need a way to make someone stupid enough to pull the vampire pole out, right? Well, what about the greedy swindler who helped Marion steal the coffin? After catching a glimpse of Lavud's body, he fixes his eyes on the expensive-looking brooch that the Count is wearing, and conveniently comes back to steal it when the doctors don't look. But dammit ... he can't remove the pin because of the stake, so ... you guessed it. De Lavud is free again, this time with the dark cheat as his human henchman. <br /> <br /> OK, so obviously the vampire is back behind Martha, and meanwhile the doctors are really confused about what they believe. At first they are determined to show that there is no real vampire, then at the end of the film they are trying to convince the police to put a bulletin on points for "a man who died but is still alive!" <br /> <br /> You can probably imagine the rest of the plot from here, but the filmmakers give you some nice twists. One of the sets for the film is a ghostly wax museum (is there any other genre in these types of films?), Complete with a fully equipped torture chamber ... with real torture and equipment for execution. The film has a strong sense of style, and not only in the campy webs. A truly gruesome sequence makes de Lavud chase a victim in a seemingly endless series of streets and alleys, following their progress alongside vague buildings with no doors as he illuminates the scene like a German expressionist nightmare ("Dr. Caligari's Cabinet" seems to be a 'influence). <br /> <br /> But the rest of the film is youthful, particularly in the climax of the film. The special effects are quite raw, even for the year it was made, and the bat fight with de Lavud is quite laughable ... but the director feels the need to ask us to believe that Martha would faint and it would collapse directly over a guillotine, positioned so that its head was in the perfect position to be cut by the blade, which risks falling because the containment rope has suddenly begun to slip off RIGHT AT THAT MUCH MINUTE! What an unfortunate coincidence! To make matters worse, he cuts away from the frayed rope to Enrique's scenes as they try to dodge the bat dive, practically stationary and waving his arms around. It is certainly a moment for Ed Wood, if ever there was one, especially when Martha seems to revive herself and stands up with an agitated air just as the blade crashes. Thank god! What a relief! In terms of kookiness, "The Vampire's Coffin" doesn't have the madness factor of "The Bloody Vampire" or "Invasion of the Vampires", but fans of these types of old horror movies will appreciate atmospheric photography, and the fact that the director manages to snatch some real thrills from this material to "count" something (haw haw).
