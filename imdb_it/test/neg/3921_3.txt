Obviously influenced by the success of "Destination Moon" by Pal and by "Rocketship X-M" by Lippert, this is not the right cut. Limited special effects, a subtle plot results in a production that even the semi-decent cast can't save. Only no credibility here. No one seems surprised to see Martians, much like Earthmen, etc. Etc. Roll over!
