Yes, the film was boring and bland. after a certain point, I wanted the crocodile to eat these people just to make it through the film. <br /> <br /> The plot is that three Australians make a fishing trip on a river in a small boat, where the fishing guide is supported by a gun. He says he does it only for insurance purposes, all the crocs were driven out of this river. It is immediately eaten by a Croc. The trio is then chased by a tree, scolded by the reptile in their attempts to escape. They spend most of the movie discussing the best way to escape. <br /> <br /> Predictably, the only survivor finds the guide's gun and shoots the crocodile. Aww, they killed the only nice character in the movie! <br /> <br /> Where are Paul Hogan or Steve Irwin when you really need them?
