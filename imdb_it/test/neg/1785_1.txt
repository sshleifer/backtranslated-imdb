Why do you ask, does this man claim to have the truth behind the existence of the almighty? Well, your deductive logic, my friends, you understand that I know that God exists because Satan does, how else have my poor eyes been soiled on such a horrendous film? Yes, there is no doubt, on a cold Friday in the year 2006 Satan possessed me and forced me to watch this film. Him what? You wonder; the devil makes the girls spit vomiting and climb the ceilings, why waste his time making you watch this movie? My only conclusion to this question is that Satan believes that Camp Fear is the worst form of deadly punishment, that you don't tear your eyes or make you speak in tongues, instead it makes you sit without mind through an hour and a half of the movie more terrible I've ever been. Can this movie be terrible as he says? Yes, my friend who watches this movie is the equivalent of being kicked in the bag about fifty million times, maybe more. But maybe I'm too strict, this movie has a few moments in it, the beginning, for example, starts in a sister's house with lots of topless girls; now I've never been to a college, I'm not sure girls really do that, but hey you can always pray. Now, after the five minutes of boobs and butt are over, a scene is presented to us on a college campus for girls; the girls themselves (about eight in all) are in an archaeological class, where they discuss virgin sacrifices and ancient mounds. Flash forward the class professor (who seems to be the only male of this college for girls) takes a handful of his unmarried students, in addition to his girlfriend, in a remote lake in the mountains, their research, to find ancient Indian artifacts; yes, right professor, we know what your point of view is. Now it is here that the film comes to life, the group of five, four girls, a boy stops at a gas station to get some directions, but here is a band of bikers who pull up and harass the girls, and then leave them alone and go their separate ways. Moving on you come to a "campsite" made up of four logs and some trees and then things start to go terribly wrong. First prof. and his girlfriend goes wandering to have some time alone when one of the girls agrees to find them, only to be captured by an unknown force. Continuing the other two girls start looking for the missing girl when the bikers, plus a drunken boyfriend, come looking for them, their plan, to rape the girls and do horrible things to them. The film continues with something about a druid who needs four virgins for a sacrifice to save the world from a species of water monster before the year two thousand; but theirs is a hitch to this plan Mr. Druid, one of the girls is devirginized right in front of us, so that plan goes away. Now since I said there would be spoilers I will go ahead and ruin the end of the film for you, the four girls will be taken, drugged with a little green and then they will be ready to be sacrificed, after one of them killed the two remaining motorcyclists and prof. come and save them; they stand on a ledge where the non-starring motorcyclist says, "I think I can get there!" just to jump off and break a leg. The professor. runs to the guy and remains submissive leaving the biker only once rape-now-heroic left to defend himself from the giant druid 6'3 ". First he makes a pathetic attempt with a stick then pulls a knife, the knife reflects a bit of lazer puts it in a mouth of golden snakes and lights up the druid on the fire instantly, after which they take away the wounded on stretches of the emergency stick and reflect if everything is really over, only to have the bubble of the lake showing the monster inside it he still lives, it is the film and this is my review, which unfortunately will not be read by most of the eyes since this is only the fifth review published for a film released fifteen years ago, fortunately Satan can only reach some of us and not everyone. The judge would like to make a sincere apology to the poor girl from Circuit City that I will borrow this movie: "I'm sorry Sheila, please don't hate me for letting you see it. "
