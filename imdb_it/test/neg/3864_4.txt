This is the first time I feel the need to comment on IMDb, to write a sort of review and, as often happens, it is not for a really excellent film, but for a truly terrifying film. <br /> <br /> Take the younger narrative style could relate to the Max Payne video game series, a cast of practically unknown (which is not a bad thing in itself), poor dialogues, some dark scenes but not enough numerous, and make a film out of it. Don't worry about bad acting, length (too long), lack of immersion (the main character must be one of the least interesting I've seen in a long time) couldn't care less if he died) or the often ridiculous solutions they find to certain problems in which the protagonist finds himself. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't have written anything if it wasn't for another review here, giving it 10 stars. I gave four, but maybe three is closer to what I feel about it. Not only do I not want to see it again, but the thought alone brings me dangerously close to wanting to kill myself. Oh, and a so-called film noir is nothing without a good soundtrack - not the case here. The final song seems to be better suited to a western movie. <br /> <br /> It's not romance, it's not action, it's not noir, it's not good. This would be my review if it were not for the minimum of 10 lines.
