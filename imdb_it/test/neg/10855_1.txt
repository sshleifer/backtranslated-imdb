This is the chance of the worst and most disappointing movie I've ever seen. I spent four years at two universities and I know there must be a good film about the experience. This is not it. The "acting" is a horrible god and the plot does not exist. <br /> <br /> Here are some episodes of my one year in residence. <br /> <br /> 1) An elegant boy who unknowingly came down with a transvestite. 2) The best friend of two girls - one with huge breasts and the other with the nickname "the brick". 3) A couple that moves too hard. 4) The boy who gets all the girls 5) The boy from Northern Ireland who is very difficult to understand. 6) McDonalds in bed 7) Curry every night for a week 8) Strike the students, a couple of my classmates ended up in the hospital 9) The common discarded that started the fire. 10) The flood 11) The boy who wakes up on his floor to discover that every piece of furniture has been taken from his room. <br /> <br /> And if I can find this list in 5 minutes and from real life, I'm sure a couple of writers can do better, much better. <br /> <br /> And for a movie named after a Sleeper song, where is the Britpop soundtrack?
