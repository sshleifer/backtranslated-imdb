I just finished watching Goliath Awaits that I ordered from my library. I remembered it vaguely for years and wanted to see it with my son. However, the film lasted less than 2 hours and I thought it was much longer when I saw it for the first time. The back of the VHS box states that the Goliath "draws a Nazi file whose secrets could destroy the free world forever". The divers were supposedly on a secret mission to retrieve the demonic document. Nothing has been said about the recovery of this document. Furthermore, the box says that "the insatiable boiler of the bestial ship feeds on human blood". This would make this horror film and nothing in this film was revealed about it. I don't remember the details when I saw it on TV years ago ... but could the back of this box be true? Did the 3-hour movie reveal more details? <br /> <br /> I just wonder if anyone knows anything about this.
