This (very) low budget movie is fun if you're a John Krasinski fan, but it's otherwise disappointing. At least it was short, so I didn't feel like I had wasted too much of my time. John's scenes are quite funny, but the "deep" attempted scenes with Lacey Chabert are rather sickening. It starts as if it might seem like a funny movie, but some of the characters are so extravagant while the others are too serious to be saggy. Don't let me start on the finale. It was totally unlikely and didn't even fit the rest of the film. I will say that I was not bored, and that is why I valued it above three. John Krasinski fans will enjoy seeing him with a bandana and stockings around his head and eating Cheez-Its. Oh, and be sure to take a look at John's deleted scenes, they are better than those that were actually included in the movie.
