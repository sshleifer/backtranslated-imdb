Before sitting down and watching this movie on HBO, I didn't expect anything but a few laughs here and there and all together a stupid and common storyline. Well, that's exactly what I got, except that I was a little satisfied at the end of the film. I didn't expect it to be, I thought it would be another hour and a half that I had in my hands to lose. Well, it was, but still it was worth it. The whole plot was very stupid, cheap, and some lines were very stupid. Otherwise, he has always had funny moments, though not many. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're going to rent this, don't do it. Watch it on television. I gave it a 4, I was generous because it made me laugh, but it was still pretty stupid.
