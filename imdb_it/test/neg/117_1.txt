This film is a waste of time. I expect an action movie to have more than 2 explosions and some shots. Damme's acting is horrible. He was never an actor, but here he is worse. It was definitely better in his previous films. His part for the script of the entire film was probably not more than a page of stupid floggers. The whole dialogue in the film is a disaster, like the plot. The title "The Shepherd" makes no sense. Why didn't they just call it "border patrol"? The fighting scenes could have been better, but either they weren't able to afford it, or the fighting choreographer suffered from lack of ideas. This is a low type of low-cost action film.
