When a losing teenager gets bitten by an insect, he becomes the superhero Dragonfly ... <br /> <br /> Superhero Movie is the latest spoof movie that hits the screens. Unfortunately, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with Airplane!, Top Secret and The Naked Gun movies) he still suffers from the guilt of the most recent parodies ... above all it is more stupid than funny! The fault is mainly the gags. It's just not funny enough. Some lines work, like the scene of nail guns, but other parts simply fall flat. The parody of the X-men, for example, or the entire fart sequence. Blazing Saddles is not! One of the key things about the best spoof movies, like Airplane, is that although the dialogue is extremely fun, the cast for most cases is completely linear. This makes it even more fun. Even when there is a simple dialogue in the foreground, there may be fun things happening behind the cast. Funny again. The other fundamental thing is that they all have a plot of sorts, to hang the gags. <br /> <br /> The recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies, THEN try and spoof them. As a result, the so-called plot of these films rarely exists. Another shortcoming of these films is that some scenes were actually fun in the original versions and, in most cases, even more fun than the scene! The cast tries to get into the spirit required, but with a lot of dialogues and unpleasant scenes, it's hard to be solved in this regard. <br /> <br /> As recent fake movies do, it's not as bad as Epic Movie, Date Movie, or the terrible Meet The Spartans, but considering that some people involved here have made good and funny movies in the past, not it's nowhere near good enough.
