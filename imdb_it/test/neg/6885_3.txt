This episode has just aired in the UK. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. The heavy touches of humor were reckless, childish and belittled by what could have been a pretty good plot. I can't believe that Jerry Bruckheimer allowed this episode to take place. I saw every previous episode of this show, and even the episode where Jack played his own older self was far ahead of this episode. The lesbian kiss was pathetic sensationalism. <br /> <br /> Furthermore there was no continuity with the previous episode. There was nothing in the plot to investigate Martin's dangerous behavior or possible drug addiction. Likewise, there was nothing explicitly written about Jack's flourishing relationship with Ann. Usually Without A Trace is good enough in this kind of continuity. <br /> <br /> The next episode must be a noticeable improvement.
