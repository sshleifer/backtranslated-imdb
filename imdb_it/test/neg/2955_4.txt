A slight spoiler in the second paragraph. <br /> <br /> Anna Christie was Garbo's first chatterbox. She and Dressler look like the only people who know what they're doing in this movie. The old man who plays Garbo's dad (George F. Marion) in the film is really a bit boring !! All he does is wobble drunk in a totally false way and shout "dat old dah-veel sea". He blames Garbo's "past", his whole life and Everything on the sea! He runs into the stupid x 10. Charles Bickford is Matt, the rough and casual sailor that Garbo falls in love with, and looks good in his role, but nothing really exceptional. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Garbo unleashes his "terrible secret" on Bickford and his father. Finally, Marion stops talking about the evil of the sea and beats her head and fists on the table in perfect time with Bickford. Then he soon throws himself into a farce on the sea. <br /> <br /> I practically had to try to finish Anna Christie. It is too melodramatic in many parts and squeaky. There are many good speeches but this is not one of them. If you haven't seen Garbo before trying something else before Anna Christie, like CAMILLE or GRAND HOTEL.
