The film "Chaos" takes its name from the explanation of the science of chaos of Gleick in 1988. What does the book or something related to the content of the book have to do with the plot of the movie "Chaos"? Anything. The directors seem to have leafed through the book (obviously without understanding one thing) in search of a "theme" to combine the series of trivial action sequences that overlap with the subtle sequence of events that acts in place of a plot in the film. In this regard, the film "Choas" recalls the Canadian effort "Cube", in which the primes function as a device to mystify the public so that the ridiculousness of the plot is not noticed: in "Cube" a group of prime numbers are thrown so that viewers attribute their lack of understanding to the lack of knowledge about prime numbers: the same approach is taken in "Chaos": the disconnected excerpts from Gleick's books are thrown into making the villain's actions in the film seem diabolically smart. This, of course, is an insulting condescension treatment for the public, and any literal reader of "Chaos" who can bear to sit through the entire film will end up being disoriented. How could such a bad film be made? Rewritten as a novel, the story of "Chaos" probably would not even exceed the desk of a literary agent. How could (at least) hundreds of thousands (and probably millions) of dollars have been thrown away on what can be considered a waste of time for everyone except those who took money home from the movie? As for what is in the film, every performance is called. Save for technical problems, it would be amazing if more than one scene were used for a scene. The story is uniformly meaningless: the last time I saw a disconnected story was the production of an eight-year literal. Among the other enormous shortcomings there are the following: The villain leaves clues to the police to follow. You have no reason to leave such suggestions. Police officers do not carry or use radios. The villain's duplicates have no reason to act in concert with the villain. Allow me to strongly recommend that nobody watch this movie. If there's any other movie you like (or even just don't hate), watch it instead.
