OK, so I know better than watching SciFi movies. . . Um, I'm sorry. . SyFy. Or shifafa. Or whatever it is now. So denounce me. I spent the whole Saturday doing a consulting brainstorming for a nonprofit. I can be forgiven for falling into my chair and wanting to see a movie I'd never seen, rather than reading Proust in the original or learning to play the oud. <br /> <br /> What to say, I didn't deserve Open Graves. Of which I have not seen anyone, incidentally. Were there any? I fell asleep? Why is this called? <br /> <br /> Some icky images. Not many fears. As with too many films in modern horror films, no motivation is given - apart from shared humanity - to worry about these people. Half a point, however, for the legless entrepreneur, who was a clich√©, but he had a good scene. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of comedies like Final Destination distributed via a board game. The game looks intriguing and involves one of my favorite old puzzles. I will give it a lot. The drawback is that the game had more personality than most characters. <br /> <br /> As for the end, if you didn't see it coming, then I think you fell asleep. Somewhere back to the dawn of the genre.
