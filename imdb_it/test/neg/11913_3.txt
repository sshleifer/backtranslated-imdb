I have to admit that I'm not a fan of Monogram Chan movies. . The plot, which involves the theft of radios from a bank vault, is a bit far-fetched and far from the atmospheric mysteries produced by Fox. Mantan Moreland and Benson Fong (as No. 3 Son Tommy) provide some laughter as usual. But otherwise there isn't much here. Great title that is wasted.
