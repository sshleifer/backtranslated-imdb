I really like the science fiction films of the 50s. I like really good ones (like The Day the Earth Stood Still, When Worlds Collide, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and many others) and sometimes the worst ones because they can be really fun and fun to watch with friends (like plan 9 from outer space). However, when a sci-fi movie is bad but not bad enough to be funny, it should be avoided. This film is just a movie. Posters make it look like a kind of sexy beast that is attacking humanity, while the real storyline is far less interesting. A woman is married to a womanizer. It is contaminated and begins to grow to become a HUGE size and decides to track down this worm and kick its tail and that's it. Also, many of the special effects really stink, especially the giant papier-mache hand that enters the room to grab the evil hubby.
