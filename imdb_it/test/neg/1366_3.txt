This is one of those religious horror films that never explain why the forces of "evil" are 10,000 times stronger than those of "good". Here we have a satanic cult that can: 1) "move away" people (as in "Star Trek"), 2) kill through small children's dolls, 3) transfer a soul from one body into another, 4) hypnotize telepathically from a greater distance, and 5) cause drastic motor vehicle accidents in which selected people turn into spaghetti while others (children, in this case) survive unharmed. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the "good" forces "can: 1) sit around helplessly, 2) walk around cluelessly, 3) panic, 4) laugh hysterically, 5) waste time doing nothing, 6) read comics while people are being massacred by dozens, and 7) arrive too late to satanic rituals. <br /> <br /> In any religious horror film I must assume that the world of that film is inhabited by God and Satan "I must also suppose that Satan cannot be 1,000,000 times more powerful, unless the film has a world order similar to that of Hell. In other words, where were the priests in this film who knew something? The best what the priest of this film could do is suppose that there are some witches - nothing else - from reading all those books in his study.To the first sight of violence this priest becomes catatonic, then he laughs hysterically, only to end up in an attack of panic, so this should be God's contribution to the struggle against Satan? Ridiculous. Every good religious horror film has the powers of the "good" endowed with some form of (more or less) supernatural power, or at least ANY concrete knowledge of how to fight the "evil". In this sense this film is quite idiotic. How is the casting of droll Martin to play the high priest (!) Of the cult. There is very little threat or astonishment at seeing the bizarre Martin conduct a satanic ritual. I mean, wasn't it to be Christopher Lee or Langhella, but couldn't they have found someone with a less funny look? Also, why does the couple return to the city after their car has been disabled? After their "friendly" meeting with the people of the city, no sane person would come back; they should have just walked. The explanation of the man to his girlfriend (and to the spectator) is that "who knows what's in that direction".
