I really thought it would be a good movie, boy ... I was wrong! For a quick summery: B acting degree for the special C grade effects for the film in general. Don't get me wrong, the story was pretty good and it's not kiddish so even an adult gets along, the "hero" is good-looking, so most women will like it :-), not a total chick movie as it contains fight scenes and some blood <br /> <br /> but the way it is shot ... horrible <br /> <br /> special effects-> would be more suitable for TV- > in a children's show <br /> <br /> and finally ... send some actors to the acting school if they have ever attended a course there. <br /> <br /> Believe me, there are better ways to waste 2 hours. <br /> <br /> You have been notified.
