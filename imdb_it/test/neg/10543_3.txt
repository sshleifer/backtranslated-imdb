I liked the first "Toxic Avenger", but the sequel didn't work. There are some fun gags in the opening, involving members of the house for the blind, but beyond that point I was simply bored. The sequel is also full of very bizarre and low-key humor. Only this time it's not fun! Most of the gags revolve around crusty Japanese stereotypes. Almost every Japanese character seems to cut the fish. Does everyone in Japan cut the fish? Troma movies are known to be more than irreverent, but if you're going to use humor that involves racial stereotypes, at least make it fun. I can't laugh if I get the same shit I've seen a million times before! One thing I have to give credit for is free nudity. There is also more free nudity than in the first. But overall I was very disappointed and the film ends with a boring chase scene that made me snort and snort, dying because the film would vanish in black. At least there's an exhilarating joke from the movie that made me cry with laughter. After the villain says a sentence from Shakespeare to one of the local citizens, the citizen (an elderly woman) responds by saying: "F ** k tu - that's from David Mamet". <br /> <br /> My score: 3 (out of 10)
