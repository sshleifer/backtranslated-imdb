This film could have been an impressive epic, but the producers seem to have done their best to make it look silly. Even God himself is not spared in this film, as his words are full of childish jokes. The result is blasphemous and annoying. Only people who do not bother to see an economic parody on biblical history could perhaps watch this film without embarrassment. The creators of this insipid production should see "The Gospel According to Matthew" (The Gospel According to Matthew), a film by Pier Paolo Pasolini, which shows that it is not necessary to pervert the words of the Bible to make a good story; the most impressive result is obtained from a sincere rendering of the plain text.
