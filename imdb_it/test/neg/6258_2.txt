This film was one of those films in which he completely deceived me into thinking that it was a poor slogan of the 80s, based on the cover, but it wasn't. It was probably one of the worst slasher movies I've ever seen. The image on the cover did not correspond to any part or scene of the film; in fact it didn't involve a chainsaw. Not even the tag line fits the movie. The film is about a group of cheerleaders and two potheads running away in a desolate cabin, in cold woods, for a weekend. However, things get colder when they start being killed by an unknown killer. At the same time, the local sheriff's department is hunting down a dangerous killer. I'll call the problems in a list. <br /> <br /> 1. The acting. The boy was cheap and terribly bad. It seemed unnatural and seemed to think it was very scripted. None of the actors looked as if they were trying to perform well and therefore seemed stupid and tired. There has been a bad acting by all the characters in the film, so I will not indicate specific people, but I will say that the stoners have done a horrible job, as well as the police and the cheerleaders, which is no surprise. br /> <br /> 2. The plot. This story had created a perfect script for the best fashion film, but instead they had it strewn with holes in the plot, useless and useless scenes and a stupid general retrospective to the killer intentions. There were big holes in the plot, including how the killer killed the last victim so quickly and yet is still present in the group of girls when it happened? The former prisoner had practically no purpose in the film other than being a useless plot device. There were random and unnecessary sex and nudity scattered throughout the film, even for a b-movie or for my taste it was a bit too much. As for the killer's intentions, he just lets it be said that he was stupid and it makes no sense why she / he is killing young girls. Also, there were some very predictable killings that I saw about 30 miles away. <br /> <br /> 3. The technical side. The lighting was fine, certainly not the worst lighting I saw in a movie, but there were places where it was supposed to be dark, but it looked more like the afternoon. The house looked darker with the lights on, then the lights off. The work with the camera was average, it didn't have good shots or incredible panoramas or zoom, I thought that doing the job created some suspense with his shot. <br /> <br /> In general, this film, in terms of plot, character development and performance was a huge disappointment and a waste of time. What I thought would be a great slasher movie turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was really ugly and made of wood, there was almost no sense in the plot and there was no emotion for this film. However, the technical aspect of this film saved it for me, because if the camera worked or the lighting was bad, I would have turned off the DVD player and blown up something else. I would recommend this film to those who love really naughty b-movies and those who follow cult classics, because this film certainly is. I would partially recommend this film for those who love films from the 1980s. But for me, this film was pitiful and absolutely horrible.
