This film is painful. This is probably the best way to describe it. It is 93 minutes of your life that you will never be able to go back. Well, actually it's more like 86 minutes because there's no way anyone wants to sit through the credits in this stinking pile of dog feces. Immediately it can be said that the film comes from the producer of "Mortal Kombat", due to its annoying and annoying techno soundtrack. This drains the few delicious moments that this film can give you. The rest is drained by the absolutely disinterested and annoying characters, the acting skills of "Freddie Prinze, Jr. School of Acting" of all those involved (including the miscellaneous Christopher Lambert) and the non-existent direction. Did I leave something? Of course I did it. Let's not forget the script that leads to suicide, with its funny (??) funny dialectic. Oh yes, and we also talk about how they shamed the original poem with this sad and useless futurist / medieval translation. The costumes and weapons (were those gigantic pizza cutters that I kept seeing?!?!) They are simply stupid, this is the best way to describe them. And the last culprit of the night is the always terrible CGI. When will filmmakers learn that CGI sucks? When will we see the wonderful effects used in the 80s? Probably never, but films like this and "Star Wars, Episode 1: The Phantom Menace" make us want them to bring them back. In closing, avoid this movie like the new Freddie Prinze movie, Jr. Then again, if you like Freddie Prinze, Jr., then you deserve to sit down this horrible movie excuse.
