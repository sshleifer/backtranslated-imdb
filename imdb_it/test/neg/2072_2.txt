Another pretentious film by Vicente Aranda. If "Juana la loca" remained of the same, at least its quality was superior (especially thanks to the great performance of Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala), but "Carmen" is boring and full of arguments (ardent brunette with a dagger in the stocking, poor man dragged to madness by passion, gangs of the Sierra Nevada, "torero", ...) <br /> <br /> Obviously Paz Vega is a beautiful woman, but for her talent there are more doubts, and Sbarrana the role is so stupid that it's almost unbelievable. The script is weak and Aranda's conceited character influences the entire film. With these ingredients the result could not be good. <br /> <br /> Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but a complete failure, in my opinion.
