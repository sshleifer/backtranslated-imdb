Low-cost stuff for bloodthirsty cultists in Greece led by Peter Cushing. It's up to the priest Donald Pleasance to stop them. Crown International released this crap in 1978 and was the "dog of the week" on one of the Sneak Previews episodes with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. I forgot which one "held", but I see the point. Crappy's film has the worst performances by Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance I've ever seen. There is a monster in the video box. No such beast exists in the film. Instead you get a statue, but at least it is astronomically correct. (Woo hoo!) <br /> <br /> Cultists look like Klu Klux Klowns ... if a group could exist. Salta.
