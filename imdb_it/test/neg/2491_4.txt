This film is a final 5. I finally got it on HBO the other night. I remember when he went out to the movies to tell a friend that it would never be a success because the Americans didn't want films about history, especially about films that were more about ideas than action. I don't know if this was the reason why FMLB didn't work well, but now, after having finally seen it, I can add some of my observations. <br /> <br /> First, while Dwight Schultz did well in Star Trek and The A-Team, as the protagonist in this film is daunting. I kept expecting Jon Lovitz to scream, "I'm ACT-ING!" The phrasing and the tone of the voice sounded like he tried to be an ACT-OR, on a stage where he had to strangely emphasize various words and phrases. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I liked the mischievous positioning of the character of Paul Newman as a manipulator who, at every turn, strives to gather these cats (the scientists) to achieve his goal. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, there was a discussion of the moral implications of the creation of the A bomb and whether the US should use it. Probably not enough of this, or in depth as justified. <br /> <br /> Finally, there seem to have been many dramatic twists. I don't know how much of the events in this film are true for life, but things like having the bomb try to slip into its chains or having a laboratory accident caused by a cup of spilled coffee (and a scientist killed as a result) are have been extending the limits of credibility. Perhaps that stuff, or similar events, actually happened, but it is certain that various scenes were added only for dramatic effect, which undermined the whole tone and purpose of the film. <br /> <br /> FMLB was OK. I need to read more about real events to find out if it was excessive or just mostly accurate.
