When HULK made his cinema debut in 2003, it wasn't long before the DVDs of the old Incredible Hulk TV show popped up in an attempt to cash in on the madness. We saw a similar episode a year earlier, when Spider-Man cartoons appeared on DVD to coincide with that hero's big-screen debut. Companies jump at the opportunity to ride the financial stretch marks of a hot brand. <br /> <br /> So the fact that this photo never appeared on the shelves of Wal-Mart as its heroes has undermined the box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot. I imagine all the people involved simply prefer to forget. To be honest, THE FANTASTIC FOUR is not as bad as everyone says. Let me rephrase that. It's not as fun as all the negative reviews might suggest. <br /> <br /> Veteran television actor Alex Hyde-White (no, he does not remember any of his roles) acts as a guide like Reed Richards, the brilliant scientist who, with his crew, gets bizarre powers after a accident in outer space. He remained with the ability to stretch and contort his body to scandalous lengths. His future wife, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab), can suddenly become invisible, while his brother Johnny (Jay Underwood) can now light up at will. Then there is the poor Ben Grimm (Michael Bailey Smith), the pretty crampon whose body turns into a mass of orange rocks. <br /> <br /> Just as friends are getting used to all this, they are called to save the world from a certain chaos. It seems that Reed's old colleague, Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp), is living up to his name, and that the evil Jewel (Ian Trigger) is not really helping the old women cross the street. Can our heroes save the day? Of course they can; like any superhero movie, it's just a question of how and when. <br /> <br /> What is striking about THE FANTASTIC QUATTRO is how amateur it is in virtually every aspect. The dialogue is so lame and tired that it seems written by a high-level class. The acting is so crude that it makes a third-level soap opera look like Shakespeare. The special effects are surprisingly good considering the tiny budget, but there are still some positively embarrassing moments. When The Human Torch completely turns on its body, for example, the whole movie briefly turns into a cartoon. I can only hear that production meeting. "Oh, nobody will notice, they will be too intrigued by the action!" Do I really mean a cartoon? At least give me a burning mannequin held up by a rope! Prior to this, the scene in which the quartet arrives on earth after their spaceship crashed is pure rear fare for teenagers. The crew simply found a field and lit an object vaguely similar to a spaceship. Is this the only remnant of such a serious disaster? <br /> <br /> Of course there wasn't much to work on in the script. There is a fairly consistent story here, but it's all so simplified. When Reed and Ben decide to go into space, they simply fall near the Storms house and ask if they will want to join them. Is it really that easy? Don't these things require, oh, I don't know, years of training and competence? Not in the world of these writers, who seemed to be inspired by the underrated genius exhibited in FULL HOUSE replicas. As bad as it may be, nothing can compare to how painful Dr. is. Doom. He was pulled out of those horrible superhero cartoons of the 60s, to the evil laugh and banging his fist on the table to underline his observations. No comic, less than all the Fantastic Four, has ever seen such an obscenely one-dimensional villain. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, THE FANTASTIC FOUR is saved from being a complete turkey because it is damn innocent. You can tell the people involved, like a little talent or experience like them, really tried. They didn't know that the end result would be so embarrassing. They had the impression that this was their big chance, that people would go to the theaters. He reiterates that they had practically no money to work (and I'm sure half of that was consumed by Thing's costume). All in all, they did well, and due to its many flaws, the finished product is a lot of fun for comic book fans.
