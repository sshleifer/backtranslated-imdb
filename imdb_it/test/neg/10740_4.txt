Homecoming; what a huge disappointment !! After reading the plot summary (the dead come back to vote - AGAINST George W. Bush !!!!!) I couldn't wait to see it. It started out interesting and immediately caught my attention. Unfortunately, though, he slowly descended into a boring political satire that I didn't need to see (I can only watch a good old Australian comedy for this!). There was practically only one or two scenes of horror and they weren't even that scary. I could not believe that this came from Joe Dante, who could easily have brought him out with a balanced balance of chills and satire. <br /> <br /> The worst episode so far. <br /> <br /> 2/5.
