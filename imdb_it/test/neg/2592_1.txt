"The new hope of Romanian cinema" ... if this is the new hope, I would not really like to see the savior hero of a cinema so prolific (Romanian cinema, that is). Now seriously, where should I start? 1. The lousy scenario: you're kidding me, this isn't even credible not to mention the high degree of stupidity 2. The direction: which direction? This film should have had a psychological tension, at least that, since they decided to make it look as scruffy as possible. Oky, I admit, Radu Muntean is not Polanski, Hitchcock, Fincher or Lynch (the list could go on), but at least the least effort would have been appreciated. 3. The language: Oky, I don't understand why (almost) every single Romanian director believes that if you make the film as miserable and obscene as possible, then you have art. I don't care about explicit language or bad image quality until the end result is worth it. In this case, it is not so. There is nothing to comment, since everything that this film means has already been told thousands of times, the characters are portrayed too much to become memorable, the "shocking events" that occur are also poorly illustrated and become little important. This film relies only on self-induced emotions, on the "we must" advertising campaign. Someone was found murdered so "WE MUST" feel sad, scared or panicked, someone went through this and that so that "WE MUST" try it a certain way. This is baloney. Because a film is a fictional piece, nothing is real here. So the only real emotions are the ones you discover when you get into his world (the movie, that is) <br /> <br /> * / * * * * *
