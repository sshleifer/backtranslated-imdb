It hurts to say this about an Australian movie, but Mr. Accident is the worst of the worst movies I've ever seen. What is even more tragic is that it does not fall into the category "it's so bad it's good". What bothers me most about this film is the large amount of money that has been dragged away on a useless, little fun, underdeveloped and inept script. Stupid shows (what are Garry McDonald and Elisabeth Gore aka Elle McFeast doing in this garbage?), Inadequate direction, no plot and a general sense of pettiness totally take away the interesting production design and leave you with a truly horrible taste in your mouth. Comedy! Has! Do yourself a favor and stay away!
