If you want to see someone accidentally eat another man's testicles, or watch a string of pathetic tough fetishists at a wedding, or listen to a man talk about how good it was to have sex with a girl while he was vomiting, then this is the movie for you. Alternating, in the way of breaking the neck, between the romantic and gross comedy, Tomcats is certainly interesting. The beautiful Jaime Pressly plays the wife of Horatio Sanz (say another) who finds himself in many situations silhouetted with other women, but surprisingly, there is no nudity. Jake Busey is completely revolting like a hound you wouldn't want as your friend. Shannon Elizabeth and Jerry O'Connell are both good and make a convincing pair, but the film is too busy trying to disgust to be good.
