I saw this movie a few nights ago and it was terrible! <br /> <br /> Terribly long - even if they managed to jump most of his life! <br /> <br /> Terribly boring - the parts they included were lengthy, and for some reason the director chose to cut away part of the action and left huge parts of the film involved! <br /> <br /> Terribly inaccurate, the "mystical" side of this film was a joke, and the last time I checked Ghengis Khan wasn't really a good guy! <br /> <br /> Interpreted poorly - I found many of the characters hard to believe, they were very two-dimensional and lacking in depth! <br /> <br /> A saving grace for the film was cinematography. This is why I gave this film a score of 2 stars rather than the bare minimum! However, if you want to watch something nice, I suggest you buy a photo! <br /> <br /> All in all this film was a terrible waste of time and money! Please do yourself a favor and forget about this Mongolian turkey!
