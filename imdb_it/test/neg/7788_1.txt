It's hard to get past this movie without smothering your vomit, actually. Poor animation doesn't help, as it makes this look like a decades-old video that you would find in Morrisons' 99p trash. Still, it's better than the abysmal script, which spends about a third of its length on superfluous extras like Belle's current problems, things about Scrooge's father, and a lot of fannying with no charm around with - suffocating - DUE MICE ANTHROPOMORPHIC. These bizarre additions consume time on the screen to the detriment of elements that you would think would be very important, such as Dickens's dialogue and the key pieces of the plot: the film gags in the game of twenty questions, for example, and sometimes fails to put scenes in the right order. Absolutely hopeless.
