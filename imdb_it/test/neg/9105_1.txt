He looked so promising in the rental shop, the premise sounded great and I couldn't wait to go home and watch him. It was Apalling the Diologue it's terrible, The Action is Extremely evil Scripted and the Plot takes a dive from the beginning. Gutenberg stages a pathetic performance, Sean Bean does his best but with such a bad script there wasn't much he could do. <br /> <br /> This is not even worth watching, although you can get it for free (borrow it from a friend for example) Not like you will regret it and waste 90 Minuites in your life. <br /> <br /> 0/10
