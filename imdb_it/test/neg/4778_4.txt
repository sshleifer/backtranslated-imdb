When I saw 6.0 on IMDb, I was pretty impressed and excited to see this movie, since a 6 for a horror movie should be pretty fun. At first I thought it would be a disturbing, invisible evil force (not having read the book) to terrorize the public - but it turns out to be something rather trivial - killer plants. Regardless, I am a rather open-minded individual about movies, so I thought that maybe the film would bring about a kind of turning point for carnivorous vines. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it failed to meet my expectations due to the excessive amount of clichés and the lack of any originality. Finally, the female protagonist continues to annoy you with her stupidity. Unless the film is intentionally a bad B-rated movie that is fun in the hilarity of wickedness, no film should ever ever have a main character that irritates you if one expects the audience to be interested in the character. These roles should be reserved for secondary characters. The characters were not developed, the monsters (the plants in this case) were not explained, and the clichés dripped everywhere. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is slightly effective are some of the bloody / bloody scenes, even if the gore pales in comparison with films like High Tension or Ichi The Killer. Logically, the failed logic (like the reason why a character who does not look at the top of a rope during a second attempt to go down into the ruins when he has just shot and almost killed someone), even if minor, adds and continues to anger the public. The film could have been saved by using characters or some kind of narrative device to scold or "redeem" idiotic characters who simply did something stupid (or at least let the character recognize or regret their mistakes). But continuing to allow the idiocy to preside will cause the public to abandon all concern for the character, in turn removing the terror of the film. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a bad film. An example of a well-made film that involves nearly twenty years is killed is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (and also the prequel) remake that certainly instilled fear and had much less flaws in the character's logic. In short, if you have a lot of time to waste, go and watch it if there's nothing else. Otherwise, don't waste your time with this sub-par movie and go see something really scary and very satisfying like the remake of The Hills Have Eyes.
