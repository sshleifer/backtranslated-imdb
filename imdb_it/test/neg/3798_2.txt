This film is linked to the original for the worst film ever made. I think this could be slightly worse, if anything. NOTICE SPOILER !!! Here are these survivors on a ship that has been overturned for a long time. Unlikely? No - IMPOSSIBLE. The whole premise is so ridiculous that it's not funny. There are some big names in the film and even they could not save this unpleasant thing. I find it really a waste of good celluloid. After seeing this, unfortunately I also decided that it was a waste of my time. Do not worry about it. Or the original for that matter! I gave a 2, mainly because they throw votes out of 1 out.
