This film is bad, as we all knew it would have been. Most of the time I usually love the trash-can comedy of the bad 80s / early 90s (haha no pun intended). List the Ski School, career opportunities, Hot Shots, Summer School and many others made in this period. This also has the classic and forgotten comedy of Dean Cameron (aka .. instructor of section 8 of the ski school and Party Maniac for Summer School). But this movie is just to slow down. It takes almost 30 minutes to go on and we have to go through an unnecessary dialogue between the guys at Sheen (E & C). And yes, I can hear bloggers dying to throw me away with "obviously not looking at 2 and 1/2 men." Well, Charlie wasn't at the level he is in right now during this movie ... not that it's something worth looking at now Charlie only shines when his co-stars support him and Emilio is no more than an abused abused headdress offers little support. In fact, this film was written by Emilio and shows him. He has no real ending (from Emilio, even the writers of the ski school 2 have invented a final). I have no idea how any problems were solved, no hot girls, no swearing to lighten the plot, characters, acting ... I'm tired of this tirade. and watch the films I listed above. You will have much more fun.
