Tyrone Power was cast in the head as Solomon. However, in the middle of the film he died unexpectedly. The studio chose to play Yul Brynner as the protagonist and shoot the scenes that Power had done. In hindsight, considering how awful this film was, Power was lucky: this would have been a horrible way to end his beautiful film career !!! <br /> <br /> Of all the biblical epics I've seen, this is by far the worst - and this is very important because Hollywood has made many boring Bible stories - so many wonder if the creation of these films they were an atheistic conspiracy !! In fact, the film was so boring that it was deservedly included in Harry Medved's brilliant book "The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time". There are so many reasons to hate the movie, but the worst is how incredibly ponderous the whole thing was! Of course, the casting of people with Italian, Eastern European, Scottish and English accents to play Egyptian and Israeli was pretty ugly - but at least that made the film strangely funny. Having the clumsy Gina Lollobrigida who plays the role of a woman reputed to have come from a place near Ethiopia was also simply horrible, but at least she was beautiful even though she couldn't act. Even having George Sanders in overweight and post-middle age has such a young role, but at least he had a beautiful voice. Creating an orgy scene that was choreographed and disgustingly boring was pretty ugly, but at least one had to see in the credits a mention of a person like "the orgy choreographer"! No, the worst thing about this movie is that almost two and a half hours, it seemed like nine, was so rude and insipid! Considering that the only mention of this Queen of Saba and Solomon is only in some wretched verses of the Old Testament, it is surprising that the film went on and on and on and on. THE BIGGEST STORY NEVER SOLD was a little longer, but that movie was based on four gospels - not a dozen verses! <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that the film is unhappy in almost every way (except for Gina's neckline). Even for devout Christians and Jews, this is a movie not to be missed because it sounds so fast and loose with the truth and injects an incredible amount of sex into a biblical movie !!! Terrible in almost all ways, it is indeed a blessing for Tyrone Power who is not remembered for starring in this bloated turkey.
