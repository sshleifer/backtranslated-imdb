After the whirlwind success of The Wrestler (see my review), Mickey Rourke had this "jewel" directly to the video. Each copy was rented for months and I even heard some buzz around it. So months later I took it on a movie network and sat down to watch it. First of all ... one of the film's locations (Walpole Island) is a place I used to visit regularly as a child because we lived a lot, very close to the reserve. Beautiful, isn't it? This is where freshness ends with this fool. I mean the story is decent enough to justify a four and even the direction isn't bad, but the performances are simply horrible, and definitely ridiculous with a really wasted power and Mickey $% # @ * &! Rourke plays a Canadian / American hit man?!?! What did they think in the name of the Lord? It doesn't even look like native blood, and its attempt at a generic native accent has made it even more ridiculous. They could have gone anywhere with this story ... they could have hired a native actor, or changed Rourke's character, how about a white man raised by native parents? Instead they made Killshot a complete and absolute joke. <br /> <br /> Since you could have captured the "stars" of Mickey Rourke in Killshot, I use this term freely. I never really liked Rourke even though his Oscar-winning performance was pretty decent. This shows and confirms my dislike for him. He looks bored, constantly bored, and his lame attempt to portray a native borders on the insult I would think. He is a good cold-blooded killer but then the story never explores that part of him that is totally back in history. Diane Lane, though highly respected in Hollywood, turns into another gray performance. It has had its moments but, overall, it has not usually taken off at any performance. It looks like it will be great, but when it's not, it's even more disappointing. Thomas Jane plays her protective husband. I always thought that Jane deserved a bigger career than she has. I think he has an action star in his blood. Having said that, his performance in Killshot is not bad at all. It doesn't take things too far and it's hard and almost heroic in a sense. He and Lane manage to get a decent chemistry, but can't get much from his character. I have absolutely no idea why Rosario Dawson A) made this film and B) had a character. His character is utterly useless and made no sense to the plot or the story, making any performance that would have given just as bad. I have rarely seen a character who is claiming so incredibly useless. The only redeeming character and the performance in this film is that given by Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the role of the unbalanced minigame who wants to collaborate with Rourke's hit man. Gordon-Levitt is exaggerated and funny and his character is really addictive. If this movie had been entirely about him it would have been a success. He literally saves him from the most total shit. His performance is almost worth watching for this. <br /> <br /> Oscar-nominated director ... whoa wait? Yes, Oscar-nominated director John Madden (I think the football coach could have done a better job) is at the head of this mess. Actually I have never seen Shakespeare In Love, but I remember the praise of the criticism I received and it surprised me because the direction in this film and with the characters was really terrible. Screenwriter Hossein Amini did nothing that I recognize, but apparently it was planned to write the next Jack Ryan movie and after this mess I can't even imagine why they want it. I understand this is based on a novel and I really hope the novel is worlds above this mess. A bit of action and a kind of hockey attempt in a story full of the emotions of a successful man and his partner and the mess in which they are involved. Unfortunately, unless you are a HUGE Rourke fan or you really love Joseph Gordon-Levitt there is no reason to let this pain pass. I did it for you and I still feel the pain. 4/10
