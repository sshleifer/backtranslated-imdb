I love a lot of movies and I'm a big fan of Sean Bean, so I thought I'd like this movie at least. Furthermore, I am Canadian and this is a mostly Canadian film, so I was ready to give it a serious cut. Nothing could have prepared me for the garbage that is "Airborne". Steve Guttenberg as an action hero? Give me a break. The acting throughout the film was so bad that I will have trouble sleeping tonight. Now I only have two wishes in my life. <br /> <br /> 1. I hope you never have to watch this movie. 2. I wish I could recover those 6 hours. Oh wait, the movie lasts less than 2 hours - it seemed like only 6 hours ... <br /> <br /> Don't look at this. Seriously.
