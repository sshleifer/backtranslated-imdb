This photo is a bad copy of the 1995 short film by Michael Pohl EXTINCT. While Michael Pohl's idea was original and perfect for a short film, the plot of A SOUND OF THUNDER was poorly adapted to Pohl's story and not suitable for a feature one would expect from a large Hollywod studio. In this case, the tragic flood situation that ruined the Prague set was just a bad link in a long chain of rusty film production. Because a study releases such a product ... it's a shame. Especially for Warner Brothers, a studio that opened new scenarios with shows like BABYLON 5 in 1993. On TELEVISION. The visual effects for television show that the pioneering CGI in episodic television in the mid-1990s was far more sophisticated than the one shown on the screen in this image. In cases like this, it can be sad: can the film.
