If you described any of the scenes; nightmares of children who kill you in your sleep, your daughter who talks to ghosts, looks for your lost child in a mine abandoned at night, so petrified by the fear that you can't move even if the blood of a murder victim drips on you from upstairs ?? so i'd say you have a horror movie. But some of them like "Wicked Little Things" weren't scary. I'm a horror fan and I loved the location, the main plot and I liked the three main women. I didn't want to see them hurt, I wanted the "bad guy" to take his sweets, the rest of the cast is always just cannon fodder, so I was indifferent in both cases and interpreted every clich√© in the book - even to the torch battery that it runs out in pitch darkness just as you start here whispering voices that close inside you. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch it anyway, but unless you're new to horror movies or under 12, you've already seen it before.
