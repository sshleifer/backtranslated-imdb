I really don't see how anyone can enjoy this movie. I don't think I've ever seen a half-boring movie like this piece of self-indulgent junk. It would probably have been better if the director had not spent most of the film showing off his artwork, which is not so noteworthy. Another thing that I didn't like the most is when a character was punched in the face, a gallon of blood would have vomited immediately afterwards. I don't know how people bleed down there in Japan, but I hope they have many blood donors.
