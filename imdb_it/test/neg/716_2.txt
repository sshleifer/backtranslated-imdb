Of all the Perry Mason post-1985 films I've seen, this is my favorite. <br /> <br /> I confess I never liked Diana Muldaur as an actress. He seems to only know how to play a type of character: a career woman with an undefined point of shit with an undefined chip on her shoulder, which for this reason is extremely difficult to understand in any way. This is not an exception - it is true to form. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves this film, in my opinion, is a serious performance by Scott Baio as a prosecutor - I really found myself cheering for him to win, and the film deserves to be seen only for he.
