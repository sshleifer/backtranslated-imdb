After getting lost in this countless time at TCM UK, I decided to take a look at it given his science fiction / adventure / field résumé: I knew I would find myself doing a stupid ride - but it was also incredibly bad! However, perhaps appropriately given the characters involved, the script takes away many recent science fiction titles - SOYLENT GREEN (1973), ZARDOZ (1974), LOGAN'S RUN (1976, to the extent that it was shot on some of the the same sets!), STAR WARS (1977), ALIEN (1979) and MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR (1981)! <br /> <br /> The plot is simple but not exactly appealing: from the title we can deduce that the water has become scarce on the planet where all this takes place - so our heroic buccaneers will take it to steal the ice blocks from the Templar rulers (!) tyrannical. A beautiful princess (Mary Crosby, daughter of Bing!) Is also involved. In search of her father, the deposed king; among other things, the cast includes another famous progeny: Anjelica Huston (daughter of John) as one of the pirate bands - fortunately, the actress's mistake in accepting such a role would soon be forgotten in the wake of his Oscar win (under the guidance of his father, not less) for PRIZZI'S HONOR (1985). Since STAR WARS had Peter Cushing as "Supreme Commander", the filmmakers opted for a legend on their screen - 78-year-old John Carradine (who sees himself tied to some sort of operating table during his short scene!). <br /> <br /> The most notable pieces (for all the wrong reasons) are: the foreigner who uses the bathroom; the castration machine; the clumsy antics (including karate-style fighting!) of the inevitable robot mates; the silly / eunuch trick worn at some point by the heroes; recurrent attacks by "space herpies" (whatever it is); the climax in which the characters are made to age when they pass through a time distortion (Crosby becomes pregnant, gives birth and sees his son grow in the space of 30 seconds, while the leading man Robert Urich is replaced by John Ford brave Hank Worden for this scene! ) - incidentally, the cut jumps adopted here (with the intention of indicating the rapid passage of time) are not only fruitless but even irritating.
