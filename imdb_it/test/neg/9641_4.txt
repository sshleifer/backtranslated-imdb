My mistake was to think that it was a serious war movie before seeing it. Everything ended up second in the film when the "MTV" logo appeared. It could also be called "National Lampoon's Sexy-N-Loose". And he played the public "MTV"; the film that followed those first comedy seconds sounded like music videos that played over 40 years ago. At least Disney was smart enough to send his R rated stuff to Touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously. Ok, I'm strict; it wasn't that bad in a movie. However, he certainly has his share of overacting and the film is extremely partial / unilateral. I have to admit that I'm not a fan of war movies. I can't watch "Platoon", "Full Metal Jacket" or "Saving Private Ryan" more than once. Sure, they were good movies, but they're not my forte and they all seem to get confused after a while where I wouldn't be able to distinguish one from the other. After a tour in Iraq, Phillippe plans life after the war, but is recalled due to a clause in his contract. Or, at least, this is the military plan until it becomes AWOL and the characters accelerate the cross country with a few surprisingly surprised dollars. No, I haven't been in any war, nor in Iraq, nor do I agree. Furthermore, I do not have all the knowledge when it comes to recruiting or signing their contracts. I can say this: although I am sorry that they are back in this conflict, I cannot hear too much for someone so stupid as not to read the fine print. It's like someone on their deathbed is leaning over to finally read the Surgeon General's warning about their box of cigarettes and say, "Oh, I'm what? Deadly? I'll sue them!"
