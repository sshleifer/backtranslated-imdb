This film could have been summarized in about 10 minutes. I don't know what everyone else was smoking, calling it a beautiful movie. I feel like I've had a couple of hours of my life stolen and I want them back. I'd put it in the category of a Battlefield Earth. Yes people are so bad. It would do well to watch a two-minute clip of this movie over and over again would have the same effect. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!
