In terms of historical accuracy, this is the worst Roman film I have ever seen. The list not only of errors, but of ideas for the plot that are absolutely impossible, would be longer than the three-hour movie, but just to give you an idea ... <br /> <br /> Julius Caesar and Augustus they are presented as Liberal Democrats, siding with the "people" against "the nobles". This is clearly absurd. The Caesars were noble as could be obtained. Their interest was in consolidating power and stabilizing a country that had been destroyed by 150 years of civil war. There had been reformers, in particular the Gracchi brothers, who lived about 100 years earlier, and to some extent defended the rights of ordinary citizens. <br /> <br /> There are many scenes that are completely ridiculous if you know something about the period. "Cleopatra", with Richard Burton, will give you a much better idea of ​​how the events took place, no matter how imaginative it is. <br /> <br /> Historical accuracy is one thing. Acting and talking are something else, and here this film comes dangerously close to a bad middle school production. I burst out laughing several times, especially when Julia, the daughter of Augustus, meets a lover. They shake passionately, as she breathes: "My father ..." "Ah, your father, your father ... your father would not approve." Peter O'Toole is at its worst, forced to gnaw through very pompous and stupid lines. The actor who plays Augustus as a young man is so nefarious --- and the character is written as such --- it is impossible to imagine him as the astute, astute, Machiavellian politician who created the Roman Empire. Here, it's just a whiner who has to be told what to do most of the time. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Rampling manages to emerge from a role as Livia, Augusto's wife, with dignity. If he had had a fuller role to play, he could have saved this production from the absurdity. <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful photograph and footage of battles, helped by a lot of standard CGI. Strangely, this was made for British TV (and seems to be an Italian-British co-production), but is labeled with an "R" rating. <br /> <br /> The DVD image is excellent and the Dolby Digital soundtrack is very nice, although it is only noticeable during the few action sequences, since the film mainly speaks. <br /> <br /> Almost all Roman films, including "Cleopatra" or "The fall of the Roman Empire", have more historicity --- not to mention the irresistible drama - of this bizarre adaptation of Classics Illustrated, Jr .. This gives a new meaning to the highly abused phrase, "Based on a true story". In this case they could have said "Suggested by real events".
