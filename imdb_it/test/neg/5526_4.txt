Well, now this strange movie. It was listed as a comedy, but I certainly didn't find anything to laugh about. I'm actually struggling to find something positive to say about this movie. Oh, I'm going there. Alex Ferns is not a bad guy in the lead role and I did not choose the ending for a change, but other than that he doesn't have a very solid two-dimensional character and is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious enough to be any form decent drama. I would really avoid having to watch this movie again and I think it does nothing to benefit the characters of the working class who are trying to portray. I found it difficult to empathize with any of the characters and I didn't have enough information about the main character Jimmy to believe his motives. Better avoided.
