Some people thought it was funny because they loved the political issues discussed in this piece. I, however, am so tired of the state of the two-party system in our country that I cannot bear the propaganda on both sides. I was hoping for a horror show, but I had "cute" zombies and partisan crap. I watch my scared horror movies. This didn't even try to be scary. Moreover, this does not have Romero's wit in his political / cultural satire tied in his films ... this was a blatant story, without imagination that it was difficult for me to sleep (for wrong reasons). On the positive side, if you hate Bush ... you'll like this (I'm not forgiving hate or Bush with this statement)
