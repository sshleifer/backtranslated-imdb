The Toxic Avenger, a horribly deformed creature of superhuman size and strength, is back in this sequel, which mostly misses everything. Toxie goes to Japan to find her father at the suggestion of her psychiatrist, who is in league with an evil society that just wants the avenger to go and get a strange hold on Tromaville in his absence. With new actors for Toxie and his girlfriend, who has a different name in this one, a much less gloomy tone, much more comical and a plot that cannot compare with the original. Even with the full integral version that can only be obtained if you buy the Tox Box DVD set, gore is the only thing that goes for it. And if it happens in ANY other version, forget to have fun with it. While the first is a low budget classic, it simply isn't. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D + <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Erika Schickel has a very fast slip; Phoebe Legere goes topless; a villianess becomes completely naked; and some extras in a public bath scene show various levels of skin. <br /> <br /> Tox Box has unilt director cut cut DVD Extras: Intro and Commentary from director Lloyd Kaufman; Second comment with director Lloyd Kaufman, editors of Troma Gabriel Friedman and Brian McNulty; Toxie on Japenese TV; Interview with Fangoria editor-in-chief Michael Gingold; Videohound interview by Mike Mayo; the same damn March of radiation that is on EVERY DVD Troma; Clip by Lisa Gaye; Mockumentary "Toxie 15 Years Later"; 2 PSAs; Troma Intelligence Test; Troma Studio Building Tour; Announcement for Lloyd Kaufman's autobiography; Image Gallery; Theatrical trailer; and trailer for: "Toxic Avenger", "Toxic Avenger 3", "Def by Temptation", "Nuke 'Em High Class", "Sgt.
