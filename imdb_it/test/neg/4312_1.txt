This is one of the worst films I've ever seen and certainly the worst movie that Nagesh Kuknoor has made. I can't believe that the person who created a movie like Teen Deewarein can create bullshit like this. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film itself is really flawed that Zeenat should look for Meera and get his clemency to help her husband avoid the death penalty to Soudi Arabia. The common logic says if Zeenat cannot easily search for Meera, then the Soudi government will not do it, so Zeenat can safely falsify the signature or print of Meera's thumb and produce it before the Soudis. Another more stupid thing is that Shankar gave an incorrect address in his passport, so Indian government officials are unable to reach the address, but after some time Meera gets Shankar's suitcase through the Soudi government. Wow! Doesn't it make Soudis more connected in India than Indians? <br /> <br /> Nagya does a little more cameo in the film as Chopra, who is looking at Meera and looking for Meera's father-in-law, Girish Karnaad's help (this guy is just wasted) to take it like a fortress. <br /> <br /> Nagya cannot speak Hindi and has been assisted by other boys to translate the English dialogues he writes, in Hindi. This time, it seems that his aide was in severe intoxication, when he wrote dialogues like "Imaan ki Chalaang" (leap of honesty). Within a few minutes, for our worst nightmares, Meera not only makes this honest jump, he beats his feet to do "Imaan ka Naach" (dance of honesty). <br /> <br /> One of the few brilliant films is its beautiful cinematography and tonality. But since Bollywood has learned the thing called Post-production, almost all films have bright colors and well-blended backgrounds, so not a big deal. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that making a cheese film is not limited to Chopras or Johars or Barjatyas, Nagyas and everyone is ready to be hit.
