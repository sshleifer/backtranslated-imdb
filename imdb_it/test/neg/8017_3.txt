Do you remember the literary adaptations in wood, not dramatic of the 70s at their worst? You'll see it when you see this piece of chocolate adaptation in a wide and unintentionally exhilarating way. The most guilty of all is Catherine Z-J, who, although undeniably within everyone's reach, replaces the fact of throwing a big dress and looking sensual for a performance. Played in an uncovered face like a melodrama, or Cold Comfort Farm without the jokes, this effort is not helped by a screenwriter with a tin ear for dialogue that completely loses the sense of irony or tragedy of the novel. A pity, given the quality of the acting talent on offer - Joan Plowright, Claire Skinner, Steven Macintosh deserve all this better.
