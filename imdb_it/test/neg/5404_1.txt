I have very little to add to what all the other reviewers have already made clear! This movie is terrible! Besides horrible ... In fact, so unbearable that they still have to find a term to describe the horrible that is "Skeleton Man". In case you expect your films to have a minimum of logic and plot, you should stay as far away as possible from this. Sure, a lot of people are killed by this skeleton puppet with a ridiculous cloak, but no one ever bothered to correctly explain what it is, where it comes from or why it is so angry with the world. It looks like a cross between Skeletor of "Masters of the Universe" and the knight of "Sleepy Hollow" and is unleashed in some remote desert. The setting of "Skeleton Man" is another totally delayed aspect! For almost half an hour, I thought the film was set in a small isolated island, but it simply sounds in the mainland where the fantastic highways run through the forest and the power plants are at the end of the forest! Eh? Why does everyone pretend to be trapped when there are millions of escape routes? However, after a couple of totally random murders, a special commando team, led by poor Michael Rooker, comes to hunt a monster they know nothing about. Really hilarious is how every member of this team looks like the expert in a certain field (we have a sniper-specialist, a traceable genius, an instructor ...), but EVERYONE dies before any of them is able to prove their supposedly masterful skills! The gods of horror must really hate Casper Van Dien, as he is again present, playing a heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason, crashes on the highway, but somehow gets catapulted into the woods to die there. Well, this makes sense ... In addition, the characters steal fantastic "Predator" battles, the bony head's horse constantly changes colors, helicopters are shot down with a bow and arrows, normal bullets blow up trees and completely useless Vietnam flashbacks haunt Michael Rooker. I say we all combine forces and vote for this pathetic top movie in the top 100 of IMDb ASAP!
