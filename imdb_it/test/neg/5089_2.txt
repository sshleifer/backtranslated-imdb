wow, I just saw one. <br /> <br /> How much CRAPPY post-production is in this film. <br /> <br /> No kidding, I could have done a better job myself. <br /> <br /> ALL post production is defective, everything. Anyone cutting the film should be banned from the film industry. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the script was a disaster. absolute ruby. <br /> <br /> Not to mention Jack Bauer and his Patchy the Pirate in a Spongebob accent. Is WTF your character doing there? But for me, the biggest flaw of all was character development, interaction, dynamics, dialogue. WOW. I can't believe how bad it was. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a 2 out of 10. 1 for Samantha, who is a great actress, too bad that the production made everyone look like amateurs. <Br /> <br /> the other 1 goes to the cinematography, which was really good. <br /> <br /> Other then that my friend, this is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I don't do it I also want to do a post elaborated on this, it was just a horrible production. Poor actors, they didn't know what they were entering ...
