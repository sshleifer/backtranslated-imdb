'R Xmas is one of the only films I've seen where I can almost say that nothing happens. I felt like I was looking at a middle-class couple who was dealing drugs, with a child, walking, eating, smoking, talking (sorry, I swear) for most of the film. And I don't think I miss you. I think this film was well directed, well acted (even though her husband's performance was rather wooden), and the constant feeling of impending ruin behind every corner definitely restrained the viewer. But when the dust clears up, your left with zero (only a boat full of fades). I didn't want car chases, armed violence, beatings, etc. In fact, I'm sick with violence. But, my God, let's go at least a little deeper into all these characters (we know each of these corrupt officials a little better ... don't show them just as street looks). Why is dialogue so young? Everyone spoke as if they were in middle school. I believe that this part of our human race can also say something other than fu_ _, sh_ _, etc. The stimulation and the plot of R Xmas I found quite interesting, but the execution was simple and simple-empty.4 / 10
