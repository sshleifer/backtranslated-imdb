"I assume you're here for damage to your mental circuits." - VAL <br /> <br /> Mike Nelson showed me this ... he mentioned it in his book, "Movie Megacheese". I asked myself, "Why should Mike Nelson make me wrong?" Now I know why the bots never trusted Mike Nelson. <br /> <br /> The music is by John Williams, which is probably part of his payment to the Devil. In fact, I'm sure anyone who worked on this film is probably in league with the old Slewfoot, or is now cursed, from the executive director to the guy who ran the catering truck outside the studio. Don't look ... for the love of God ... don't look !!! Not even making a copy and showing someone else won't curse you ... I'm doomed now, I understand. I accept it But save yourself ...
