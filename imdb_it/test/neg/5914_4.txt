by Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> I couldn't wait to see it. I like Eddie Murphy and I love when a star-hand makes a vehicle for themselves or when someone who writes decides to score their directorial debut. But when the head of the star gets too big for the rest of his body, there's always the danger of a big-budget Hollywood vanity production. <br /> <br /> Will the director keep it real? or will he only lose a sum of money (the study, ours) and the time (that of the studio, ours and his) who gives himself a pat on the back for an hour and a half? Unfortunately, it's the second one here. Another thing I really like is when someone breathes new and fresh life into an exhausted and dehydrated genre. None of this here. War movies at the nightclub have become so worn out that even parodies are bleak and deadly. <br /> <br /> Murphy does neither. It does the most cliché: it fits into a conventional gangster routine of conventional formula and plays it seriously as if it were "The Godfather". It's like a script in which the next draft puts the jokes and new ideas. But it seems that someone with some influence has just looked at him and went: "No, that's fine." <br /> <br /> Probably Murphy. He is credited in all this. In the opening photo of beautiful white satin sheets, his name is engraved in five titles. <br /> <br /> THE PLOT: A young orphan saves the lives of Pryor and Pryor adopts the small ragamuffin. <br /> <br /> 20 years later, the Pryor landfill has become a first-class hot spot. They are taking down a lot of money and a gangster wants their action. He even has a dirty cop on his job. But Pryor has a scheme, to "LA PUNTA". <br /> <br /> Murphy's script sounds like an unfinished first draft that no one had the couple to call it. Actors are not allowed to stand out very much, if at all. Even the almighty Murphy appears to be an autopilot. <br /> <br /> Pryor shows class and kind manners like Sugar Ray (perhaps it would have been better to call his character BROWN Sugar Ray - further proof that this needed a polish), but everyone here is basically just on vacation. <br /> <br /> The Oscar nomination for the film received is well deserved (Joe I Tompkins 'Best Costume Design'), but production values ​​are the only part that makes the 1930s authentic. <br /> <br /> Some sets look a bit fake, but this should be a kind of comedy. It is rare for a film to be nominated for a Razzie and an Oscar (unless it is one of Lucas' new "Star Wars" chapters). It's 1938 and everyone talks like in 1988, especially the comedians. This is the formula of a prehistoric white man. And with all these black and satirical comedians, you expect them to spit out the genre or at least bring you new life. No. Murphy is practically coming here. <br /> <br /> The great Roger Ebert summed up perfectly when he remarked in his review: "Murphy approaches his story more like a costume party where everyone can look great while fumbling through a plot that is not been fresh at least since 1938. "<br /> <br /> Jasmine Guy is a perfect cast and seems to have indulged his role and Michael Lerner has all the looks, the bad mood and the mannerism of the mob boss's prototype. And there are times when Pryor gives you an idea of ​​how a more interesting leader and authority figure would sound. It gives each scene a feeling of dignity. <br /> <br /> Would it have been too much to ask Della Resse to sing? Or at least stop embarrassing yourself with all his "Kiss My Ass talk?" <br /> <br /> And the late Redd Foxx does not leave much of a swan song here. He has a little back and forth with Resse that could have been something exceptional. No. Murphy wastes another opportunity here. <br /> <br /> Murphy's Quick is charismatic and likeable. But those moments are few and far between. Murphy has never been better and never boring. His character made me laugh twice throughout the film. Stan Shaw's boxer with a horrible impediment is not only painful and embarrassing, it's annoying. There's more to comedy than simply showing something unpleasant. You have to incorporate some kind of light touch and funny situation. Watching him straining even some of the simplest words makes us feel sorry for him and annoyed by Murphy. <br /> <br /> Can Murphy write a screenplay? Well?? there was "Raw", but that was a really standing material. He wrote the draft of "Boomerang" and "Coming to America" ​​for sure. But she didn't have the last word there. Perhaps a team of ER-type screenwriters could revive him. <br /> <br /> Murphy's direction is so slow and silent, you'd swear he was asleep at the wheel a while. He has too many static shots and doesn't seem to know how to build and release suspense. At one level, I think Quick is the real Eddie Murphy. Angry, young, hot-headed and ambitious. But occasionally fascinating. Now, if it was just funny sometimes. <br /> <br /> There's a scene where Murphy has a femme-in-bed fairy tale that he's going to make love with him and kill him. You can probably guess how it will end. Like everything else in the movie, this could have been better, but ?? <br /> <br /> "Surprisingly," Murphy hasn't directed another film since (he got a Razzie nomination). And he doesn't even write the final draft for his films (he WON the Razzies for writing this!) <br /> <br /> It's great to watch and the music is beautiful, and there are some really nice scenes. But this falls into the category of "gems among all odds and ends". Not enough from them. <br /> <br /> It would have been. I should have been. It was not. Oh good. <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
