A friend and I went to see this movie when it came out in 1980. He was playing in a huge theater and we were the only two people in the place. It lasted two days in the theater before they stopped showing it. It was so bad that we laughed to the hilt. From that moment, we consider films based on Kill or Be Killed as the worst film of all time. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's so bad that it's fun. It is not worth giving a second look for sure. I can't just give myself more than a 1 because I don't think the film's creators wanted it to be so bad and I can't give credit for an accident. Sorry.
