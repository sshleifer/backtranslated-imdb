The DVD version we bought had Sandra Bullock on the cover, but we found out it was a picture of her from another movie. Unfortunately, she is very little in this movie. You can, however, see how far it has arrived. <br /> <br /> The other bright spot of the film, in addition to its very small part, were some scenes set, shot in New York and New Jersey in the 80s. <br /> <br /> The sound is terrible. Sometimes the background noise is so loud that dialogue is hard to hear. Sometimes the dialog box has been redone without any background noise, which is disconcerting. For example, sometimes when I'm in the car, car noises are too loud, and then suddenly there's absolutely no extra noise. The director loves close-ups on faces and so it is clear that the film has been nicknamed because the words do not correspond to the movements of the lips. Through most of the film, the voices sound as if people were talking in a tin can. <br /> <br /> Background music, when there is music, distracts instead of adding to the film. <br /> <br /> The management is ridiculous. Shooting angles and sound effects make the movie look like a joke, especially at times when there is supposed to be tension, like in the middle of gunfights. The writing is terrible. There are some subplots that make no sense, and most characters seem very stupid because there is no explanation for their motivations. The writer / director tries to explain some of the relationships between men who were together in Vietnam, but none of them makes sense. These top killers and former soldiers do not seem to be able to see other people's shadows or hear other people moving. The actors move from calm to panic and return to calm without any warning. It is simply a combination of bad direction and bad writing. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are so bad that at first we thought we had stumbled upon a student film from someone who had just got Sandra Bullock involved. If you like to laugh at student films that are really poorly made, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, avoid this movie.
