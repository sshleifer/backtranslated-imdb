1st watched 04/30/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Waters): Corny Waters musical comedy with some funny scenes and good parts, but it wasn't an experience not to be missed. John Waters directed this parody of the 1950s scene full of music with Johnny Depp playing the lead role. This film is very similar to what he did with the parody of the 60s entitled "Hairspray", but this is not as effective. Some of the songs are catchy, some of the characters are interesting in their eccentric Waters mode, and the performances are fine even if they are sometimes exaggerated. The plot is similar to the movie "Grease", where there is a good group and a bad group. The bad guy, Cry Baby, wow is a girl from the good group. The good girl joins the bad group, but once Cry Baby hurts her, she falls back into the group. This establishes the ending where Cry Baby tries to win her back. Now, one of the differences expected in the films of Water is that the bad group doesn't look so bad all the time and the good group acts as if they had a stake in his you-know-what. I certainly saw it in Hairspray too. The extravagance and stupidity are not so funny in this film, and leave us alone with the feeling that the film could have been much better. The main attraction of Johnny Depp's character is that he is able to make a tear down his cheek (so his namesake) at various times and makes women fall everywhere for him. This is abused and the fundamental bottom line is that the film is OK, but not so great.
