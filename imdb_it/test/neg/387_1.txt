This is probably the worst movie of all time, which actually took itself seriously. And not as a result of acting, because being an actor, I have to say that Rickman and Stowe had to be at their best, just to escape and need electroconvulsive therapy after the main photograph. Being one of the 57 people who saw this film coming out in theaters, I have to say that I have never seen a film in which the film is finished, the credits have rolled, the lights of the house have been lit and no one has seen it before. is moved from their seats. About five minutes after the lights of the house got up, people started to come out of their comas to look around, and I think many of us thought, okay we understood, it was a joke, right? Now they're going to show the truth movie . Finally, after the ushers distributed the disguises, and we swore an oath of secrecy never to admit to being there, we felt it was safe to leave, praying that we would not be seen leaving the auditorium. I have seen some bad films in my day (I have Cinemax for heaven's sake), but I am still disappointed that I will never be able to recover those two hours of my life that I lost by watching Closet Land.
