Richard Gere and Diane Lane are the protagonists of a love story with the kind of final in which I really get angry ... let's say it's not my cup of tea, just like shop novels aren't my cup of tea . <Br /> <br /> The plot has a doctor who stops at an inn and meets a woman with a deep but brief relationship. He goes to meet his stranger son and returns to his life. <br /> <br /> Well played and well done, the filmmakers have forgotten to get a real storyline. This is the stuff of dime-store novels that makes women faint and men shake their heads in disbelief. I would not be so opposed to the film as an unreasonable love story, except that the film takes a turn on the last reel that is so out of the left field to be completely unbelievable. Why do some types of movies have to do stupid things like this? It's really ruined for me. <br /> <br /> If you like romance try it, even if you wait for the cable.
