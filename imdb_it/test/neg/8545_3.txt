Terribly disappointed with CITY OF MEN after being swept away by CITY OF GOD. Lost is the exciting and unpredictable plot, and instead, in its place, it is bland predictability with obvious attempts to manipulate the public by a superficial pretentious production and distribution team. This story ended up feeling like a cheesy soap opera rather than a gritty unworthy one, which is what it should have been. This is what happens when distributors try to look for a wider audience (ridiculous shots of the Rio coast, etc.) at the expense of a compelling story and characters. I couldn't really worry about what happened to any of the characters in this movie - they were all so two-dimensional. In short, a sad waste of potential that should have been a crash following the exceptionally inspired CITY OF GOR. Boo!
