Cartoon of 1940, banned nowadays probably because of the gag "Black Beauty", in which Daffy rides a black person like a horse. <br /> <br /> The whole story takes place in a bookstore, where the characters in the books come to life every night. So we have, among others, the ugly duckling (Daffy) and Wallstreet's wolf. They come in pursuit after the wolf tricked Daffy with a false duck (hence the title). <br /> <br /> And the hunt is all there is in this little cartoon, which at the moment has no real appeal. Just fun if you are a true Looney Tunes fan, I guess ... <br /> <br /> 4/10.
