I saw it on Sci Fi and, in retrospect, I'm not sure how I managed to see it all the way. This is total rubbish. It's not a B series movie, it's a "D movie" in the best way. <br /> <br /> In practice this grim reaper who looks at a thing on a horse (and sometimes not on one) kills everything in its path somewhere in the mid-west of America. Lots of people (in fact murdered) are missing, and a bunch of mismatched speculation soldiers go looking for them. The best part of this film, I'll tell you now, are some really nice girls. Let me now spoil it by saying that everyone, except the less cute, has his head cut off, cut apart or hit so hard with a moving weapon that his head explodes. There is no spoiler ... The blood in this film is exaggerated and really grotesque. It serves no purpose. <br /> <br /> Here's what's good: the sets look OK, the actors sometimes work well, the clothes and props, some of them, are decent. <br /> <br /> Everything else you can think of, sucks. Much of the nastiness is in editing. Sometimes it simply passes from a scene of rapid action to a silent and drowsy real scene. Sometimes the characters do things that are incomprehensible and always divide, but not even in a way that the viewer can follow. They seem to have separated without realizing it among themselves, but they also seem to know that they are dividing all the time and are doing well even if they are in a very dangerous situation and there are bodies everywhere and people die on the right and on the left. Nothing in this film is the least plausible, most of it is inconsistent and confusing, and I don't understand how this immortal, indestructible bad murderer was able to be stopped in the end and, frankly, I don't care. During this film too many hilarious nonsense happens and I don't care to list everything here. And they're all so serious during the whole ordeal when it's almost ridiculous ... just awful. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete waste of time. There is no excuse to watch this, unless the only channel you get is SciFi and you're tied to a chair in front of the TV. But if you're not tied, it's better to do a crossword puzzle, throw a Frisbee or just think. There's a lot of much better B movies you can watch. <br /> <br /> My last year in high school my friend and I, in visual communication and worthy class, we made a long movie trailer for our film (There was not a full movie, just a very trailer long) and we did a better job of shooting and assembling the piece with the premiere. It was a better job than this film. This really says something about this and I'm puzzled and worried about why Sci Fi would show something like this when there are so many good low-speed movies that they can show. <br /> <br /> The only film I've ever endured that was worse than this is Raptor Island (another brilliant science fiction work) - although it has had a smoother and more streamlined flow than this movie - but this is very close and it is certainly the second in my list of worst movies I've ever seen.
