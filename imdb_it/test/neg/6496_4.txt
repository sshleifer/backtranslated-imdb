Most critics wrote devastating things about Michalkov's film, but I wanted to see it. And, unfortunately, they are right. The film has the highest budget ever in the history of Russian cinema, two international stars, colorful mass scenes, apparently turned quite close to the Kremlin - but in the end it seems like nothing. You wouldn't believe it, that this director previously made masterpieces like Urga and Burnt By the Sun. The characters in the plot are not convincing, neither Jane, nor McCracken nor Andrej. Only General Radlov deserves to be mentioned. Stay on the surface all the time. Politically it is for me a glorification of the army, and especially of the Russian, with values ​​like honor and duty. And, having lived at least six months in Siberia: My Russia is much more than what is represented in Michalkovs' film. Regarding "Burnt By The Sun" by the same director of a no-question-10-points movie, one of the best I've ever seen in my life, I was disappointed by that. Sorry. However, Michalkov's unique talent for providing incredibly beautiful images is still there.
