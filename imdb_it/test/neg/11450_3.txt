I must have been in a good mood to give this film shameful, predictable, embarrassing even a 3. What's wrong with that? We start with free sex, although I admit that the rotational style of bonking was something I had never seen (or experienced) before. And I guess they even saved some money by showing the same-sex scene three times. Then there are the inconsistencies. The "Oakville Tribune" seems to be in a green part of whatever city it was. (Hamilton Ontario ???) Yet, in the rooftop scenes, it appears to be in an industrial area with a mill that erupts smoke and flames. Furthermore, the interior of the building --- the editorial office --- the stairs --- seem much larger than the outer ones. SPOILERS HERE Then, when our intrepid reporter is finally fired, he returns to the building several times, once after the hour. Hardly the ending is also pitifully predictable ... the classic lure and the switch caper in which the good guy turns out to be the bad guy. But my main objection is the fact that this is yet another film financed with Canadian and Ontario tax credits, which is ashamed to settle in Canada, proving once again that the Canadian film industry is flawed and opportunistic. Films from one country have to do more than just provide jobs. They should reflect culture. It's bad enough that the American studios use Toronto as a test for New York. But it's embarrassing and irritating when Canadian producers (in this case, CanWest Global) do it with the help of federal and provincial governments. In a word ... BAH!
