This film was shot in my hometown and I met many of the "actors" in the minor roles. Most of them were students from the local karate school and even when it was shot, we all knew what was smelly. It was however interesting to see it realized. Most of the places where it was filmed no longer exist, such as the disco, the pizzeria, etc. The "world premiere" was held at the Akron Civic Theater and we all laughed hysterically at how stupid it was. I personally think it's the worst movie ever made, but it brings back many good memories. Watch this movie with advice ... enjoy it for what it is ... a very low budget, poorly maintained, karate hit.
