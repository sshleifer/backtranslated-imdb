It is easier to watch this film if you see it as a scenario created by Starfleet Lieutenant Reginald Barclay during his hologram addiction. (Barclay is a recurring Star Trek character played by Dwight Schultz.) <br /> <br /> Dwight Schultz is miscible as Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer's character is poorly written, so we never see the depth and breadth of his knowledge. Instead, we see a superficial, two-dimensional figure from a soap opera. Paul Newman is also a mixture like General Leslie Groves, but the problems of this film go beyond having the wrong actors in the wrong roles. <br /> <br /> The real mistakes and the great freedoms taken (with the chronology of events) for The political agenda of Bruce Robinson, the advanced screenwriter, makes this film embarrassing to watch. This is probably why this film has found a home on the so-called History Channel. <br /> <br /> "Fat Man and Little Boy" combines bad science, bad history, bad script and mediocre acting to produce a film that shouldn't be seen by impressionable students or college students who know nothing of the Manhattan Project.
