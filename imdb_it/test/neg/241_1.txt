The Mexican "classic" was the third entry in the Aztec mummies series. As you will soon discover, this film is anything but a classic, but it is more like a film that deliberately tries to bore you. <br /> <br /> Some scientists want to steal the Aztec treasure from a tomb, but to guard that tomb is the walking ambulant toilet paper: The Aztec mummy. Knowing he can't beat the Mummy, he builds a robot and a very bad one. We will see Mr. Robot in the last reel as he hangs around and fights with the Aztec mummy. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of lousy sci-fi movies, the most shocking hell Fi movies that I see are bad, but this, for the whole 64 Minuites, is the worst movie I've ever seen, with Fubar that comes very close .... <br /> <br /> In conclusion: Do not waste time.
