Originally from 1988, Touch Of Death is probably the most frustrating Fulci film I've seen to date, pushing me to join the chorus of horror fans who generalize that his films get worse as you arrive later in your career. Considering the synopsis of the plot, I was expecting a damn melancholy fun with this, but for all its bizarre flourishes, it seems to me boring even in a period of 80 minutes, and suffers from deceptively shabby production values ​​and film production (or lack of what). <br /> <br /> El Story: A person suffering from gambling who sees the wines and the dense (and strange) women he meets through columns of lonely hearts before throwing them so creepy - sometimes eating them or feeding them to animals - and steal their money to keep their debtors at bay. Of course, it is unlikely that only one man is the host of so much debased pathology (drug addict, psycho / sociopath, cannibal), but this is Fulci! <br /> <br /> Touch is actually the cheapest and the flattest Fulci movie I've seen. There is hardly anyone inside it, for example, even against the background of street shots. A journalist who continues to appear on the televisions of the film to warn the non-existent cast of the latest actions of the maniac operates in the most pathetic television studio on the planet. He can't even look at the camera because he has to read all the titles on misaligned sheets of paper. <br /> <br /> Some scenes go on and on with the protagonist murmuring to himself about what he did or what he is about to do, but acting is not good enough to support this kind of thing , so the main result is spectator boredom. The film also seems bland and ugly in general. I read that it was destined to be an Italian telemovie (it was never screened there? With the amount of gore involved, it seems unlikely), and it stinks of old shoddy telemovie production values. <br /> <br /> This is also Fulci's first foray into pure black humor, but he is too awkward a director to make it work. Sometimes a blatantly cheerful or "weird" music is used to play against a gruesome scene, for example while the hero / villain is cutting out a corpse in his cellar. The effect isn't really chilling or funny or ironic, whatever you'd like it to be - it's mostly just dazed and lousy. <br /> <br /> Obviously, there are some moments of glory that save you, you are waiting while you are trying to stay awake), including the eventual killing of a woman (...) who will not leave life, even after his face was completely destroyed by a damn club and a homeless man running a car back and forth on him about five times. The most outrageous element of Touch, however, is all the physical deformation of widows courted by the madman. Beards, hairy moles, messy harelips - it's not like looking for women with these characteristics, it's just the way all widows of lonely hearts are, apparently. There are a lot of shots of Mr Crazy who secretly makes a face while doing the blowjob on these women. The black humor of this flashy misogyny could have some power or resonance if the film were not performed so badly in general. In the end, Touch Of Death seems like a really lazy and inarticulate mess.
