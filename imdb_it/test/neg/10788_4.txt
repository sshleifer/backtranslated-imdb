Throughout his career, Hitchcock has made great films; this was not one of them. <br /> <br /> A man knows too much, his daughter is kidnapped to ensure his silence, and in the final period everything is solved with the accompaniment of gunshots and dramas on the roof. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen the Fritz Lang films of the 1930s - "M" comes to mind - will know to what extent this urban crime and conscience narrative is not up to the task already been done in that genre at that time. There is an entirely amateur air about much of the staging and acting that subverts any sense of threat, darkness and depravity that Hitchcock may have tried to instill. <br /> <br /> What is worth looking at, however, is the sequence associated with the Albert Hall shooting. Once started, it is as if the film had received a blood transfusion. The camcorder is lively, the cuts are interesting and the way it all combines up to the climax is masterful. Here you can see the future master: Hitchcock orchestrates all the resources effortlessly with extraordinary and memorable effects: when the scream arrives you really feel like you hear it.
