I have neither read the book on which the film is based, nor the letters between Vita and Violet. If I came to this film with any expectation whatsoever, perhaps the Bloomsbury group (including Virginia Woolf and of which the Nicolsons were part) would have been represented. It wasn't, but for me it wasn't a problem. What I'm asking myself is how the people behind this film managed to make it, in my opinion, so uninteresting and repetitive and most of the characters are flat, despite the great material and some excellent actors. The script is simply not good enough. I agree with the criticism of my Finnish neighbor - too many useless sex scenes (but only among women, while there is nothing explicit about Harold's many love stories), too many useless scenes in general, too many background information for the characters. It seems strange considering the quality of the production - on the surface it seems a really ambitious work, but the script is obviously the heaviest and this is where this film fails. <br /> <br /> Life's relationship with Harold struck me as unconvincing, even though they both play very well, especially her. The way they continued to declare their unconditional love for each other in a rather corny way, I thought, well, just not convincing. It makes a lot more sense that it should have happened through the letters, as Tmmvds points out. I would have also liked to know where the nicknames came from - the Russian ones * and Mar - why on earth is anyone called Life given the nickname Mar? They could be small things, but it's important to contribute to the bigger picture. <br /> <br /> * I saw the film with English subtitles, and where Mitya should have said, Medea said instead. This may partly explain my frustration with nicknames - I don't understand why Vita should be Greek while Violet is Russian!
