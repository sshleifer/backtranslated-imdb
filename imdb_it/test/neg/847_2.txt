Actually, I couldn't wait to see this movie. After reading a series of reviews before the release, it looked like a really cool movie, one that was beautifully filmed and one with an interesting cast (Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hurt.) <br /> <br /> Well , it may have been all of those things, but it is so boring that I almost challenge anyone to sit through it in its entirety and keep the attention. Furthermore, Cage's attempt to speak with an Italian accent is embarrassingly negative. He is such a good actor that I made him shudder every time he spoke in this film. <br /> <br /> "Disappointing" seems to be the word most used by reviewers here to describe this film, and I totally agree. <br /> <br /> I suppose it didn't take much word to understand how bad this film was because, like Cage's accent, it wasn't good.
