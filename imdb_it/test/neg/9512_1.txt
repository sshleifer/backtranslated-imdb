Well, to each his own, but I thought Gibson's Hamlet was the most terrible version I'd ever seen ... as subtly nuanced as a paper bag and inspired as a telemarketing call. The only reason I saw the film to the end was that I was hoping it would either improve or become unintentionally funny. No luck. <br /> <br /> No disrespect for the supporting cast or the Zefferelli script, but nothing can make up for the mess of the main character. I saw Hamlet well depicted as an African prince, as an animated lion, as a rough warrior, as a romantic poet, etc. Etc. Etc. But IMHO this representation was just an abundant lack of spirit along with the weakest hams.
