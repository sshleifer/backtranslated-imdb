"Grande Ecole" is not an astute exploration of mixed sexuality but, if you need it, a film for an X-rated channel. Although I suspect that there is nothing in this film to spoil for a voluntary spectator, the plot is simply an excuse for male-to-female and male-to-male couplings set in the unconvincing context of a competition between a Parisian school for future CEOs and an important school for those seeking higher degrees in the liberal arts. Likewise, there is a thrill of cultural clash between the high state and low-ranking French youth, as well as a social conflict involving French and Arab immigrants from North Africa. All that is missing is a female-to-female coupling, which could easily be arranged with a slight twist in the plot. <br /> <br /> The acting is at a slightly higher level than the usual pornographic film - but "Grande Ecole" is, to be blunt, no more than pornography with artistic aspirations. I'm not offended by sex. It's just repetitive and, for a long time, boring. Where's Hays's office when you really need it?
