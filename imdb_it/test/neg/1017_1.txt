Director Fabio Barreto has received a strange Nominea Academy for his latest film O Quatrilho. Quatrilho is a bad movie, but in Bella Donna, Barreto has made one of the worst movies of all time. His adaptation of the novel Riacho Doce is ridiculous. Think with me how the poor Brazilian fishermen speak perfect English? In the film they do it. There is no script, it's just a very long video clip with beautiful locations and lots of sex scenes with Moscovis and Henstridge.
