I saw this movie because Calexico made the score. A real disappointment. Annoying and fashionable scenes, with urban hipster and their fashionable lifestyle. Stereotypical culture of Mexican frontier (mystic grandfather with rattlesnake and potions, grandson in his mariachi style restaurant). A few laughs, but hipper-than-thou, and I really miss the vision and the basic talent of cinema.
