I would have liked it if I didn't like Diane Arbus. <br /> <br /> It didn't really capture the unique visual aesthetics of Arbus (as did Stanley Kubrick in "The Shinning", with the twins in the corridor, a direct tribute to one of Arbus's most famous photos, and one with disturbing qualities that none of these cinematic images has), and certainly none of his (extroverted) character, resemblance (thin and Jewish, not Queen Kidman), or life, save some very superficial similarities, was a fad that later he photographed "monsters" and "strangers" among many other things. This film focused on the "monster", as its symbol for artistic and personal empowerment, in a very superficial and predictable way. Outside of this, it may have been an interesting film about the middle-class fetish, but I was too annoyed to worry. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the name Arbus had been interrupted, it could have been less annoying, but it didn't have its name in the title, there would have been nothing that made me interested in seeing this in the first place. A "Secretary" disappointment.
