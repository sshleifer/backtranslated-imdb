This may have been a creepy role for Valeria Golino but the film has instead decided to shift its attention to another area. The film is about a woman named Grazia (Golino) who is married to a fisherman and mother of three children. She is a free spirit and prone to outbreaks so the rest of the village and her family decide that she should be sent to Milan and see a doctor. The story takes place on the island of Lampedusa, off the coast of Sicily, and shows everyday life there with teenage boys in rival gangs and just trying to find something to do about the rock-baked sun. The eldest son of Grazia, Pasquale (Francesco Casisa) adores her and always tries to protect her during periods of depression. The daughter Marinella (Veronica D'Agostino) is a girl in flower who is infatuated with a local policeman and the younger son Filippo (Filippo Pucillo) is very impertinent and makes fun of the policeman's accent. After learning that she must be sent to Milan, Grazia flees and Pasquale helps her by hiding her in a cave while everyone is looking for her. This film could have really had a greater impact if he could focus his attention on Grazia. We see some irrational explosions and behavior on his part, but theirs is not the result of these scenes. Nothing comes out of it. The film looks good and is beautifully photographed, so it is thanks to the director Emanuele Crialese, but the story had to focus on something more substantial. The film does a good job of showing us what life is like on this island and what is happening in the lives of the three children as they grow up. Theirs is a conjecture that Golino's character gives the impression of being a mermaid-like creature and that is why he finds it difficult to exist on earth. I also feel that the island itself expects its inhabitants to behave in a certain way and if you don't, you can be subject to the harsh realities of its rules. All the speculations, but I think the attention of the film could have remained with the character of Grace. After hiding in the cave, he really has nothing to do. In a sense, the character becomes stagnant. I wish Golino had other things to do because I've always liked him and every time he's on the screen you can't take his eyes off her. She is a bundle of fury, passion and raw energy! Too bad that Crialese has not written a more complete role in which to act. When the film ends, your left feels drained of an incomplete story.
