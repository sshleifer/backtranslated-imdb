If you can get past this film without laughing out loud on the screen, you're a better photographer than me. <br /> <br /> Count logical errors, jumps of common sense and credibility extensions ... more than two hands! <br /> <br /> PS: if another film uses a place that is clearly UCLA, and states that it is a different university (in the case of this film: Berkeley), I'm going to lose it.
