Legend has it that at the gala of the first Hollywood screening of 2001: A Space Odyssey, about 20 minutes into the film, Rock Hudson shouted "Could someone tell me what the hell this movie is about?" Well, I beat Rock about 19 minutes, 59 seconds. This film makes absolutely no sense. Who were those people? Where were those people? What were the rules of the game called Quintet? Are there any rules for the Quintet? Was Robert Altman and his cohort making the film as they went along? What was Paul Newman thinking when he signed up for this? Maybe the old Fast Eddie saw Zardoz and thought "Well, if Connery can be involved in a futuristic movie that doesn't make sense, I can too." Maybe the good stuff is on the cutting room floor and all we see is the inconsistent stuff. Also, did all the cast manage to keep their hats funny? You have never seen such strange hats in one place of your life. Quintet confirms what I have always thought: when Altman is good he is superb, but when he is bad, he does things like Quintet
