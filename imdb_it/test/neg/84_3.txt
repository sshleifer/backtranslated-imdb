Seeing the title of this movie "Stupid Teenagers Must Die" made me believe that it was a parody of some kind. I discovered later that the original title was "Blood and Guts". Both titles are misleading, though. This is neither a parody nor a serious splatter movie. This is something in between, failing in both areas. A group of teenagers take part in a seance in a spooky house and then the murder begins. It looks familiar, doesn't it? Well, this film adds nothing to the endless stream of similar movies. And it's badly done. Due to the lack of light, the entire film is grainy. Now this effect can be very effective, but it is not in this case. The young cast does not act too badly, but the director has no idea what to do with the actors. In numerous scenes the actors are clearly waiting for directions, but these are given too late. It could also be a mistake of a publisher, of course. The characters are unrealistic and the plot is just a stink. Sometimes the sound is terrible: conversations are indecipherable, but when you speak out loud or shout the actors are very strong. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but it's still a bad one. For me a 3 out of 10.
