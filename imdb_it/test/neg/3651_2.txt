The sound in this film is a nightmare. This is the best I can say for this movie. Any chance of a good story is lost once this movie starts. The premise of the film looks good. A playboy who comes to terms with the people around him. The plot is predictable and very boring. Wet t-shirt competition could be the worst scene I've ever seen and it's worth seeing in a kind of Mystery Science deal. The sound is sometimes difficult to hear and the main actor does not seem to know how to speak clearly. His accent makes it very difficult to understand. The only brilliant sport is the acting of Penelope Ann Miller. Her role is underdeveloped but she interprets it well. In short, don't waste your time.
