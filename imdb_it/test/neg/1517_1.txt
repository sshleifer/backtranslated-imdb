Wow, this movie was terrible. It's that simple. Actually, this is the first time I go out early, as far as I can remember. This went well, though: I had a nice chat with two more charming girls while we waited for the rest to finally abandon the shit they called a "movie". <br /> <br /> Where to start. Bad acting, bad jokes. Fecal humor, which I simply can't stand. Sorry, but snot, pee and scat are * not * funny. Have you seen the image of the title? That scene actually drags on for about 5 minutes, with the two "heroes" hitting and mutilating each other, which should be humorous on its own. It is not. <br /> <br /> Apart from body fluids, violence and disguise, I don't remember much about this. At least not very well. I was really very disappointed with this piece of junk. Or let's be honest here: since I'm really a big fan of "British" humor, I was angry. <br /> <br /> So, do you want my advice? Three words: don't look.
