Days of Heaven is one of the most painfully boring and useless movies I've ever seen. In no way, form or form would I recommend it to anyone ... unless you are trying to put your children to sleep or, God forbid, give someone an aneurysm. If I could go back in time and do something, I'd set fire to the reels before they were sent to the movies. Why? The plot of Days of Heaven is simple, but extremely vague. Long sequences without dialogue make up a large part of the film. The characters are too superficial and ridiculously stupid to relate to. The climax of the story does not touch you: at this moment your brain has worked so hard to understand the plot and the series of hidden metaphors that your ability to think has disappeared. The only things that work are your eyes and, unfortunately, your ears, which must listen to the sound of Linda, the little girl in history, who talks like a man. I'm more stupid now for seeing this movie. Don't let that happen to you.
