As powerful as the real Phoolan story is, this book based on the movie came out before she was released from prison and had the chance to tell it. <br /> <br /> It is supposedly based on his diaries but is illiterate. How does it work? <br /> <br /> Having said that, some areas of the film are accurate and the acting is not bad, with a certain sensitivity shown. <br /> <br /> Although this story needs to be old in a TV series. Far too long to happen in a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> Read his autobiography. Highly recommended. It's a fantastic story.
