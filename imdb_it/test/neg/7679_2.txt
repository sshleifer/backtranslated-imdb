The original airport (1970) was a classic of its kind, and the first two sequences of the film B (Airport 1975; Airport '77) were the most enjoyable, at worst, playable entertainment; but this gross and inept final voice has no entertainment value and shows a shocking contempt for its audience. It's unbearable and not even good for laughter. <br /> <br /> All three of the "Airport" sequels were theatrical releases produced by the Universal television wing, but this is below the modest standards of a TV movie of the day, with low-cost production , grotesque casting, "comedy" insipid and unpleasant visual ugliness. The project was clearly condemned by the "creative" efforts of the universal executive Jennings Lang, who personally produced and was given a "history" credit. <br /> <br /> Everyone starts somewhere, and writer Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) may have provided an element of auto-burlesque, like previous films (especially the infamous 1975 Airport), but there is no it's nothing worth spoofing in the turgid, inconsistent script of Roth and even in the comedy Airplane! he left this raw untouched. <br /> <br /> What makes The Concorde: Airport '79 particularly interesting is its abusive abuse of professionals. The worst victim is the supremely gifted Cicily Tyson (Sounder, Miss Jane Pittman's autobiography), ruthlessly reduced to a vomit subplot involving her escort of a frozen heart transplant in the unfortunate flight. <br /> <br /> A special groin kick is reserved for the wonderful George Kennedy, who is the real protagonist despite being buried on the cast list. The official mascot of the "Airport" series and the only actor to appear in all four films, Kennedy had more than deserved the title role and his turn in the Captain's place would have been the only possible reason for this voice over to the squeezing of a last dollar. Kennedy provides the only warmth and true humor in this mechanical muckup, putting aside his machismo skill and revealing a genuinely sweet and tender side to himself, and to his amiable and heroic character of "Joe Patroni". Unfortunately we are never allowed to forget how much Kennedy is fat and old and over-the-hill, and Alain Delon, the super cute overage, calls him inexorably "Pork pork" as part of a completely flat fellowship. Even the Parisian love story of Kennedy, the only human part of this plane wreck, turns out to be just a set-up for a hateful joke at the expense of Patrons, Kennedy and the spectator.
