It looked like it would be like Silence of the Lambs or Zodiac or something, but it wasn't. It was really more like one of the Halloween movies without all the jumping scenes. It was a bit like Plan 9 From Outer Space in the sense that the evil main continued to make inane speeches that made me want to have a snack without taking a break. The idea of ​​someone so mad to kidnap people and torture them as a form of spiritual enlightenment is actually an interesting idea, but the execution was meant for TV. I have to say that it was better than I expected for a film written and played by Dee Snider. A good first try. Perhaps he will learn some lessons and his next effort will be less clumsy.
