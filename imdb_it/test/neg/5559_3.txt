This is a parody. This means that there are no characters as such, they are all simple stereotypes, and the film is completely based on the quality of the lines. <br /> <br /> Well, there are some good lines in this movie. Unfortunately, they are hidden in a mass of real fools. If one expects all dialogues to be absurd, the fun disappears. <br /> <br /> You see, there's American Pie 2, my all-time favorite teen movie. It contains many real original characters. Maybe the jokes are without taste, but all people have some kind of life. For example, they feel embarrassed if something embarrassing happens. This is what makes the jokes themselves really fun! <br /> <br /> This film is not like this: each scene is clearly organized as a mere parody, so there are no characters, so there is really no room for any sympathy. Also, if you know the original films, you know entire scenes in advance. Add the fact that many jokes are not funny at all, and you have this movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved me from becoming completely bored where in fact the comments of some teenagers in the cinema where I was watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Ah, and my personal strength of the film was the brief appearance of Melissa Joan Hart in a scene. Sigh. It's too beautiful, it can't be real. Hmm, is that a whole movie?
