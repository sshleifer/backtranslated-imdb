This DVD only lasts 30 minutes and has boring interviews that reveal that the average Slipknotian has an IQ of about 30. But these aspects are the least problematic here. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that Slipknot is one of the least talented metal bands to sell more than 100,000 units of their shit. (The only reason I say "one of" instead of "the" is because System Of A Down is even worse.) Just like Ed Gein's girlfriends, this band's music is rebuilt along with old metal clich√©s, that must be found both in their image and in their ultra-opaque music. In fact, their image is fun; their videos are like fragments of cheesy horror movies, so they at least satisfy some purpose as entertainment. <br /> <br /> Their music, however, does not consist of anything of quality - anything: just a bunch of misleading, listened to - a million times before guitarist-only riffs, which are in no way related among them and yet they are grouped randomly to form "songs" that have no cohesion, no highlights, nothing at all. But if the riffs are really bad, then the voice is even worse: the singer from Slipknot has a stereotyped and uninteresting evil growl - the 90% type of all the metal bands of today - but it's nothing compared to when this hool disappointing start to try singing! Yet what could one expect? The rule n.39 of the manual "Nu Metal" says quite clearly: "you will alternate growling and singing, ignoring the fact that the two styles do not mix well, because most of your fans are so deaf that they will love you even if you * *** in the microphone. "Slipknot are at their worst when their" singer "starts to play" melodies ". <br /> <br /> But let's get back to their image. It is stolen, copied, robbed, scratched, borrowed, taken without asking no less than Mr. Bungle. Have you ever heard of it? Of course not. You only listen to nu-metal, and Mr. Bungle is quite far from this, and anyway beyond any categorization. They too wore masks - grotesque, horror, similar to those of the Slipknot, I might add - in the late 80s and early 90s. This band, whose frontman is Mike Patton of Faith No More, has never been successful because their music was not aimed at media music fans (to put it mildly). <br /> <br /> So basically, Slipknot isn't even original in the image department. They have nothing new to offer, so they will be forgotten in several years: once the masks become boring for the legions of their irreverent fans, which is when Slipknot will be forced to compete in the music market only with their generic music. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Mike Patton, it is interesting to note that a number of nu-metal groups often place the his singing as a great influence Predictably - and fortunately - Patton is not flattered by this and has denied being somehow proud of being influential for one of the worst metal sub-genres of all time ... <br /> < br /> That said, enjoy this short DVD and the low-cost chills that could provide the inexperienced ear and the bored eye ... And then polish those Slipknot posters, because in a few years no one will take care of them, the poor ones. <br /> <br /> Dop or having seen Corey in the documentary "Get Thrashed", I finally understood why he wears a mask: he is a ginger with a child's face with blue eyes, similar to Dave Mustaine's younger brother! Not exactly scary. <br /> <br /> For my other rant of the music world, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/1 <br /> <br /> Please, punish me hard, very difficult, clicking "no" below.
