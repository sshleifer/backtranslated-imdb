I'm writing this just as a chess player and as a film viewer. I saw the 1997 Kasparov-Deep Blue games on the Internet. I know something about the problems that have been raised. Other chess players will come in and want to know if this movie deserves to be seen / bought, and I'm talking to most of them. However, I will try not to ignore those that are not "in the game". <br /> <br /> This film is about the 1997 game between Garry Kasparov and the custom-made "Deep Blue" computer. However, the first image you see in the film is not from Kasparov, or from the computer, but from "THE TURK". This is an "automaton" that was built in Europe between the 18th and 19th centuries and played winning chess against all others. I put the word "automaton" in quotation marks because it was, as everyone now knows, a fake. There was a man inside. <br /> <br /> If you don't like to see "THE TURK", then you won't be able to stand the film, because "THE TURK" has the same time as Kasparov, maybe more, both in the modern movie and in the one in black and white of an old film. The reappearance of "THE TURK" every few seconds underlines Kasparov's accusation that "Deep Blue" had human assistance - that it was (to some extent) a fake computer, that IBM cheated, that there was "a man inside" who worked behind the scenes to help him win. Kasparov not only believes it, but filmmakers seem to believe it too. So this is not a film about chess games or chess computer programming. It is a piece of propaganda about a large company that is supposed to abuse a helpless grandmaster. In reality it is very similar to a "negative advertisement", as it is chock full of threatening music and suggestive photographic works and spectral and innuendi sound effects ("we never found out what was behind that closed door") and the ubiquitous "TURK". <br /> <br /> Now, most people in the chess community are pretty much convinced that IBM didn't cheat and that this was Garry's paranoia at work. For starters, for a human to help "Deep Blue" beat Kasparov, it would seem that you would need a human who was better than "Deep Blue" And better than Kasparov. Since there was no such person, the whole idea is a bit suspect from the beginning. Furthermore, at the time this film was made, there were computer programs that could run on your PC and that could beat the great masters. Today, much more than in 1997, we take for granted that a computer can do things that one might not expect. And we are less inclined to consider it a monumental human tragedy than a computer beats a chess boy. (And in fact, the bottom line is that Kasparov has beaten himself with two wrong mistakes, including the resignation of game 2 in a drawn position.) <br /> <br /> Regarding chess games, actually you see very few. There are some comments from masters and commentators that briefly tell how they went, but in reality you can't see almost any strategy or tactics. Of course, as a chess player, I regard this as a great lack, but I think that even non-players are deceived. Imagine a baseball movie, for example, where you can hardly see any of the games - just a commentator who tells you that "in Game Four, the White Sox defeated the Astros with a similar score". No one would make a film like that. But here, for example, we are told that Kasparov made a bad mistake in opening the decisive game 6, but we are not shown the position on the screen, nor did we explain why it was a blunder, or what he should have done instead, or anything. We see only a few seconds of Kasparov holding his head in his hands, and then more sound effects and more atmospheric camera work. <br /> <br /> (Since I saw it on DVD, I would like to warn DVD chess players how The jacket promises you that Extras include "analysis" games. It's an analysis by the grandmaster, who people like us might find interesting? NO! It's computerized speech synthesis computerized analysis from a version of Chessmaster, which tells you when a piece is attacked and a piece is isolated and you're in "Caro-Kann Defense, line main ". Blahhhh. <br /> <br /> Someone could then come and say," Well, clearly this film is meant to dramatize the game for the non-player, and therefore it is unfair to be impatient with it. "But in it doesn't really do a great job of reaching the non-player - it eliminates some points that a real novice would really like to have explained. For example, he says that Kasparov could get "perpetual control" in the second game, but he doesn't explain what it is (or shows how it would have seemed on the board, which would have been interesting). Go back to Kasparov-Karpov games, but don't explain why there were two or who organized them, etc. I did not need this information alone, but it is familiar to me. If you don't already have chess experience, there are some places where you'll be confused, and that's just a flaw in the movie. <br /> <br /> Ultimately I cannot recommend the film, which, like "THE TURK", is not what it claims to be (a documentary) but more a scenic illusion.
