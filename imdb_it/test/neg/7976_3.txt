Supreme Sanction is a film about a murderer who works for the US government. He must kill a well-known television reporter, but he spares his life when he sees that he has a small daughter. Since he did not kill him, he becomes the next target of his employers. <br /> <br /> The script is not good, even though I've seen worse B movies. A killer with remorse, the government kills innocent people in the name of fighting terrorism, ... What is next? Aliens who save the victim ??? No, Supreme Sanction will never win any prizes due to the script. And acting isn't better, I'm afraid. Some well-known actors (Michael Madsen and Kristy Swanson), who clearly had a lot of accounts to pay and then agreed to play in this film, along with other actors who probably don't even know what a camera looks like. . <br /> <br /> So why should you watch this movie? Well, if you have nothing better to do than watch an action movie and you're tired of the 10.531 replica of Mc Gyver or the A-team, this could be the movie you want to see. Otherwise it is better to leave it alone. I give him a 3/10.
