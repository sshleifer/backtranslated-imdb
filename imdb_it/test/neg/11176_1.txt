I admit, I was captivated by the provocative still images of Charlotte Lewis of this film, as well as a commentary on IMDb's wall dedicated to her, defining this image as an "undervalued film". And so I got, with great difficulty, my copy of "Dial Help". <br /> <br /> What a waste. <br /> <br /> Nothing but a cheap blood and blood movie with a ridiculous premise that I have no intention of repeating, with several telegraphed sequences (for example, when we see Lewis giving himself up) eating with love to his fish, we know immediately what will happen to them later). Even Lewis, with his beautiful raven hair, big bright brown eyes, full and pouty lips and stunning figure, can save this film. Lewis fans would be better off with "Bare Essentials", "Sketch Artist", or even "Golden Child".
