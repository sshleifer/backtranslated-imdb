From the beginning this film drags and drags. Clumsy overlaps that explain the story, monochromatic acting, boring sets, total lack of humanity, verve or style. The actors seem drugged. Potentially an interesting story completely wasted. Surely someone realized how serious it was at one point in producing it?
