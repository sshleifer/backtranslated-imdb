Well, here we have a zombie movie that maybe it's not even a zombie movie. The entire film is set in the near future plagued by zombies, but the film does little with this concept. Instead he focuses on a zombie hunter who is trying to get revenge and his money from a group of other bounty hunters. What good is money when almost the whole world has gone to hell and the cities are mostly desolate. And why pay people money to kill zombies in the first place. As if people didn't want to kill these dangerous menacing monsters when they're not paid. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the plot of "The Quick and the Undead" is anything but narrow. Of course, moreover, it is not filled with the most logical and interesting moments, characters or dialogues. <br /> <br /> Still not a completely horrible film. It certainly isn't as bad as some people try to make you believe it is. It's pretty nice, or at least he said the film doesn't look cheap. The effects could be a little abused, but nevertheless they are quite beautiful, as are the effects of make-up. <br /> <br /> The film was not what I was hoping for. The title might suggest that the film is set in the wild, wild west, during the days of cowboys but the title is just misleading, no doubt chosen to cash in. I fell in love, expecting this film to be a combination of a zombie-western bloody horror. <br /> <br /> For fans of zombie movies this film will mostly be a disappointment to watch. Obviously it doesn't add anything new to the genre, but it doesn't have enough of the same genre in it to be considered a good movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Not totally unwatchable but also far from a recommendable one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
