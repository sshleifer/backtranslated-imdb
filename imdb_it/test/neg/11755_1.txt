I know the curiosity killed the cat, but I simply had to see the remake of Psycho, especially after having recently been on a Hitchcok trip and getting to know his work. I saw the original Psycho since I was a child, I knew how to respect it and not only that, it was an excellent film! One of the best, in fact! The first thing I said when I heard about the remake was "How to redo perfection?" I also kept this to myself, but I think I have a more open mind now and I thought it was a way of introducing Psycho into a new generation. <br /> <br /> But this turned into a total insult and slapped the face of the original Psycho. I know this was said, but I saw the making of this film, and the director thought "Oh, I just want to update it and shoot every scene shot like the original" ... what's the coolest point? ! OK, but I want to judge this movie by myself, despite being offensive to the original. I mean, the acting wasn't up to it, but honestly, it seemed like the actors were just looking at the original and memorizing the lines from there and making them shit. <br /> <br /> Looking at the making of this film, I wanted to slap Anne Hasche, she said "I never saw the original, I just wanted to work with Gus". Ooh, that made me angry, because frankly, it's not just that, he really sucked into this role as Marian, he wasn't convincing, not to mention his shower scene was really horrible. Vince Vaughn didn't ... let's put it this way, the film was horribly ruined. This was a pity against the cinema and on its own, this was actually a bad movie. It was too much and it destroyed what could have been a new introduction for a new generation. But for Gus, let the film play the part of who knows WHAT THEY ARE DOING! <br /> <br /> 1/10
