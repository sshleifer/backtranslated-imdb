Usually, any movie with Steve Railsback in mind is a good movie. However, this film does not conform to this opinion. Lifeforce is a film below average that is extremely confusing at the beginning (it reminds me of Star Trek: TMP), but is able to pick up things a bit when London becomes Zombie City. A horror / science fiction mess that is very difficult to seduce, even if the ghostly / naked vampire is very easy to look at. This film deserves a rating of 4 out of 10.
