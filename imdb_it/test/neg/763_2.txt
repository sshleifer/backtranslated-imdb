For a scientifically engineered super dog that should have been the answer to the pet crime, CHOMPS was a jerk. <br /> <br /> All I saw Chomps do was sit, walk or run. Or run, then walk, then sit down ... and then come back up again, stretch, then walk and then go jogging with K-Tel's dance hits. And sometimes he had all the answers to the Jumbo newspaper. But mostly he just sat a lot. <br /> <br /> All I'm saying is: In a celebrity Death Match, Chomps failed to eliminate Mr. Bigglesworth.
