This must be the most boring movie I've ever seen. The only positive thing I can say about it is that fortunately I didn't pay to see it. We were given a free screening at school and everyone in the audience sat there embarrassed wondering when the fun would start. This piece of garbage is too long, too long a film. The real idea of ​​why the film took about 10 seconds to be presented. The only ones who may be interested in this film are those who have lost their jobs and want to know why. They could find some interesting interviews. A different modification may have made a documentary of this interesting, but I doubt it, the interviews shown were not engaging in any way. As it is, it is only a tragedy, both to observe and to be a part of. AVOID THIS FILM AT ANY COST!
