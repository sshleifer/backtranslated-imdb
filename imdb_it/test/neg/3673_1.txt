This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen and has no storyline and the plot it has is very dispersed. The plot is lacking in content, suspense and subtitles, as what seems to be the plot is in Russian. The set seems to be just a room with various lighting effects and the moment you think something good is about to happen, you are disappointed by the total lack of acting, drama, suspense, horror, gore, plot and mythology. The style of directing was done to death (the fisheye camera). It would seem that the only action in this film is in the last 10 - 15 minutes and the action is compounded by the actors' incapacity to correctly portray the suspense. The only interesting thing about this film was my dog ​​barking at surround sound.
