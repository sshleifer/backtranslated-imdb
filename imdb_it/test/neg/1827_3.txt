This is a pretty crappy picture. It offers nothing unique or original or even interesting. <br /> <br /> A medical student discovers that a secret society in his university is engaged in gruesome medical experiments. And of course she gets involved in solving the strange deaths at school. This film started off promising with some fantastic special effects in which a guy is partially dissected while he is alive and tries to escape after he wakes up, but then the fizzles and the rest of the special effects are pretty routine plastic models of the human body and that unreal blood that always seems to have these horror films of the second level. <br /> <br /> And as if the routine plot and the bad acting weren't enough, this movie had subtitles that many times didn't even match the nicknamed English that feels to be spoken and then add it to the movement of the mouth which does not correspond to the dubbing .. well, let's just say trying to coordinate everything that in your head isn't worth for this mediocre film. <br /> <b r /> I had at least relied on a few skins in this film and, except for a while during the closing credits, this film didn't give any results. <br /> <br /> This is a boring horror / gore film mill routine --- short on horror and gore. Take this movie unless "Ernest goes to Camp" is the only home left.
