I gave this film a four-star rating for a few reasons. First of all, I felt that this film was certainly preaching and I hate it. Still, it's my fault if I watch a Christian movie in the first place. <br /> <br /> My friend and I rented this movie because it looked interesting. The back of the case said something along the lines of a spiritual battle, someone who opened a kind of border that allowed the demons to enter our world and the like. Something I am very interested in, indeed. This film almost hit the target. It was more like on the edge of the target, more on the tree than on the target itself ... <br /> <br /> The basic plot of this film is that two couples are kidnapped by a group of terrorists to be victims of experiments . However, since their experimental serum comes from the search for a scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and spiritual realms, the men of the couples are now able to hear, smell, hear and see the demons of the spiritual world. In this order. Apparently the sense of taste is not present in that realm. <br /> <br /> This film is very clich√©. They took the title seriously while the men, while chained to the beds, ask their women to look behind because there is something there. <br /> <br /> Despite a good effort for what it was, I think the special effects could have been done much better. The demon scratching the woman was, in a word, hilarious. His wife was as nasty as hell and everyone in the room practically applauded when she died. We all hoped she would be beaten by the other woman in the chair. <br /> <br /> The message is one that I don't care to comment on, apart from the fact that Christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for this. <br /> <br /> And so I give him four stars because it's not the fault of the film, I'm not a Christian and I don't like this kind of message, and I had a kick-off to comment all over my friend and watching this movie it looks like an MST3K episode.
