when I first saw this film, I was literally wandering around on the ground laughing (especially when they were being chased by water, and when the boy was driving through people's gardens, I mean that it would be bad to drive around the washing line? special effects! this film clearly didn't have a big budget. or that or the boy left his child in charge of the controls. the water coming out of the damn thing looked like a close-up of a can of beer that had come back on. What were the actors thinking about? did they really think it was a good movie? or did they really need money? not that they would have gained much. when I saw him for the first time, I was like, "God, how old is he?" when I looked at the information on it and saw it was released in 2003, I thought my TV was broken. <br /> <br /> this is really a catastrophic film, in more ways than one.
