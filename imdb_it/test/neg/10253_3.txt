I readily admit that I watch a lot of really bad movies. But there are very few that I can think of that are just as bad as When When Had Tails. It is a stinker of epic proportions. What should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen discovering a woman for the first time is instead a boring, lifeless affair, without a single laugh. The play is extremely weak. I suppose if you think hitting someone in the head is fun, you might find a laugh or two. The guys in this movie make the three marmittoni look like high art. And a plot is not enough to hold the thing together. It seems to drag it forward and forward. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe you're wondering, "If it's as bad as you say, why didn't you rate it below 3/10?" Good question! And I have two answers. First of all, the film is not without its curiosity value. I find some interest in an Italian parody of films like One Million Years B.C. with Raquel Welch. I will give When Women Had Tails a point for its historical "value". The other two points are for the sole presence of Senta Berger. I know it's not so much an explanation or reasoning for an evaluation, but what are you going to do? It's the best I can invent.
