The arguments presented are very interesting; suburban culture, suburban expansion, public transport, depletion of oil and gas, energy dependency, alternative energy sources, etc. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it is a pure and shameless piece of propaganda. A point of view is presented, then hammered on the viewer over and over again. See the same handful of 'experts' who have repeatedly made their case. The alleged "narrator" begins as a reporter, but in the end he also preaches the dogma of the film. <br /> <br /> The dark side of the film is not so much the dark and negative message about oil exhaustion, but the feeling that people in the film are really eager for a post-oil company and all that it entails. They depict this picture of a utopian society in which we all return to the model of a self-sufficient local village; go to work, shop locally, cultivate our food and, in general, live an idyllic 19th century lifestyle. For them, the post-oil society would seem a great vision of a better world. It would certainly mean the end of globalization and, better yet, the end of Walmart. I will give them the credit for having applied the current mathematics in exposing the weak points of various alternative sources of energy touted, including ethanol and hydrogen. <br /> <br /> I gave her 3 stars because I liked the old movie and the premise.
