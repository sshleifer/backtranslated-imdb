Strangeland is a terrible technological horror / thriller. Dee Snider plays Carleton Hendricks, a disgusting computer freak who prays young girls through chat rooms. His ridiculous philosophies of pain and suffering are both misguided and totally unfounded. There is no connection with reality with the ideas presented in this film, it's more like Dee Snider sat down and tried to invent the strangest things possible to impress horror fans and maybe some of his old fans, but the end result is Unfortunately for me, as a horror fan, the cover of this film looks very good and immediately caught my interest, which is the main reason I was led to watch it. I assure you that this is not a quality horror movie. It's a boring but boring attempt to suggest what might happen in the minds of people who treat themselves like Carleton Hendricks did in this film. The sad part is that nobody does these things to themselves. Marilyn maniac 'Manson hasn't even gone that far, and the fact that he had a song on the soundtrack makes it clear that the film wasn't meant to tease his type of music (it would be a stab at Snider himself), it's more if Dee Snider was trying to get up from his career and introduce himself again as a sick person. Dee, it seems like it's time to let everything die ...
