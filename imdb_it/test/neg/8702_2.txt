I realize that it is very difficult to live up to the first movie of The 10 Commandments (which was great and personally not a fan of Charleton Heston) but wow ... this movie / mini-series was disappointing. Even the animated The Prince of Egypt was better. <br /> <br /> The only thing that threw me was Ramses. Compared to Yul Brynner's version, Paul Rhys' version seemed so weak and non-Pharoh. The acting was not that good. For a modern adaptation, I expected something better. It just doesn't look as good as the first one. I guess they were running on a tight budget or something. There is an occasional narrative voice that I found strange and useless. He also broke the flow of history. And um ... God's voice / lines were pretty weird.
