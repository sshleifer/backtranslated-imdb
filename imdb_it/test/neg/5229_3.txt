This film is based on a novel by Stephen King in which the mysterious new merchant Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) offers every citizen of Castle Rock the object he wants most - but there is a heavy price to pay for these transactions . Local sheriff Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) is soon forced to face a series of brutal deaths and suspicious circumstances. <br /> <br /> Below average for Stephen King's cinema: I understand why some people would think it was boring. He continues without offering genuine scares and forces the viewer to spend time (once again) with a group of loathsome losers whose mutual hatred is ghostly. <br /> <br /> I like the novel and I don't think this lackluster movie does justice. There are too many unfortunate changes from screen to book. <br /> <br /> Von Sydow makes Gaunt too charming. We should be sorry about Gaunt in the right moments, don't enjoy him. I also hate that the sheriff's deputy principal (Ray McKinnon) was written and played as an annoying Barney Fife idiot. Star Ed Harris seems to have been forced to take this photo by his agent, but however professional he is, he really sinks his teeth into his dialogue. Bonnie Bedelia (as the love interest of Pangborn Polly) and Amanda Plummer (in one of her mentally unbalanced standard roles) are closer to creating characters who are nice. <br /> <br /> Yet it is also mean and mean. <br /> <br /> Although I will be damned if I didn't feel a bit cathartic looking at a group of unlikely movie characters who are torn to pieces. The climax has good explosions. Often I give films a better rating than they probably deserve, but in this case I feel I should be honest and just say: 3/10.
