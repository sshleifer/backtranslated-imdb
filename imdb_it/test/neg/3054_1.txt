Dear friends, I have never seen a trash film like NIGHT OF THE DEMONS (1988). It seems that the director Kevin Tenney had the intention to copy classics like THE EVIL DEAD by Sam Raimi (1978) or RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD by George A. Romero of the same year. The film was very bad, the film was very dark, so I had to turn the brightness control to maximum. In fact, the images of horror must be obscure, but not like the NIGHT OF DEMONS. The whole film was ridiculous, without suspense, worse actors than Alvin Alexis in the role of Rodger and horrible make-up effects. An average rating of 5 stars for that movie? I can not believe. Perhaps the users were happy with the tits, the donkeys and the actresses' pussies, they were really worth 5 stars. Greetings, Hans-Dieter
