Wow! This film is almost a pity about words. Obviously the writers somehow wanted to connect him to the Ghoulies franchise, so they got Pete Liapis from the first to resume his role as Jonathan ... just now, he's a cop and he doesn't have similar character traits as he did in the first. The ghoulies in this are not the ghoulies of the last. Economical-looking puppets have been replaced by cheaper-looking miniature people. Instead of being one of the main antagonists or being bad, they are more like the prominent comic characters who appeared out of nowhere for no reason. <br /> <br /> When I was watching this movie for the first time, it seemed like I had seen it before. Why was this? Because everything in this was stolen from another movie. All police lines and action scenes were by Lethal Weapon. The ghoulies were practically like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, except they weren't funny at all. The scenes from Ghoulies' original film have also been scattered throughout this film. I think the target audience should have been an adult, but the mixture of black magic, cartoon farce, police drama and bad acting doesn't work at all. I hope they don't make a Ghoulies V, because I don't want a movie studio to lose their money. <br /> <br /> My assessment: BOMB / ****. 78 minutes R for violence.
