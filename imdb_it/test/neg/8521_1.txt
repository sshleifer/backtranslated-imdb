You're Dead is an indescribably terrible attempt at a British gangster movie. It has not a single original idea, being a terrible copy of various elements of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, The Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. The acting and the dialogue are absolutely atrocious, the plot is ridiculous and absolutely predictable, despite the constant attempts at twists, and contains nothing but characters and clich√©s of dimensions. He has some good actors, but they are out of shape and are not able to do much with the terrible material they are working with. It is an absolute torture to sit in this confusion.
