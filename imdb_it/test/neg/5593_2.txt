Why was this film made? What were the creators of this thought?!?! The first 8MM movie had at least one storyline that made sense and was potentially interesting. The first film was about the snuff industry. This sequel is about ... wait ... the porn industry !! Yes, as if the snuff film industry, an industry where people allegedly would be killed in entertainment films, was on the same level as the adult film industry, an industry where people film others people involving non-stimulated sexual acts and situations for eroticism. The idea alone should warn you about how badly the idea for this film is conceived. It is not helped by the lack of plot, character, acting, direction, script, logic, theme or even sound design. This is an extraordinarily boring film that has never caught my eye. Literally nothing works. Why does a mysterious thriller about the porn industry involving murderers and betrayals still work? I don't have much interest in adult films, but I've certainly seen them before. Why would anyone make a film about the ills of it and do it in a sequel to a movie about snuff movies? I don't even know if there's an industry involved in snuff film production, but I hope it's not. The idea of ​​a snuff movie alone is horrible and only the really sick and sick people will be part of it. I don't think the adult film industry revolves around murder and torture. I'm pretty sure many people make pornographic films for good intentions rather than hurting and killing people. It is never right to hurt another human being. The adult film industry is not about hurting people. It's about creating films that are, for me, a diversion and a waste of time. What is this film trying to say? Does not work
