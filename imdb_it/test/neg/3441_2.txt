These writers are trying to recreate the characters they have on "scrubs" in a different occupation, but the characters with whom they are blocked have no charisma or acting ability, not to mention the writing seems poor and effortless. These guys are trying to create something that would be nice if the writing wasn't so disgusting that it's leaving the shows only the lifeline of being two attractive teachers who barely keep it alive. The humor in this show seems to try to address an audience with an I.Q. of 40 or less. Another reason why this show is becoming a failure could be that the script of the "scrub" show is excellent and this show has to follow it leaving the viewer in a strange position without knowing whether to cry or lose hope in the new sitcoms all together. This is just my opinion, but I think these guys should stop now before they humiliate themselves more than they already did.
