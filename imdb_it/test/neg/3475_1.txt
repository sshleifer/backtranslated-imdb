What a mess! Normally, when criticizing a historical film, it is always fun to highlight the inaccuracies introduced, usually added by the authors to create more "dramatic" situations. However, "Imperium: Nerone" is an entire type of pet. In this film we try to find ANY thing that is confirmed by the historical record in the midst of the waste of nonsense and fiction presented as the life of the bad Roman artist-emperor. <br /> <br /> And it's a pity, because Nero is one of the most fascinating of all the Roman emperors. His life has been full of tumultuous events and interesting people to make a really beautiful film. The producers of this mess have chosen another path, which only leads to scratching their heads from any informed spectator. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: <br /> <br /> 1. Nero is depicted as a child of 6-8 years old when Caligula has his father killed for treason, exiles his mother Agrippina and sends the boy to be raised by slaves in the countryside. "Ten years later", the story resumes just before the assassination of Caligula. Facts: Nero was born about six months after Caligula began his four-year reign, and was only three years old when he was assassinated; Nero's father died of natural causes; Agrippina was briefly banished for bad behavior, not for treason; and Nero had not grown up among the slaves, but he had the typical education of a young member of the imperial family. <br /> <br /> 2. Okay, according to the writers, Nero is now around the age of 16 when his great uncle Claudio becomes emperor (in fact he was about to take the 4th place); Agrippina engages the ruin of Empress Messalina and marries Claudius, who adopts Nero. So he sets out to conquer Great Britain and is poisoned by Agrippina immediately after his victorious return. Nero is declared emperor, although he is still only 18 or 19 years old. Fact: Claudius conquered Britain in 43 AD, two years after he began his reign. He lived until 54 AD Nero was supposed to be 31 by now from any normal chronology, but in reality he succeeded to the throne at the age of 16 years. <br /> <br /> History tells us that then followed the "Five Good Years" ", where Nero wisely and well governed under the tutelage of the philosopher Seneca and the commander Pretorio Burrus. This is shown - a kind of - except that the portrait of the Roman Senate in contrast to Nero's good measures is false: the senatorial opposition to Nero began only when it began to show signs of madness and began to kill the senators for real or imaginary treason. /> 3. Nero's mother, Agrippina, is the dominant species, who killed her husband-uncle to become his emperor son. After a while, Nero gets tired of his interference and decides to kill her. "Tigellinus henchman stabbing her to death. All quite true, but the reality was much better! Agrippina was a survivor and did not go easily." Nero tried three times to poison her, but as an old poisoner she herself was an expert in all this, and failed. Then he tried to crush Arla to death, causing the ceiling of his bedroom to collapse, but even that failed. Later, he sent her on a journey on a ship that was deliberately built to collapse and sink; as he went down, he jumped into the sea and swam to the shore. In the end, he stabbed her to death. Now show everything that would surely have improved this movie! <br /> <br /> Other errors abound: the lover of Nero Acte was not a childhood slave, he never repudiated him, and there is no evidence that she became a Christian. Nero did not commit suicide by cutting his wrists while sitting next to a lake. Etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> The sources of Nero's life are mainly Roman historians Tacitus and Suetonius, both of the senatorial class hostile to him and to his memory. But the evidence indicates that it remained very popular among ordinary people, unlike one of the final scenes in which it is targeted by the crowd with vegetables as it leaves the city to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> WHY did the writers and the producers take an intrinsically interesting story with a lot of good stuff for any movie, and do this piece of shit? Oh, and did I mention that sets and costumes were trivial? Lol. <br /> <br /> A star, because there is no way to evaluate it lower.
