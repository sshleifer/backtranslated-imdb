This film was a great disappointment. The plot sounded great, about a creature half human and half leopard in Africa that becomes the subject of a documentary of young American adults. When many of the crew members are found dead, the 2 survivors are interrogated. I wouldn't even call it a horror movie, since most of the film is about the (mis) adventures of the aforementioned, narcissistic twenty-year-olds, who include sex and animal dung smoking to grow tall (it's not as funny as it sounds - trust myself). You rarely see the creature, and the main actor (who is also the director, screenwriter, editor and producer!) Is incredibly annoying. <br /> <br /> I was finally so annoyed by the never ending that I quickly forwarded to the end. I had guessed the ending in less than 10 minutes in the movie ... and I was right. So this terrible movie is also predictable - as if it wasn't bad enough. Moral of the plot: avoid films that are recited, directed, modified, produced and written by anyone. And avoid this movie, unless it's kept under fire.
