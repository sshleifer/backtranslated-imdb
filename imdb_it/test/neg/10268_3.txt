Everything that made the original so funny seems to be absent here. This is simply a "run of the mill demons on the destruction of destruction", but without the passion that has embellished the original. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in history, in fact it seems that they ignore the first of all. Here, the demons go wild in a high-security apartment building and, of course, they kill most of the inhabitants horribly. The effects of makeup actually seem less convincing than the first time. Although the actors weren't exactly brilliant in Demons, in Demons 2 they are actually much worse. You don't care about these characters, EVERYONE. The plot is non-existent, poor music (apart from a song by Simon Boswell), is not at all scary; it's not so nice. <br /> <br /> Easily the worst film by Dario Argento was also involved with Lamberto Bava (Bava has a cameo in this film, not very funny). <br /> <br /> Maybe 3 is too high a score, but at least I could look at everything and didn't think I'd stop halfway. My advice; Follow the original.
