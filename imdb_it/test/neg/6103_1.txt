<br /> <br /> This film is best enjoyed by a wide audience with convulsions. <br /> <br /> Very often the characters of KADOSH are seen looking intently at nothing. Very intense, very thoughtful, very serious unhappy faces. During these moments there is a music with a very serious sound only to make sure that the spectator realizes that the scene you are watching is not about fun and games. <br /> <br /> The funniest parts of this film rank among the many thoughtful stars. We learn that the women of the KADOSH community have two duties. One is to raise as many male children as possible for their husbands. The second is to remain employed so as to free their husbands from having to work. What do these men do with their ample free time? They pray And we learn that at home they pray aloud: "Thank you for not having created me as a woman". And at their place of worship they pray to thank for possessing functioning male genitals. <br /> <br /> Along with prayer there are many scenes of delirious delirium, screams and endless rocking and bodies that swing back and forth, and mixed with everything are many intricate and bizarre ritualistic activities (or simple but equally strange) . <br /> <br /> The cream of involuntary comedy comes from sex. The image of a hot and annoyed man actively exchanging bodily fluids with his wife in bed while trying to prevent the beanie from falling from his scalp is unforgettable! <br /> <br /> Every sex scene is fun, but one that stands out is when a husband rubs his face against the feet of his beautiful wife (YaÃ«l Abecassis). Oh yes, we are finally entering the land of sensuality ... but NO! The rubbing of the feet stops before something happens and the husband starts his autistic-looking head, swinging and the body swaying to the end of the scene! <br /> <br /> There are three attractive females in a state of near stripping, however KADOSH contains absolutely no nudity. Technically, there are some interesting images and pleasant uses of lights and colors by the director. <br /> <br /> For a more credible, educational and entertaining treatment of the condition of being a dirty female unworthy of holding a book in a world where respect is measured by the speed with which a man can quote a phrase from ancient writings, I suggest YENB by Barbra Streisand. <br /> <br />
