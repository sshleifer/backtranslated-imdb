Allow me to get him out of the way before he takes down this movie: I love Park Chan-Wook's work as a director. While I disagree with the masses who say he is the best director working in our time, I can't deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. I really enjoyed one of his other films, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Also, the acting of Min-sik Choi was the only thing that allowed me to take this movie seriously. . . for 1/5 of the execution time, ie. <br /> <br /> Now the evil: the plot is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema / literature. I'll never understand how critics can destroy a Hollywood blockbuster to be clichés, so hail movies like Oldboy that are just as unoriginal and obvious if they aren't even more so. Regardless, Oldboy is one of the most generic and non-original films ever conceived. * Spoiler * The man is held captive, the man seeks revenge, the man discovers that he had sex with a member of the family, the life of the man is over. * End spoiler * In a nutshell, this plot has been used in everything from Greek representations to modern melodrama soap operas and countless films / books in between. It is so melodramatic and not very original when the major revelation occurs, I laughed loudly. Does it mean that I am a desensitized fanatic without emotions as some reviews of this film say about people like me? No. What it means is excessive plots make people laugh. The Scary Movie franchise proved it, and Oldboy also proved it. Why can't people think of something that is really disturbing instead of throwing up only proven clichés masked by fanciful works of shooting and classical music? This raises the question of blood / cold blood. Simply put, it's not there. The director is too shy to point the camera at the screen when something "bloody" happens, as if we were watching a children's movie or something. Maybe we were. Anyway, I heard that Oldboy called the "most brutal movie of all time" and "the most disturbing movie ever" but when I saw it I saw NO even remotely bloody or disturbing. All the "gore" is off the screen, and even then the level of violence is nothing you haven't seen before in PG-13 movies like the Dark Knight or Casino Royale. Because this has also achieved an R-rating, it confuses me, much less "the most brutal film of all time". Seriously, I've seen movies that make Oldboy look pretty at every level when it comes to violence / blood. <br /> <br /> The other huge faulty facade is the main villain. Most of his time on the screen is showing his bare ass to the American Pie-style comedian, but should I think it's oh-so-bad? When he wears clothes, his hair is combed back like a bad Asian mix of rude James Bond, mixed with something from Austin Powers. He talks like a brain-dead teenager recovering from an acid overdose, and his dialogue is so bad that it made me laugh once again. Seriously, Oldboy made me laugh more than any comedy this year. . . <br /> <br /> In the end, Oldboy is for those of you who sip good wine, don't have a sense of humor and talk about how boring your lives are during dinner parties. It is for those people who are so stuck in their ego that they have forgotten how unoriginal they are, and consequently have forgotten how original and boring the "movies" (never "movies") they enjoy. <br /> <br /> Those people I can say is this: I like "movies" and even "movies". I like reflective dramas that actually say something about the human condition, and I also like useless action movies that excite me in a coma. But the fact is that for me I like both "film" and "film", they must be original. They must be something I haven't seen so many times that I've lost count of the number of times the plot has been used. When something is not original, it is expendable. If it does exactly what everyone does, it's boring and boring. Before giving Oldboy another perfect evaluation because he has "touched" you, maybe you should think of something: a film would not be as touching, but at the same time original will make you think more? I just hope someone other than me can understand this. <br /> <br /> Overall: Oldboy is forgettable and cheese. <br /> <br /> 1/10
