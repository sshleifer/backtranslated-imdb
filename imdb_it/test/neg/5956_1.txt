Where do I start? The box should have been enough to keep me away from this attempt, but I was soon taught not to judge a book (or a movie) by the cover, so I ignored the disgusting graphic quality of the box and rented it anyway. But common sense should tell you that if they can't make a single, fixed image correctly, then how dark are the moving ones later? Yes. They were pretty awful. <br /> <br /> The actors in this film appeared totally unaware that they had been filmed, since any expression seemed to fit, regardless of the situation the characters were in or what they were reacting to. <br /> <br /> However, a good story can make up for the drop in low budget productions. A good dialogue can sometimes lead to a poorly funded attempt. Unfortunately, this was not one of those times, because the story was weak and non-existent, while the other required good cinema elements. <br /> <br /> There are simply no words for how bad it was. <br /> <br /> Maybe you can get the idea from my evaluation of -2.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
