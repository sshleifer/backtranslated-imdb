I expected a lot more than this film compared to what I actually got. The acting was horrible on everyone's part and the story was far from impressive. It took a lot of things that I didn't even follow for what was happening because he was so nervous. An example of acting is when Paxton's character, Vann, is shocked by the colonel in South Vietnam, so he throws some sand from the "sand map". It was impossible to get an idea of ​​what he felt and his actions were robotic. To make matters worse, I have no idea what I should try for Vann. He is obviously presented as the protagonist, but as soon as he arrives in Vietnam he begins a relationship with a teacher of English Vietnamese. The only thing the film had to do was that it wasn't particularly boring. I give him 4 out of 10 stars.
