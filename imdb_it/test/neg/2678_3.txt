Scanning through the comments, there doesn't seem to be much love for this film, and it's not very difficult to understand why, it's rubbish. <br /> <br /> Now, I'll start by saying that it's over the product has been damaged, in many ways, since the death of Donald Pleasance (Dr Loomis) in post production. This required a new jigging of the film's conclusions with Loomis who bought the farm and took away what should have been a double spin at the end with Michael swapping places with the mysterious "Man in black" and I don't mean Johnny Cash. /> <br /> Now to the story. The fifth film ended quite unsatisfactorily with Michael Myers escaping from prison with the mysterious man in black. It turns out (well) that this man knows the origin of Michael's illness and is also a colleague of Dr. Loomis named Dr Wynn. They also kidnapped Jamie Lloyd (played by Danielle Harris in parts 4 and 5, but played here by JC Brandy). Jamie, pregnant, runs away from Dr. Wynn's lair and so Michael follows her and kills her. But she had had the baby so now she needs to track down the baby so she can kill her great-grandson. <br /> <br /> We hear a ridiculous explanation of Micheal's evil involving Gaelic curses on bloodlines and mysterious symbols. A radio show is broadcast from Micheal's hometown for some reason, which gives Michael some more unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> In the end the film, just like this review, is vague, confused and without direction with a very anticlimatic ending. <br /> <br /> Some scenes of sex and nudity. Bad plot, passable effects, with some good run of the wrecker, kills, but seriously lacking in motivation. For what he had to explain everything, this raised some new questions, made parts 4 and 5 useless and it was a bad way for a great actor in Pleasance to end his life and his career.
