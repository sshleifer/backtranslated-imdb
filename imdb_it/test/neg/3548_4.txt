Normally I don't try to imagine a thriller, but Cleaner was completely too predictable. Samuel L. Jackson playing the character Tom Cutler, along with his profession, created an interesting twist at the beginning of the film, however, it was just like that. Without even thinking about it, I knew where the plot would be taken and in 30 minutes I already knew who the murderer was. Rather then trusting in myself and having seen several films that turn around, I saw its completion. What a disappointment, I was right from the start. <br /> <br /> The casting of characters was good, as was the acting of Jackson and Harris ... except Eva Mendes. From the starting gate he didn't play a believable character in correlation with the script and this ruined the whole plot too soon. Perhaps this was a setback to directing or just a weakness in the story itself. Her role as Ann Norcut should have shown more emotion and anxiety about the situation that was growing around her. This would have made the build-up a little more compelling and the ending more dramatic. However, Cleaner is watchable, not storable. I have seen episodes of CSI that were more exciting than this.
