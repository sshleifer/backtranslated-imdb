I really liked the "Candid camera" with Dom DeLuise and I was surprised to see that, over the years, Suzanne Somers became the co-star of the show. But that was the only positive side of the show - the whole study, the introduction, the hosts - everything that gives the new meaning to the word "pompous". <br /> <br /> Well, it would be OK if the materials weren't so chronic - I mean, come on, the best you can do is show some men who have trouble taking ketchup from the bottle, Suzanne Somers walking with the Halloween basket in July, the place of ice cream that only sells vanilla ...? I saw some episodes and it was horrible every time. They were posing as if it was the greatest show ever and then filled the time with such boring scenes that I felt really embarrassed to watch. Even the people in them seemed bored and this can't be good.
