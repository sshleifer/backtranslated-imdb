This film is about a depressed and emotionally limited man who has a distant relationship with him in his apartment in Istanbul. As time goes by, their relationship becomes more and more tense until they finally start screaming at his home guest - who is out of work and doesn't seem eager to find work. This is most of the film, in fact. The problem is that even though emotionally and depressed people are VERY withdrawn and non-communicative, they are not a very satisfying film. This is because most of the time he (and his roommate) stares into space and says nothing. I think all these plan moments could have been shortened to make a 30 minute movie - I certainly wouldn't have worried.
