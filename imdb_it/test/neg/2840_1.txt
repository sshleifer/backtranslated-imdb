Lisa Grant (Adrienne Barbeau) is a real estate agent who is in danger of being killed by a deranged maniac who kills people in his profession who feel that house prices are too high. As reasons, this is pretty damn retarded. Lisa's boyfriend appears to be a talk show host that the killer continues to call on the air. In the beginning I was positive that this was a comedy or a satire of some kind, but while the endless minutes kept buzzing, I realized that it wasn't like that and the film was simply grossly incompetent in every way, form and form. I'm just surprised that some of this horrible was not directed by Jeff Lieberman (yes, send me an email again hate him, Jeff you hacker) Anyway, back to the movie, poor, poor Barbeau, you can EXACTLY identify when his film career is went up in flames and it all started here. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: The Movie Channel
