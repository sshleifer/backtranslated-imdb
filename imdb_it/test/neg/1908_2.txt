All I have to say is one word ... JUICES !!!! The only reason I gave this 2 is because Josh Hartnett was in and he is handsome. He should have beaten that boy Klein ... stupid, stupid and mindless. At the end of this film you can't stand Klein and you really don't care what happens to Leelee. Hartnett was the only good thing about it.
