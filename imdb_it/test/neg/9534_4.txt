What a waste of talent - even if it seems that Crudup in real life is much more similar to the insipid, self-absorbed and characterless character he plays in this disappointing film. <br /> <br /> In art, sometimes empty spaces reveal more than painted or created content. What this film reveals is the inconsistency and the contradictory / competing, unresolved impulses / consciousness of the film director / writer. Involuntarily shows the LACK of awareness that a truly evolved and deeply aware character should have and torment himself to deserve the empathy or sympathy of the public OR whose lack is used to serve as a warning to the public. But this film fails on both levels in this regard. <br /> <br /> The fact that Cal, the main character (very much an antagonist, not a protagonist in the true sense of the word), has no empathy for anyone, especially the most deserving ones (who DO NOT include him) and who has a compassion so exaggerated, authoritarian, self-pity, whimpering only for itself, combined with lack of remorse and guilt or awareness of its impact on others - all converge in this film to make it the epitome of self-engaging sociopath, arrested by development and narcissistic - somehow this is now the gold standard for males on the cinema and in the world at this moment and moment. <br /> <br /> One of his counterpoints (James LeGros) states with a true laser flash: "I bet you didn't do a good thing in life - and I bet you won't." Capture the absolute essence of the character Cal. Something that the other characters who made bulldozers in the film seem to realize quite quickly even though the director has stacked the deck to manipulate the sympathy for Cal. This is a testament to the talent and capabilities of the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> The "return" of Cal has nothing to do with character development, transformation or evolution of consciousness. It has only to do with the definitive capitulation that until something better arrives, could also return to its comfortable and welcoming status quo of qualification entitled where life is easy and no one will ask for it to grow - something of which it is intentionally incapable and disinterested in doing. <br /> <br /> The film could have been indicative and intentional in showing the traps and tragedies - the devastating effects of this type of lack of conscience / conscience, but excuses and glorifies it instead - in fact, it bends in the self-pity together with the arrogant, selfish and emotionally rickety main character. <br /> <br /> (and it sure made me shudder when I think of the recent revelations about the doomed murderer Scott Peterson). <br /> <br /> If you want to see Crudup in its most nuanced and full of exciting potential that has never really been realized in my opinion, look at the underrated "Inventing the Abbotts". ...
