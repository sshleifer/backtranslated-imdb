The Brave One seems to indicate that the main character is obviously brave. I wouldn't agree. The bravest thing to do in a situation like the one that happens to her - brutally beaten with her girlfriend who doesn't live another day from it - is to chase criminals without resorting to a distorted view of society. The character of Jodie Foster, Erica, is a radio personality who is a niche that walks the streets and records what happens. We are not given a real depth "he had a person he loved, he died, the police do not pursue it, she takes a gun, yada-yada-yada, she gets a little but is not really involved in the main detective" in the character, and so they were left with something leftover from films of the past: the code of vigilance of justice, where taking power in one's own hands is all there is. But we are never too sure if Erica is healthy or not, if the filmmakers take a position in one way or another (ie until the end, which is such a stupid message to carry anyway, dog included as overbearing metaphor), while she is making the city of New York today, which has become significantly safer than, say, twenty years ago, it seems you can be stabbed or beaten if you go down the right alley or sit alone on a subway car. <br /> <br /> There may even be a slightly better film in the middle of it all - perhaps only in the undercooked sub-plot with Terence Howard's detective, who is involved in a custody battle of a child who does not is his and a woman who is not connected to a stepfather and I do not know, apart from the fact of owning parking lots and being a bad guy, but we are left with a script that is both frenetic and broken by logic. It becomes ridiculous, for example, to see that at first Erica's logical side is not able to resume correctly, as seen in her first snapshot in a minimarket at the opportune moment of a robbery of a wife by her husband - and then giving way to the illogical of his crack-shot when he was shooting a pimp who was driving the car towards her and killing him and lowering himself just in time to avoid being hit. It doesn't help Jordon's style with the camera to become a little more unbearable: it's called stedi-cam for a * reason *, not because it can come and go. <br /> <br /> Ironically, script and direction become very good, or rather they work at their best in the desired circumstances: when they look at the real barrel scene under the bridge, caught between a video-recorded viewpoint from one of the criminals from the normal cam of the film in a rhythm that is perfectly confusing. And when Erica returns for the first time on her radio show, and stops trying to do her old shtick, and speaks "from the heart" of how scared she is - this scene, from Foster's performance, to the clear direction and screenplay, is the best scene in the film. But apart from that, there is only a lot of attitudes in a fragile psychology: is it a De Niro in Taxi Driver or a Bronson in Death Desiderio? We have his own narrative on the scenes, some of which absolutely must not do anything with his radio program, observing how disgusted he is in walking at night, nothing to do but his self-imposed task of cleaning up the streets. But unlike Death Wish, a film that contained more ambiguity and never had a response in the end in a revenge scenario, the path of infinite violence simply listens to a message, which will not be new to anyone who has seen a second of Lifetime the melodrama of the film of the week. <br /> <br /> Actors make do with what is given, and in the end it becomes much more frustrating to try to stay with the expected, trite plot and the old unexplainable plan (more unwittingly hilarious, like some imprecations shouted by Howard after shooting in a scene), and the temptation to go out becomes stronger and stronger. It is a very problematic picture, with only a few moments of genuine interest and a clear bending of the convention.
