Normally Jane Austen's BBC productions are pretty good, but Northanger Abbey is just plain strange. What were they thinking? This film has little of Austen's charm and ironically mimics the gothic novels that Austen wonderfully laughed at. Not only that, the "gothic" sequences are tacky, exaggerated and frankly stupid. The actress who plays Miss Morland is poorly launched without an obvious appeal to attract the attention of a qualified bachelor, and although I rather liked the creepy Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, it's not like the novel, even when it presents the dialogue directly from the book. Robert Hardy in the role of General Tilney has turned into one of his terribly "ham" shows. This film was so bizarre and strange that I actually looked at it again just to savor how terribly wrong it was.
