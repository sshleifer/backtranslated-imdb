The animation is great, I will grant. But Disney has perpetuated every stereotype that we in Alaska have tried to overcome in the last two generations. And the names, I mean, let's go ... Sitka, Kenai, Tanana and Denahi (Denali take-off) ?! Those are real places where real people live! And the real people that these real places are named after are probably coming out of Earth to take revenge on this little movie. Disney, you're based outside California and Florida, in the rest of the states that still treat us like a foreign country. If you can't stay true to what you know, at least rent and / or work with people who know which area you're trying to charge. Maybe then it wouldn't be so offensive! :(
