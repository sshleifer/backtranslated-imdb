How can I get a 6.0 rating? We are like horror fans so used to horror movies that they are so terribly bad these days, that when one comes up with some, and I repeat 'just a little', redeeming quality, we get too excited and give an assessment that is just a little too high? The director has a certain visual style. No doubt about it. But among some decent shots he has forgotten a good story, mood or fear. He had a very slow first act, scenes of homicidal madness, annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and incredibly incredible turn. And what is the portrait of American teenagers in so many of these films? They must always be so stupid, irritating and so superficial. I don't remember the boys being like that when I grew up here in Holland. All in all, I can't give this film anything more than a 4 out of 10 rating.
