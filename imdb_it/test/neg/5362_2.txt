I give this nonsense to 2 instead of 1 because there is a worse show called Haunted Homes. But this boy and his friends conduct their investigations as total idiots. They assume that there are ghosts from the beginning and, if they ever find rational explanations behind the experiences, they will have to be drugged and screaming to admit it. But beyond that, the whole format of the show is incredibly annoying. Although many seem to be scripted, the college-educated boys who form the cast can barely speak English, but still insist on trying to use "big" words that they obviously don't understand. And the chief investigator Ryan, his ridiculously self-important voiceover, makes me want to throw the TV through the window. (and he always seems stoned). In short, this group makes TAPS guys look like Ghost Hunters from MIT scientists!
