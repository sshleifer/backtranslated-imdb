** Possible spoilers ** From Dreamworks and director Peter Chan, "The Love Letter" is a romantic comedy that takes place in a picturesque coastal village in New England where single mother Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a small picturesque library. One day at work, Helen comes across an anonymous letter (the "love letter" of the title) that somehow was housed under the cushions of a reading sofa. Reading the amorous prose in it, she believes that it was written to her, specially placed on the sofa for her to find, and, for her reasons, she thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer. Inadvertently, however, Helen leaves the letter where her employee, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds it, believes it is for her, and, of course, thinks she knows who wrote it. The circumstances then bring him into the possession of a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), who thinks that Helen wrote him the letter. And before everything is resolved, you can only imagine the hilarious situations in which all those involved were expressed; and I intend to imagine, because the way in which this film takes place, the audience gets a little more than what it brings. There are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy fails miserably: it's simply not very romantic, and it's not funny; and this is a powerful combination that makes this movie virtually fake from the opening credits. Once the setup and the main character (Helen) have been established, in practice it doesn't go anywhere for the next ninety minutes or so. When you finally find out who actually wrote the letter and to whom, you might be less interested. Rounding out the cast are Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Julianne Nicholson, Gloria Stuart and Geraldine McEwan. It is a pity to see such talent wasted in such a joke like this, and in bad shape in the balance. Kate Capshaw, who usually illuminates the screen only by introducing himself, seems tired here, while Selleck seems to have just come out of a week-long three-day bender. Ellen DeGeneres actually comes off looking for the best of the group. It is said that travel is often a more intoxicating experience than the destination. In the case of "The Love Letter", however, it would have been better for all concerned if everyone had just come home first. I consider this 1/10.
