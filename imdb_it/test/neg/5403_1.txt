As a useful warning to others, I believe "Skeleton Man" is actually worse than "Raptor Island". I used RI as an example of the worst original film presented on the Sci-Fi channel, but SM is the most ridiculous incoherent and wretched film I've ever seen. Yes, I watched almost everything, entering it for about 35 minutes. It attracted me with its pure ineptitude. What was science fiction thinking? Once Skeleton Man and the leader of the surviving platoon (or whatever it was - I'm not good with the terminology of military units) reached the chemical plant, the film moved into an area of ​​impossible absurdity that was almost mesmerizing. I had the same idea of ​​another spectator who wondered if more than one film had been modified by someone to create a terrible whole.
