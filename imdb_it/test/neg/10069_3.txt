<br /> <br /> JURASSIC PARK III * ___ Adventure <br /> <br /> Sam Nell (The pot), William Macy (Happy Texas, Fargo), TZ (a Lion (Family Man) <br /> <br /> A better title would be: ESCAPING FROM THE ISLAND OF REALLY DEDICATED DINOSAURS, but then nobody would have needed to see the movie: in this sequel, a group of beggars visit the dinosaur island to save the teenager victim of hang glider incident. <br /> <br /> ACCESS HOLLYWOOD reports that JP3 started filming without a complete script, which explains why the film seems to have little or no other purpose than to show the progress of special effects Of course, there are some clever scenes and some moderately fun parts, but no significant plot to tie them together. JP3 puppets and dinosaur animation are very good to excellent and more numerous than ever. can compare with the original J URASSIC PARK or even with JP2. <br /> <br /> JP3 is a merciful 90 minutes - the last 10 minutes of which it is credible. Even so, I often found myself checking my wristwatch. The audience with whom I saw him left the theater in silence. <br /> <br /> A better bet: watch the film LEGALLY BLOND. <br /> <br /> Dave
