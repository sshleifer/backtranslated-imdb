This is undoubtedly the most ill-conceived film in history. Carrot Top's inventions are some of the most terrible attempts to be fun in history. I'm not familiar with his other job, but if it's half that bad, then I'll cry. I give this film 1 in 30 billion stars, and may God have mercy on the souls of those responsible.
