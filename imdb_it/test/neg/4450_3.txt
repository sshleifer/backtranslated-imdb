I just saw that movie and I was pretty disappointed. I did not expect much at the beginning, as the premise of the film does not suggest size however. Unfortunately, it is not even able to offer an equally stupid show. The main problem is probably acting. While I've seen much worse actors in much worse films, the story would have required some people to behave like violent maniacs, others while people were in a really stressful situation, and they couldn't. Even though I saw the German version, I watched with the original audio, so it's not just bad voices or stuff like that. Furthermore, the German version of the DVD seems to be cut, the murders are practically all left out, which means that, except for some semi-garde scenes closer to the end, the German version does not provide a film for "gore-hounds" , be it. I can't comment on this for other versions, of course. The plot has some stupid moments thrown here and there and the beginning is simply hilarious (never heard of a demon visiting a psychiatrist?). Too bad the film is too serious, if it was shot as a horror comedy and changed a little here and there and could have worked better. The ending is just a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> If you really have nothing better to do and you can't stand the boredom you could (and it's really a weak "power") consider this movie. If there is anything else to see or do: choose the alternative one.
