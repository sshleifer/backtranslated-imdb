Honestly, I met the real Han Su Ying and saw her played by an American actress who bears no resemblance to something Chinese that makes my head spin while I watch this movie. Why can't Hollywood get Nancy Kwan instead? at least he is more faithful to history ... for God's sake ... Dr Han Su Ying is Chinese I know I met you in person <br /> <br /> and watching the whole cast .... so few Asians the faces of a film about an Asian love story also amaze me <br /> <br /> I think acting is good, but without authentic Asian faces in an Asian love story makes the plot like this corny and a whole load of Baloney <br /> <br /> is just like another movie I know of "THE CONQUEROR" I guess my eyes pop out when I see John Wayne as Genghis Khan !!!!! <br /> <br /> and that makes it worse. ... why a man born in the MONGOLIAN STEPPES breed has a southern Alabama accent ??? !! and an economic imitation of anything Asian <br /> <br /> Good Grief <br /> <br /> I am not surprised that one day I will see Dr Martin Luther King Jr played by One of the black guys and minstrel show < br /> <br /> I'd like to see it <br /> <br /> and laugh all round !!! <br /> <br /> Cheers
