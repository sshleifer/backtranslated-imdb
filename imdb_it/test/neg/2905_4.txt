You know, after the first films of Chuck Norris, I managed to understand that a movie was produced by Golan-Globus even though I tuned myself in the middle, without ever looking at the credits or the title. Also, I could tell it was Golan-Globus within a minute of the screen's time. Something about the structure of history, the silly relationships between the characters, the polite dialogue, the acting in wood (enriched with occasional terrible performances), the times and the rhythms of the scene that made Albert Pyun look like John McTiernan, the very fine plots and choreography of struggle not ready for the early evening ... Golan-Globus has been incredibly consistent over the years in terms of style, subject and point of view. <br /> <br /> What can you say? must work for them, since they have produced literally dozens of films. Go to one of their productions and you know exactly what you're getting. And it's not brain food, folks. <br /> <br /> "Ninja 3" is another piece of hackwork in a long line of GG delicatessen products, and offers the typical pleasures limited to film-goers' palates. You have a Bad Ninja, it affects policemen and criminals and anyone who gets in their way. You have a good ninja, busy stopping him. You have a Westerner thrown into the mix so that we Americans can identify with him (or her in this case) and be reassured by the fact that "We can still beat those pesky Orientals in their own game." You have a love interest (which is usually the worst actor / actor in the film) fencing with the hero. You have an endless series of assaults, murders and persistent blows of men who gurgle in agony while an arrow or a thrown star slips unconvincingly out of their eye, neck or chest. You have your Beefy White Guy / Bodyguards in Suit that calls a Ninja a 'Son of A B * tch' and throws a punch at the roundhouse, just to get his * ss handed over to him. You have a final confrontation between the good guy and the bad guy that lasts for 20 minutes and stops like a RoadRunner cartoon instead of reaching a climax or a resolution. <br /> <br /> Ninja 3 is a little different, as the plot revolves around a scrappy female athletic type who is possessed by Bad Ninja, so she ends up killing a lot of cops and criminals and Beefy White Bodyguards in Suits while under her spell. But all the other elements are there, as formal as a Kabuki comedy or a Noh play. <br /> <br /> Actually I thought that Lucinda Dickey was quite nice in this movie. She is very muscular and shapely, has great cheekbones and some athletic "ooomphs" for her movements, and you can actually suspend the creed enough to accept that her character can do some of the feats she does in the movie. You can almost, but not completely, bring this thing. An extra start for his participation and good energy. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sho Kusugi is here, and practically dominates the last 10-15 minutes of the film. And just to show you how third-grade and uninspired GG movies are, the director and editor interrupted the last fight between Kosugi and the Bad Ninja scene with numerous reaction shots by Dickey and her boyfriend watching the battle of life and death with an expression of bland fun. I'm serious ... for all the emotions and reactions they show at the procedure, they could be looking at a sea turtle in an aquarium at Marineland. I can only imagine how Dickey must have felt when he saw the finished product - he probably wanted to run the editor with a katana for real because those reactions make it look like a complete idiot. <br /> <br /> A pleasant waste of time ... but it's definitely a waste of time. Perhaps if you are a fan of Sho Kusugi, or even a fan of Linda Dickey, you would find it worth it.
