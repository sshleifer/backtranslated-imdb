This is one of the most horrible "scary" movies I've seen for a while. I had to wonder if John Ryhs-Davies was just bored and wanted a distraction to make this film. The Chupacabra looked like a cross between the Sleetaks of Land of the Lost and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Also they should have used someone who was a little smaller as the Chupacabra of the legend is much smaller. All in all, however, the film was so bad that it was fun. Why can't bullets and electrocution stop the Chupacabra, but the kick boxing captain's daughter is doing well? See if you are sick at home or you feel down and need a good laugh.
