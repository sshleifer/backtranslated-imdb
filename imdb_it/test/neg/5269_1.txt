"Ordinary Decent Criminal" is based on the exploits of Martin Cahill, formerly the subject of John Boorman's 1998 film "The General". Cahill had a rough education in a degraded area and graduated from petty crime to armed robbery with honor. He justified his criminal career by emphasizing his lack of experience on every occasion. This is a common excuse for criminals who conveniently neglects the thousands of slum dwellers who do not turn to post offices by robbing and selling weapons to make ends meet. Cahill made fun of the police and local authorities, not to mention the IRA, which earned him some sort of "folk hero" status and made him many enemies. However, he was basically an amoral and autonomous thief. <br /> <br /> My main problem with "ODC" is that the main character is meant to be a lovable Irish thief. Kevin Spacey does a good job interpreting Michael Lynch with a mixture of oily charm and quiet threat, but the character is too amoral and selfish to be seen as a sort of hero, even an antihero. <br /> <br /> The film is well shot and performed by a refined cast, but what disappoints is the script. The writer Gerard Stembridge fails to make a decision; Are you writing an Irish "Lock Stock" or a more petty treatment of Martin Cahill's career as a thief? This is the problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person. <br /> <br /> It is also a pity that "ODC" has followed the film release of "The General" by John Boorman, which was a more accurate portrait of Martin Cahill's story. Cahill was a clever thief who knew the value of good publicity, so it's not surprising that his exploits got film treatment. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is that a studio was ready to take Cahill's story and give it a happy Hollywood-style ending. The charismatic-whining slayer Michael Lynch, Kevin Spacey, rides anonymity with his bike in "ODC". In the real world, Martin Cahill was executed by the IRA, only to show that no one becomes stupid from an obsolete, sectarian and corrupt paramilitary organization and gets along. <br /> <br /> The real Cahill would never have departed from his fame because he supported his image of "Man of The People". Having Michael Lynch give up everything to avoid death in "ODC" is a cop-out that ends with a weak and superficial film.
