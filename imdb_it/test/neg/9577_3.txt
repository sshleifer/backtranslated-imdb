This Italian-Spanish co-production tells an interesting and bizarre story about Dr. Bannister, a woman who not only has the best years behind her, but also has a scarred face that makes her look like a monster. But in Madrid, a professor who knows has conducted some experiments on animals with a substance that regenerates cells. The experiments were successful, but the animals became aggressive. Because the professor will not allow Dr. Bannister to be the first human guinea pig, she kills him and consumes the substance. She becomes a beautiful young woman, but also a vicious killer when it comes to keeping her secret a secret. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is a lot of fun, but Piero Vivarelli didn't have enough skill and money to make a good movie out of it. Furthermore, the film becomes boring after a good start and fails to recover a fast pace even though the film's execution time does not exceed 83 minutes. And while the setting changes in the Swiss city of Geneva for the last third of the film, sometimes it even looks like a holiday movie, since we see how beautiful Ginevra is (which it really is), but it doesn't help to push the plot forward . ..). So, with a more talented director, better actors and a bigger budget, "Satanik" could have become an obscure Italian classic. But, as it is, it's just a dull and boring criminal movie that isn't really worth looking for. Rating: 3 out of 10.
