I went to see this movie today, with the hope that it would imply at least a half-intelligent story. I was extremely disappointed, as it was not. The plot and decisions of the main character were so far-fetched. I was hoping for a "Dog Day Afternoon" movie, but instead I got something totally unacceptable. In reality I found myself totally hoping that the "hero" would be thrown down, and I almost left the theater on several occasions where this should have happened, but it wasn't. Heist films are not meant to be high-impact films, and this has tried to be just that. Every two minutes during the second half of the film, I found myself saying "no way". Without giving away the whole story, he went around an armored wheelbarrow that was financially in trouble, and whose house was being foreclosed. He was invited to do a robbery and accepted, only to retreat once the action started. Weak.
