Not to be confused as the highly publicized vehicle of Samuel L. Jackson SNAKES ON A PLANE; SNAKES ON A TRAIN is low budget, has no actors (so to speak), but some fairly decent visual effects. An attractive young woman (Julia "Rayanne" Ruiz) does not want to marry another's choice for her husband; then it is subjected to a powerful Mayan curse that opens snakes in its body, slowly devouring it from within. His only hope of survival is a shaman who lives across the Texas border. Time is running out for her; and is put on a train from El Paso to Los Angeles. In a short time the snakes are leaving his body plagued with nausea and rapidly growing in size. Passengers on the train are now trapped and soon they will be snake snacks. The final sequence is without doubt the best of this 91-minute movie. They also receive acting credits: Alby Castro, Al Galvez and Giovanni Bejarno.
