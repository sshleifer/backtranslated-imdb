As stated by others, this is a ridiculously horrible film (NOT A FILM!). It's not bad in a fun way, just painful to try to resist. Don't waste your time. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak is quite hot, but there is a scene in which she is in a bathtub, and you can see the band that covers her breasts under the bubbles. Furthermore, he is getting fat. <br /> <br /> The combat scenes are so bad that they are unwatchable, if you know or worry about martial arts, or even decent choreography, and the editing / effects are abysmal. /> <br /> There is no profit, it is not going anywhere, and it sucks to get there.
