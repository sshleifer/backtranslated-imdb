What can you say about a film that makes "The Erotic Witch Project" look like "The English Patient". Once again, the plot and characters are secondary, but the plot is almost an exact copy of "TEWP". <br /> <br /> Four prosperous sisters and a stupid male guide enter a forest to look for the naked girl, and women become sexually accused. The naked girl leaves the porn devices and an inflatable doll, just like in "TEWP". They are lost, the doofus is lost and the girls return to their hotel. There they reconstruct the end of "The Blair Witch Project", when the cameras are dropped and the guide is seen playing bell, an integral game of subtle plot. <br /> <br /> At least three of the sorority sisters here have unnaturally large breasts filled with dimples and stretch marks, along with rather obvious surgical scars. The only "natural" girl here is humiliated by the director. In an extremely unsound and prolonged credit segment, the outtake scenes in which it is not possible to obtain a correct line are reproduced over and over again until nausea. <br /> <br /> Julie Strain shows up with a fright wig to play the nude girl role. This scene seems to be added later, since no one could be credited in the cast with filming. In the background, while women scream and caress, you can see someone's fence. This could be the backyard of director Jim Wynorski. <br /> <br /> This is just a bad thing. Lesbian love scenes are kelvin cooler degrees than "The Erotic Witch Project." Most of the lovin 'is composed of the four women who crush their eight collective breasts together. I think they are trying to form a silicone-based life form that will save them from this bad career decision. It is not such a fortune. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then the creators of "The Blair Witch Project" should be really crazy. <br /> <br /> This is unrated and contains minor physical violence, strong profanity, female nudity, sexual content and sexual references. <br /> <br />
