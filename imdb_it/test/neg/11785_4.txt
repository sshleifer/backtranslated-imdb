I think Walter Pidgeon was misplaced in this film. Simply not credible in the role. Barbara Eden was beautiful and played her part quite well. No one else was memorable. <br /> <br /> I remember that the TV series came out of this movie when I was a small child. I even think I have a plastic "Seaview" that would submit and was perfect for playing in the bathtub. A long time ago. <br /> <br /> Regarding some of the other criticisms I have read about this film: it is certainly unfair to judge special effects or scientific knowledge from 4 decades ago compared to today's standards. The effects were OK for 1961. Not great, but OK. As for science, it was also ridiculous for 1961. There is no excuse. Furthermore, the diver was terribly spacious. I understand that the navy refused any help for this film, so maybe the filmmakers had no idea. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film bored me. (And I'm a fan of science fiction.) I can't recommend this. Degree: D-
