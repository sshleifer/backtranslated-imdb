I was extremely excited about this movie! my expectations were under control because I read the book before I expected any differences. what I didn't expect was how big the differences were. Beginning with the physical appearance of the characters ... like the lack of tattoos by Channing Tantums n Amanda Seyfried not being a dark lol, but I gave up ... the character's developments were not there at all ... you didn't have time for amanda sweetened character of amanda and could not be heard for her or for John when they had separated for the first time ... I thought the two weeks were hasty and I hated that she had left before him ... we needed emotional separation. .. and because they changed Tim from the book ... because they made him a dad instead of a brother and because they made him so old and the film lacked that intense moment in which they discover what happens at the end (I don't want to spoil it lol but for those who saw it know what I mean) and whhyhyyyoooo wwhyyyy changed the ending ... in the book it was heartbreaking and emotional and emphasized the Channing Tatums character's decision to have it run ... it did looking like a hasty ending ... it was terrible ... what disappointed me the most ... the end of the book should have been exactly the same :(
