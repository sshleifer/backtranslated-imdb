This was a mixture of films that started without going anywhere, got lost on the way and then suddenly found a plot in the last 5 minutes when the title character is FINALLY presented. There were so many ugly boys cut from the ram in this film, I lost track of who the owner was and who the overseers were. However, I have a casting theory; all the bad guys were played by ugly actors (and an ugly actress) and all the good guys / victims were played by beautiful actors. In fact, the actors who played the supreme victims, the slaves, were as wonderful as the daughter of the innocent priest, while the owner of the plantation, his minipartorial mistress and his overseers were rather hard on the eyes. Purposely? Make the call. <br /> <br /> I hung up to the end and others might be able to do it. If you just want to watch the naked breast, there are many here and if you have a fetishist slave / master then you will love this movie. Otherwise, watch it once, throw up, take a shower and never talk to anyone about it.
