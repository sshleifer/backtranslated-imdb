So bad, it's fun, especially during the cocktail hour, and believe me, you'll need a beer, a drink or anything else to go through this turkey. Where do they get the financial support for these "horror" films by "paint by number" numbers? The fun in this film is to predict which characters will be eaten and in what order and to throw away the so-called "uniforms" worn by the "military" jokers. The birds of prey, by the way, are not the same raptors we met in "Jurassic Park", but a kind of cousin. (Sorry, no spoilers here. You'll have to watch it to find out for yourself) Don't expect the plot to make sense, no matter how simple, go ahead for the ride. You could make it a game ... take another drink whenever you hear a certain sound ... or better yet, whenever someone is creaked by a "raptor". With a little luck, you won't even remember seeing this movie made for "C-grade" TV!
