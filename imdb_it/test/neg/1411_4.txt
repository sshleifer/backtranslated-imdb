I found this vehicle Robin Williams slightly fun at best. I imagine you would call it a political satire of sorts.it on a political / comedian who decides to run for president and unexpectedly wins. I found most of the dry humor and Robin Williams is much more sober and calm than usual. I would say that the film is more of a drama than a comedy, with a bit of mystery and suspense. I think the dramatic parts work better than the comic parts and the mystery and look of suspense (even if this is a small part of the film) worked best. Again, I wouldn't rate this film very high. For me, it was a decent waste of 2 hours, but nothing special. My best advice would be to grab it on TV / cable or hire it cheaply before deciding whether to buy. My vote for Man of The Year is a 4/10
