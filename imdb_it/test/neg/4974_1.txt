I started watching it because I was looking for a nice "background" comedy for my Sunday morning. Then I noticed that this was going to be a road movie and I decided to really watch it. <br /> <br /> The first 15 minutes were horrible, but I wanted to give a chance, because I never judge a film without looking at it completely. Then things started to improve slightly. This seemed like a good friendship film. But then the film started to have horrible predictable twists and when the movie was finished, you felt like you had lost time. Does this have something to say? Why did they even make a movie like this? And I didn't expect a modern Citizen Kane, but I still have several ideas about how this movie could have been improved. <br /> <br /> So follow my advice; let it be and watch a real road movie. There are many. I won't make the directors of those movies look bad by putting their names on this review. <br /> <br /> 1/10
