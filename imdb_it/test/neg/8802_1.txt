This film is ugly, so bad that my mother, who can barely stand the "suspense" of Disney Snow White, was laughing out loud throughout the film. My first warning should be that it was in the $ 5.50 basket at Wal-Mart. But actually I found some good movies in that basket, so I can't fault it for this debacle. The second warning should have been that when the cashier called the DVD, it was actually $ 3.88. Once again I have never been one to ignore cheap coupons. This film is definitely not for people looking for something beautiful to look at, and it's certainly not for everyone who loves the occasional bad movie. If you need background noise while doing something like playing cards with some friends, take this, but if you're looking for something to watch, don't even worry about it. It was really disappointing because there were many good actors. I seemed to be looking at a chocolate version of Willard.
