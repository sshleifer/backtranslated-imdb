As I said, sometimes the low budget is good. You can see a good movie without a lot of extra BS that can hide another piece of shit. Well ... this was that piece of shit. If anything, I thought it was humorous, unfortunately the humor was not intentional. The only recitation half came from Bill Smith and his part was cut (it's a joke). There was never a Bill Smith, nor was there anyone who could act. Even Gerald Okamura sucked, and was chosen for about 40 films. The fighting scenes were comical and made me feel like I could kick $% # @ # $. The sound was horrible, as if all the sound was recorded on the set. My 10 year old could have written a better script ... By the way, my 10 year old fell asleep ... no joke. I give a B + to the edit to cut the movie to just 90 minutes ... 60 minutes would have been an A +.
