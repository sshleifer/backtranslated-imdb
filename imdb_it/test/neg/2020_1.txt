Mamma Mia. And here I thought there were no worse directors than Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Imagine the number of decisions needed to produce a film. Script conceptual approval. Dialogue change. Casting. Set and prop design. Position selection Act. Timing. Cinematography. Lighting. Music. Audio and video editing. Direction. <br /> <br /> Now imagine that each of these decisions was wrong. <br /> <br /> Result: Dracula 3000. <br /> <br /> For a film apparently set in the 2900s, this film seems surprisingly an economic gangsta hit of the 70s. The set is ridiculous for the period. The dialogue is atrocious. The timing of each scene is ridiculous. Acting is beyond the abyss. Everything stinks. <br /> <br /> Let's take only props, for example. If you have a movie set on a spaceship built in 2900, how likely is it going to have the exposed pipes and hydraulic ports of a 60s tanker? What, the technology hasn't changed in 900 years? The "professor" uses a standard tandy keyboard and Radio-Shack flipswitches to "reprogram" the computer. What, have you not yet understood the voice control? Of course, the Prof is tied to a wheelchair. With wheels Although, you know, they have intergalactic hyperdrive ... but apparently not even a motorized wheelchair, much less a floating person, or bionic legs or something. And apparently this merchant carried an intergalactic expedition of rosewood caskets. How convenient. Then there are the weapons: the crew carries standard firearms from the end of the 20th century. In a ship In the emptiness of space, where a bullet would kill them all. Nice planning there, props department. <br /> <br /> Oh, why go on.
