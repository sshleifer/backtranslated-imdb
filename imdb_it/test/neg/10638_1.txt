this movie is so ugly and Hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so big. Nothing is good. Bloodline ... very gore but meaningless and most of the time without originality. the film is about the past, the present (1996) and the future of the puzzle. The creator of the box and his offspring fight against some demon but nothing seriously binds the 3 stories. Pinhead is in the movie ... but he is not Pinhead, he is just a boring villain who kidnaps children and kills birds, and the worst ... he talks too much. One thing I didn't really understand is why the dog from hell ????? It cannot be a cenobito because it has nothing human. Why can the dog be killed by pressure if the other creature from hell can receive projectiles without problems ????? The bloodline is inconsistent with the film series in many ways. For example, Pinhead and Angelique are old friends in this film, but it's impossible for Pinhead to have met Angelique because Pinhead is just a World War I soldier and Angelique is an old demon and lives in Paris because he is sometimes 200 years old.
