This show had a promising start as a sort of opposite of "Oceans 11", but developed into a superficial visualization of T & A. In fact, according to my little brother this is the only good part of the show. <br /> <br /> The first season was by far the best, new and interesting things went downhill afterwards. The only redemption point of this show is JamesCaan, the other actors are not brilliant. The characters lack depth and seem to be incredibly selfish and generally unpleasant. <br /> <br /> To quote a friend "Las Vegas is like Baywaych in a casino" In my opinion it is a generous way, Baywatch has been much better and much more realistic.
