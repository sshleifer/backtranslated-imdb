The script is the worst part of this film, as it moves from one premise to another, losing all the important pieces that would have made a series of different stories possible. (This film is confusing, because the public doesn't know what the story is.) I didn't have any problems with low production values ​​and the acting wasn't great, but this is telly, so it was fine. I don't care if some scenes seemed to have been made in one shot. But having such a sensible script is not absolutely necessary. Did any executive actually read it before shelling out the money? Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> The prologue in particular was written so poorly, it needed a voiceover to fill in all the details that had been left out. The prologue was hurried, it was not clear what was going on, that is. The Russian revolution was reduced to "Some clashes are happening in Petersburg", with the following scene arresting them. I know the fundamental history of the revolution, so I could fill in the details, "those annoying communists". The prologue is best ignored. <br /> <br /> This may have been a careful study of a confused person about who he is. Establishes this premise in the asylum. He could then make her struggle to identify herself for the rest of the film. No. Gone. The film assumes that she is who she claims to be (although there is still no empirical evidence). He puts on a melodramatic novel, a love so strong, that he will believe everything he says. Okay, a romantic story. No, because it doesn't make sense. The love interest seems a crazy fool (and incidentally, squalid), which explodes in wild gestures. This also does not work, because the film foolishly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end. They never married and she returned to America. The love story collapses. Although there are many love scenes, I was never convinced of why they were in love. I find the rom-com novels more convincing, although there are only one or two scenes that state that they have even spent time together. <br /> <br /> It could have been a thriller thing in which the film assumes that she is who she says she is, and strives to prove her identity. No, the court case is summarized rather than dealt with. The bizarre voice returns, again to fill in the details of a better film. <br /> <br /> The funniest thing to consider is what really happened. Anna Anderson was a fool who went to America and married another fool and did crazy things together. During her life, she had attacks of moody behavior. None of this in the film. There is a really annoying character in the asylum who emerges from nowhere and announces himself as an informant like "Someone flew over the next cuckoo to twelve monkeys". Fortunately, she vanishes, having brought nothing to the story.
