After spending half an hour examining the rumors, a gay bar located outside Tupelo, Mississippi, SMALL TOWN GAY BAR shifts the focus to the murder of Scotty Weaver at Bay Minette to demonstrate the risks faced by respondents. But there is a problem here. Bay Minette is not near Tupelo, as the film suggests. It is not even in the same state. Actually it is about three hundred miles in the coastal Alabama. <br /> <br /> Director Malcom Ingram does not hasten to emphasize this fact, nor does he bother to mention it while Bay Minette is little more than one In the middle of the road, it is about two deep breaths from the main metropolitan area in Mobile, Alabama, which has a notable gay community, gay bars and even a Metropolitan Community Church congregation. If Ingram is in bad faith on these points, one must ask if it is also on the others. <br /> <br /> Speaking as someone who was born, raised and continues to live in Mississippi, I must say that I find most of the SMALL BAR GAY SMALL a lot of hooey. Neither Meridian nor Tupelo, the communities Ingram concentrates on, are rural, small, or isolated as might have imagined, and gay bars are actually more common in the state than the film implies. That being said, Ingram rather mildly ignores the fact that the absence of a gay bar does not mean the absence of a gay community, and in doing so demonstrates a rather profound ignorance of southern culture, which tends to hold back those who frequent bars. .. be gay or straight - in low esteem. <br /> <br /> SMALL TOWN GAY BAR is, in my opinion, an example in which a director came to his subject with a personal agenda in hand and then proceeded to film the agenda. Do gays and lesbians living in rural areas of the Mississippi face important, sometimes frightening, challenges? You bet, but it's not an excuse to fiddle with reality at this level. The DVD includes a comment track and a number of deleted scenes, but I found the movie itself so ridiculous that I didn't waste time with them. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
