This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I can't believe that people actually a) write scripts like this b) have a budget to make a film c) actually expect it to succeed. Words can't even describe how awful this movie is. I like my beautiful piece of teen movies, but this hasn't even come close to being fun. In fact, it was fun for the sole reason that it was so awful. I can probably count one (maybe two) parts in the movie where I even managed to squeeze a laugh (in addition to the laughter about how bad it was). <br /> <br /> Renting this was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever done. It's been a day since I saw the movie, and I'm still shocked at how horrible it is. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> 2/10
