I was a sophomore in college when this movie came out and I had never seen it until last night. In the end I decided to watch it because I like to dance well and because the film had such a cultural impact. After watching the movie I am completely baffled by how it had a different effect than putting people to sleep. <br /> <br /> The story is rather absurd when you think about it. Does anyone actually buy the idea that that beer full of old and sturdy steel workers and crewmen can keep the clientele with the high concept dances that those girls were doing? They would have ended up in Zanzibar faster than you can say "performance art". Can you imagine the reaction of the real life versions of that audience to that bizarre TV that watched No dance dance what she did? Please. <br /> <br /> It seems plausible to me that there may be a woman who worked on a steel construction site and was also a dancer - after all, both have physically demanding jobs. But I did not buy for a second that girl worked in a steel warehouse. And I didn't buy for a second that I was looking at a real steel construction site. Steel work is dangerous. Don't keep your work area similar to a garbage dump and you don't end up losing a limb. I love some of the magical shots like when two welders are sitting in the big welded corrugated tube. What the hell are they doing in there? Or when you cut six centimeters from a rusty steel bar with a cutting torch. He was obviously on board and started cutting things at random. <br /> <br /> But the holes in a story like this can be overlooked if the movie is fun or at least inspiring in some way. Flashdance offers nothing to balance it, however. <br /> <br /> The dance is horrible. It's the style of spasm and spastic pose that ruined American musicals until ... well, are we really on? The sensuality that the film seeks is ruined by the total lack of personality of Jennifer Beal. I mean, I'm a 42-year-old male and when she was supposed to eat lobster, my only reaction was to think she should have had a lobster bib. <br /> <br /> You can't really go after Alex and she dreams because her character is so stupid and superficial. The dog had more things than her. <br /> <br /> The love story is flat. He looks like nothing but a boss with hots for one of his workers. Zero passion. <br /> <br /> Even the final scene where you dance for Orville Redenbacher and some other stiffs is unsatisfactory because the reaction of the panels is so incredible. What serious dancers wouldn't have rolled their eyes on Alex's cheerleader routine? In short, the film had nothing but leg warmers and large sweatshirts. Oh, yes, there is a beautiful piece of nudity when Alex "saves" her friend from being a useless erotic dancer (a ridiculous bit of hypocrisy). Apart from that, the film is a waste of time. I wish the MST3K crew were still in business. This would be good for them.
