Only a very young child could overlook the absurdities of this bomb; Is the first difficulty faced by the "Seaview" submarine what appears to be a piece of rock? fall down through the water and crash into the hull. But it's not rock, I'm under the North Pole - it's ICE! Everyone, except perhaps the small children mentioned so far (and some of them) know that ICE FLOATS. <br /> <br /> So, a disaster strikes - what a damn VAN ALLEN RADIATION BELT around the Earth catches fire! No one knows how it happened, we are told, which is understandable, because it is absolutely impossible for radiation to "catch fire", and even if it could, there is NO SPACE IN AIR to make it burn. <br /> <br /> There is literally no good reason to overlook the basic scientific concepts for grade II schoolbooks when making a film; however, Irwin Allen manages to do it again and again; perhaps we should instead focus on "people", which is quite simple, since they are CARDBOARDS. <br /> <br /> The cast strives a lot not to look embarrassed in this ridiculous sub-kiddie joke, much like later episodes of the TV series "Lost in Space", whose concept was cut short by writer Ib Melchior then move on to production. <br /> <br /> The subtitle looks pretty good, and that's why this gets a "2".
