This is a strange film. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience, but is full of sexual allusions. The whole premise is rather absurd, not just the idea of ​​some shrunken heads of three dead children fighting in the crime, but the same said that the boys facing a band of tougher boys is a bit far-fetched, but then new, the parents are mainly absent in the film and the authority figures are missing to keep the boys in line. <br /> <br /> The cast is good, Meg Foster plays a true mafia leader, with the beautiful AJ Damato as the leader of the bullies. Aerky Egan and Rebecca Herbst are as affluent as the young lovers, though for a comic actress of her talent, Leigh Allyn Baker is notoriously wasted on this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is unusual, but I think it's enough to compensate for the poor quality and bumbling performance. The scenario is rather boring and the "special effects" rather depressing. Sit down, unless it's in the right mood.
