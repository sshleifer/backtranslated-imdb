Even though I was a big fan of the low-or-budget horror genre, I couldn't find this disaster having fun. With horrible acting, a painfully generic "plot" and without dimensional characters, no matter how bored and drunk you are, this is not worth your 81 minutes. Don't make the same mistake I made. Rent something else. Everything else!!!
