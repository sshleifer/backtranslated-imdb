Every time I think of this film I feel physically sick. Reading a book so beautiful and then discovering that there is a film about it was a great feeling. Years later, imagine my joy in turning on the science fiction channel and finding it starts in just 5 minutes !!! Get the headlines and then uggg. If only a couple of things had changed OK. Everything changed. Numerous completely new characters are added. The main hero has shrunk and de-aged for about 30 years, and his friend / wife is now his hilarious mother! Even the dog is reduced to sub-lassie capacity. This is truly a terrible film at its absolute worst. I will gladly remove my toenails with pliers rather than go through another horrible vision, and ask everyone to think about looking at this - please don't do it. If you have a copy, burn it now, and think about how much better your life would have been if this celluloid insult had never occurred.
