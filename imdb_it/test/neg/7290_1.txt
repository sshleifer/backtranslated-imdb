I wish I could find some positive things to say about this animated sequel (but not really a sequel) to "Atlantis: The Lost Empire", but it would be a very short comment. The magic that the first had is nowhere to be found here, the animation is rather poor everywhere, the characters themselves are not very well designed. Even the backgrounds and close-ups are not good. Here there is very little attention to detail. Instead of a compelling and compelling story, we have 3 short stories that are boring and don't make much sense. I swear, even the characters seemed bored, and they preferred to be somewhere else. Who says the voice actors were bored and wanted to be somewhere else, at least that's the impression. Some of the same actors return for this sad endeavor, but an integral part of the success of the first was Michael J. Fox as the main hero, Milo Thatch. I had the distinct impression that this film was thrown together capitalizing on the success of the first, without a doubt a lot of thought or care. But at least Cree Summer returns as the voice of "Kida". It's probably the only good thing about this movie, and even she doesn't seem to have her heart completely in it. you couldn't blame any of the casts for not giving it all, considering what they had to work with. Or rather not working with it. This is a film directed at video (and I use the term freely) that should have gone straight to the dump plus nearby. In any case, too bad for Disney. Customers deserve much better than this. This gets you a 0/10 and one deserved in that .pu
