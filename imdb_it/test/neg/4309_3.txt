The Russian space station "Avna" with a crew of four Russians and two Americans is threatening to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere in a few days. Russia calls on NASA to rescue the abandoned crew and NASA shuffles the Atlantis space shuttle. The NSA is also interested in the "Prometheus", a prototype of a microwave energy source that is tested on board "Avna" and is organized for one of their men to put on a mission. <br /> <br /> This is the plot. On less important things. The space station and the shuttle are the same, obviously obvious models used in "Fallout", "Memorial Day" and "Dark Breed" (and a handful of other films, suspect). The effects of the model are so evident throughout the film and make the film look very 60s. The sets are a little better but they are too 1980s for what is presumably a brand new station built by an American company (which will later enter as part of a conspiracy to destroy 'Avna' and 'Prometheus' and claim insurance The script has some good moments (including the goodbye of Yuri and the little cue at the end), but it's still pretty bland and sub-standard. The acting is ok, the only outstanding performance comes from Alex Veadov who offers some of the film dialogue best Michael Dudikoff is, surprisingly, one of the best parts of this film: Ice-T is Ice-T. "The film offers some surprises that I don't want to spoil. /> <br /> Certainly one of the sci-fi films of low level and contemporaries of the last six years, but not the best. The film is watchable but the special effects and the plot will probably bring many viewers off. Instead rent the other sci-fi movie "Stranded".
