I'm a fan of Judy Garland, Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly, but this movie left me cold. I was expecting another American in Paris from Minnelli, so maybe I was expecting too much. <br /> <br /> The film was short of songs and with few impressive dance numbers. I was impressed by the very expressionist Kelly dance like the Mococo on the ship. I was also impressed by Nicholas Brothers in Be a Clown, too bad the song was so annoying. I also liked Judy attacking Kelly with a bric-a-brac. Check out Lorna Luft's autobiography for some interesting information on that scene. <br /> <br /> Actually, the film has some of the most annoying songs by Cole Porter, in particular "Nina". Furthermore, Judy and Gene constantly scream like strident children. <br /> <br /> The plot is subtle - which is the norm for the musical course - but it is not saved by impressive dance numbers or memorable songs. I suspect that the best parts of this film have been left on the floor of the editing room. Please, as a film restorer, find those pieces of film and show us what the movie could have been!
