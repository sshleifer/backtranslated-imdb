This film was absolutely terrible. The only explanation I can think of for the good reviews received by some here is that they were written by people in the cast. Actually it was painful to watch this movie. Even my grandchildren (ages 6-13) could not bear to see him. As far as I know, this film has never been released in theaters and for good reason. It's like some people sitting and having a beer and saying, "Hey, let's make a movie, who wants to be there?" It's so bad. Besides Luke Perry, who is only in a small part of the film, I didn't recognize any other actor. It is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is in this case. I liked Sandlot (I) and generally I like stupid and stupid movies, but this film doesn't have a single saving quality. The people who wrote it have no idea how children think, speak or act and the film is a messy mix of terribly trivial lines and stupid jokes. I rarely write negative reviews, but this is the worst movie I've seen from Man's Best friend and it's definitely one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen in my life. If you entrust it, remember that I warned you. The fact that some people have rated this film as good is a sad commentary on their taste and intelligence. I'm not exaggerating.
