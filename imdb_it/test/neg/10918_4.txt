CUJO is a film adaptation of a novel of the same name written by Stephen King. <br /> <br /> I never read the novel, but just scanning the comments page gave me some ideas. I noticed a reference to the change in the ending. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is as follows: a Saint Bernard dog is bitten by a rabid bat and continues to kill. <br /> <br /> The plot seems quite worn out now, having been made in various films. However it may have been something new when King wrote the novel. Or maybe King's novel has given a twist to the story that was never shown in the film. <br /> <br /> However, the first 40 minutes of this film have nothing to talk about besides the dog bite. Nothing else happens - nothing scary, nothing funny, nothing more to add depth to the characters and nothing interesting in any other aspect. I found this section hard to seduce and kept shouting on TV, "come on, come on!" The events I was seeing on the screen resembled a TV movie of the dramatic genre or an extended episode of a television soap opera. Unfortunately, there was only one family in the film that concentrated, so he couldn't even work at a soap opera level. The dog was the best character in the film, but in this section he didn't get enough time on the screen. There was nothing to indicate why this dog would end up in a murderous madness later. <br /> <br /> After the 40-minute score, something finally happened. The dog suddenly turned from a lovable pet into a vicious killing machine. He started attacking some people. There was also an interesting cat and mouse chase when two characters were trapped in a car, unable to leave because the dog would attack them. Even in this second half too long, the suspense would accumulate long before he died again. It was just a stop-and-play situation repeated over and over again until the film reached its conclusion. <br /> <br /> Without giving the end, I can tell you that he was very formidable and unworthy of a Stephen King story. <br /> <br /> The suspense scenes on the screen are exciting to watch. Some great camera angles add a threat to the dog's vicious nature when it attacks people. This is particularly important because, as others have mentioned, a Saint Bernard dog is not at all as scary as, for example, a Rottweiler. Unfortunately, the film fails to use suspense music to support on-screen images. The music is too melodramatic rather than suspicious. This could fit into a TV movie, but it looks incredibly out of place in what should be a dark-toned movie that presents the viewer with a living nightmare. <br /> <br /> This leads me to face a wider problem with this film - photography Working with the camera and above all the choice of colors make this a very cheap TV movie that one would expect to see as a movie daytime on Channel 5 here in the UK, where I'm writing this comment. <br /> <br /> The two main actors offer good acting performances that help give life to the boring segments of the film. Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro should have the merit of doing a great job with the poor material they are given. I could forgive some brief moments of exaggeration by paying more attention to the dialogue, which could not have allowed other interpretations in my opinion. I will not make judgments on the other actors because they have practically nothing to do. <br /> <br /> As someone who is a fan of SALEM'S LOT and STEPHEN KING'S IT, both film adaptations of famous Stephen King novels, I had high expectations for this film. But it turned out to be a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> In general, I do not recommend Stephen King fans or horror movies in general to watch CUJO. This is one of those moments when I have to recommend the book rather than the film. We hope it gives life to the story in a way that the film failed to do.
