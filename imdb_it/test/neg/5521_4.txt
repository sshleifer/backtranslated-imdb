HAPPY DAYS was one of my favorite shows when it aired in 1974. But critics were quick to show their ignorance combined with a total lack of sense of humor by banging this show because they thought it was a cheap attempt to cash the success of American GRAFFITTI. <br /> <br /> There were some similarities between American GRAFFITTI and HAPPY DAYS. <br /> <br /> Both open with "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley & the Comets. Both took place in a bygone era and both saw Ron Howard as one of the leading roles. But there were also some important differences. While American GRAFFITTI was held in California in 1962 and focused on a group of recent graduates about to take that big step into adulthood, HAPPY DAYS took place in Milwaulkee, Wisconson and centered around a group of high school teenagers, taking care of of the joys and tribulations of adolescence. <br /> <br /> HAPPY DAYS originally opened with the juke box reproducing the original version of Bill Haley and the ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK of the comets. But when the old ones got hot, thanks to the success of American GRAFFITTI, and the original 1954 version of ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK, entered the Billboard Hot 100 and became a hit again in 1974, royalty payments went through the roof. So a "remake" of the song (the correct term is now "new stereo recording") was quickly replaced. <br /> <br /> The current HAPPY DAYS music theme was then introduced for the second season if I need memory right. <br /> <br /> Both fans and enemies agree that this show is an escape. Freedoms have been taken and details have been overlooked, making this show anything but authentic. <br /> <br /> It's perfectly fine. HAPPY DAYS should be a comedy, not a history lesson. But sometimes writers sometimes used to put up their necks and hit controversial topics. An episode centered around the Cunningham building of a fall shelter. Another episode concerned a divorced woman who moved into the neighborhood with the dream of starting a new life. The subject of prejudice was addressed when Howard was invited to the wedding of an old army friend who had just turned black (at a time when prejudice and discrimination were unfortunately an acceptable part of the American lifestyle). The problem of the draft also came in a later episode! <br /> <br /> The show as originally set in 1955. A problem that was faced wisely was with the cast. Most of them were teenagers and, like every past year, it was obvious that they had aged and the series aged with the cast, shifting the series from the safe waters of Eisenhower years into the Age of Camelot, all the way through with JFK and then in the turbulent second half of the 1960s. That, along with writers who ran out of ideas, and later, cast members like Ron Howard who left the show, wisely ceasing to go on, left me wanting to do the right thing by pulling the plug on this show and abandoning while they were ahead. This, together with the public in adoration of the idols that he could not control himself every time the Great Fonzie entered the scene, started to wear very thin very quickly. <br /> <br /> This show originally represented the Fabulous Fifties while we LIKE to remember that era. Time heals wounds, you know. Everything has its place and although I'd rather hear the "original hit versions" on those "new stereo recordings", those "new stereo recordings" worked very well on HAPPY DAYS. And this is where I find myself regretting having bought the DVD! Unlike the first complete DVD of the first season, the original music of the complete second season has been replaced with different music. While it's nice that the original episodes have been digitally restored to digital perfection, the removal of the original music has destroyed what made this show so fun to watch!
