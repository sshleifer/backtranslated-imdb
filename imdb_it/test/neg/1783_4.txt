I thought it would be a fun comedy without sex or nudity. Well, there is no sexual content but to be a "funny comedy", I only remember laughing at "The Green Butchers" three times. The hilarity is focused on cannibalism and mental retardation, which is just bad mood, in a bad way. <br /> <br /> I should have left this movie and I'm kicking myself because I didn't do it. In fact, I shouldn't have seen this movie in the first place. The only good that came out of this film was the fact that Bjarne and his brother eventually made amends and put their horrible past behind them. I advise any well-intentioned person to avoid this coarse film.
