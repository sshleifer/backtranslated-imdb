This film has tried to capture the naive idealism that many teenage girls have for fun, friendship, escape, danger, sex, maturity, etc. The problem is that he failed to establish these things on every single level; and that is why he failed to build a decent story around them. I could not follow the point of any part of this story, nor any reason why I should care. <br /> <br /> This film is not at all an exploration of pedophilia. It's basically a girl in love with her sister and her sister in love with the idea of ​​"man". While the latter proves her love for men, the first tries to recapture her sister by "drawing". <br /> <br /> The plot is weak, the characters are weak and the reality of everything is similar to a director of amateur porn movies (without the sexual substance).
