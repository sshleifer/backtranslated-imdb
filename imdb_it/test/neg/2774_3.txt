This is a cheap looking movie! A stripper continues to be attacked and raped by zombies and no one believes her. He goes to the police who also raped her. Eventually he finds a child who has also been attacked by zombies and track down the zombies in "The Zombie Master". The fact that Stephanie Beaton plays as a stripper is the only reason to watch this movie.
