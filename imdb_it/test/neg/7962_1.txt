This film spends a lot of time preaching against marijuana. However, the plot and graphics are so crazy that it looks more like the poster child for LSD. <br /> <br /> Plot: Michael's heroic struggle as he fights his addiction while being subjected to the humiliation caused by Winnie the Pooh and Papa Smurf. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, there is a good message, but it is obscured by the fact that the writers have taken an idea of ​​PSA rather stale and have tried to extend it to 30 minutes. This includes a sequence of songs, in which you are told that there is a million rational ways to say "No!" like "I can't smoke pot, I have homework!" <br /> <br /> Writers cannot make up their minds about what to do with the characters they have staged without copyright. At first we see that everyone has to hide from the human characters, but within five minutes we see them all running in plain sight without anyone noticing. Soon they start interacting with the human cast, and the only one who is even slightly disturbed by this fact is not the drug addicts, it's the little sister who talks to her teddy bear (Pooh, anyway). Also, there's the little floating drug demon. Because you know, drug dealers don't give kids drugs. He is also ambiguous - while he may be the symbol of Michael's addiction and therefore should not be seen by other people, he laters and persecutes little Corey to get his drug. So I guess he's ... uhhh ..... going forward! <br /> <br /> The entire plot finally culminates in a crazy sequence in which Michael finds himself in what appears to be Carnival Saturday of Souls, aka a theme park from hell, where the various cartoon characters they beat him and ignore him and stuff like that. For example, Miss Piggy eats it in a sandwich and spits it out. If the writers weren't tall when they wrote this, I have to recommend that they try to get tall because they can't get any crazier than that. Of course, the film ignores the fact that Michael has had highs for two years at this point, so why this sequence of triumphs would frighten him is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I realize that I'm completely chasing this movie, but actually I saw it again just because I had the trouble of tracking it down on eBay because of its infamy of being a BAD cartoon. The level of involuntary humor is brilliant. Take this scene for example: Michael's dad cheers in the fridge for a beer. Note that many of them have disappeared and mention it to his wife. The always observant mother tells him "Don't worry, you probably drank them last night watching football". While obviously we should learn that Michael is drinking beer (in addition to the dish and the crack), instead we read and understand further: - Hey guys, it's okay to have chemical dependencies while you're adults - on! Scenes like this are worth the small price of this movie. Oh yes, and the fact of hearing Simon the Chipmunk say "Marijuana".
