About 5 minutes into the film, you are catapulted into this brutal cat-and-mouse story between the two main characters and from that moment it gets worse. The biggest problem is the characters and how incredible they are. This is what 50-year-old Hollywood producers and screenwriters from out of the world think of as stoner life as if they had given the cast to Friends. Bland, boring, annoying and completely unrealistic. I despise this movie.
