I really wanted to love this film, and not just because it contained Aaron Eckhart, but I thought the premise would be nice, because I like movies and shows that revolve around chefs. Photography was good but, in addition to going around the chefs, everything else is just a clich√©. Oh and Little Miss Sunshine were very irritating in this film, even though Abigail Breslin seems to be a little irritating in every movie she plays in, as she plays many roles in which she is neighing. It has decent cooking flashes, but the food didn't play an important role in the film than I expected, which was a huge disappointment for me. This film had good potential, the cast was great but they had very little to work with. I like a good-hearted romantic comedy but this was simply bland. And longer than it should be because it seemed a lot longer than it is. It's not a terrible movie, you won't miss anything if you don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 10
