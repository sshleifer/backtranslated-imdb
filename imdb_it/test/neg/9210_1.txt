There must be an option 0/10 for bilge like this. <br /> <br /> It was painful to look at, but strangely exciting all the same. It's irresistible because it seemed incredible that a movie could actually suck so much. I kept thinking "it must be better". It got worse. It's worse. <br /> <br /> How come people thought they were producing such a categorical piece of junk that I'll never know. The most surprising thing of all, however, is all these reviews that I see of people who really love the movie. Yes, the acting was good, but the film was really very bad. The worst movie ever!
