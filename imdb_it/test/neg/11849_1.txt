<br /> <br /> ********** NOTICE SPOILER *************** <br /> <br /> If you liked JURASSIC PARK 1 , 2 or 3: <br /> <br /> If you happen to like really bad movies for their pure entertainment value except for their quality (case in point - highly recommended DARK STAR by John Carpenter) <br / > <br /> If you like dinosaur films in general - <br /> <br /> THEN STAY BY THIS KINEMATIC CRAPSTERPIECO! <br /> <br /> The shameless use of archive material from CARNOSAUR 1 & 2 puts most of this miserable attempt into a dino / slasher film - Take the scene, for example, where the security guard meets the his destiny to the jaws of Alpha T-Rex. For some reason, it loses about 50 pounds and appears 10 years younger. Why? Simply because this scene was taken directly from CARNOSAUR, which was a poor movie to begin with. <br /> <br /> The ending was a carbon copy of CARNOSAUR 2, for those who had the misfortune of being passed through losing video. Once again, we see Mr. Rex fighting a bulldozer - which alternates like a forklift - through the miracle of -ta-daa! - Repertoire material from the aforementioned CARNOSAUR 1 and 2. Of course, the ending is exactly the same - the beast falls on its death just as the complex goes up in flames. <br /> <br /> A real insult to anyone's intelligence. <br /> <br /> But it's even better than watching the ROSIE O 'DONNEL SHOW. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: 1/2 * on ***** <br /> <br />
