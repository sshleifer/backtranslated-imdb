I normally love finding old (and some not so old) westerns that I haven't seen, being entertainment for the evening. It's a great way to sit back, relax and escape the politics and problems of the world for a few hours. But this was not the case with this version of The Magnificent Seven. The cast and the plot of this series closely follow the Hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment; good old story get-your-mind-right, revisionist, where the 'bad guys' must all be white, masculine, confederate (in this case), and preferably Christian (if somehow it can be worked into the script). It's sad, really. The best films in circulation are now and have always had to do simply by telling a good story on the big screen, not on the introduction of someone's political ideology.
