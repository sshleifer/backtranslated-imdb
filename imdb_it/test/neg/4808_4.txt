When I saw this movie for the first time, I said to myself, "Hey, what the hell does a good movie look like, why not rent it?". So yes, I rented it and went home to see it. When I inserted it into my DVD player I was shocked. <br /> <br /> First of all, no one told me it was a Mexican film and was spoken in Spanish, fortunately it had subtitles. <br /> <br /> SECOND, he was naked, naked NUDE! Since I don't have any backgrounds in Mexican films, you could see my shock when I saw it. * GASP! Covering virgin eyes, NOO * <br /> <br /> THIRD, predictable to say the least, but actually being predictable was no excuse for me in the film I like, because I don't care if it's predictable, unless it is not much above. <br /> <br /> FOURTH, as Heidi and Kike came together, in a poor way. <br /> <br /> FIFTH, how the film ended. It was a final BAD, BAD. How Mr. Van der Linde's sudden endorsement of the mayor's election was because his daughter knew how to organize the party ... BLAH, Blah. I hoped it was not so easy to accept it, the director could have simply hurried it. <br /> <br /> After all this beating of bad things, good things are here to come. At one point the film was pretty funny, with Maribel being clumsy in the kitchen and everyone, Heidi's attitude, Valentina was poetic of words. What I really like was the song that Valentina made with her girlfriend. That's all, and for the other things I didn't mention they were just so-so.
