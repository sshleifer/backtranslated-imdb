History carries on. Drug traffickers: beautiful women and a resolute policeman. Nothing has not already been done a hundred times before. The boat deserves the wait Amsterdam is the perfect city to make it. The canals and waterways put you on the edge of your place. I would say the same thing that made Bullitt the car chase, very intense!
