Computing. Can there be anything more boring? Sitting in front of a computer all day typing a few keys all day every day, touches Tap. This is very much of the problem with this film, the heroine sits in front of a computer VDU that beats the keys and no matter how many looks of agitation she gives, or how many suspenseful notes the player or how many extreme close-ups entails from the director not much excitement about the fact that there are few things less exciting than looking at someone on a computer <br /> <br /> There are some other problems, too many real errors about how computers work. Can I hack into a computer that is turned off and not connected to the Internet? I imagine that when THE NET was created 10 years ago very few people would have understood how computers worked so that writers would be able to do BS for a long time, but since we now live in a global village where almost every family in the world Western has its computer audience is certainly very attentive to the real mistakes of this film. And of course there are too many cases in which someone acts stupidly or out of character at crucial moments to advance the plot that makes THE NET a very mediocre film
