This French film is apparently about a creepy and terrible cop who investigates the rape and murder of a young girl in a small town. However, the film does not talk about anything at all and it takes a while to say nothing. If a character takes ten minutes to walk from Point A to Point B, the film spends ten minutes showing this walk, and these are the "action" scenes. There are also static shots that last for minutes, making the viewer ask if he accidentally pressed the pause button on the remote control. The script has enough material for a 20-minute film. The film lasts about seven hours. Do the accounts. The actors were apparently amateurs and shows. Note to yourself: never see a Dumont movie again.
