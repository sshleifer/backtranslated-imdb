Of all the movies I've seen, this, The Rage, must be one of the worst yet. The direction, the LOGIC, the continuity, the changes in the plot and the dialogue made me cry out in pain. "How could anyone find something so lousy"? Gary Busey is known for his "B" films, but this is definitely a "W" movie. (W = waste). <br /> <br /> Take for example: about two dozen FBI and local law enforcement agents surround a caravan home with a jeep wagoneer. Inside the jeep there is MA and is "confused" about why all the cops are about. Within a few seconds, an enormous firefight ensues, but is killed directly. The cops shoot the jeep with Gary and the company that shoots them. The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary turns in circles and is not hit by a single bullet / ball. BUT he is killed and Gary doesn't seem to notice, dammit, that guy is tough. Truly a miracle, not since the six-shooter fired 300 bullets there was such a miracle.
