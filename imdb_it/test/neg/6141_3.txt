I like the CSI concept, but the show is ruined by some seriously wooden acting. The Medical Examiner has the best lines and delivers them in a bow, casually, that enlivens the story. Unfortunately it has little time for the screen. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, why does Jorja Fox always seem and act in an absolutely unhappy way? I know the forensic investigation is a very serious affair, but the characters, for the most part, seem to confuse seriousness with the absence of a sense of humor and complete lack of personality. I can't imagine going out with Sarah Sidle or Catherine Willows; what would you talk to one of the two? I'm waiting for the episode when, at the end of a shift, Catherine takes a remote control, points it to Grissom, closes it and gets it into a closet until the next day.
