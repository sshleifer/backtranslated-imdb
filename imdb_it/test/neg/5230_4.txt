STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Only the Mark is missing *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br /> <br /> Based on another of Stephen's long novels King, this takes place in the small and dormant New England town of Castle Rock (also the name of the film's production company!), Where a new antique store, the popular Needful Things, was opened. The owner and owner, Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) hides, one might say, a diabolical secret. There is an object in his shop that everyone wants in the small city: first a small cash advance is required, before a much more sinister price is requested. As suspicion, hatred and madness shatter the city, it is up to police chief Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) to restore order and save the city from a terrifying end ... <br /> <br /> I have read Needful Le novel earlier this year, and was eager to see the film adapt again to compare them (as if this would be a contest!) but it had been deleted on video and DVD and I couldn't to find anywhere from which to rent it. So I was happy when I finally found it at a flea market during a shopping trip ... <br /> <br /> It's one of the crudest ironies that King's novels are generally the best to read but when fit on screen nine times out of ten are complete garbage, as is the case here. The material that makes his books great simply doesn't translate into a movie script very well, for some reason. And I suppose there's always the question: why bother looking at this when I could read the book again instead? <br /> <br /> I appreciate that some are simply too long (ie It, The Stand) to be transformed into a complete screen with all the situations and characters included, but there is no reason why this could not have included all the material in the book. As a result, many key characters in the book (eg Ace Merrill) are not included at all and we have a very bad character development which means that we are not interested in the characters that are involved since they are so lacking in depth and motivation - for example we have a character in the book, Danforth Keaton, who kills his wife towards the end, but we have not been shown any hint of any hint at any reason that he did not hate or hate her and so has no impact when it happens, unlike of the book in which a lot of depth was invested and really involved you to find out what happened to the characters involved. All the script material to fill in the cracks, if you will, is really stupid and trivial and the typically silly stuff that is included in King adaptations like this. <br /> <br /> Most of the film's problems are that it deviates so far from the book, but there is also a terrible acting by a cast that obviously cannot prove to the silly material that is asked of it. to exhibit. In the 1990s, many of King's works began to skip cinema and were transformed into a territory created for TV / video. Garbage like this must surely suggest why. **
