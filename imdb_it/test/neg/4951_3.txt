After watching "Still Life", a short film directed by Jon Knautz, I was genuinely excited for his film debut, "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer". "Still Life" had perfectly captured the essence and feel of an episode of "The Twilight Zone" and I couldn't wait to see what Knautz could have done when he played the horror comedy genre. The captivating nature of the name and promotional materials suggested something along the lines of "Evil Dead" or "Army of Darkness"; a funny 80s-style horror movie with many monsters. While that was what Knautz was doing, he completely failed to capture the entertainment or entertainment value of these films. <br /> <br /> The problem with "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is that it completely lacks understanding of what made these horror comedies, which it seeks to evoke, so great in the first place. Two-thirds of the running time is devoted mainly to the hero of the film, Jack Brooks, a plumber and university student, as he goes to class and tries to deal with his uncontrollable outbursts of anger. There is no monster in sight for most of the film, barely a drop of blood or the slightest attempt at anything related to horror. Even if "Evil Dead" or "Dead Alive" ran out of blood, they would still be fun. "Jack Brooks" is not. It's simply boring, which is the worst thing that can be a film of this nature. The same Jack Brooks is not that interesting, at least not enough to justify the amount of time on the screen that was assigned to him. Everything there is to know about him is revealed in the films for the first ten minutes and from that moment on, whenever he is not beating the pulp of a monster (and rarely does), it is not worth looking at it . The film is not going anywhere, following him around for psychiatric sessions and fights with classmates. <br /> <br /> In the end things recover. Jack Brooks fights some monsters, some heads are crushed, some humans are slaughtered, and then it's over. That's right. All in about fifteen minutes. It's a good fifteen minutes. The monsters are all pretty inventive (and made entirely behind closed doors) and there are some great gags (the best is a crushed zombie head), but after spending seventy-five minutes of pure boredom, fifteen minutes are not going to cut it. <br /> <br /> This is really all there is to it. I could ramble on acting that is pretty well done (especially the horror icon Robert Englund in a non-traditional role) and how the prosthetic of creatures are a nice return to the days when movies didn't use CGI, but they really don't. t matter. "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is absolutely boring and while Jon Knautz obviously has the talent to create a good movie (again, the last fifteen minutes are killer and "Still Life" was fantastic ??? check it out), "Jack Brooks" completely misses the mark. He has his successes (acting, makeup), but these don't change the fact that it's not funny at all. The screening I witnessed had the director and the cast present. One of the information I gathered is that the sequel was under development and that this time it would focus more on the fight against monsters than on "creating a hero". My advice: skip this and wait for the sequel.
