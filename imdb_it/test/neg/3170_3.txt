Usually I don't consider shooting a movie unless it is REALLY bad. Homegrown is a film I wish I hadn't even turned on. The plot is interesting but the acting and writing are too scarce. I didn't care about the characters. Any film that has drug use and free nudity as its highlights is not worthy of praise. The characters have spent their time getting up and believe me, this is the only way to sit in this movie.
