Years ago, I took a pretty well done TV movie called "Linda". It was released in 1973 and starred in Stella Stevens as the female title. Imagine my surprise when, over ten years later, I saw the same story again on late-night TV. However, it was this 1993 version, with Virginia Madsen. Don't get me wrong, I can handle remakes, even the dark ones. But this reconstructed poorly written and poorly filmed made me feel sorry for Madsen and co-star Richard Thomas. Unlike the original, dialogue here is a clich√© and makes me think: "Why did they take the trouble to rewrite it?" Secondly, the camera work is very heavy and the film stock is poor. Sometimes I remembered the student film competition at the beginning of "The Big Picture" by Christopher Guest. Finally, the cast looks bored (Madsen) or suffering (Thomas). In fact, the only one who really seems to like the job is Ted McGinley. Of course, with his perfectly combed hair and his hooded teeth, he's really extending from his previous work on "The Love Boat". In short, to borrow a criticism from Opus the Penguin in Bloom County: <br /> <br /> "This film is for film what Jonestown did for Kool-Aid." <br /> <br /> Thomkat
