A Brazilian television cable presents "Yadon Ilaheyya" this month in its "Cult" channel. I saw the trailer and listened to the announcement, and decided to watch this movie. Indeed it is an absurd, boring, pretentious, stupid and useless disconnection of the conflict in the Middle East, and together with "Soultangler", they are certainly the worst films I have ever tried to see. I've really lost forty-three minutes of my life watching the first half of this shit, highly indicated for torturing enemies. How can this film be awarded and nominated for awards at Cannes? My vote is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Intervenção Divina" ("Divine Intervention")
