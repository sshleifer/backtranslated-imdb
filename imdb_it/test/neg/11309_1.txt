After watching this movie I felt sick to my stomach and if I saw another minute I would have to run to the bathroom and vomit until dawn. A sick movie that was NOT fun and was NOT worth it, money at all. If someone wants to see this movie, don't! Your children will never forgive you and will sustain the disease for a week. So if you value your child's education and want to stimulate your child's mind, please don't watch this movie. Please, NOT!
