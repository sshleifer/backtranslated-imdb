This is a terrible film, which is barely recognizable from the book, although they have a similar plot. The time it takes to watch this movie (which is only 1.5 hours) would be much better to spend anything else, including the growth of the grass. The addition of poorly made fantasy scenes makes Catherine unbearably stupid. The actress who plays Catherine also encounters ditzy as all goodness and seems constantly surprised, even when she should look lovingly into the eyes of her Tilney. Honestly!! The film ends with a scene similar to Catherine's where you can't help but wonder if it happened or if it's simply delusional, and not in the best way that makes you think, but in a perfectly horrible way that sums up the film terrible. The only positive thing about the film is the title, which was written by Mrs Austen herself. I generally love BBC productions, but this is horrible.
