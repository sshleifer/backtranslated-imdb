As a Michigander, I took the jokes about Michigan. Great fun - make fun of Pontiac, Ann Arbor, all those playful Detroit suburbs. Yes, yes, I've heard these lines a million times. I will give them credit for having accurately depicted Grosse Pointe's lameness. It couldn't get whiter. Did you hear those adorable Michigan nasal accents? Where girls talk so fast you can't understand a word that comes out of their mouth (nose) ...? As much as I love Michigan, I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> I've never met a person from Grosse Pointe that I liked. Listen to that terrible live band and that annoying and horrible background music! What is that? One of the bands of your friends from Gross Pointe? Probably. Wow, what a great "Detroit scene" you guys have over there. Strange how the people of Grosse Pointe always say they are from Detroit. They are so white and rich, they want to have something to complain about. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is blowing. Right from the limping jokes about the girls in thongs to the terrible development of the character. Oh wait a minute, do you mean that the whole base for a character is that he very often says f-word? What a profound personality. Great job, Grosse Pointers! And I love all the sexist jargon, like the narrator who calls the first girl who is killed that we've never heard of a "naive b * tch". It is really beautiful. <br /> <br /> And those homemade masks with Marilyn Manson contact lenses are really great. And I like how it made the reason why motorcyclists came and killed people perfectly sensible. And how their master narrator had such an obvious role in the film ... ?? The main boy was so boring that I fell asleep watching him. The three idiot boys (or were they two or four? How can I say, they all look and behave the same way!) They were trying so desperately to make me laugh, but Beavis and Butthead have already brought out my humor laughing in 1994. And what about is it gay jokes? No wonder this movie has been sucked - everyone involved must have some minor problems with their masculinity, eh guys? <br /> <br /> The only thing he saved in this film was the main girl. Despite what other people have said here, she was actually a good actress. Teenage girls talk about how she spoke. They really act like she acted. His acting was very natural and credible. I really thought she was an employee of the Grosse Pointe convenience store. .. maybe it is! And yes, she had big tits, many of the women here. Michigan is the fattest state in the Union, you know. In all aspects. <br /> <br /> So those of you who think this is a representation of Detroit is not. It's the suburbs of Detroit. They are very white and full of adolescent aimless anxiety. Limp Bizkut, ICP (yes, ICP comes from one of our suburbs) and $ 75 wide khaki pants! Rich lame guys who are crazy because they have a lot of money and nothing to complain about. And they make bad movies too. <br /> <br />
