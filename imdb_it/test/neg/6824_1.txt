Rourke does his usual part, like a sinister, resentful, Neanderthal, ferocious, cretin, in the same mold as "Picture Claire", "Out in Fifty", "Get Carter", "Double Team" and the rest of Garbage which it is located. <br /> <br /> It has a few lines. <br /> <br /> Of course, all this is just garbage, he underestimates Rourke, paralyzes him and it doesn't matter for his characterization as an actor. Again, after seeing "A prayer ...", "Johnny Handsome", "Barfly", "9 1/2 weeks", "Year of the Dragon", etc. etc., for many years I have considered Rourke an exceptional, intelligent, intelligent man. I think it has changed since then. <br /> <br /> It seems hardened, calcined. <br /> <br /> "He went about with grim looks; / Desperation inhabited his breast / E made man a perfect parasite." (Belloc, "The Example"). I had absolutely no other reason to watch this boring movie except that it was in Rourke.
