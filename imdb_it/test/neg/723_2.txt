at first I thought "nasaan ka man" could be one of those new Filipino progressive films. as someone has noted before, the film doesn't look bad. It is clear that the directors have used more expensive cameras to shoot, better angles, better audio equipment, good-looking actors and more beautiful places. <br /> <br /> However, the improvements are all purely superficial. if it weren't for all the shiny and expensive filters, 'nasaan ka man' would feel just like the typical second-rate local film - - hyperactive drama, predictable twists, "yes right!" moments, crying, screaming and characters that you don't care about anything anymore, all pushed down your throat. <br /> <br /> a couple of things bothered me about this movie. first of all, when is it okay to have sex with the adoptive family? that topic not related to blood does not make an ounce of difference. second, wouldn't a woman really tell anyone she's been raped for 40 years, simply because her father told her to keep it a secret? and, where the hell were the lights in this movie? I know the director tried to make things super dramatic, but I was forced to view the brightness function on my TV.
