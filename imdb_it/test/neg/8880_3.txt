I had this DVD to watch, thinking that I would see a kind of biography or painter Goya, but the film talked about everything except Goya. This film is about a young woman taken from her family by the Holy Inquisition, presumably because she practiced Jewish rites (just because the poor girl didn't like eating pork!). The rest of the film is about torture, humiliation, led by a poor script (I can't believe it is JC Carri√®re's as I could not believe this cr ** is directed by Milos Forman) centered on a religious man and that young woman that's all. <br /> <br /> Ah, and there is Goya, I forgot, playing a completely peripheral role - that could be the role of John, Paul, Peter, Manuel, Joaquim, Jose or anyone else. Very disappointing - one of these films that will be forgotten forever (if it hadn't happened yet). Rent "The name of the rose" if you want a film about the Holy Inquisition. And I don't know what you should rent if you want to watch a movie about the Spanish painter Goya. Maybe a good director, not Forman, still needs to do it. PS: the Spanish painter Goya, the protagonist who gets lost in the plot, is played by a Scandinavian actor, which makes this film even more difficult to take seriously. Maybe next time we should send Javier Barden to play the biopic of the Norwegian painter, Edvard Munch!
