A couple of clarifying comments are in order. Herschell Gordon Lewis contributed with a brief introduction to the video version of DOCTOR GORE (aka THE BODY SHOP), in which he touched on his collaborative efforts with J.G. "Pat" Patterson, director and protagonist of DOCTOR GORE. Patterson invented the "gore effects" for THE GRUESOME TWOSOME and some other Lewis films in the late 1960s. Lewis notes that while 2000 MANIACS was a "five gallon" film (referring to the amount of blood on the stage requested), Lewis-Patterson's productions were "fifteen-liter" images. Lewis does not describe DOCTOR GORE as a "fifteen-liter" film - he is just talking about the films he and Patterson made together. Lewis confessed (elsewhere) that his introduction to DOCTOR GORE was improvised before he even saw Patterson's movie! Then take it with a grain of salt. <br /> <br /> This could be an "unfinished" film, but like some unfinished novels it has a "final". Only missing connective tissue. <br /> <br /> Patterson has a precise stage presence and a dry sense of humor, helping to make this simplistic show a little more watchable than it should be. There is an extremely ruthless plot - even the BLOOD FESTIVAL is more complex - and a reticulated musical score by William Girdler. A little nudity and lots of skin. The entire central section of the film involves the construction of a "perfect woman"; this is concentrated blood for the bloodthirsty and laughable. <br /> <br /> Patterson, the director is in the lead, but tries to tell his story in a creative way, if you can use Frankenstein's clich√©s in a creative way. But the best reason to watch this movie (on Something Weird's DVD, if possible) is that it features a perfect Nashville washing machine, "A Heart Dies Every Minute" by Bill Hicks. It's not the truth!
