Ok, you have: <br /> <br /> Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (The backbone of England). She is killed in the first scene - it's true, people; this show has no backbone! <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole as Colonel Cricket of Ol of the First War and now the enchanted Lord of the Manor. <br /> <br /> Joanna Lumley as Mrs. ensweatered of the Manor, 20 years younger than the Colonel and 20 years after her first but still glamorous (English spelling, not mine) enough to have a toy boy on side. It's all right, they have the full knowledge and consent of Col. Cricket (they also come around for Christmas!) However, she's kind enough to tell the colonel to have said a toy boy of his own age (what a girl!) < br /> <br /> David McCallum as said toy-boy, just as unnecessarily glamorous as his grasp. Pilcher couldn't find any cover for him in the story, so he gave him a subdued job at the Circus. <br /> <br /> and finally: <br /> <br /> Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups, venerable director of the Venerable Girls' Boarding School, serves tea in his office with a hint of deep and touching advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. His best advice: "I was in Nancherrow (the local England mansion) only once, I thought it was very nice but, somehow, it wasn't part of the real world." Well, we can't say they didn't warn us. <br /> <br /> Ah, Susan - time was, your character would handle the whole show. They don't write them that way anymore. Our loss, not yours. <br /> <br /> So - with a cast and setting like this, you have the re-makings of "Brideshead Revisited", right? <br /> <br /> Wrong! They took these one-dimensional secondary roles because they paid so well. After all, acting is one of the oldest temporary jobs (mention another one!) <br /> <br /> First warning sign: so much backlight. They wander around shooting outdoors - "hey, it's just the sunlight!" <br /> <br /> Second warning sign: the Lady who drives weeps a lot. When they don't cry, his eyes are wet. This is the law of love novels: Leading Lady is "open-mouthed". <br /> <br /> By now, the Leading Lady must be known as LL <br /> <br /> Third warning sign: LL actually has stars in her eyes when she's in love. Anyway, I will give Emily Mortimer a prize just for having to play with that spotlight in her eyes (I wonder, have they used the contacts?) <br /> <br /> And finally the fourth warning sign: no character on screen feminine is "Mrs." She is "Miss" or "Lady". <br /> <br /> When all was said and done, I could not yet tell you who was chasing who and why. I couldn't even tell you what was said and done. <br /> <br /> To sum up: all of them live through the Second World War without any of them happening at all. <br /> <br /> OK, in the end, LL discovers that he lost his parents in the Japanese prison camps and the little sister returns to the catatonic home. Meanwhile (there is always a "meanwhile") a young LL boy had a crush on (when, I don't know) he comes home from a difficult place during the war and is found on the street by Lady of the Manor (must be a little way if SHE will find it there.) Both victims of the war were taken away to recover in Nancherrow (SOMEONE must be "taken away" FROM ANYWHERE in these love stories!) <br /> <br /> Great drama.
