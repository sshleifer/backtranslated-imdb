*** SPOILERS *** A hot and sexy Linda Blair while the Witch Amelia Reynolds is very angry with her friend and rival Witch in the city Erica Barens, Julie Strain. Amelia gets her husband Hal, Edward Albert, to get a job promotion at the Giger & Greengrass law firm against the most deserving Larry Barnes, Larry Poindexter, who is married to Erica who cast a spell on Hal causing him to lose controlling his car and almost killing himself. <br /> <br /> Larry discovering Erica's attempt on the life of his best friend, Larry, has a violent fight with her that causes Erica to fall from the balcony on her death. It is when Larry returns to his ex-wife Carol, Rochelle Sanson, that things start to heat up really, emotionally and sexually. The evil Amelia tries to have the dead spirit of Erica who takes possession of Carol's body and ends up killing Larry, who she holds responsible for the injury of her husband, Hal, who left him permanently confined to a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> of a story but a lot of cheese and soft-core action with poor Larry who is manipulated by Amelia through Erica's resurrection who intends to kill him the first time she turns her back. Amelia is a bit out of her head not knowing exactly who she is and who is not a threat to her. Amelia even manages to convince her poor and innocent gardener Stan, Michael Parks, to lose her family in a bloody home invasion, then her mind, accused by the police of being the murderer and, finally, Ameila's life herself . While he is forced to run in the Reynolds house, under his control, he is crazy about a hatter who is trying to kill both her and the unfortunate Hal. <br /> <br /> Larry Parks looked and acted so strangely that you had the feeling of walking by chance on the set of "Sorceress" and of having been in the cast playing his part as Stan. Without the help or benefit of a script, he improvised his way and then slowly realized how terribly terrible the movie was. Stan, who was killed at the beginning of the film, was a great advantage for him since he didn't have to suffer, like those of us who watch, through the whole mindless and upsetting movie. <br /> <br /> It also becomes clear to you, as to the creators of "Sorceress", that all this shenanigan on the screen must reach a sort of hopeful and successful conclusion and that a surprise ending is put to an end at the end of the film. The ending talks about the best thing, besides Miss Blair and the rest of the cast of very wealthy women, which can be said of the film.
