Perhaps this film was actually intended as a satire like "Airplane", but it didn't succeed as if it were a "thriller". I don't understand why they couldn't pay a real pilot a couple of hundred dollars for a little technical advice. Hell, I would have done it for free! This magical plane managed to transform from a 757 to a 767 to a 747 in an hour and the levers of power worked backwards. And the dialogue seems to come from the back end of a "phone" child's game where everyone spoke different languages. Actually I rewind the TIVO and look at it a second time to see if it was as bad as I thought at the beginning. Was.
