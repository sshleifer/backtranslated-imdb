Well, Doris Day "built" (as Ethel S. "Dynamite" Jackson) is mistaken for the theatrical Ethel Barrymore, and falls in love with the dancer Ray Bolger (as S. "Sam" Winthrop Putnam). The old Frenchman Claude Dauphin (like Philippe Fouquet) also digs Doris. Honestly?? What were they thinking? - This wildly inappropriate musical includes Ms. Day gracefully singing the "April in Paris" standard and others. Of course, there is nothing as good as his Columbia recordings of the time; and nothing comes close to the astonishing and imminent "secret love" of the day. Although the material doesn't serve him well, it's nice to see Mr. Bolger perform. Some of the musical numbers are odious. <br /> <br /> **** April in Paris (12/24/52) David Butler ~ Doris Day, Ray Bolger, Claude Dauphin
