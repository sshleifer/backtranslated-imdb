The film Razor Blade Smile has an interesting title and a leading role. Now most of them might not like this film for the plot and the acting was a bit cheap, but that's the attraction of a movie like Razor Blade Smile. In a way it must have been a bad movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you watch this movie until the end you will see that it is like I said a cheap vampire movie with some humor. (The way they manipulated colors in some scenes is also very interesting.) <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, this movie is a guy you rent and laugh with your friends and enjoy what it is . For no film is it really bad. <br /> <br /> As Lilith Silver says: "Humans never smile enough ..."
