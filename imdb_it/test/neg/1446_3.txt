It looks like Dee Snyder ran out of ideas in the middle of the script. The second part of the film is basically just a rehash of the first, which makes the film very boring. To summarize: Cop's daughter is sucked into a party through the chat room where she is sexually harassed / tortured by a psychopath (played by Snider). The policewoman saves her, the psychopath is put into therapy / prison. Psychopath is published four years later and everything is reproduced again. In all this there are many inexplicable plot elements: why was the psychopath "Captain Howdy" the first? What happens to the deviation of the one-time personality for the bottle? How does he kidnap all the adults and can he sew the closed mouth without difficulty? And perhaps the greatest unsolved mystery of all ... how is a man of 6'2 "with pink hair behind a woman of average 5'6" hiding? These are just some of the questions I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that Snyder was trying to make a sort of comment about a) the "dangers" of online chat rooms, b) the hypocrisy of Christian sexual customs and the effect that our twisted society puritan has on us as individuals. If so, he failed. The film is too badly made to entertain, it does not matter to transmit social messages. The torture scenes are stupid and boring, on the verge of nonsense (especially when Snyder enters one of his "pain and death" monologues), and everything else is simply stupid. The call tracing scene is really lame ... when the cops get the caller ID and * 69? The young partner of the main police character is particularly horrible ... in practice he should not work as an actor. And the audio in the final showdown scene is really poor. I guess they couldn't afford two boom microphones? <br /> <br /> The rest of the acting is not terrible, but it's not even nice. The policeman is a beautiful note and his detached quality is not entirely credible. Dee Snyder is not really bad, but he growls and laughs too much. Robert Englund (who deserves much better) stages a rather amusing performance of a hypocritical redneck. If you are a big fan of Robert Englund, the film probably deserves to be seen just for him. All others are forgettable. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, we have seen all these elements of the plot made first and made better, in films like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HELLRAISER and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. I suggest you rent one of those instead of watching this turkey. 3/10. <br /> <br />
