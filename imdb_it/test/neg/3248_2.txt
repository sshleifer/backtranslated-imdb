OK, I would give it a 1, but I'll give it a two because I was laughing while watching this movie ... First of all, I can make a much better film than this ... in a week ... The special effects have made this movie a real joke . You should not make such films with horrible special effects because people will not take it seriously. Even acting and directing were horrible. The script had many holes in the plot and the whole movie was not at all credible. This must be the worst Indian movie ever. The songs were bad too. The acting was bad and artificial. I have to say more. Don't watch this movie if you're not curious to see how ugly it is. That's why I looked at it. I'm going to the movies and I wanted to see how bad a bad movie can be. Trust me, I've seen one of the worst movies in history, if not the worst movie.
