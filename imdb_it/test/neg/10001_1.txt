First of all, I hate idiotic rappers, who couldn't act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads. All they do is curse and shoot each other and act like a clich√© gangster version. <br /> <br /> The film does not take more than five minutes to explain what is happening before we are already in the warehouse. There is not a single sympathetic character in this film, except for the homeless, who is also the single with a half brain. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both hill billie and the character of Sadler is just as bad as the gangsters. I didn't like it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The film is full of unnecessary violence and the specialty of Walter Hills: people who fall from the windows with glass flying everywhere. There is virtually no storyline and it's a big deal when you cheer for no one. Everyone dies except Paxton and the homeless and everyone gets what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The only two blacks who can act are the homeless and the drug addict but are professional actors, not annoying ugly rappers dead in the brain. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this shit and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead. For fear they have characters you care about, sense of humor and nothing but real cast actors.
