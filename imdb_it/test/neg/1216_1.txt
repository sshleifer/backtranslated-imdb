I like to think of myself as a bad movie connoisseur. I like to think that the movies that most people label as the worst of all time I can easily resist. <br /> <br /> But ... there are exceptions. I can only remember three films that I had the misfortune to see that I repeatedly used the fast forward button for great pieces of history. Those films are The Mighty Gorga, Night of the Seagulls and this little shit, Deep Blood. <br /> <br /> In the world of Jaws repaints, this falls off the scale. Deep Blood does not have the realistic plot of the original crocodile, nor the incredible effects of The Sea Serpent, nor the comment of Tintorera. No, instead, we are treated by a handful of teenagers from a failed 1980s sitcom that clashes with the bullies and the local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Shark attacks are accomplished by quick cuts of documentary films with actors unleashing in the water, occasionally with some of what appears to be orange paint thrown into the water. There is not a minute of original footage of sharks in this celluloid dump. <br /> <br /> Normally, me or someone like me would read a dismal review like this and say "cool, I have to find a copy of this!" It's the same thought I had when I read another reviewer's review on this same site. How wrong I was. <br /> <br /> So ... from a nerd fan to another ... let me collect dust on the shelf ... pick up From The Depths or The Great Alligator instead of satisfying your need for something badly lurking in the water.
