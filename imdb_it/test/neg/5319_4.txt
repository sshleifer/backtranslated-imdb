Peter Hunt started as a very talented film editor and got his first directing attack when he directed the James Bond movie "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" (considered by many Bond fans to be the best of the series). Other films in his filmography include epic adventure films such as "Gold" and "Shout At The Devil", both adapted from Wilbur Smith's novels. "Gulliver's Travels" is a strange one in his movie list; it seems strange that a director of Hunt's style and competence chooses to direct a film of this type. An action in mid-live / the half-animated revisitation of the classic satire by Jonathan Swift, the film seemed twenty years out of date even when it was made, and in all honesty simply does not work. And there's not a damn thing that Hunt (with his usual eye for frantic action), or star Richard Harris (who can usually revive the more rigged roles) can do to save this. <br /> <br /> Lemuel Gulliver (Richard Harris) is a brilliant medical student living in Bristol in the 17th century. His father (Norman Shelley) wants me to go to London to make a fortune; but Gulliver prefers the idea of ​​receiving a rather lower salary but a much larger adventure like a ship's surgeon aboard a ship called "Antilope". During a journey, the "Antelope" is wiped out during a storm and hits a cliff. The ship sinks and everyone is lost, apart from Gulliver ?? which is on the shore in the kingdom of Lilliput. When he arrives, Gulliver discovers that the strange land he landed on is populated by incredibly small humans, no taller than his big toe. For them, it looks like a giant. They persuade Gulliver to help them in a war against another race of tiny people living on an adjacent island. But Gulliver doesn't like to be manipulated for purposes of war and devastation, so he makes plans to escape. Harris is left to bring the whole movie here. His first couple of scenes involve other actors, but once he is shipwrecked in Lilliput, he spends the rest of the film riding his knee set and acting with his animated counterparts. The idea of ​​mixing live action and animation was not new at the time, but certainly not much had been done. Some Disney movies like Song Of The South, So Dear To My Heart and Pete's Dragon had tampered with the idea, but it was still in its infancy. "Gulliver's Travels" is not a particularly animated film, but the scenes showing the interaction between Harris and his cartoon co-stars are at least competently done. Occasionally the film tries to be faithful to its satirical origins (there is a scene in which we learn that Lilliput went to war with his neighbor because of the eggs!?! - and the point seems to be that wars can begin beyond the more ridiculous things). But in his heart, this is a film for children and the satirical nuances are barely lingered. Did everyone involved do better things during their career? "Gulliver's Travels" could fill an otherwise empty afternoon, but apart from that it is a forgettable and overwhelming experience.
