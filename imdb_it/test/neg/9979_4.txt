"Caligula" shares many of the same attributes of the "Fellini Satyricon" of 1970 with bizarre panoramas, oddities and depictions of sexual excesses all set in the "glory" of ancient Rome. But Fellini is not ... First of all it is not so funny. Too much time for the screen is dedicated to McDowell with the rubber face and bully face in the title role. His performance is too blatant and appealing to be convincing. The portraits of Jay Robinson in "The Robe" (1953) and David Cain-Haughton in "Emperor Caligula" (1983) are much more persuasive and credible, the latter being the most nuanced. The relief could have been judiciously provided by developing the surrounding characters more completely. As it is, I am little more than cyphers. An example is the role of Macro, played by Guido Mannari who has an extraordinary presence on the screen in an important role, but is largely left in the background. The only positive credit features are the skillful use of some Prokofiev and Stravinsky themes in the soundtrack and the inclusion of some of the unpleasant but still accurate deeds of the despot. These two factors are much less than is necessary to alleviate the prevailing boredom, however.
