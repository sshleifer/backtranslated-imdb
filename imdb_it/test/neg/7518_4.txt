Time Machine starts in New York in 1899, where Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) proposes to his beloved Emma (Sienna Guillory) that he accepts, unfortunately after being attacked by a robber and Emma is killed and dies in Alexander's arms . Jump forward 'Four years later' and Alexander built a time machine he uses to travel until the night Emma was killed to save her, but this time she is still killed, only in a different way. Alexander realizes whatever he does, but many times he comes back Emma will always end up dying in one way or another and he wants to know the answer so that he travels far into the future to discover the truth. However, after destroying the moon, two new races have evolved on Earth, humans like Eloi and the monstrous Morlock eating Elois. Alexander decides to stay and save Eloi. <br /> <br /> Directed by Simon Wells who is actually the great-grandson of the author HG Wells who wrote the original The Time Machine book in which the original The Time Machine (1960) the film was based and is in fact the 1960 film that producer John Logan's screenplay is based here rather than the original literal source of Wells. While all three share the same story and the same ideas, this remake adds the subplot on the betrothal of Alexander, Emma, ​​who is killed and this is why he invents a time machine rather than simply because he is intelligent and can to do it. The script is a mixture of science fiction, action adventure and drama, none of which really took me or hired that much, of course there are some special effects, some action scenes and the moment when Alexander's question comes explained on why he can't save Emma is actually pretty smart and it makes sense never caught my imagination and I've never really been touched by it. The Time Machine aspects of time travel are very similar to Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1992) in the sense that you cannot change the past but at the same time the future is not set only The Time Machine is not at all as close as a good movies like Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The character is fine even though I thought Guy Pearce was too young to be an intelligent scientist capable of inventing a time machine and there is never a real explanation behind mechanics, because it's like for a moment there was not a time machine the next one who invented and made one and works perfectly. I suppose the Back to the Future trilogy offers a lot more excitement, laughter, excitement and general entertainment value than The Time Machine he ever does and while I stop before calling it a bad movie since it moves at a decent pace, says a history is reasonable and has its moments I wouldn't call it brilliant or even particularly good. There is also a small, cheeky reference to the original book and film that are both controlled by the name here. <br /> <br /> The advantage of this modern version over the original is the development of special effects and in particular CGI which leads to scenes of the time that pass quickly around Alexander in his time machine complete with huge buildings in construction, new ridges, canyons and mountains that form and an elaborate pan back that ends in space as we see passenger rockets in orbit around the moon. The effects work well, there are one or two moments that seem a little below average, but in general the effects are good. I saw The Time Machine on telly and the station sounded bad and scanned it so that the left and right edges of the frame were cut off the screen, cutting off part of the year on Alexander's time machine dial. so I didn't really know what year it went? Apparently director Gore Verbinski has filmed the last eighteen days of filming as Wells suffered from "extreme exhaustion", while IMDb says the time machine itself was the largest and most expensive construction ever built for a film at that point I find it hard I think Guy Pearce broke a rib during a fight scene but as a soldier carried on. <br /> <br /> With an alleged budget of around $ 80,000,000 the production values ​​are high with a New York period recreated with love and good effects even if Surprisingly The Time Machine was nominated for an Oscar for best makeup artist, but was defeated by Frida (2002). The acting is mixed, Jermey Irons performs well in a terrible trick that makes him look like a rejection of a Lord of the Rings movie while vocalist Samantha Mumba makes her big-screen debut here and it's just terrible even though Guy Pearce is quite good and quite nice. <br /> <br /> Time Machine is not a particularly bad or particularly beautiful film, just a bit trivial that is watchable and spends an hour and a half but not much else. Look again Back to the future (1985).
