Don't worry, there is no spoiler here, only that there is a very predictable plot. A couple decides to live in her father's love nest so they can write a book / article / newsletter about her adventure with a famous tragic Hollywood actress. All this production went as a troupe of a high school doing an episode of "Murder She Wrote". The only acting I was sold on was the old fogy they interviewed for the story's sources. Apparently the filmmakers thought the film was becoming too long, so towards the end they stopped pointing the camera at a kind of disturbing image of the star and brought plot promoters to wrap this thing up. Don't waste time - even tried and true horror / intrigue classics fail in this film.
