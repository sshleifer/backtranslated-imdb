The interpretation of Danny Lee as a spirit policeman is the only point of interest in this film, although he has an excellent cast including Chow Yun-Fat, Carina Lau, Andy Lau, Shing Fui-On and Alex Man. CYF plays a triad boss who wants to settle in a life of peace and abundance, but Alex Man, a psychopath who has a big grudge against CYF, won't let him. CYF tries to escape to Malacca but without success. After his family was blown up, his comrades dead or turncoat, injured and broken, CYF returns to Hong Kong to get serious revenge. <br /> <br /> It looks much better than it is. CYF is well dressed and handsome, he looks pained, grimaces and screams at the right time, but you are not interested in one way or another. Andy Lau is beautiful, but that's all. Carina Lau has a small, tiny part that was beautiful, but gets a bullet in the head soon so it ends. Alex Man is a cartoon villain who is so exaggerated that he can sometimes be intriguing, but the writing here is so flat that he comes across a garden variety. <br /> <br /> Danny Lee is great though - too bad it's just a small blip on the screen of this dark (literally) and essentially boring movie. <br /> <br /> Rent, don't buy it. Or just skip it altogether. <br /> <br /> This is the sequel to "Rich And Famous", although apparently it was filmed simultaneously; it was released first due to the power of the CYF boxoff.
