This film is pathetic not because it is badly directed, played, sung, danced, filmed, etc ... but because it is really difficult to ruin a film using an ABBA soundtrack - but, unfortunately, this is the only thing that the film he can do. The musical presentations in the film, SouthPark, were much better than in Mamma Mia. The director of Mama Mia is proof that you don't need the talent to be a director - all you need is the ABBA songs. <br /> <br /> Just to give an example of what is terrible: an aging of Meryl Streep is shot with close-ups in intense sunlight singing and ruining the song with all the wrinkles that distracts his face. Why do it to one of the most talented actresses out there?
