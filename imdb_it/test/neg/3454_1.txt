Having seen the first scene, I realized that the acting was so bad that it was not possible to resume it later. Superficial and artificial, with frequent attempts to look professional through references to technology in the way a five-year-old tries to make it look like he knows what he is talking about. <br /> <br /> The second-second plot is completely unrealistic and almost every single decision made by the writer was the type expected of a lower-than-average level student. The general plot was not original and predictable like a sausage pack. The few attempts to make intelligent dialogues were limited to neurotic and apologetic behaviors. At ten you might like it. But it would take a child of five to accept the lack of realism; How the advanced cell function allows someone to bypass a code block by touching it as if it were a magic wand, selecting one of the hundreds of voices through a ventilation system (tearing off Superman) and repairing a home computer simply by detecting thing? wrong instead of looking for flaws? In fact, that scene is a clear example: the fault was that one of the cooling tubes (aluminum strips) on the CPU was broken, as it would be if an exhaust pipe on a V8 engine were torn by an explosion. This is something that cannot happen and, if it did, it would not prevent the computer from working. There is no electric current passing through this tape, but when he (without doing it alone, his arms worked on autopilot because his body cells were super efficient) he put a push-pin in the tear, a desktop with icons appearing on the screen immediately without booting. <br /> <br /> And so it goes all the way. Like when he escaped from an interrogation room in the NSA headquarters by lighting a lighter under a fire sensor, leading to open doors throughout the building. Of course, the NSA has not foreseen this acute and cunning approach to escape, nor has it put any guard out of his room (or anywhere else) to defend against a breakthrough in military nanotechnology. So he went out and took a taxi. Examples like this are not just numerous, in fact there is no single scene that makes sense. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the so-called big effects were terrible. He threw a basketball for a child in the park, and the child was thrown back 20 feet horizontally on a tree. No acceleration or deceleration, but constant speed and height, like a motorized cart. I'm sure that if I stopped and looked for the cables that held this child's posture as only the cables can, they probably didn't know how or how to completely erase them. If someone is thrown so far into a tree, he would at least say ahi (or rather be hospitalized with broken bones), but the child was just confused and amazed. <br /> <br /> Moronic. This is the word for every creative decision taken during the entire production. I'm going to put the director's name on my personal blacklist, someone as poorly able as he can't improve. I want to ask for compensation for wasting 45 minutes of my life to watch it and the time it takes to write this. Although he felt therapeutic, it was traumatic to realize how little it takes to get a pilot approved. The only excuse for a slightly intelligent person may have to see it voluntarily, it would be imprisonment or lobotomy.
