We've all seen the bad movies, well, this takes the cake. I saw that box from the Junior movie looking back many times from my many trips to the horror section of the local video store, and it interested me a little, it seems to be a tribute to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so I thought I understand it. Am I wrong! Junior sucks, long and hard. In other words, it's really bad. Although I win my prize for the most creative use of a bikini. TO AVOID!!
