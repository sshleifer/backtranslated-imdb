Anyone who thinks that Kool Moe Dee, Carol Alt and Corey Feldman understand a list of good actors must smoke something that I would like to try one day. Where to start: lousy soundtrack, acting with the hammam, "action" in some places. This is the typical type of amateur butcher meat written by those who washed the stars was and never was the love of acting. Actually I felt embarrassed about the "stars" in this "movie". The only actor who was missing from the top of this bullshit was Gary Coleman, who if he had been in the movie would have made him at least a bit terribly ugly, rather than just bad. <br /> <br /> There was a part in the film in which Carol Alt shouted: "DO YOU THINK IT IS A IDIOT?!?" Yes, Carol, I know, your agent does it, and PLEASE for the love of all that is decent and holy ... GO AWAY and stop degrading yourself like this! This film is something that Anna Nicole Smith will take part in. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you what the plot is, but that would be an extra sentence for this article, plus my mind drifted through the movie many times anyway, so I just paid attention.
