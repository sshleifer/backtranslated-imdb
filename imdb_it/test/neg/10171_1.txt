Like many of the comments above me, I also thought it was the average scifi film, but unfortunately it wasn't. I found it rather condescending, and indeed, the sermon. <br /> <br /> But it's not the only comment. The scenes are very 'artificial' (not like in Scifi, as I will explain in a few moments). (The next sentence is a small spoiler). The film is more or less a discussion between two groups. The physical set-up of a discussion generally involves two or three men standing side by side, the central one in general. In the worst case, the other part is represented by one person. <br /> <br /> Interviews with journalists are also very artificial, sometimes even unprofessional. For example sometimes the discussion is among the reporters (I mean, from a point of the interview, 'akward'). Moreover the people interviewed always remain calm, they say everything without normal emotions. I mean you can't say if they lie or not, they're crazy or not. They show almost nothing. <br /> <br /> Even this is very unprofessional, "Christian" journalists always believe everything that is said by the people they interview. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: <br /> <br /> All conversations contain: <br /> <br /> - facts <br /> <br /> - arguments for / against <br / > <br /> There are no lies. No mind. (The next sentence is a spoiler, ignore if you're going to see the movie.) The only lie that's happening is to show how 'non-believers' are bad. <br /> <br /> This leads me to conclude that the film is a B movie. It is very similar to "Plan 9 from Outer Space" (from the 1950s), but this film also has an annoying and incorrect discussion about aliens and on the Christian faith. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I have no intention of insulting Christians, people who believe in aliens or anyone else. This is a thought I have about the film, not about people. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I would like to stress that I don't know if the actors are bad or if they have just received terrible scripts.
