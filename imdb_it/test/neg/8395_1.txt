this film is honestly the worst piece of trash I've ever seen. this is slow, less boring plot. the filmmaker deserved to be shot. There were various aspects of involuntary comedy, one of which was the fact that Jared was strangely encamped. It caused a lot of laughter but also a lot of yawns. don't look at any place with anyone at any time. If you hate someone, recommend buying or renting it. great waste of time and money. Thanks Gus Van Sant ... no. I can't think of anything else to say except that I will never see this movie, it will make you want to jump off a cliff. I hope that Gus and his friends read this comment before it is too late and he does a sequel or some other catastrophe with what appeared to have been shot with a camera phone.
