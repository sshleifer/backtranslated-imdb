Had she not been married to the producer, Jennifer Jones would not have been the obvious choice for the female lead in this tragic story of a relationship between an American soldier and an English nurse, set against the backdrop of the First World War. His British accent is not perfect, and in the fifties it was unusual for a great romantic attraction to go to an actress in the late thirties, even as attractive as Miss Jones, especially when she was several years older than her protagonist. There were a number of beautiful young British actresses in Hollywood during this time, such as Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Jean Simmons and Joan Collins, each of whom could have been more convincing in the role, but Miss Jones had an important attribute that everyone they lacked, ie a marriage certificate with the name of David O. Selznick on it. In the case, the film turned out to be so turkey that they were undoubtedly grateful not to have it on their CV. <br /> <br /> The film tells, in depth, the story of the love story between Frederick, an American volunteer who serves with the Italian army as an ambulance driver and Catherine, a nurse with the Red Cross British. After the Italian defeat at the Battle of Caporetto, Federico is wrongly accused of being a German spy and sentenced to death. (The film paints a very rigid picture of Italian military justice: it would seem that the Italian Court of Justice has the power to pass the death sentence after a trial that lasted all thirty seconds without hearing any evidence and without allowing the accused to be legally represented or to speak in his defense). Frederick manages to escape and cross the border into neutral Switzerland, accompanied by the pregnant Catherine. <br /> <br /> Hemingway's novels have not always been a great success when shot. Howard Hawks managed to make a good version of "To Have and have Not", a film that is definitely better than the book on which it is nominally based, but it is because he largely ignored Hemingway's plot and turned the film into a remake of "Casablanca", set in Martinique rather than in French Morocco. Like the 1943 version of "Per chi suona la campana", "Farewell to Arms" is a slow and fatal movement. It is also a mixture. Jennifer Jones never makes Catherine come to life. As for Rock Hudson, his alleged Christian name may unfortunately be appropriate. It could be solid as a rock but also impassive as one, and in this film his Federico looks like a representation of the Great Stone Face. Despite the passion and emotion inherent in Hemingway's plot, the emotional temperature is always too cold. The image has nothing to envy to some interesting postcard views of Italian and Swiss landscapes. Not surprisingly, it wasn't a success and his failure put an end to Selznick's career as a producer. 4/10 <br /> <br /> A taste. Shortly before the battle of Caporetto, an Italian official said that Russia had already concluded a separate peace with Germany. That battle began in October 1917, at a time when Kerensky's Russia was still fighting alongside the Allies. The Russian revolution did not take place until November; it was only the "October Revolution" of the old Julian calendar. The new Bolshevik regime signed an armistice with Germany in December 1917, but a separate peace was not signed until the Brest-Litovsk Treaty of March 1918
