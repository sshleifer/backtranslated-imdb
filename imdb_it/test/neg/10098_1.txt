2001 was perhaps not the best year for Eric Roberts. Both Raptor and this one came out. I looked at Raptor some time ago and really thought it sucked and being Erics the worst. But this shared his moment of fun and D-standard. This has nothing. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Thomas is the name of the actor probably worse these days. The story has no punch and everything seems even slower than a snail that breaks into curves. <br /> <br /> The two things that stand out are Martin Kove and Eric Roberts. You could argue that their efforts are good or that, compared to the rest, they are mainly criticisms. <br /> <br /> I say thanks Roberts see you next time (and we hope it's better).
