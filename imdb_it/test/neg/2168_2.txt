I understand that this was Llyod Kaufman's attempt to save a movie that was in the pits. The whole film is dubbed because the audio reel was rubbish. The voiceovers were SO bad and terrible quality. As much as you love Troma, they tend to be a little heavy in the voice at work. The acting was terrible. One thing I liked about this film was the quick cameo by Trey Parker who made the aristocratic line with a silly wig. There are a lot of great director's guys in this movie like James Gunn and Eli Roth (friends of Lloyd Kaufman). Once again I think this was Llyod's attempt to save a lousy movie and try not to lose thousands of dollars. I won't go on, but this film was a disaster. Check out other Troma titles.
