The Good <br /> <br /> Carrey is a good actor and he showed it in "Man on the Moon" and in "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". But hey, what can an actor do without a good story and a proper direction. Can do "Number 23". <br /> <br /> The villain <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is a poor and overvalued director and has shown this in almost every film he has made. What he did with Batman is just a disaster, but probably the Batman movies should look beautiful. Well, they didn't. Instead of gothic and macabre we have Disneyland. Surely "Falling Down" was great but you can ruin the film with Robert Duvall and Michael Douglas AND with an excellent script? No you can not. <br /> <br /> And so the good actor and the poor director finally met and did the "Number 23" ... <br /> <br /> The Ugly (23) <br /> < br /> I know it is stupid to begin with but ... the Fingerling subplot (almost half of this film) looks exactly like the introduction of another chapter of Max Payne2. VoiceOvers, quality of the detective novel, character quality, even color, mood and music, editing and sound mix! Maybe it works for the game, but it's definitely not in the cinema. <br /> <br /> The staging is so bad that it becomes fun. It's not even annoying. Does Carrey law walk down the stairs in the park? Why? It's natural? No, but it looks good. Why suicide the blond-covered walls in his apartment with white paper? If she just wanted to kill herself? There is no logic in this, but it still looks good. Guess what, it doesn't look good at all. Instead it seems unnatural. <br /> <br /> All female characters are flat. Because that's how it is? Who cares, let's get on with the story. <br /> <br /> Who is this Fingerling? Private eye to suicide? Hardly credible. <br /> <br /> The scenes in which Walter Sparrow is discussing with his wife about the book of time is actually about him could be the best part of this movie. Instead we get the Moulder / Scully routine. Disappointment. <br /> <br /> Interiors have no sign of people living in them, except for significant objects (shoes, photos, etc.). Difficulty. <br /> <br /> Dialog boxes are not that bad. But what about V.O.? Well, that's another story. "Destiny does not exist, there are only different choices". Obvious captain for the rescue! "The number was coming after fingerling and now it was coming after me." Cliche. And so on. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the average housewife would break into the public building in the middle of the night. Success and undisturbed. <br /> <br /> The subplot of the dog that drags the main character into the cemetery. This is so old trick and so comfortable for the writer, and that it should have been banned. I say! <br /> <br /> Flashback and editing similar to "what happened in the last episode of X-files" is not the best way to present the most interesting part of the film. IS '? <br /> <br /> I wish I could say that this story deserves a better destiny, but it is not. It does not make sense. Said in chronological order it is weak and unbelievable. All the time in which undeveloped characters are trapped is a chain of situations that are nothing but fiction written poorly. It might be fun, but - since the whole movie really died - it's not. For many coincidences it is just bad for every story. And the "mystery"? It is predictable and easy to guess. <br /> <br /> Losing contact with reality is a great theme for a good movie, but I've never seen anything like it in Hollywood productions. If you are interested in the subject look at "Repulsion" by Polanski or something by David Cronenberg, "Spider" or "A History Of Violence" both films deal with similar problems that "Number 23" wanted to show. Wanted, but failed.
