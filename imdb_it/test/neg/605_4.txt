"When a Killer Calls" is an unusually bad slasher film, with some very unpleasant and disturbing sequences. The decision was clearly taken to try to collect the remake of "When a Stranger Calls" by inserting almost - word by word - the telephone sequences of that film. They seem very forced. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the director commits the cardinal (but all too common) sin of having friends of the heroine who make repulsive scoffs. So, for the beginning of the film, we like it a lot and are cheering on the baby-sitter (a nice, believable job from Rebekah Kochan), but then she is joined by teenage slasher friends and the mood is ruined. <br /> <br /> The type of movie works, but it's probably a lot more unpleasant than you'd expect, so be warned.
