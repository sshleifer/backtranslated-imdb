OK this will contain spoilers. Now I've never seen such a big pile of poop since the laxative / feed mingles with the elephant enclosure in the zoo! It has more holes in the plot than those consumed and for the "realistic" plot. Well, sexual slavery is a terrible and very real world problem and this bilge pile uses this plague as a plot device to titillate and tease, shame for all concerned for that questionable piece of judgment. But back to the movie, if you were going to kidnap people from an airport, by the way, some of the safest and happiest camera locations in the modern world, then why plant a stoolie inside the van that pisses everyone off until the plot needs a breakthrough. Wait to be outside the airport, pull the gun, handcuff the passengers, calmly drive to the warehouse and kill the boys, work done. As for the passengers, on at least three occasions the good guys have bad villains and are armed, WASTE! Once in a movie, it may be acceptable not to put a bullet in the skull of villains, but COME THREE times! And after he killed most of you. The boy is also willing to put the gun down to stop a scarred cheek, but he kills a girl for a yeast infection that could be clarified with a $ 20 dollar drug. I could go on and on about the amount of holes in this, but I won't waste any more time. Suffice it to say that I have rarely been so insulted by such a frightening piece of nonsense and by the real problem of sexual slavery, the girls go voluntarily to new "jobs" in distant lands and are raped, raped and often killed by the master band that meets them from boat / plane and take their passports and freedom. This is an insult to all those whose lives have been affected by this! Do not waste your time!
