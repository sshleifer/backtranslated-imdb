<br /> <br /> to make this short and sweet: I hope that this film will not be considered the fundamental work for the "general Asian" of American cinema. the acting was sub-par, relying on stereotypes, raised voices and exaggerated disdain to express his message. chris chan park does not delve into any of his characters, allowing them to remain caricatures of angry / frustrated / distant / non-communicative Asians. these representations do not render the characters mysteriously attractive; it makes them confused and unpleasant. I like to think that we Asians are more complex than that. <br /> <br /> I came out of the unconvinced movie. not convinced that these characters had a long life, half-brother as a connection to each other to do everything possible to help their friends out. not convinced that the protagonist had something that went beyond the superficial attraction of his girlfriend. not convinced that hardworking immigrant parents do not pay for their child's university education. not convinced that all the characters were even necessary, for example: janet, which is put to bed in the back of the car and quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> the plot, which in reality I think had potential, was not allowed to come into its own for two reasons: 1) flat characters for which I had no sympathy / affinity, 2) the plot is obscured from scenes with no meaningless sequitur, like the sequence of seance / donut shop with amy hill that was simply ridiculous and superfluous. <br /> <br /> I recommend the park for its efforts, as I am sure that it took a lot of hard work to produce the film as well, and I will also give it the benefit of the doubt this time around as a newcomer director / screenwriter, but I sincerely hope that next time he will go a little deeper. just because the film is one of the first of its kind on the Korean American experience, it does not mean that it is automatically good.
