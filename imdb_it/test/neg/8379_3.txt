The two most noteworthy things about "I Will not Play" are: he won an Oscar for best short film with two reels of 1944; and was directed by Crane Wilbur, leader of the silent era. The plot of this run-of-the-mill short is irrelevant, the dialogue lacks spark, while the acting is no better and no worse than that found in most of the Hollywood movies of the 40s (in other words it's terrible) . Of course, there are moments when "I Will not Play" is fun - the totally artificial aspect of Janis Paige and the delivery of the line are precious - but we laugh at the image, not with it.
