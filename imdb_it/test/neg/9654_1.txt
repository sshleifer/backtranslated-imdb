I bought this because it was $ 1.99 and Harry Carey was in and there was a friend of mine, and for $ 1.99, how bad could it be? Then I read some comments here on the film and started getting excited - maybe this was really a lost gem, one of those fantastic little B-movies that everyone had forgotten about but deserved to be resurrected. MISTAKEN! I'm not sure how anyone else can give this thing the praise it received somewhere here, but I found it one of the most boring and blatantly wet movies I've ever seen. And I'm not talking about Richard Carlson's Texan accent (directly from Texas in Georgia, I guess). It's just stupid. No one in the film behaves like a real human being. Nobody. And nobody does anything credible or interesting. It is not even a clich√©-fest. It's just 80 minutes of frames passing. He even managed to make Harry Carey, Maria Ouspenskaya and C. Aubrey Smith boring. Now it's unbelievable.
