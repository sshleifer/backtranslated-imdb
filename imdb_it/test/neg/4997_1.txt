Hey, I'm a fan of such good movies, but there's nothing so ugly and beautiful about Rise Of The Undead. It's just so ugly and that's it. No cheese to redeem, no involuntary humor, nothing! - Boring apocalyptic zombie (The "Undead": few people with almost no make-up) meaningless with crooked special effects (if you can call those effects), stupid plot and annoying actors. They also have the courage to snatch and quote from other (better) films (Resident Evil, Dawn Of The Dead and Night Of The Comet) and managed to get me to sleep on the side. However, it was Rise Of My Eyelids once the credits were launched. My advice: save your money It's not even worth hiring it, unless you want to go away and / or put some people to sleep, then go ahead and give it a ride. You have been warned;)
