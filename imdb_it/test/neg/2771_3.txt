Obviously this was a fairly low budget production, but the cast was pretty decent, the basic premise was promising, and something more could have been done with it, but the script was not so great - the plot is inconsistent and it almost seems casual times and dialogue are rigged and terrible. <br /> <br /> Basically, a girl's father is beaten by fellow gangsters, and later becomes a robber, and wants to avenge his death, and then enters a mob racket protection involving corrupt politicians. <br /> <br /> Alan Ladd gets top billing, but he really has a very minor role. <br /> <br /> I must say that I found it slightly funny in its archaic B-grade hokiness but it's really poor and pathetic.
