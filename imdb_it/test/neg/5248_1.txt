By hiring this video for the film, I didn't expect a fantastic piece of cinematography. (Not to mention just because a film is in the cinema it will be.) Only by vaguely following the story told in the epic poem, this film offers a unique view of the tale of monsters and super humans. General photography can be summed up as confrontational, with its mixture of medieval and post-apocalyptic (reminiscent of Mad Max). With a rock and techno soundtrack to start from, one moves away feeling a little off. The fighting scenes, though incredible, are fun, and Christopher Lambert has some of the most interesting combinations of weapons I've ever seen in movies, though often a little unfathomably inefficient. The special effects used for the Grendel monster are surprisingly effective and are one of the few highlights. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert offers an average performance like Beowulf. It won't be nearly as memorable as Highlander, but at least it's not as poor as the Fort. The supporting cast is rather neutral. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good story of action and adventure with a complex and engaging storyline, I would not suggest this movie. However, if you want a film that is of little substance, full of campy battle scenes, and a rather predictable plot, find a copy of this.
