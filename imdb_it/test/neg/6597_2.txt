Even though I sat looking at the whole thing, I have to say that it wasn't nice. It was everywhere, with large pieces of missing information on how things developed and even inaccurate in some bits. If you don't know anything about Michael, you won't understand anything. You have to rely on your current knowledge of that man to make some bits make sense ... Acting was a bit dramatic, Flex Alexander didn't look like Michael, who was discouraged for me and seemed literally gray at the end he portrayed Michael as a somewhat naive, but very positive, kind and loving individual he was okay even though they sometimes made fun of him. If you want to see the life story of MJ, take a look at "An American Dream". It's much better, but the only thing is that it will cover the "bad" era. I have no doubt that in the end they will make a big budget film about the life story of MJ, so Michael You rock ;-) !!!!
