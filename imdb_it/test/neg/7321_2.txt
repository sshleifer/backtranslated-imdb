I watched this movie on video with a couple of friends as part of a triple teenage comedy header, along with Dorm Daze and Going Greek. Obviously we were not going for the quality, but for entertainment with empty heads and coarse gags. In general we got what we came for, but Wild Roomies really stood out: to be bad. <br /> <br /> First impression first, the cover: the cover of the Norwegian edition showed covered breasts and a bunch of seemingly "crazy" roomies in the background; Show pictures of drunk semi-naked teenagers making bunches of funny stuff, right? - The "crazy" roomies on the cover were not even present in the picture. And the fun things you think they'll do? Absent as well. <br /> <br /> This movie has been labeled as a comedy, which is a bit odd since it's not even remotely funny. The relational drama would be more accurate. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is about a young couple who inherit a sloppy house in Los Angeles, and are forced to take some roommates to make ends meet. These roommates eventually put the young couple's patience and relationship to the test because they are so "wild". The problem is that they are not. And here is the problem of this film: the protagonist couple is so anal-retentive and neurotic as to be able to generate zero sympathy. You'll find yourself cheering on the roomies that are antagonistic in the middle of the movie. Add mediocre acting, lame dialogues and boring direction and you find yourself a movie that is better not to see. <br /> <br /> Look at something else.
