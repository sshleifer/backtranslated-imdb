A box with a button offers a couple the opportunity to be financially free, but the cost is the life of someone they have never met. This is a very boring movie to watch. Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed it, decided to make a film without compensation. You are taken for a lap of slow accumulations, one after the other with minor revelations at best. At certain times, I thought to myself, this will have great meaning in the end, but nothing does. The film leaves only one thought: "This story could have been told in 30 minutes, without all the nonsense extended". I hope you avoid this terrible movie and keep your sanity.
