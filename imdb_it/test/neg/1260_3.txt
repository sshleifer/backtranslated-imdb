This was more of a love story than one about an angel coming down to earth, although both corners of that story have a good part of the film. <br /> <br /> If I took this film to heart, as someone who knows and believes in the Bible, I would have quickly boxed it, but I don't think the general atmosphere was either mean or blasphemous. He was simply ridiculous or just stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean, is John Travolta a dirty angel? The smoke? Scratching his groin? Quoting the Beatles? A "warrior angel" who knows nothing about Heaven? An angel that flirts with all women? Yes, it is all absurd and certainly biblical - incorrect. <br /> <br /> I could tolerate all this, but I don't know how many people, whatever their beliefs, who could stand a boring film that turned out during the second half of it. He begins to drag when the romance between William Hurt and Andie MacDowell begins. Some dialogues during that love story are so stupid as to offend any discriminating spectator. <br /> <br /> This is another film directed by Nora Ephron. Dude, I can't believe how many incredibly stupid movies this woman has written or directed. At least she's consistent.
