I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life. Movie date. It was bad But this ... this is just ... not good. House Party 4 is the worst movie ever. It's that simple. It is basically Ferris Bueller with people of color. Oh, and it's not funny. It's horrible. Terrible. Chris Stokes could be a superstar on BET, but he's an idiot. He can't write a play. Or a horror movie. I like to call it a blacker and less known Uwe Boll. Except that Uwe Boll's films are horrible fun, if you understand what I mean. You can invite some friends, take a jump in Alone In The Dark and have fun laughing and eating snacks with your friends. Chris Stokes is like that, except if you invite friends to watch House Party 4 with you, nobody will laugh. Not even the black bachelor party or the illiterate athlete. I'm serious, I didn't laugh at this movie once and for all. The acting is terrible and the film looks like a bad independent film. What was the budget for this film? $ 5 damn? I mean, what the hell? This movie sucks; don't waste your time with this shit. That's disgusting.
