I am a keen movie watcher and enjoy a wide variety of films. However, I found NO enjoyment in this movie. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I don't think he had much of a storyline, the characters weren't funny and the relationship between the characters was dysfunctional at best, and the ending didn't make me love the movie more. It is certainly not in the same category as "The Cave" that was, in my opinion, the best cave film ever made. Even "The Descent" was better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It was a waste of the $ 3.79 rental fee and my time to watch it. Do yourself a favor and keep from it.
