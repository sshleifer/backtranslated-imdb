Think of this film as serving fans, a dream for the fan of the slasher genre. Let's start with a bloody prologue that is practically foreign to the rest of the film. Nine-month flash forward and the real story line begins: The virgin Mandy Lane is coveted by every athlete and nerd in her school, and is invited to spend a weekend on a ranch with three boys who think they can be lucky, and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and breast size. So ... you have a group of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night, who want to do nothing but have sex, take drugs and drink alcohol. The only other company is a hunky ranch that may or may not be affected by Gulf War Syndrome. Hmm ... potential future suspect maybe? <br /> <br /> As you have probably ascertained by now, all the guests of the house end up being massacred in a variety of bloody ways, and for a change the black man is NOT the first to die. There are some conventions that still hold up, like the newly dressed little girl being chased by a car in a field. Or the lights go out mysteriously in the evening while our "heroes" recklessly separate to face the problem. Even at the so-called shocking turn in the end, the film is like an old 80s horror film updated for the 1950s and is successful on this score. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it also inherits much of the problems of the films of that era, namely the very thin characters and the predictability of the whole enterprise. People are cut, shot, bludgeoned, etc. But because of their innate hatred of the public and the stupidity of being in these situations, it is difficult to take care of them while the bodies are stacked. Someone is killed, one of their friends goes looking for them alone, BANG are black bread. Rinse, then repeat. Maybe one day we will have a script with plausible, intelligent and nice characters that make rational decisions but end up being overtaken by a killer genius. Until then, we must tolerate that teenagers with IQ from the pond life are caught in an unbalanced hooded sweatshirt. Oh well .. 4/10
