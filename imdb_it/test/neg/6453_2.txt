I tried to appreciate this movie. I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as "Big Brain on" Brad in Pulp Fiction. But I didn't care about the characters at all. Kevin Spacey is a sting throughout the film and even discovering some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like it. Especially the ending --- which made me hate even more. It was like watching a bad car accident. Spacey played a puncture well (he does it very well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.
