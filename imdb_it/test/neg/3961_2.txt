The dog can act ... unfortunately no one else in the cast of this sordid children's movie can do it. A stray but very intelligent dog creeps into the life of two motherless children, to the great regret of their bitter and cold-hearted father. In what can only be described as Dickensian, the wicked widower prohibits his children - who may or may not be mentally challenged - from playing with Benji. Neither the children nor Benji obey. Soon the children are kidnapped and Benji has to help the police find them. It is only then that the old man understands that Benji is good, not bad. <br /> <br /> Tom Lester, whose only previous acting experience seems to have played the mediocre Eb on GREEN ACRES, plays one of the kidnappers. So unfortunately Deborah Walley used too much. The previous triumphs of the Walley screen include BEACH BLANKET BINGO and the painful IT'S A BIKINI WORLD. He also played both Gidget and Tammy in the past and here he tries to erase the reputation of his good girl by playing badly! <br /> <br /> STAY away from BENJI ... it's a dog and this movie is a dog!
