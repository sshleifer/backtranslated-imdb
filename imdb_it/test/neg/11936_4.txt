The director was probably still in his early stages of learning when he tried his hand at westerns. Take a look at the clothes. They all look well washed, well-combed, well-dressed and well-ironed, as if they were ready for the church. Even the horses seem well cared for and shining. This is a WESTERN, for crying out loud! It should look dusty, bad and sweaty. And then there's the amateur acting of the females in this bird. The whole lot, about a dozen, all beautiful and well endowed, have just been raped and widowed, but hardly a tear runs. Instead they all look with great interest (if not even lust) at the seven wonderful newly arrived who later nurture, blindfold and comfort with love during their battles with the bandits. The same criticism of the director is directed to Lee van Cleef, who does an excellent job of acting. Our Lee, who plays the law, has just lost his dear wife. But Lee, hard as organic rock, shows no emotion and is just a few days after the death of his wife in the arms of a juicy widow with whom, together with his brood, he moves towards the future. The cad. And then there is another thing that always bothers me with this type of film: no matter how many dynamite-induced explosions take place in the middle of a pack of about 50 horses, no matter how many shots are shot at the mob above them , only the scammers are killed and the nags always go to rejoice in one piece. (I know ... silly moi ... it's just a movie ...). It is not the worst western ever made, but to prepare for some serious yawning.
