When you see Barry Corbin in a movie cast, you can never be sure if it will be a classic or a junk. Guess which category falls ONLY. Apparently derived from a popular science fiction novel, WEAPON, SOLO plays Mario Van Peebles as a human-looking robot who decides to think for himself and is therefore destined for elimination. He hides in a Mexican village, obviously to save money in places and extras. Paying in pesos is cheaper than paying in dollars, I suspect. William Sadler is on his way, as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy Van Peebles. Van Peebles manages to beat them all easily, of course, while Corbin watches all this while having fun from afar. The film is a horrible rip-off from THE TERMINATOR and CYBORG series, and apparently has little to do with its source material. It is written and recited in a horrible way, and the great fight at the end is decidedly comical. Van Peebles, a decent actor elsewhere, is a scream pretending to be a robot covered in synthetic meat. Looks like he's doing the Robot Dance most of the time.
