What a terrible movie this was! I did it for about 50 minutes and started to skip the chapters to the end. The plot is nothing special, and the dialogue of the film differs from the main story so much that your head will explode with anger. Many useless minutes wasted just listening to the characters discussing something irrelevant to the plot, AND / or something that could be said in a shorter period of time. The camera work is flaky and grainy. It seemed that Mr. Milligan needed to take his finger off the zoom button! I also noticed that at some points during this film it seemed that Andy was in crisis and would shake the camera uncontrollably. The joints between the scenes were nervous and did not flow. The crime scenes were nothing special - incredibly, and ridiculously fake. Almost no blood, as the title suggests. This film takes about 1 hour and 20 minutes and the murder scenes take about 1 TOTAL minute of the entire movie - if that. What a miserable piece of trash this movie was. Andy Milligan is probably one of the worst directors to afflict humanity with his talentless direction and camera work. Usually, I can go through really bad horror movies, and laugh about it later. But I can't do butter masters. I'm just angry I spent an hour and a half of my life looking at this (which I wouldn't do to get it back). Accept my suggestion and DON'T watch this movie if you're not going to fall asleep. TERRIBLE.
