Gordon Scott with his well-combed hair, the hourglass figure and the strange English pidgin must be the worst of all Tarzan. As for the other actors in this mess, they are on a par with any grade 4 grade school acting class. I've seen used car dealers in TV commercials that can do better. They make Clayton Moore look like Laurence Olivier! And where did Jane (the boring Eve Brent) take her lipstick and eyebrow pencils in the jungle? I realize that these were made for children but Wow! The plot seemed OK but the director should have asked more of his actors. I realize that even Weissmuller's films have some flaws, but this seemed so "low budget".
