Martin Lawrence is not a funny man I Runteldat. He only has too much time on his mind and he is too crazy to have his word games beat at the beginning of the game. Try to make fun of the critics, who boil down to "fuck you". Then it continues with rather primitive sexual jokes about smokers with throat cancer and from there it only goes downhill. 3/10
