This is perhaps the most ridiculous crap I've ever seen. Three unrelated stories about completely stupid and random things are occasionally interrupted by a bus and a boring monologue about a fool's relationships. Christ knows why so many people have been involved in this. Highlights: green fridge man reading Jean-Paul Sartre, the slob mans dinner guest and his products for horse manure products, an unreasonably unreasonable woman in the third short, who suspected an unfair gambling man just to be interested in generic activities, blowers. <br /> <br /> I need to use other lines in appearance, so I could also mention some more stupid things about the movie. The first film involves a man driving a talking machine and obeying his unreasonable demands for absolutely no apparent reason. The only way to watch this movie is if you were blind and had other debilitating defects in your personality and in your brain. It is a bit funny in an ironic way, but also extremely tired, like being forced to chew for a long time on a stained carpet.
