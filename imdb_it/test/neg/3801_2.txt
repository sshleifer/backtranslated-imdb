Sequels, well there are many reasons to do them, but what went through Irwin Allen's mind to come up with such a boring idea is beyond logic. There are so many answers open to this film that it's ridiculous ... like the Poseidon, which is a monstrous ship with passengers drifting on the sea and only Michael Caine with his miniboat and a bad Telly Savalas discover the boat ... well, at the beginning the French marine is flying over the wreck with their helicopter but while a sinking cruise ship is a daily thing, they fly away ... What am I trying to say ??? Hmmm, Michael Caine joins Sally Field and could collect everything he sees (diamonds) if there wasn't a Telly Savalas looking for weapons on the ship ... my God, why am I really wasting my words here? It's ridiculous and knowing that both Field and Caine are involved makes you think about what went through his mind when reading scripts ... certainly not diamonds ....
