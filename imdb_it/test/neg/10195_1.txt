How terrible is it? Let me count the following ways: 1) It is a bait-and-switch film that starts from the UFO survey, then turns into a high-pressure sales job for Christianity. Come on, come on! If the creators of this film felt their message so strongly, why mask it? It annoys unbelievers and pushes the guards in the opposite direction. 2) It's not even a good sales pitch! If the characters in this movie asked me to go to church with them, I would run like hell in the opposite direction. They are scary! 3) Acting is terrible. They all behave as if they were in an educational movie about work etiquette. 4) Cinematography is a bad home-film. Wait, it's actually not even that good. 5) Bad, bad, bad script. All the dialogues, no action. Like a tennis match, they bounce back and forth between the close-ups of the "talking head". 6) Direction ... which direction? Oh, there had to be a director somewhere. I challenge you to understand where. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, I have some positive comments about this movie. The editing seemed professional, but it couldn't make a difference. A good modification of poor material is still a bad movie. The opening theme music was actually very good! Very scary and UFO-ish. Too bad the film didn't concern UFOs. <br /> <br /> If you don't already know, here is the bottom line. I wasted my money seeing this movie, and it made me angry. If they hadn't disguised what this movie really was, I could say it was my fault.
