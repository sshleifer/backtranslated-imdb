First of all, this film is so confusing that it's almost impossible to summarize it, since I myself didn't understand this horrible story. Furthermore, the unknown cast, led by an actress called Laura Mennell, is simply horrible. The expressions and cries of the character of Sara Tobias are ridiculous and ridiculous, grimacing confused with acting. Last but not least, there are many positive reviews on this film in IMDb as follows: <br /> <br /> - Top Notch - Can't wait to see other directors working? the author has only one IMDb review on September 24th 2004; <br /> <br /> - Incredibly filmed, incredibly intense ?? the author has only one IMDb review on 12 August 2004; <br /> <br /> - Not typical blood and blood, indeed better. 7/10 ?? the author has only one IMDb review on February 13th 2005; <br /> <br /> - As intense as the Asian horror !! - The author has only one IMDb review on November 14, 2004. <br /> <br /> Coincidence? Or are the parents, relatives, friends or people hired by the production to promote this shit? My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11.11 ?? A Nova Profecia" ("11.11 ?? The New Prophecy")
