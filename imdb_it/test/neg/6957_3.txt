First of all, this movie leaves you in a wise limbo mood. You don't know what to try. So much so that you don't feel bad for Caines' character when his son is murdered (which was actually mainly due to bad changes). The script was too insignificant. None of the situations are important when you look at them. The soundtrack, or the lack of (if there was not enough to remember) does not help a little. The only surprise of this film was the performance of Andy Serkis. He was on a par if not better than Caine's. The story would probably have been better if Serkis had killed him. Because frankly you don't feel any kind of redemption in the climax. Just a feeling of lack of feeling, if you hear me. Basically this film is massively missing. Leaving the public insane for the whole thing.
