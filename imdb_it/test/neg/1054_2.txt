This is your typical junk comedy. <br /> <br /> There is almost no laughter. No genuine moment. No memorable lines. No scene in which you think of yourself, "was intelligent". Anything. The plot is embarrassingly ugly. <br /> <br /> It's ugly to look at and boring to die for! There is no substance here. This film has nothing. It doesn't matter if Farely was or not in this. A shit movie is a shit movie, no matter who is involved. <br /> <br /> In addition, David Spade is a terribly unfunny comedian who plays the same crappy character as ever in the movie / TV program in which he is. <br /> <br /> This movie was dead on arrival. There is no life here. It's not funny. No intelligence. There are a lot of other "stupid" comedies more fun than this. This film is just pathetic. <br /> <br /> 2/10
