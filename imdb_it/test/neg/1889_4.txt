I've been a fan of classic horror all my life. Many nights lasted until the early hours of the morning watching Universal movies in "Horror Incorporated" and "Creature Feature Night". Unfortunately, I saw this movie in the early evening and yet it almost put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've ever seen a "horror" photo where everything was so important. Dr. Edelmann doesn't seem to believe in the supernatural, but in a short time he is treating Dracula and watching Larry Talbot turn into the Wolfman without blinking. He and Talbot discover Frankenstein's monster as if it were a daily occurrence. Edelmann is all set to bring the monster back to life, but after Talbot, Miliza and Nina protest is like "Aww, you're right, it's not a big deal". After making the betrayal of Dracula, he opens the coffin of the Count in the light of the sun and POOF!, He left, just like that. <br /> <br /> The only person who didn't seem to have phoned only in his lines was Jane Adams as Nina. His reward is bounced from the hump into a hole by Frankenstein's monster at the end of the film ... and nobody even tries to save it! She, Dr. Edelmann and the Monster all perish, while Talbot and Miliza casually leave the castle. Definitely the lowest point for Universal during its classic horror years.
