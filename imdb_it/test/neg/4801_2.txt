This is the kind of film I'm wondering why someone would have thought of doing it from the beginning. This is the kind of movie that I can't understand how people put money into it, how the rental store can put the DVD on the shelves. This is the kind of film I blame for renting it. <br /> <br /> There are good class B movies, and I don't reject the genre. When they are good, they capture the interest with the action, they have pretty well written characters, and they acted well enough to worry about them. The effects in some of these films support the film in many cases and you may appreciate them for their originality. Almost nothing is true in 'Coronado'. The subject and script are on the level of cheap comics - just a clich√©. The effects are cheap - and I don't care that the film has a low budget - you can do a lot with a low budget, but you need a little talent. There are so many continuities and other director errors as in ten other films. You don't care about the characters, you don't laugh, and at the end of the movie you are asked if the parody was intentional or not. The only quality I've found is the scenery, there are some good places, it deserves a much better film. <br /> <br /> 2/10 on my personal scale. The worst movie of the year so far.
