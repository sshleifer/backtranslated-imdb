Coen Brothers-wannabe by screenwriter and director Paul Chart relies too heavily on ideas taken from other (better) films, yet he manages to create an eerie atmosphere that keeps you in sight. Robert Forster frees himself as never before to have played a psychopathic psychiatrist (ha ha) who goes on a murderous madness in the desert. The film is unusual, but in its attempt to keep one step ahead of the public, it becomes alienating and discouraging (with a role for Amanda Plummer that is downright humiliating). A truly skillful ending, many other eccentric businesses - and Forster looks great in the nude - make this object of curiosity, nothing more. The veteran film director Irvin Kershner has produced, and perhaps should also be directed (could Paul Chart be a pseudonym?). * 1/2 from ****
