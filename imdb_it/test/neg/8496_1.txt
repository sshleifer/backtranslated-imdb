Mr. Kennedy should stop running the ExPeRiMeNtIng with invalid movie scripts. What was he thinking? This is a film that shouldn't have passed the "hey, I have an idea, let's make a sequel" phase of the beginning. If there was a ZERO score, I'd give it, but I suppose I'll settle for a generous 1. It seems that these days, if there's a penny to be made, the film performers will recover an old success and run it from a group of writers and see what happens. (Hey, I said "hit and run"! Kind of like I felt when this movie ended!) How come this piece of trash has seen the light of day is beyond me. It is full of unpleasant humor, strange animation and jokes that take you nowhere near a state of confusion. If you get dragged into this movie, and someone pays you ... well ... but it will be even more painful than a brick in the forehead. However, if you intend to pay your hard-earned money, look for a better alternative.
