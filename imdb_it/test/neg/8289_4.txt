The female high school star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in a ruckus against coach George Michaels (Christopher George interprets it as a big head-to-head that is VERY demanding of the athletes under his turn) . He will be fired after the school has committed itself to providing the film with its motivations as a possible murderer. Some twisted sweatshirt psychopaths (more or less as we often see Michaels wear), using a stopwatch to mark his performances, kill the members of the team of athletes that included a dead woman. Soon the disturbed parents called the principal Guglione (Michael Pataki) wondering why their children did not return home after a prom. Inspector Halliday (Carmen Argenziano) starts poking around the campus at the request of worried parents. Immediately a besieged Michaels becomes the first suspect after the body of a gymnast is in a locker. Ensign Anne (Patch Mackenzie) returned home from her base in Guam to receive a diploma as a dead sister and soon confronted the murderer herself in the hunting scene. Kevin Badger (And Danny Murphy) is the tiring boyfriend of the lost track star. <br /> <br /> Slasher slow enough distributes the sequences of death rather a little trying to mix humor inside and rather failing miserably. Sequences of low quality killings only increase laughter, like a sword set in a soccer ball thrown into the stomach of a football player or a pair of garden shears used to decapitate a poor soul who makes a loss. Linnea Quigley has a fun role as a horny pupil Dolores who sleeps with her music teacher to a higher degree and always chases a male (the recipient of the garden shears before she has the chance to sleep at Dolores outside the prom ). Vanna White has an early role here as a blonde blonde who discovers the dead gymnast's body in the locker. Virgil Frye has a foolish role as an inept officer.
