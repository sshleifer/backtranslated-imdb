This film is not even good enough for the $ 1 supermarket basket. I only bought it because Terrence Howard was in it. I guess he couldn't be too demanding about his roles during this time. <br /> <br /> The film itself was difficult to seduce. They seemed to be grabbing the straws with a weft. The "boys' night" had to be the most boring I've ever seen. One minute are they talking and the next acting poetry? The topics were also difficult to follow. Most of the acting lacked depth. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what they were going with this, but they definitely missed the mark.
