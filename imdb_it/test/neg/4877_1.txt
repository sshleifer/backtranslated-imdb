Where do I start. First we list the positive things about this film. <br /> <br /> 1. Mikael Persbrandt is as big as the Gangster Thomas. This is the only character you really care about, and he's a bad boy! (Allthogh never does anything wrong, and is generally a pretty nice guy) 2. Kjell Bergkvist is always great. He's a little tonic here, but he's still pretty funny 3. The film looked pretty good by Swedish standards, good depth of field use and lights. <br /> <br /> Now the villain. This is by far the worst script to do on the big screen ever. Everyone else's acting was rather ugly and exaggerated. The management was horrible. A totally meaningless story, totally unrealistic characters and events and 1.5 hours duration. Almost everyone in the theater laughed during emotional scenes. People have just started going out during the course of the screening. <br /> <br /> There is no way to summarize the story into something coherent, so I don't even try. Every clich√© ever conceived is in there and in all the wrong places. I'm sorry to say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Watch it for a good laugh, but try not to pay money for it;) <br /> <br /> .R
