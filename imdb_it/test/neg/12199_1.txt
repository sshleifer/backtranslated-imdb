Acting 10, Script 1. "Hurlyburly" comes from that unfortunate postmodern theater school that stated that something like a story or plot is forbidden. While people can get away with it on stage, in the film it becomes deadly - or at least deadly boring. We stayed with a group of great actors who talk about dialogues that, if written brilliantly, do nothing. Worse, each character speaks with the same voice despite their backgrounds. The only attempt to differentiate is to have Anna Paquin who uses the word "is not". <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter that the characters are inscrutable losers in the extreme, the camera work is simply sloppy and (for LA residents) the attention to geography is ridiculous. (Hint: the view from Sean Penn's window is about eight miles away from the view from his back window, and you can't drive south through Hollywood and end up at Glendale pretending to be Burbank.) Ok, suspension of disbelief and all that - and normally I wouldn't pay attention to such little things, because they are just production whims. But the fact that so many have remained despite the theatrical pyrotechnic on the screen says a lot about the weakest element of this enterprise - the script. <br /> <br /> In short, skip this, even on the video. Rabe chose the wrong quote from the Scottish game for his title; Hurlyburly would have been better called "A story told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, which means nothing." A little long for the tent, perhaps - but at least it would be an honest advertisement.
