Words cannot describe this film. Loaded with ridiculous stereotypes, a silly storyline, and poor music, this film lacks any category. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by IMDB credits. This is not a Michael Dorn movie. He is a secondary character in the grand scheme. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Credit's is an actor called "Prince" - which makes me think if it's the same artist as previously known as .... I'm not sure it's worth watching this movie just for this . <br /> <br /> Great summary ... group of teams ... one has kidneys ... one has $ 35,000 .... one has an "Illegal Substance" .... and one has $ 350,000 . Add confusion and confusion over who needs to meet who, revenge for being caught, and so, and you end up with this mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> Given a choice, I would like to pass this film.
