The honest young insurance agent Ronald Reagan (like Eric Gregg) is optimistic, but poor. His wife, screenwriter Sheila Bromley (like Nona Gregg), longs for the good things in life. Describing herself as "not weighed down by tons of righteousness," Mrs. Bromley starts spending more money than Mr. Reagan earns. Bromley gets good things in life, but puts the couple in debt. Bromley is a funny shrew. <br /> <br /> The handsome Reagan attracts other women, such as the impatient employee Gloria Blondell (like Patricia Carmody); but it is not granted. To pay the bills, Bromley gets tangled up in the insurance fraud racket, which helps sack her husband. An unemployed Reagan seems to be tempted in a life of crime - will he remain upright or will he be wrong? Clinton Rosemond has an awkward "broken arm" scene. <br /> <br /> *** Accidents Will Happen (1938) William Clemens ~ Ronald Reagan, Sheila Bromley, Gloria Blondell
