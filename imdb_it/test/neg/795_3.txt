Before closing my post as "I don't understand", let me say ... I'm one of Richard Kelly's biggest fans and "The Twilight Zone". Donnie Darko is one of my all-time favorites and I even thought Southland Tales had its moments. I'm a passionate science fiction fan. I was very excited to see "The Box", I couldn't wait for it to come out. <br /> <br /> Having said that ... "The Box" is terrible. Behind "Drag Me To Hell", this was the worst movie I saw in 2009. And it simply DOES NOT FINISH! Whenever you think you have reached the end, another change in the plot and you are ready for further torture. Actually I was crying in the theater towards the end of the film ... I couldn't take it anymore. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with "The Box", regardless of how you affect it or try to justify it is that it simply makes little sense. Trust me, I "understood", I understood what was happening. But this does not mean that it makes sense to look back. Take the basics for example. The main couple ... Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, play Norma and Arthur Lewis. Diaz loses his finances in his work, then complains to his husband that he is "living salary on salary". Well, sell that fucking Porsche that your husband drives then !!! They live in a beautiful two-story house in a beautiful subdivision. Marsden is working on what appears to be a well-paid job at NASA and Diaz is an experienced teacher. And, yes, Marsden drives an overly expensive car. But are they somehow living salary by salary?!? No need to press the button, just reduce your expensive lifestyle a bit! The film would have worked better if they showed the couple unemployed and in serious debt. Instead, they are apparently desperate for money ... living all the time what I would call a luxurious lifestyle. As I said ... you can understand what is happening, but it still makes little sense! This is a rare combination. <br /> <br /> There was a terrible scene in a bookstore that I believe can become one of the worst segments in the history of cinema (in my opinion it was terribly played). He was idiotic, illogical and out of place. I can't even begin to describe it completely, so I'll move on to a subplot involving the blood of the nose and possession of the body by the aliens. (Yes, unfortunately I'm serious). A child is in Diaz's class with a villain and a smile on his face (a sinister smile that apparently goes unnoticed by everyone who has authority in the school). He begins to ask Diaz personal questions, literally embarrassing her in front of his class. No punishment is given to the child whatsoever ... he was not even asked to stay after class for a speech! Then Diaz is at a party ... and the same guy is one of the hired help ... ironed shirt, apron and all! I do not know many children possessed by aliens (who appear to be in Junior High) that even in the moonlight as a bus boy at parties sponsored by teachers and school officials ... but we found one here! (See what I mean ... you can understand it completely, but it still doesn't make sense ... a rare combo!) Like many things in the film, the child comes and goes ... no real explanation about him, no ending with the his character. Going forward ... A lady approaches Diaz in a grocery store, telling her that the experiments are performed secretly and her family is one of the test subjects. Well ... hmmm ... if the aliens possess the powers they can take over a remote body ... and the aliens don't want to help Diaz ... then whoever took over this lady's body and gave advice to Diaz? ! Still ... The lady was trying to help Diaz ... and the aliens weren't interested in helping Diaz ... so who the hell was controlling her body ?! Never explained I never spoke of No nothing again !! It goes on and on like this for what it seems to me, 2 weeks. It wouldn't end! I wonder if this film was the subject of a great job of shooting at some point. It was badly modified. Diaz's accent was there a minute, the next one gone. The secondary plots began but never ended. The numerous rejections of the release date obviously show the problems that the producers had with the finished product. It really is a train disaster. <br /> <br /> Switch to this ... there is no redemption value in it. 3 out of 10, just because I like Diaz and science fiction! But it probably deserves a 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading! <br /> <br /> JD
