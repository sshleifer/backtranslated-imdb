Although Stephen Gyllenhaal is a good TV director with a good deal of credit, "Homegrown" is just a disaster in the script and direction. Despite performances by Billy Bob Thorton, John Lithgow, Kelly Lynch, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ted Danson, such a good cast failed to save the film. <br /> <br /> Gyllenhaalics will know that Jake and Maggie is in the movie, but you don't see Jake very well and Maggie only has 30 seconds in which the babysitter took the Lithgow character off a bust. It is not even a powerful comedy like the film had to be. It wasn't fun
