Before seeing this film, I believed that there were two types of bad cinema. (1) Your average, absolutely uninspired rate (eg "Constantine"), and (2) work that is charmingly bad, or so bad, is good (a la "Manos The Hands of Fate"). Now that I've seen "Dr. Gore", I know there's a third kind of bad movie: the shit sandwich. This will be irrevocably tattooed in your memory. A work that is incisive in an incisive way. Anathema. <br /> <br /> I hated some movies before, but I've never hated a movie so much that my disgust has reached its point of respite and has become the contempt for SELF! Have you seen a movie that not only makes you regret losing the time you spent looking at it, but makes you suffer for another hour? Watch out for the disciples of the Mystery Science Theater, this is a cinema to suck the soul. Go Rent "Circle of Iron" or "The Killer Shrews" instead.
