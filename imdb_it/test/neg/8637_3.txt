When George Sluizer was told he could direct an American version of the book "Het Gouden Ei" / the movie "Spoorloos" (outside Holland, this film also has the name "The Vanishing"), he was told that it would only have passed through if the ending was changed - He was told that "the American public" would not approve the original ending. Of course, the original finish is much better, and without it the film loses its impact. Because I've already entered this in the curiosity section, I don't want to give the original ending and keep my comment without spoiler. If you want to know the original ending, look at "Spoorloos" or read the book. This film is absolutely rubbish and I don't like the first Kiefer Sutherland movie. Watch the original Dutch film, which is one of the best thrillers in the world.
