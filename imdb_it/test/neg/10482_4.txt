Ok, when I bought this movie, I think it should be the last b-movie, the space monkey that lands on Earth and starts killing people right away! <br /> <br /> Well, that was almost everything I expected, a typical low-cost 1960s scifi movie. The acting must be the worst I've ever seen, especially the girl who plays the lead role and the girl who played the maid made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> So, why doesn't "Night Fright" fall into the "so bad it's good" category? The reason is that some scenes were too long and boring. For example, the scene was that police officers were looking for clues in the woods, they were only a few minutes of walking aimlessly. And then the grand finale, people are waiting for the monster for about 5 minutes and when the space monkey appears, it blows up in 20 seconds, at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Yes, "Night Fright" is boring, but it has a couple of fun moments. I can recommend this film to anyone who loved movies like "Zontar, the Thing from Venus" or "Curse of the Swamp Creature". <br /> <br /> I say "Space Fright" 4 slaps Space Monkey on 10.. <br /> <br /> -Rob Gruesome-
