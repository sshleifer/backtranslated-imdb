I only saw the episode of the minimum wage and yet I have no intention of looking at others, how can it be? Morgan begins theatrically to complain about his terrible situation living on the minimum wage at the very beginning of the episode and the complaining never stops. Never. Luckily for the viewer, his thin girlfriend is just as annoying as Morgan (even though she is not even more annoying). <br /> <br /> And then to go to the top, go to the cinema and buy bottled water for 2.50 and then go to a restaurant to eat out while they naturally * drumroll * complain that they are poor. <br /> <br /> I don't care if the other episodes may or may not be better than this. No one should be forced to watch this shit.
