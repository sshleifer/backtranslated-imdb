The two protagonists, an Englishman and an Australian who take up a history of the American civil war in Romania, do not have the slightest spark between them, they are absolutely incredible as lovers and absolutely insensitive. There is no history, no characterization, practically nothing to keep eyelids apart during this interminable fest of boredom. Renee Zelwegger, also hopelessly unfortunate, practically chews the fences, but at least seeing her embarrass alone provides some comic relief. Nicole Kidman has a decade too old for the role and has no idea what's going on. The deficient role of Jude Law could have been played in the same way by all the extra Romanians. The only requirement is to wander through the forest that seems silly while watching a parade of guest stars steal the show. Not that this was important, because all the roles of the stars of the guest star were completely superfluous as they had not advanced the so-called comma plot. And as if all this were not enough, the author felt the need to launch a pirouetting, whirling, kung fu jumping horse. What was it?
