The Greek settings for some parts of the film were very beautiful and the photography got all my votes and this is the measure of my raves for this film. I discovered that all the characters were narcissistic archetypes found so often in American culture and were superficial and uninteresting. Susan Sarandon and Gena Rowlands are easy to look at, but I found their characters very narcissistic and unlikely for many other reasons. When Gena Rowlands sings at a party, I wonder how this woman can think of herself as a real stage star. I was tempted to press the MUTE button until he finished singing. Molly Ringwald was herself and the character of Raul Julia was so indecent as to be absolutely disturbing. The film was too long for my taste and I couldn't play it again even at the point of a gun.
