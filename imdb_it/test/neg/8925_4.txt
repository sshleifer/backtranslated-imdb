Ho Hum. Just another movie with Steven Seagal pretending to be a spiritual being, but hitting heads and killing them like nothing happened. He obviously justifies it in the end by donating the money to an orphanage., What sweetness. Lay the world to waste and we will ignore it if you take care of a little girl. Jeesh! This time, she is partner of Ice Cool (Anthony 'Treach' Criss). I must have someone to put all those lines that lead to the asshole, man, and there are many. The dialogue is pure disgust. <br /> <br /> Follow the villains Nick Mancuso and Kevin Tighe, two people who were born to play the asshole. <br /> <br /> Mari Morrow is squeezing and star awesome soap Sarah Buxton. So cute. <br /> <br /> I believe that if you have a little excitement from July, this may be enough. If nothing else, it will help you graduate in Seagalology.
