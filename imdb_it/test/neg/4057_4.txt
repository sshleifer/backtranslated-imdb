It's amazing what you can see if you wake up at 2 am and turn on the television. I didn't know they showed movies like this. I immediately thought of Roger Corman, who reused film locations or used other film locations for his films. <br /> <br /> The brands of this film could simply move the camera corners and add some time and have a XXX movie. <br /> <br /> There was no story, just a minimal dialogue that led to stripping and sex. I bet there were not 100 words in the whole movie, but surely there were many large busts and hot lesbian actions. There was also a male / female action, but it was only about 25% of the film. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing came to my mind when watching this movie that it might interest those who are buying high-definition DVDs. Sony refused to license Betamax to adult directors and adult films released on VHS. You can guess what happened to the max beta while the adult film industry makes millions of videos. Sony has again refused to grant the Blu-ray license to the adult film industry and has just signed an agreement with Toshiba. You can guess which high definition system disappears.
