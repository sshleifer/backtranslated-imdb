I think we should think about what wonderful salt-and-earth characters. Unfortunately, this is lame and laborious. <br /> <br /> As always with any production set in Newcastle, there are numerous shots of the Tyne Bridge and frequent attempts to show what the great Geordie 'characters' are. The viewer is never allowed to forget where the film is set, as if the rest of the world was interested in Newcastle and its inhabitants. <br /> <br /> If you like well-observed, original and original work, you look great.
