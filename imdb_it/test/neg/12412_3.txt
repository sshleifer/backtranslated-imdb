Ah, another movie with motorcycles, possessions of the infernal angels and Steve A-Lame-o as the not so cool motorist. This film is not based on history, but on drinking, smoking and many moral acts. Steve's surrender of a dying cat during his serenade "I love what I know" made me vomit for hours. The chick Linda (rrrr) takes care of everyone! Fats have acted best since he grunts and makes sounds. I also challenge you to try to understand what Banjo is saying. "You're kidding about a private stock." This is the writing of scriptwriters. <br /> <br /> I liked the ending. What better place to have the climax of a lighthouse! You have to see it to hate it. <br /> <br /> DIE Jeter, DIE !!!
