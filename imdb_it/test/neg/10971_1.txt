This film takes a lot of freedom with known historical facts. Even small things like Flynn that licks one stamp after another, when he would almost certainly use a damp sponge, is one of the annoying things. Flynn was never tried for manslaughter or murder. It is not known that he captured his mother making love with another man, and it is not known that he had a homosexual relationship with anyone, and he did not end up in a crash in Sydney. He did not have his two-and-a-half role in In the Wake of the Bounty of impostures and this role did not turn him into a well-dressed movie star. <br /> <br /> This is just a mediocre film in which the name of Errol Flynn was attacked only to sell more tickets and more videos.
