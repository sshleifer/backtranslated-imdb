Personally, I have not gained much from the ACT OF SEEING WITH YOUR EYES. I have noticed many reviews that are very much appreciated here for the film, and I am rather surprised. Maybe I missed something the other reviewers felt "touched", but I found the movie rather boring and basically useless. <br /> <br /> The "action" of the film is a bunch of autopsy footage shot in a "home art style" - lots of extreme close-ups, weird editing, etc ... and no sound or dialogues. <br /> <br /> I believe that the ACT OF SEEING WITH YOUR EYES can be considered a study of human anatomy, or perhaps (if you really want to dig a little) a sort of comment on the fragility of humanity or anything else - but I have personally discovered that it was a series of semi-interesting films but eventually boring autopsy. If this is your point, then this will be a winner for you. having seen more interesting ER films, not a "bad" film, as it is not really a "film" in the traditional sense - I found nothing really remarkable about it - 4/10.
