A look at the evaluation should tell you that this film was voted by the shills, in an attempt to artificially increase the ratings of this film. <br /> <br /> This film brings nothing new to the zombie genre. In fact, it's ridiculous (in acting and in cinematography) and derivative in the plot. The makeup looks horrible and the zombies look even worse when they are hit. The lines are delivered rigidly and poorly timed, with the exception of the bounty hunter, who is the only good actor in this chaos of a film. The worst offenders are the Italian boy (Hans), Ryn the protagonist and the bad protagonist. I saw a better delivery from the pizza truck with a flat tire. <br /> <br /> It is a self-proclaimed "western zombie", but the only thing that makes this "zombie western" is the fact that people wear cowboy hats and the real name of the main actor is Clint . The protagonist is not as beautiful and mysterious as a traditional Eastwood hero, and as an anti-hero, he does not have the wise attitude to get him out. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the fake brilliant reviews. This is just another level B zombie movie that is competently done for the budget it has had (it has some decent lighting), but it smells like a director, acting and low-budget bad acting. There are a lot of really stupid scenes that make this look really amateur.
