THE AFFAIR is a bad TV movie from the 70s that features the hesitant lovers of Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood. She has poliomyelitis and leads a solitary existence as a writer of pop songs. He is an ambitious lawyer, very outgoing and absolutely in love with her. Their relationship, as it is, is doomed from the beginning, and she knows it, but she follows it anyway. Two things to keep an eye on if you're trapped in looking at this: Wood's Jane's Fonda hairstyle that never minded, no matter what, and a melody that soon sings in this terrible movie. He sings it for four or five or six minutes, so you know that the filling of commercials is classic. It is also one of the worst songs ever written, and the woman who sang Wood's voice should have been hit and put out of her unhappiness. Also, keep an eye on all the tops and peasant clothes. In comparison, Wagner looks relatively timeless, with his hair cut short and sports a series of classic clothes.
