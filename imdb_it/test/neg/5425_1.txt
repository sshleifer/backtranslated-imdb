I can't say I was surprised by this atrocity when I saw it a couple of months or weeks ago (I don't remember). I saw it as a two-part episode of Zoey 101, because that's how they showed it here in Canada. <br /> <br /> I was incredibly annoyed by the thing about Makeover at Nerd, it's just an example of how unacceptable, unwelcome, superficial, negative, biased and stereotyped, people in show business are frankly and deeply irritated. It wasn't funny at all. A nerd is a stereotype and makes people very offended. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the people in Zoey 101 have no real problems. Logan has a big house, he has a famous father, he has everything and even Zoey is rich. They never have to deal with the things that today's tweens and teenagers have to do to tackle problems like peer pressure and stereotypes. Moreover, the actors are horrible. Jamie Lynn Spears doesn't deserve to be on a hit TV show like Zoey 101 (what's wrong with the world?), He has no talent for acting. Actually, she's worse than Britney! The thing about Chase and Zoey was incredibly predictable, I mean how could the show go with Zoey and Chase attending? What other problems could they have? Except that Chase doesn't get the girl he wants, it's perfect! The absolute worst 48 minutes of my television watching life. Never. 0/10 (and this is generous)
