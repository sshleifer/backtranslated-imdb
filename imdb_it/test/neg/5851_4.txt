The RAT RACE commercials made me look too young for me, but since my boyfriend loves this movie (and the soundtrack), I finally gave up and watched it tonight. I show him David Lynch's movies and all kinds of dark indie things (I recently forced URBANIA on him), so I felt I owed him a harmless Hollywood product. <br /> <br /> I didn't want to hurt his feelings, so I saved my complaints for you. Yes, RAT RACE has its moments, but much of it irritated me. Let's start from the beginning. RAT RACE was marketed as a "family movie", so I was a little surprised to find that the first scene was about a porn movie. (I can hear it now: "Mom, what does AFRO WHORES mean?") This scene has no purpose in this film except to fill up some nastiness in a PG-13 movie. <br /> <br /> And while we are still in the casino segments, it is quite convenient that all the characters played, in the same span of time, at the slots that contained the gold coins. What would have happened if they hadn't done it? Would those millionaire millionaires stand by and watch? And how did they get the gold coins in the slots in the first place? <br /> <br /> But I'm discussing a point in the plot that the film needs to exist, so I'll continue. About Whoopi and his long-gone daughter: they meet for the first time, yet during all their suffering they don't discuss anything about themselves. Why make their relationship so supposedly complicated? Couldn't they have just been, say, a mother and a daughter on vacation together? Why is business a long-standing adoption? And why portray her daughter as a career woman of hard driving chained to her cell phone who never needs to contact her business again? Did the script simply forget about this subplot and character trait? <br /> <br /> This illustrates the main weakness of this film - the characters are inconsistent and interchangeable; it is exhausting when everyone is equally crazy and without identifying traits. And another thing: the events are not plausible. Oh, sure, characters can do strange things, but the characters themselves must be believable. Take THE NAKED GUN (another Jerry Zucker movie) for example. Frank Drebin has rather exaggerated moments, but all he does is, in theory, possible in his world. (Jane is also funny, but it's a different kind of fun, which makes the difference.) A character in RAT RACE who defies natural laws by jumping on a running train destroys any plausibility that the film may have; these are clearly not real people, so why should I worry about them? <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with RAT RACE is a moral problem. The characters get their transport modes almost totally stolen. I know, I know, this is just a stupid comedy, and the same actions didn't bother me fifteen years ago when I saw MILLION DOLLAR MYSTERY, but there's a lot of violence in RAT RACE, and now it bothers me. And I will not go into the entire sabotage sequence of the airport except to ask myself if the writers did not consider the real implications of this action; Was that scene fun before 9/11? <br /> <br /> I will jump on the unpleasant aspects concerning the heart, the drugs of one's family and the Nazis (whose accumulation and profit worked best in an episode of "Seinfeld"), and go on to complain of acting. Rowan Atkinson began to annoy and ended up unbearable; I don't know when I liked less a comic character. And the three Oscar winners need new agents. Whoopi came out the best, but he didn't have much to work with (he loved the copper perm and the purple lipstick); Kathy Bates's part was shrill, but mercifully short; Cuba, it was ... oh, man. Cuba, honey, please fire your agent! Following INSTINCT and CHILL FACTOR, this is your third attack (be glad you didn't see PEARL HARBOR or SNOW DOG) - it's time to return the Oscar as best supporting actor to its rightful owner (Edward Norton, for PRIMAL FEAR ) An actor of your stature has no problem running half naked through the desert and is controlled by an imitator of a Lucille Ball character. Do you still read the scripts to your films or are you slipping into a bag and taking out your next random project? <br /> <br /> Are there other small points that annoy me (how did Grisham and the prostitute so fast?), but, in essence, RAT RACE equals little more than your basic group of character types that are hampered by arbitrary obstacles on their way to a rather overwhelming and inexplicable ending. Do they give money to charity? What kind of ending is that?!? Yes, it's the "noble" thing to do. Never mind the likelihood that Smash Mouth cross-license / license whores do a benefit concert in the middle of the New Mexico desert, but who would really do such a thing? Yes, they say it is the journey, not the destination, which makes a journey worthwhile, but there is no journey without a destination. If ever there was an example of "wrong happy end", this would be it. What an end to a film that, despite my fussy here, I liked parts (I confess to enjoying the bite with the cow and some of Lucy's things along with the character with the tongue piercing - at first I thought the speech was indecipherable it would have led me to a wall, but it became my favorite. <br /> <br /> But as far as my boy knows, I found RAT RACE rather amusing and fascinating. <br /> <br />
