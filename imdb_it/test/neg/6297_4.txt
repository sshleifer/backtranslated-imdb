Basically a road movie. Gay, transgender and other gender genres are quite disturbing, particularly when the child is involved. You must hand it over to the costume designers. As for the actors, the only one I was familiar with was Terence Stamp. I suppose it was a very good performance, out of the normal range of his (or anyone else's). The film as a whole was superficial, just a vehicle for intelligent and cursed jokes. All in all, I don't recommend this.
