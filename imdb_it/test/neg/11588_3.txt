I just found out, before writing this review, that "Komodo vs. Cobra" and another movie called "The Curse of Komodo" were both directed by the same guy, Jim Wynorski. This could explain why they are almost identical premise films. Both are characterized by an island ruled by the military, a colonel who is more concerned with covering his tracks than the lives of his employees, the people who run to reach a helicopter that conveniently lies in a field somewhere on the island, and giant komodo dragons created through running genetic experiments. What differences are there? Well, the intruders on the island are now the capitalists who want to expose the secret of the government and there is also a giant cobra on the island, hence the title "Komodo vs. Cobra" even if the conflict between the two monsters is not relevant to 'history.' "Komodo vs. Cobra" is more or less what you would expect given the title and the origin of the channel: the Sci-Fi channel. Even if from time to time you'll find one you might like for one reason or another (I liked a movie called "Komodo"), I don't doubt that it will. <br /> <br /> "Komodo vs. Cobra" is not just a boring film, but it is also one of the least enthusiastic sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time. In some of these films, there is an air that indicates that the directors were giving at least a certain level of commitment, but here I see very little. This is again indicated by the fact that it is only a reworking of "Komodo Curse". The CGI for monsters seems to come from a second-rate videogame, the cinematography and the scene are scarce, the acting goes from passable to poor, action scenes are boring, and then there are some parts that are, frankly, unforgivably bad. I see many movies where one person will fire a gun many times without reloading and I can handle it. But in this film, where Michael Paré takes a thirty-eight-shot gun and shoots it fifty times continuously without reloading it once, well, I laughed at first, but even so it became tiring. This would be the action. A monster appears, people scream, Paré shoots continuously without reloading his gun once and for all the image, and someone is eaten. <br /> <br /> "Komodo vs. Cobra" is a very bad film. The only thing in the movie that is worth mentioning in a charitable way is an actress named Michelle Borth, who is not only very beautiful, but a surprisingly strong performer. Even with the unkempt dialect and lack of enthusiasm in the script she was given, Michelle Borth managed to get a surprisingly good performance and makes me think that a good actress like her can get stuck in a film as blatant as this. He obviously took it for salary, but it won't increase his career, I'm afraid.
