The film starts a little with the child interested in a girl of his age. Clayburgh's shy husband is killed in a car accident while preparing to go to Rome and sing like a diva. Matthew objects but arrives. He connects again with the girl, but this time, Matt is in cocaine. His superb voice, adorable and impetuous mother, is in the spotlight. He doesn't know how to handle Matt's addiction. The film drags itself in search of a plot. Clayburgh is in the wrong role and Bertolucci may have had his head on the moon while directing the film. The Moon has great symbolism. <br /> <br /> Save time. I am perhaps too generous with 4 *.
