Following the good words of my friends, I took on this film, hoping it was at least equal to the laughter of the similar movie, "House Party", but I was very disappointed and very bored. <br /> <br /> Falling asleep while watching a movie is never a good sign. I don't know if I didn't like it because I don't live in "da cappuccio", or if I'm not black, but it's probably one of the two. <br /> <br /> try to spoof some movies, only with a few laughs, but in the long run it fails miserably. I miss.
