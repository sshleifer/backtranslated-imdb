When something can be whatever you want or be, it means that it is very difficult to register with someone. But just as the shape of a cloud in the sky may appear to one of us or remind us of a warship, and to another back of his aunt, and yet to another absolutely nothing but a cloud, this does not make this cloud meaningful except for the spectators' interpretation. Anyone who can find to throw a stuffed giraffe out of a bright window, or worth it, without relating it in some context, maybe he's just trying to impress us with his intellectuality. <br /> <br /> Forwarding to this film as the dreams of a madman does quite well, especially since there is no standard or expectation for what dreams would be, and even if we are crazy about ourselves, this is hardly will give us healthy reference points for comparison. A love story with this film carries the same risk of seriously playing Nostradamus. Whatever real meaning was conveyed at the time could be buried in private jokes, meditations or provincial minutiae of his time, and in some restricted radical intellectuals! I saw a bit of an agenda even with my limited capacity. <br /> <br /> The film is decidedly anti-fascist and to some extent anti-Italian. I noticed that although the years 1929-30 were years of great public works and urban renewal in Italy, any indication of this seemed to have been avoided. Also, (avant-garde academic spinners take this into account for your next lesson) the short-haired man with a mustache in the party segment near the end is a caricature of Victor Emmanuel III and his high partner, no less that Queen Helen, former princess of Montenegro. Without an understanding of potential historical relevance, even the apparent irrelevance is beyond the competence of academics or other intellectual attitudes that would bask in irrelevance to impress us. <br /> <br /> I gladly add my paint buckets to the defacement of this cinematic joke. But in an adaptation of the famous little boy's mot; The film really has no face (to deface). Painting would have helped him burn though.
