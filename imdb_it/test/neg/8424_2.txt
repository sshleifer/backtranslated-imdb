Forget any distressed documentary! This film is a real comedy about a 40-year-old porn star whose goal in life is to sing junky circuit party songs. The only problem? Colton Ford can't sing! And the movie cuts away whenever it seems ready to burst into a song. Still, Ford and her equally unfortunate boyfriend Blake Harper complain and run off into their tank tops, determined to make dreams come true. Even more fun is the "manager" Kyle who seems to have the .Q. of a turnip and whose collagen-injected lips look like a bee stings him. How can adult men be so self-delusional? Bwa ha ha! As for the documentary, the filmmakers don't seem to have any POV and the film is poorly structured and wildly irregular. Very few basic information is provided on the three leads. Such an inclusion could have made the three seem something different from the West Hollywood stereotypes.
