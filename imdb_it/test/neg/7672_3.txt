A certain slack could be cut this film due to the fact that it was done in 1979. That said, it's really terrible. <br /> <br /> No matter the ridiculous rear-projection or the horrible, terrible camera- Tracking of alleged "flying" objects, it is the acrobatics that the Concorde pulls away to make you blink in disbelief. Barrel rolls, loop-the-loops and violent "evasive" maneuvers left me wondering why the Air-Force of the world didn't just fly the Concordes like their main fighters. <br /> <br /> So here are the important lessons I learned from this celluloid cheese festival: <br /> <br /> 1. The Concorde is at least as agile as a Phantom 4 jet. <br / > <br /> 2. You can shoot with a rocket gun at Mach 2 simply by opening the cockpit window and pulling out your arm. <br /> <br /> 3. If the rocket launcher fails to discharge, do not drop it, as it may shut down. <br /> <br /> 4. The Concorde can dodge up to two Sidewinder missiles fired simultaneously. <br /> <br /> 5. A glow will distract a missile looking for heat each time. <br /> <br /> 6. Turning off jet engines is a foolproof way of launching missiles for off-track heat if 5 (above) fails. <br /> <br /> 7. When making a crash landing in Concorde, it is apparently impossible to pre-discharge the fuel. <br /> <br /> 8. The Concorde pilots are all combat-trained veterans. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, this film is not very realistic. The effects are primitive according to today's standards and this, together with the nonsensical acrobatics that the Concorde plays, makes this film worthy of little but contempt. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Not recommended at all!
