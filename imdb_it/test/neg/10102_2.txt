I just saw this on TV today. It was in the ABC Sunday afternoon movie. <br /> <br /> It was not a very nice film, but for an independent low budget film like this, it was fine. There is a bit of suspense, but there are so many bad qualities that really bring the movie. The script is rather lame, and the plot elements are not very realistic, like the way a 911 operator would laugh and hang up when someone is reporting a murder. I don't know what the writer was thinking when they got the idea, but it's not very realistic. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie would be a good suspense thriller, because there were some scenes that seemed to lead to something good, but unfortunately they never did. There were some elements of the plot that were used in other films similar to this one, and in the end they were not very creative. <br /> <br /> If there's something good about this movie, it's the cast. Every actor in this film did well with what they had to work with. The terribly underestimated actress Elizabeth Pena was very good at this movie. She is very sexy and has an incredibly sexy voice. However, if you want to see one of his films that is really beautiful, look at the excellent animated film The Incredibles. In that film, he used his sexy voice. <br /> <br /> What can I say, this film is not really worth your time, but the actors were good. Unfortunately, they have all been wasted on this film, which is a real shame. This film tried to be a good suspense thriller, but it finally fell. If you want to see a good movie like this, but much better, see The Hitcher. If you want to see something with the cast members of this movie, watch one of their other films. You can really pass this movie easily if you have the chance to see it.
