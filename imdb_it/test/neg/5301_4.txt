I really liked Get Shorty, but this movie was disappointing as a sequel. First of all, Travolta looks nothing like the Chili Palmer of Get Shorty. He simply savored this performance as he did in all his recent films. It's not entirely quiet or has a gangster on him that makes you kind of root for him during the movie. It looks like Travolta got out of bed and decided it would be nice to play in this movie. The plot was not exciting or intelligent, there are actually no highlights, the only thing that looked like entertainment was seeing Christina Millian perform and The Rock was fun. But anyway, to make it short, this film was trash and I had to force myself to overcome it.
