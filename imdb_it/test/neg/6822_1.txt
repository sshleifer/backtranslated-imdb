I'm sitting here watching the movie, Tango and Cash. It led to a discussion of other great films of the late 1980s. The ridiculous connection between Tunrer and Hooch, K9 has arrived. <br /> <br /> Granted I have never seen K9PI and if I still value my life, I will never do it. Joshua cites this as his film of the year. Wow. Wow. I am absolutely amazed that this film exists. But much more than that the fact that Joshua likes this move troubles me to the core. I think Joshua is an interesting guy <br /> <br /> K9 <br /> <br /> K9
