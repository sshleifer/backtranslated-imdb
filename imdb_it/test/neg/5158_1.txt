The worst movie ever !! It's not smart, fun or challenging. 84 minutes of bad actors doing their best with a horrible script. <br /> <br /> Acting was so bad that you can see dead people breathing. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the writer / director combination believed they were Quentin Tarantino or something (you know how to make a film about anything beautiful yet) but failed miserably. <br /> <br /> I hope the writer never makes another film EVER !! not all are born writers, sometimes we need to count our losses and go back to being a bathroom attendant or something else. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie, even in mute with the stereo that is still a painful 84 minutes.
