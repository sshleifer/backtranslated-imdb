Infamous horror movies rarely measure the hype that surrounds them and I have yet to meet a criminal worse than Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes. Having restrained from watching this for years, I was really happy when I got it for Christmas and I waited one evening for my girlfriend to be out to settle down and watch him - knowing her extreme dislike for something really horrible. I don't need to be bothered. <br /> <br /> After a promising start, if familiar, that firmly fixes the film in the survival horror world of "Desolution USA", things go to pieces quickly when the protagonists and the antagonists meet in the desolate desolate expanse . <br /> <br /> It seems as if it had been shot with a budget of $ 5, with the costumes of the cannibal clan taken on by a shady masquerade mask that specializes in fake caveman and Indian red clothing, the plot follows an annoying indifferent WASP group making a detour during a trip to California, to look for a silver mine in a nuclear test area (!). When they break down, they are assaulted by the local family of meat eaters and have to struggle to survive. While I was hoping for another Liberation, in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Wrong Turn or Devil's Rejects, I actually realized I ran into something that should have been dusty and invisible in a backstreet store business bin. <br /> <br /> With gallons of tomato ketchup for blood and a couple of gruesome wounded close-ups, I can kind of see how an 18 Certified (in the UK) is justified, but with those cut-up shots this wouldn't be It seemed out of place like a Saturday afternoon thriller on ITV. <br /> <br /> The entire silver mine / sub-plot of the nuclear test site is just a McGuffin to justify the inclination of the "civilized" family against the primitives, but given the ease with which the savages get the ass is stretched credibility to think of having survived for a generation that preached passersby. /> <br /> And then there's the ending ... or lack thereof. The Hills Have Eyes seems to be missing a third act or, at least, a satisfying epilogue. Instead, I was left to ask myself, "Yes, and ...?"
