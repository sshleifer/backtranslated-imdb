I don't know why they kept the name. How could they have called the series "The Scarlet Pimpernel" after they got so far away from the novels, I wouldn't have had the slightest idea. The names of the characters are the only things they have maintained, and even then they changed some, mixed them and changed Percy's relationships with them. Sure, I only watched about two hours at most, but it was enough for me to realize that the series was nothing like Baroness Orzcy had portrayed her characters, and she probably would have rolled into the grave when she was shooting and airing. Poor lady I hope that when the next person wants to make a film or a series of the book, it will not completely ruin it as in this series.
