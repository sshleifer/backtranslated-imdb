I swear, I had never seen such a bad movie like Half Caste. Not only because it doesn't make sense, it's a huge piece of egolatry and self-confidence that makes me sick. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Apocada (in Spanish Apocada has a pronunciation similar to "apocado" which means "outside" of life and happiness ") makes here a video of a single man who thinks he is Sam Raimi or the boys who they directed the Blair Witch project. This is the Blair Kittie project, with a low and expensive budget. <br /> <br /> The story, a couple of American filmmakers going to Africa to shoot a documentary on Half Caste, is simply meaningless: the way of filming, inserting high-speed shots with slow-motion footage, makes you just turn your stomach more than the stupid jokes (what the hell is that dialogue on Beastliness?) or the limping performance. that this cast (or caste?) is American, they all seem European to me. <br /> <br /> Finally, suffice it to say that the filmmakers made a smart move on selling the movie cast. like most of the original film) and a b in the cover (in Spain the cover had the image of the half caste in negative), so I feel unhappy now, because I can't ask for my 14 euros back.
