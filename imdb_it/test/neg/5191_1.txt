Ewe, the opening screams zero budget. The titles that look like my nephew were unleashed with iMovie. The DVD packaging gives you the impression of being treated in the old days of boobie films of the 80s. NO! Almost no nudity from a film that sees Traci Lords! This film really needs nudity too. Instead you get many perkies of the Lord pointing through a T-shirt, however they seem to be activated by boiling steam. It's strange, in my world the headlights come on in the COLD. <br /> <br /> The plot is pathetic, the blind boy is just a joke, and not funny. His antics are so forced and predictable. He stumbles on things and you see him preparing for the fall. He needs to work on his physical comedy. <br /> <br /> Most of Frostbite's nudity comes from a hot tub scene that appears to have been taken months later and entered for a distributor. And nudity is not worth it. <br /> <br /> NamoiBucks; it's only a matter of time before Starbucks takes this into consideration. Not even fun. As Billy arrives in town for the first time, they meet Namoi Bucks, "Wow, they have them everywhere". This leads you to believe that it's a parody of Starbucks, but surprise, behind the counter of this place is Namoi herself. Apparently he loves coffee so much that the owner of this huge chain has decided to work in a small, cold city. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film has in store is the Warren Miller snowboard movie. Yes, this is all Warren stuff, so if you want to see a great action, take a Warren Miller movie. Leave the Frostbite alone. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good about this film. There is no reason to rent or buy it, and if a friend offers to lend him a copy for free. Hit him and end the friendship.
