The stupid comedy projects Ray Milland embarrassed as a British officer in World War II Europe, escaping the German borders and taking a gypsy woman hungry for men, played by Marlene Dietrich. Slow pace, too long and mixed: leashes are too old for this type of juvenile forage, although Marlene shines in her solo moments. It took three scriptwriters to adapt Yolanda Foldes' book to the screen, but this material must already have seemed dated by 1947 - it knows of something that Ernst Lubitsch could have revealed in 1939. The scenario is moldy and the stars have absolutely no chemistry together . ** from ****
