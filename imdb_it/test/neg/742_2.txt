I'm afraid I didn't like this adaptation. When I started watching it, I had a strange feeling of watching some TV series from the 70s, because of the filter and the musical score. I didn't like the final scene. Mr Tilney appears dressed only in his waistcoat. Jane Austen would never have let a gentleman come out without a frock coat. It seems that the producers have interpreted in a modern way a misinterpretation of a romantic girl's dream. I appreciate the more modern JA adaptations, which show an eye for these details, which makes the BBC series so useful. Sorry, I can't wait for the 2007 adaptation. I hope it will be better and I will show the benefits of 20 years of Jane Austen adaptations.
