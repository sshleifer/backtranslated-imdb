I'm normally a greedy for poor movies, but this thing stinks. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible effects and very little humor, what the hell was the point doing this movie? No gorzo to talk about and no acting to talk about. <br /> <br /> I could only handle 45 minutes of this movie launch, and this is rare for me. <br /> <br /> Anything positive to say about this drivel? the cover was OK, I'm pretty sure the movie also has an ending, even if I didn't make it. <br /> <br /> The rats were disorganized and constantly blew their lines, lacked intensity and seemed only to overcome the rhythms for their salary. The actors were worse.
