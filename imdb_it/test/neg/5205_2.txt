I think this should have been shocking or something like that ... All I can say is .... POOR UNDERSTANDED !!! This film is so badly made that the parts that "should" shock and rebel make you feel ridiculous at best. The characters are so lame and 2 .... wait .... 1 dimensional, which I applauded for every sick death ..... everything except HEADING WEIGHT. <br /> <br />
