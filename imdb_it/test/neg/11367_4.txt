Actually I liked certain things about this game. I loved the perspective firsthand and I wish I had the one chosen in the first three games. There's nothing like seeing monsters up close, in your face. The graphics really weren't bad, but I would have liked to have more things to interact with even if it was just a shooter. The music was fine. The things I hated were: the kind of sucking and aiming movement was total pain. The story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing without originality. The inability to save was terrible !!! Some of us have lives and would like to save to finish the game later. I thought the weapons were also sucked. This game is fun for a while, but it's nothing like the first three and it's only fine if you just want to shoot. I would recommend it for the novelty of playing firsthand, but that's all. Play at your own risk.
