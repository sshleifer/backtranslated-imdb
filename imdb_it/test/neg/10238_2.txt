Sammi Cheng and Andy Lau were paired once again in their third movie - YESTERDAY ONCE MORE - directed by HK actor Johnnie To ... fans of To's action films will be disappointed to find that a single pistol in the shooting .. Furthermore, fans of the previous Cheng & Lau films, NEEDING YOU & LOVE ON A DIET, will also be disappointed to find that YESTERDAY is not at all funny or engaging ... <br /> <br /> Mr. & Mrs. To (Lau & Cheng) are a divorced couple ... both wealthy citizens of Hong Kong ... both incredibly mischievous ... both are simply professional thieves - "two birds of the same feather" ... A couple of years ago, they divorced their inability to find a way to break the loot ... Now she is remarrying ... to the son of a rich heiress - a boy of a total mother (Carl Ng) through and through ... The future mother-in-law (Jenny Woo) suspects Mrs. nora To and plans to marry her son only for the family jewels - the priceless heiress's ruby ​​necklace ... <br /> <br /> The necklace is stolen ... it's Mrs. To get the best of her? ... or is her ex-husband, Mr. To's way of sabotaging the marriage to steal the jewelry for himself? .. <br /> <br /> This is not a film about two people who fall in love or rekindle a love ... there are about two people who have always been in love but who somehow have been crazy to make it happen ... let the pride and greed overwhelm ... <br /> <br /> Overall: YESTERDAY is a part of the robber / robber movie and partly a tribute to the classic Hollywood glamor of his golden years - that is Cary Grant and Grace Kelly of TO CATCH A THIEF ... Johnnie To is riding too heavily on Cheng Lau chemistry from their previous films ... hoping Cheng / Lau's immense popularity and fan base are enough to justify this third film ... I believe that Sammi Cheng is one of the nicest / most intriguing entertainers working to date .... & Lau is definitely the Tom Cruise of Asian cinema ... <br /> <br /> I really liked their first two films and I consider the couple Cheng / Lau comparable to those classic Hollywood couples of the 40s and 50 ... but YESTERDAY is not up to expectations ... the terrible writing, the ridiculous situations, the product positioning in abundance, and all the subplots and supporting characters were not necessary ... come to think of it .. ... this film was not necessary ... unless you love celebrity by watching ...
