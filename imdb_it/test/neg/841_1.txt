OK, so one night some friends and I decided to be really stoned and watch a movie. Unfortunately for us, we chose "Ernest Goes to Africa". I've never laughed so much in my whole life. This film goes beyond the bad. I literally depopulated the best films of "Ernest Goes to Africa". (Movie Poop) <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film, at least for me, was the opening sequence, when Ernest is making silly faces. When they showed it with a peanut-sized head, I lost it. Maybe I found it so funny because at that point I was the tallest. Maybe you're right. <br /> <br /> If I had to guess what George W. Bush's favorite film is, I'd say "Ernest Goes to Africa". Never before have I seen a film rely more on the stereotypes of people in the color of the 50s. There were times when words escaped me and I watched in amazement. <br /> <br /> As I watched this, I couldn't help but wonder: is this film meant for children? Do the literate adults really look at it? How could there be an entire "Ernest" movie franchise? Is this really my life? It's true? <br /> <br /> I hate this movie.
