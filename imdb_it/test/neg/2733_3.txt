Terry Cunningham directs this original of the science fiction network. All is not well in Washington and Oregon; Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes threaten to bring down most of the Pacific in the ocean. Trying to prevent the world from plunging into ecological devastation, a group of expert scientists led by Dr. Jake Rollins (Luke Perry) takes a huge land-drilling vehicle called "The Mole" to chew his way to the earth's burning core to avert imminent fate. The technical dialog does not help or speed up the film. The acting is lame, but then Perry has always been relaxed. You can only blame him for taking part. Others in the cast: Michael Dorn, Adam Frost and Michael Teigen
