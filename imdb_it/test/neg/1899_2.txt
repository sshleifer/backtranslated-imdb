What a frustrating movie. A small southern city is brimming with opportunities to explore the complexities of interpersonal relationships and the dark sub-coverings hidden beneath the placid surfaces, as anyone who has read something about Carson McCullers already knows. This does nothing. Instead, the writers were content to shine with ill humor, with banal and melodramatic melodramas. This looks like a movie created for TV, and was directed without particular distinction, but it's hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interesting. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating aspect, though, is the fact that there are a lot of extremely competent and attractive actors in this cast, all actively seeking to do the best and do what they can with this - well, there is no other word for this - drivel. A tragic waste of talent, particularly that of the great Stockard Channing.
