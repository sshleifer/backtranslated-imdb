why, why did I waste time watching this movie? was given to me on video by a friend and I thought I'd watch it, it can't be that bad. first of all, is acting simply terrifying and should we believe it to be real? secondly, this film boldly attempts to copy the project of the witch Blair (yawn) and does it very badly. so if you want the fright of your life I'd suggest that a Simpson Halloween special would be a lot scarier. but, if I just wanted to laugh, maybe the general crap of this movie would be enough. but overall I would like to avoid this movie at all costs or drink a large amount of alcohol before looking. the best? it's only about an hour and a half, thank god.
