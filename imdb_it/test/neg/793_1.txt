The first time I felt I needed to write a review. <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of movies in my life and I like a wide range of movies. I am reasonably open, and I can easily say that I liked a movie while still saying "yes it wasn't nice but I enjoyed it". I can appreciate the mastery of great films like The Shaw, redemption, godfather and American history X. I like good movies in a genre like horror or comedy, even though the film might not be so great. I can even enjoy a bad movie that I enjoy (Bloodsport). I will also try to evaluate the film enough even if I don't like it. The lights of the city of Charlie Chapin were not a film that I liked, but I can appreciate the acting and the stories for the time. I think some people when visiting this site instead of clicking on a vote by chance should consider some ideas. Try to evaluate the film based on how effective it was. Don't let your personal prejudice affect the assessment. See also the other moves you have evaluated and compare the film you want to evaluate. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was the worst piece of trash I've ever seen. 2 hours of my life where I just stole. The acting was terrible, across the board. The scenes where moved to the maximum. However the real misfortune was history. The first 20 minutes we actually had a story that tried to make sense and took the viewer from point A to point B. Later it was a nightmare. They kept trying to add new items, but nothing was explained. Nothing had ever made sense, he was dead steward, he is alive, he was struck by enlightenment, he was really enlightening, he was alien, he was an alien, etc. The ending did not bind anything and actually did not answer any questions. The only positive thing was that nobody cared where we were just happy to leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 ??? What's wrong with some of you? I have to admit that the 8 of us, when we were so angry to see this, thought "what would have improved?", And we decide to tell some of our friends that this movie is good, so they should suffer and watch this movie. What can I say that misery loves the company. This is really the only reason I can see a 6.5 rating. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your life!
