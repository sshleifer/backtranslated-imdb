I have to say, I found this film very disappointing. Yes, I know that Maltin gave us 3 1/2 and others think it very well. But, well, the opera sequences were terrible. I take it Jeannete MacDonald is an acquired taste. Yes, in the short sequences I saw with Nelson Eddy, she is immensely preferable to him. But alone ... God, I don't like opera and I despise the operetta, and it's fundamentally intolerable. At some point I had to cover my ears. Gable is OK, and Tracy is thrown away. The plot is annoying in the JM never simply tells Gable that he loves it and the work and why can't he do both? Instead he suffers in silence (or not) with the compromises he makes. The supporting cast is clearly not memorable. In addition to the three stars and Jack Holt (and I suppose his mother), they are all just background and forgettable. The EQ sequence is the only thing that saves the film. He is alone. Yes, it is quite spectacular and moving. But "oh God is great" seems very artificial. I prefer immensely "In the old Chicago" with regard to the ghosts of the disaster of the old days. Save on this.
