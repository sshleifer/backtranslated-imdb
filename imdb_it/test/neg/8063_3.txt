I bought this thing used in the "garbage bin" of the video game store. I wanted to get that guilty feeling of watching something I was warned is too intense to watch; I wanted the value of the shock. I wanted to feel guilty and mean looking at a "forbidden movie". I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Ferox does not work because it is so campy and fake. Most of the time the camera doesn't show you "shocking" stabs, ribs, slicing - just see the consequences. (They show a breast that engages in detail). The special effects are just OK. Nothing here that tells you that violence is real. The "cannibals" are obviously poor people of Central and South America who were dressed as wild jungle and said to behave in a petty way. These people were obviously in the whole movie to get some money, or food, or both. Once again ... simply not convincing. <br /> <br /> However, as everyone else has said, there is a real murder of animals that is happening here. This is the extension of realism. For me it was more shocking than any gutting, scalp shredding or castration, and even then, the animal deaths aren't bloody at all - maybe just sad.
