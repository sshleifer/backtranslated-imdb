I never really thought about watching this movie. I kept seeing it perched on the horror shelf in my local video rental shop and had never thought much about it. Just your run to the mill, a bland zombie with some blood and a sex scene. Nothing special, you could also look at Python ... oh no wait, this is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I decided to watch it only when some of my friends saw it on TV and said it was a terrible piece of garbage. So, I decided to check out these stories, and only then did I realize how terrible the movie behind the bland and uninteresting DVD box was. <br /> <br /> Not that the idea is negative in itself. An airplane is a confined area, and it would be a death trap for people on board if the zombies made their appearance ... a good premise for a zombie movie. But this film took a good setting and dazed him with mediocre acting, unsteady chamber work, annoying characters and a terrible score. <br /> <br /> The characters all have different levels of hatred. There are two young couples who are basically friends who go on holiday to France. A couple is made up of a jock and his annoying girlfriend who is having an affair with Mr. Jock's best friend, who came with his girlfriend who is a psychopathic blonde. There is also a policeman who is escorting a fraudster (an effeminate and very annoying swindler). The policeman is probably one of the least irritating characters on the lot. Then there is a group of hostesses who mostly end up as zombies chow ... no I didn't watch the whole movie, it was a really too painful experience to complete, almost like watching the Cannibal Holocaust. Oh, there is also a golfer on vacation with his wife, a strange marshal who actually doesn't seem to be important until he is called to help the escaped zombies, a trio of scientists all falling victim to the undead and a couple of pilots. The camera work is often shaky and, although it seems unlikely to many people, it can really get nervous after a while, like having a small fly constantly buzzing around your head. It's small but it's there and it's annoying. <br /> <br /> The adulterous couple is really irritating. All they do is have sex in the bathrooms of the plane while their spouses are not watching ... in fact all the young adults in this movie are madly annoying. They whine, complain, fight and have some of the boring and incredibly boring dialogues in the movie ... yes, it makes you happy to see them die. <br /> <br /> The score is atrocious. It is so generic and uninspired that it kills any kind of suspense that a scene might have generated and replaces it with the feeling that someone is scratching a blackboard with their nails and laughing at you. In fact, it looks like the score of ... Python! That movie will never stop haunting me. <br /> <br /> There is also a character that the directors seem incredibly intent on having in as many shots as possible. A nun, sitting next to young adults and holding the Bible that is included in so many shots, starts to wonder if she plays an important part of the film ... but no, so why have it in so many scenes? Maybe because the original project of the creator of the film was a nun porn movie? No one will ever know. <br /> <br /> Zombies look good. Their makeup is good and they are probably much better actors than living characters, they are much more convincing and nice! The guard in charge of keeping an eye on the scientist's illegal load was rather amusing. A large chest seems to fall on him, and the camera briefly shows the public that his leg has been pierced by a kind of pointed object ... yet he does not scream, he does not wince or complains about pain. He simply grunts and squirms in an attempt to remove his thigh from his leg ... in fact he looks more like an overweight man trying to scratch the back of a suffering man. <br /> <br /> Ah well, all in all, I give him 1 for the interesting setting and 1 for the zombies. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you like young people fighting and throwing things at each other, and unfortunately there really is not Something funny about the whole thing, so watching for a laugh would probably fail, unless you're in some kind of psychoactive drug.
