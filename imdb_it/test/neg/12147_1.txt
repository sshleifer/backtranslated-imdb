his must surely be one of the worst gay-themed movies of all time. Who told any of the so-called actors who can act. Bad sound - bad script - gestures so exaggerated as to challenge reality. A nightclub scene with a single actor and scenes of dubbed scenes. <br /> <br /> After seeing other low-budget films made similarly, I was prepared for something innovative - but not simply pathetic. <br /> <br /> Parents and friends should really not encourage anyone to make this tripe. <br /> <br /> And the DVD - No menu access; it's worse than a VHS tape. Once you get started, you have to look at everything through - fortunately the fast forward button works - with this movie and DVD nothing else.
