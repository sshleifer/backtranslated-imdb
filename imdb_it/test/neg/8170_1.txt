This film really shows the farce and hypocrisy of Indian society. What it tries to show is only ONE aspect of history. The other side of the story is the mental and emotional abuse of Indian children that this film does not show. <br /> <br /> "Indian parents" are guilty of the following: a. Destroy the individuality of children by making them completely dependent on their parents at a very early age. These children grow up to be adults only in physical appearance but remain children in the minds. Since everything was provided to them by their great Indian parents, children automatically do not feel the need to work hard at something or learn the basics of human communication with other human beings apart from their parents. <br /> <br /> B. I can show you so many Indian parents who try to prevent their children from making friends, going out or preventing them from doing something that will start to make them adults. <br /> <br /> The reason they do it is selfishness itself. Indian parents "expect" their children to take care of them as they get older. They do not make savings for themselves and when they reach the age of 50 ... They cry loudly ...... We have become old now and therefore depend on you children because we have done the GREAT SERVICE to take you to this world and take care of it of you and make you intellectually weak. <br /> <br /> Most Indian parents at the age of 50 have crumbling bodies and health and are financially completely insecure. Most believe that they ABSOLUTELY don't need to take care of themselves since they "expect" their children to take care of them. <br /> <br /> The opposite happens in the West. People start planning at the age of 20 about their retirement and once they retire they are financially secure. <br /> <br /> Do Indian parents have NOTHING like that since I said they brought children into the world and what better investment in this? <br /> <br /> I am a victim of my Indian parents (I am sure there are countless other Indian children like me), who have grown physically but are still struggling with their lives on THEIR OWN and continue to have pestle of 50 years screaming out loud for HELP all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie only shows ONE side of the story ..... UTTER piece of JUNK
