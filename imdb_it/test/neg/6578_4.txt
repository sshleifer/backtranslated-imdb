I like losers. So 12 years after seeing Star Trek V for the first time, and I thought it was weirdly bad, I gave him a second watch, hoping to find some saving value that I lost the first time. <br /> <br /> I no. <br /> <br /> The writing is semi-cooked and, although at the beginning the quality of the acting is stable enough to keep the film standing (even if trembling), the more we enter the plot the more foolish it becomes. The last quarter of the film is simply ridiculous. What was even worse, from the POV of the original cast, is that this was the first ST movie to be released AFTER the franchise returned to television with Next Generation, and the average Next Generation episode would put this to shame * - including special effects! What an embarrassment. <br /> <br /> The Final Frontier is not completely unhappy - I gave 4 out of 10 - but it is so below the standard of its predecessors (yes, including the first one) that the only reason I can think of to see it is because you will appreciate the other films more. <br /> <br /> * unless it is an episode with Troi's mother.
