I saw this show for a while, just for my cousins, and I HATE it! First, the girls dress in the same style clothes and have the same first letter in their names. (Come on, I could do better than that!) Then the bad guys (save me), first we have a monkey with part of his (small) brain showing, then we have a (gay) version of the devil, a pink hill, a green band band (with irony, it is their name) a spoiled princess (once again, ironically, this is "her" name) among others. I also found out that there is no male hero in the show. (Not that I'm sexist or anything ...) I'd rather watch Sailor Moon, it's much better than this. If someone else wants to see the show in the room you are in, find a way to break the TV. Believe me, it will save you half an hour of torture. <br /> <br /> Vote: I'm giving this just what it deserves, a 1 out of 10. Whatever you do, DON'T LOOK AT THIS!
