A stupid confusion that the comic "Bullwinkle" has been playing for half a century, NO HAROS DEANES shows that it is possible to snatch a good film (THE CANDIDATE MANCHURIAN) without copying a single quality fragment from the object of your loot. The acting barely registers on the cable TV scale, the plot is less nuanced than an old "Sgt. Rock" comic, and only the "bad" Boris J. Badanov-style mustache is missing from the Commies. This film reaches the unusual feat of being too bad, too stupid to be appreciated by anyone with opposable thumbs.
