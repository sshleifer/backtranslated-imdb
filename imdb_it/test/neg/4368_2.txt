I've never seen Killjoy's first film, and I've never even heard a good thing about it. So I see Killjoy 2 in the local blockbusters and pick it up and look at the back. Starring Trent Haaga and Debbie Rochon boasts. Now, being the big fan of Troma that I am there, there is no way that I am not going to rent this movie, how can it be bad with these two init? Oh, how wrong I was. Even Trent and Debbie can't save this excuse of a movie from being as bad as it really is. Trent, frankly, stinks like Killjoy, although it's probably more the fault of the writers who gave him some of the worst one-liners in film history. Debbie puts on a solid performance but it's not enough. The killings are terrible as are the effects of blood. For example, check when the boy is supposedly impaled on something or something. And just to finish the finale it's just one of the worst I've ever seen in film history. The film doesn't even work that badly which is a good level. Avoid as the clap of hands. <br /> <br /> 2/10
