This film was perhaps the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life. From the 10 minute opening, I was ready to go. The clich√©s that slapped you in the face, and the plot was not only predictably stupid, but full of holes more than Swiss cheese. I'm considering suinging for that 2 hour, $ 6.25 loss along with the fact that I'm more stupid now for watching this film waste. The T-Rex must be turned over in their graves, so to speak.
