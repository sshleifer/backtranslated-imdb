When you watch this film, with its deterministic cause and effect, wall-to-wall clich√©s and banal feeling, can anyone be so naive as to think this is actually Barrie's life? You look at him in a position of disagreement. Hollywood biographical films are no longer based on individual lives, they are just rewrites of previously successful biographies. If Hollywood made a film about your life, it would be full of such perfect synchronization that you could barely recognize your own story. Any personal complexity would be erased from a simplistic and all-encompassing background. Your story would look like "Rocky" because it's the only arc of life that Hollywood knows how to produce more. We could not leave the public to meditate on something left open at the end. This film does not trust an audience to understand things without being brought to them. I perceived the captain hook / mother reference eons before the film literalized it for me. I could see the 25 guys running for days. <br /> <br /> This is a completely average film. It is not horrible but not exceptional. So it's likely that they shower with some Oscars next year. There is nothing that the Academy prefers to congratulate itself on having finally noticed the models implemented over the past thirty years. <br /> <br /> From the article New Yorker "Lost Boys" by ANTHONY LANE: <br /> <br /> "Arthur Llewelyn Davies, also adored his boys, and may not be unfair of" Finding Neverland " omit it, for rationalization purposes, from the scene: when Johnny Depp meets Kate Winslet, he is already a widow, while Arthur was very much alive when Barrie first entered consciousness and, little by little, the home of the Llewellyn Davies family. br /> <br /> "Finding Neverland" is a whiner. He met George and Jack, and began to meditate on the means by which they could be made immortal, the story is sad, but the reality is even more dismal: 1907? Arthur Llewellyn Davies dies of jaw cancer 1910 Sylvia dies of lung cancer The five boys were orphaned, Barrie became their guardian 1915 George is killed in the First World War, fighting with his regiment in Flanders 1921 Michael, university student at Oxford, drowned men three swims with a friend. The two bodies, once recovered, find themselves clinging. <br /> <br /> On April 5, 1960, Peter Llewellyn Davies, at that time a respected publisher, threw himself under a subway train in London. We should not presume to read a tormented mind, but we can see that, if he had lived another month, he would have reached the centenary of Barrie's birth and then, one imagines, a new flurry of interest in "Peter Pan" "??" that terrible masterpiece ", in the words of Peter Llewellyn Davies.
