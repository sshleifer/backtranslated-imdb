Actually I joined this site simply to write about this movie. I was sitting in my living room and this movie came out on one of the local channels. I did about an hour before I simply had enough. Curious to see what the general public of the film thought about this film, I looked for it on this site. I was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming amount of people who thought it was great. I needed to have my say, and here it is: this film is absolute rubbish. It was a task to sit on. The "jokes" were inspired by shelters not inspired by other shows and better films, and the manic portrait of Leguizamo of this nasty character should only appeal to the age of ten. Actually it could be a stretch even for that age. I'm all for a ridiculous nonsense, but there isn't even the slightest hint of wit or intelligence. I have an idea, take non-trivial jokes and play at twice the speed. This is fun Ha. Has. <br /> <br /> Films you should see that make foolish humor and add comic timing and originality: The Marx Brothers' A Night at the Opera, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut , ... and the list goes on. Don't waste an hour and a half of your life on non-memorable shit. <br /> <br /> By the way, I can only assume that the reason why David Bar Katz (the other writer) was VERY little in film after this film is because he was immediately blacklisted. I'm really impressed that Leguizamo was able to recover after this mess.
