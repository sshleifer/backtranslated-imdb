This is the movie that practically played the death knell for the Hollywood author. With over $ 40 million, Heaven's Gate is so poorly designed and built that it would take a lifetime to break down every area of ​​failure. What bothers me most is that technically it is bad, an unforgivable sin for the money that was there. John Hurt's opening speech at Harvard is not audible, as is a conversation between Kris Kristofferson and Richard Masur at the train station. Some people seem to think that Cimino understood this as a "style". Not him. It's just a bad sound recording. The characters are not particularly well designed, except for the four or five cables; in the battle scene, it's hard to say who the bad guys are and who the good guy is. Even at that level, it is impossible to enjoy the film. The casting of Isabelle Huppert as the city lady is a joke, her French accent makes the whole character a fraud. The acting is generally rigid, without any ray of action or depth of feeling; even Christopher Walken is bad. The character of John Hurt is the only one with bravado or vitality (although Hurt, at 40, playing a fresh-faced Harvard boy with bags under his eyes is clearly ridiculous). <br /> <br /> I suppose to say that it is too long is excessive. The skating sequence could easily be cut, the cockfight scene is quickly becoming a cinematic cliché, and the final scene aboard the ocean liner is right outside the Twilight area. Having Rod Serling appears in front of the camera at the end to explain what we just saw would be the perfect ending. In reality, those scenes in themselves are not bad, but Cimino has not earned the right to include them, because what he gave us as "flesh" of the picture is so incompetently bad. The editing is scarce, especially in the climax of the great battle. At some point, the same explosion with the same wheel of the car that flies by the explosion is used three different times. I wish I could say something, something beautiful in this film: a great scene, a great exhibition, even a memorable line of dialogue, but I can't. It's all just a big wicked mess. The only thing I liked was the photography and the locations of Montana, which are extraordinary. Even Cimino couldn't ruin everything. This is a long, boring, bad movie for all standards. And people who claim to have been hit only because of cost overruns are just joking. 1/2 * out of 4
