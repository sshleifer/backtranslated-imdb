There is very little positive that we can say about this film. Walter Pidgeon is a really unconvincing and even crazier hero when he tries to become "hooded" like a villain who, we have to believe, drinks too much and silences his wife a little. Margaret Leighton, like the undercover wife / sergeant, is a little more convincing, but it is still hard to believe that a hood of their salt value would not see through their charade in less than a minute. The plot, on a robbery of ingots, is foolish, and the action drags rather than takes them. David Tomlinson, who plays Algy in the same way that David Tomlinson seems to play all of his roles, is the only glimmer of light in a totally boring affair.
