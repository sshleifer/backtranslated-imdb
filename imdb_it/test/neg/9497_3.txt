I love Ustinov's distinctive and literal narrative. And photography is quiet. We included the film for our 3.5-year-old boy who wandered around the room. So, for our first view, we only saw about 1/3 of the movie and we were quite fascinated. When we looked at each other again, sitting in the family, we were all mortified by the violence and dangerous situations for the life of the poor otter. Around the middle of the film, there is a row of dead and bloody animals. Lots of blood, not just a little. Then in the end, there's a wild fight with a dog, then the blood clouds the water. You would think, given the G vote, that's all you'll see ... that WILL IMPLY that one of the animals is dead. No. They drag the carcass out of the water and show it clearly for several traumatizing seconds. Personally, as an adult, I love horror movies and I feel good with the violent films of Scorsese, Cronenberg, Tarantino. Hell, I love the ultra-violent Battle Royale. But those are not films for children and are not advertised as such. If you're deliberately raising your little ones to see the harsh realities of life for cute animals, then this is the movie for you. If you are like me and my wife, you may want to save your children nightmares and avoid this.
