My brother plays "Moose" in this film. Although most of his scenes were left on the floor of the editing room. The funniest line is that the film is "nothing wong with stat". However, this is shot in Portland, OR, where we grew up. The disco was called "Up Front FX". What I loved about this film is that the main character (who has no name on the box because Bolo brings more influence) should be a police detective ... a great opportunity to shoot in a red convertible Porsche. I need to get a copy of this, preferably the director's cut, so I can see all the scenes my brother is in. The only scene in which it is found is the beginning when I'm in the disco. He got the job because he went out with this cheerleader from a semi-pro soccer team called The Oregon Thunderbolts. It is interesting because its name appears as the first entry in IMDb. Fame has him, luck, not so much.
