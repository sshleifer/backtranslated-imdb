What an embarrassment ... This does not do justice to the original with a terrible recitation by everyone in this film, Hitchcock must shoot in his grave. The scence in which Marion is killed in the shower is so ineffective and not very original. The only good thing is that they used the same music and it's so obvious that it kills her in the shower. I consider this film 3/10
