However it must be said that perhaps more in America than to say, here in the UK, it can still be a delicate subject. Just look at the entire defeat of homosexuals in military age some years ago in the United States. It is with 'In and Out' that the writer Paul Rudnick draws on the mentality of the small Central American city and the way in which the press in the United States (as well as in the United Kingdom) makes a big deal in celebrating a celebrity. You just have to watch when Boyzone's Will Young and Stephen Gately came out into the open. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline), a high school English teacher in his hometown. people are preparing for Oscar night, while one of the candidates Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) comes from their city and was a former student of Howards. Cameron, who plays a gay soldier in a Vietnam epic, wins the prize only for playing Howard as a homosexual during his acceptance speech. This could not have happened at a worse time for Howard who is only a day away from marrying her boyfriend and classmate Emily (Joan Cusack). As one would expect the media reaction to be catastrophic and Howards' life upside down. He not only tries to convince his family and friends that he is not gay, but escapes journalist, Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck). <br /> <br /> Although this was announced as a dejected comedy, it is clear that Rudnick and director Frank Oz are also trying to be satirical. Just look at the first scenes of the Oscar ceremonials and the way the people of Bracketts' home town and the school's educational committee react to its release. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the film is not up to the promise we see in the film. It is a rather flat attempt to make social comments from an extravagant comedy. A good cast is sadly wasted on a script that never really brings the necessary amount of laughter and is not as close as insightful as he thinks. <br /> <br /> Kline offers us the same kind of captivating interpretation that he gave us in his previous comedy "Dave ', making Howard an immediately likeable character. Cusack also has a good relationship with Howard's boyfriend weight while "Tom Selleck plays very well as a gay reporter. Even Bob Newhart is a joy, as a high school principal where Howard works. It's great to see him on the big screen for a change. It's a shame that this should be." br /> Performances, as they are, can do little to save the film from being a rather boring affair, while a couple of scenes do offer some fun, certainly the inspired scene in which Howard attempts to appear more manly listening to a self-help tape. There is little to enjoy, and when things fail to get worse, Rudnick resorts to a disgusting ending that staggers over the upper sentiment, and I couldn't help but hear that my intelligence was insulted.Malloy seems to be a character too shabby to become the man who puts his ethics before getting a good story while Cammeron eventually comes to the rescue in the climax of the film seems at first to be too involved in a character to worry about what happens to his former teacher. After all, he caused all the problems in the first place. <br /> <br /> 'In and Out' is not exactly but if you consider that Klines works better as 'A Fish called Wanda' you cannot help but feel that there is a great talent here that is sadly wasted. <br /> <br /> Robs Rating: * *
