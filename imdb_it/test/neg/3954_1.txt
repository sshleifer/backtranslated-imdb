Bad, bad movie. When I saw the synopsis I was expecting something like Ring with video games instead of tape. Nothing like that happened. I admit that the idea is interesting and could be turned into a good film, but it is not. <br /> <br /> First of all, choosing the person of real life, Countess Bathory, is a stupid move that adds absolutely nothing to the story. Anyone who was even vaguely familiar with his story would begin to wonder why and why this Hungarian noblewoman ended up in this film. To choose a vindictive generic spirit would be much, much better. <br /> <br /> Then there is the whole concept of te-die-in-life-real-as-you-die-in-the-game. As I said before interesting, Ring-like story. But instead of developing it into a good storyline, it's like there's no explanation, because the game has become as it is, because it was created and so on. Waste of good idea. <br /> <br /> And finally this movie doesn't even have a cruel part of fun parts that can, if not save at least some watchable horror movies. The death scenes are too fast and the acting is too wooden to be fun. <br /> <br /> Avoid if possible.
