Two Los Angeles policemen track down a serial killer nicknamed "The family man" who wiped out entire families and when one of the police officer's wife takes the 6, questions are raised and a serial killer is discovered not to be responsible, but rather mafiosi. The idea of ​​Seagal in a serial killer movie is an interesting concept, in fact you could see Seagal playing a good serial killer, but for him a cop who has a ridiculous inclination for rosaries and razor-sharp credit cards turns out stupid than even ridiculous. Even a running joke involves Wayon's pleasure in eating powdered deer penis and well this vulgar material is completely out of place. Not to mention the start of a school taken hostage, due to the breakup of a boy with his girlfriend. After Seagal has neutralized him, the girl tells the boy that she loves him. Now there is a lesson to be learned from all this, if you want your girlfriend to come back, taking the school hostage could get you back on her good side. I myself would think that the flowers or the old phone call could work, but then again, they are old-fashioned. Also, who am I to put a brake on someone else's brilliant reconciliation plan. <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
