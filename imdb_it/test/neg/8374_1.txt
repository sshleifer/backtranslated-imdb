This has to vote with the worst movies I've ever seen. It wasn't fun. My wife fell asleep. I suppose if you are the kind of person who is all sweetened by the sight of a dog, then he could do something for you. If you expect a comedy to have a bit of humor, you will be disappointed, unless you find an English radio announcer who says the word f very funny. The club strippers kept their underwear on and so there was not even a little nudity to alleviate boredom. What happened in the strip club made no sense. There was a lot of grumbling from the main character with whom I didn't develop any sympathy. Mena Suvari was barely in the film, presumably right there to make people think it was a serious attempt to produce a film. The villains were not convincing and carried the same threat as a dead sheep.
