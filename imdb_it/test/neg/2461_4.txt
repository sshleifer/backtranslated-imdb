This is a pretentious film like a superficial director like Joel Schumacher could do, I suppose. A group of medical students take turns to die for several minutes; after awakening they discover that their sins have manifested themselves in one way or another. Because some characters are visited by dead people and some seem to be obsessed with their guilty consciences, it is not entirely clear what the connection is, but the visions all seem to be sixth art films. Because students treat their experiment as a kind of big journey that will make them famous is a bit of a mystery, as the results are completely indefensible and, as the movie mentions several times, they have been documented many other times. Still, it's nice to see Schumacher practicing for his Batman trainwrecks with some of the old neon paint and colored light bulbs. And William Baldwin is a board.
