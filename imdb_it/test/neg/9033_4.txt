So Seagal plays a DEA detective named John Hatcher who lost his partner for a drug investigation, surprise surprise, Colombia! Not to brag or anything, but my father was born and raised in Colombia (hence my surname), and now he's a doctor in California, so no matter what the movies would have you believe, there are things different from drug dealers and cocaine that leaves Colombia! <br /> <br /> However, in a drug bust that went bad, Hatcher loses his partner and accidentally kills a naked Colombian prostitute, inspiring him to confess, somewhere I never saw him go first in any of his films, before or after. It was actually quite interesting. Seagal has a tendency to become almost asexual in the way that it is never very involved with women except as a plot device and the way in which the occasional attempt at seduction, by a stripper or a lover, never provokes the least interest he. He's always ready to be a bad boy. <br /> <br /> But in the confession booth, he confesses that he lied, sold drugs, falsified evidence and even slept with informants to get the information he needed to put the bad guys behind bars (I hope I don't have you I will get into trouble with God by telling you this ??). The priest tells him to go to his family, so he decides it's time to withdraw from the force. <br /> <br /> The third third of the film is an exercise in the subtle characterization characteristic of Seagal films. Marked For Death is the story of Seagal against a band of Jamaican drug dealers, and these guys have no discretion in pushing their products in broad daylight. <br /> <br /> Hatcher returns to visit his old high school coach, Max (a minimum effort by Keith David), and right in the middle of practice there are some of these dread-locked crackheads sitting right there, in the stands that sell crack to high school girls who look like bookworms. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just had a high school experience, but I didn't know crackers and crackheads came out of SCHOOL in MIDDLE OF THE DAY. However, it doesn't take long before Hatcher learns how bad these guys are. They're not just selling crack to high school kids, but the coach has regularly lost football players with their drugs, they engage in a stupid submissive look with Max, and since that's not enough, his 13-year-old granddaughter is dead to their crackhouse. <br /> <br /> Ah, OK. We get the picture. I'm sure they also torture puppies and beat up old women and maybe ruby ​​candy even for children, just for good measure. Is it really that difficult to determine who the bad guys are? The 13-year-old niece died in their crackhouse. Wow. <br /> <br /> Anyway. Not only does the film not know how to develop the villains without resorting to what is fundamentally reduced to the name of the film, where bad actions are assigned to them superficially through dialogue, but do not know how they should act. <br /> <br /> The head of the drug traffickers is called Screwface, and I suppose he should tell you something about the type of film he is by himself. Screwface is a Jamaican cartoonist man with these pale, bizarre green eyes, which I assume must be an important part of his character because he spends most of his time on the screen with his eyes slightly protruding from his head. His favorite means of intimidation is to scream really loudly in his wildly exaggerated Jamaican accent with his face literally less than an inch away from anyone who is screaming. This guy likes to go so into the faces of the boys that he has to turn his head to the side so that their nose doesn't touch. All I could think of was how the poor would take their breath. <br /> <br /> Friend, they don't want you to forget that these guys are Jamaican, by the way. Their accents are so exaggerated and exaggerated that for most of the film it's almost impossible to understand them. It's not important. No matter what they are saying, all you need to know is that everything that comes out of their mouth is a kind of evil drug-related thing, it's just psychopaths who sell drugs and kill people. The film must have been a great success in Jamaica! <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the film is that the script, especially the bad guys, as I have described, are spectacularly stupid, even for Seagal film. They are so funny and bizarre that it is impossible to take them as anything other than a goofball b-movie creation, something that is slapped together to provide a fodder to which Seagal can distribute its distinctive punishment mark. <br /> <br /> But there is also a bizarre kind of mysticism in the film that makes everything so strange. For example, a mystic, I imagine you would call it, at one point puts a kind of curse on Screwface (if I remember correctly) spitting Bacardi's morsels on a live rooster that is hanging upside down before beheading and dripping his blood on a photo of Screwface. Hmm. Interesting. Sadly, it is this same woman who warns Hatcher that his family has been "marked for death" by these people, which means they have a voodoo hex on them. Not to detract from anyone, but if they had told me that my family had been cursed by such people, I just laughed at them. Hatcher doesn't strike me as the kind of guy who does a lot of bad voodoo stuff! <br /> <br /> But the set-up, as you can see, is pretty standard for a Seagal movie. Bad ones, I imagine you can say, though not very impressive. Surely the strangest film in Seagal's career ??
