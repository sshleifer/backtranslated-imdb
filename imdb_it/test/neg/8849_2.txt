I can appreciate films with subtitles from foreign countries and especially those where the subtitles are weak and actually don't seem to follow the plot or really make sense, but this movie had too many parts that didn't really make sense. <br /> <br /> All in all, I can admit some scary and bizarre parts, but they are repetitive, I felt like I was watching a trailer trailer; it looks like it's a short film shot with different actors. <br /> <br /> In the veins of RINGU and GRUDGE but not even closing the hype ... the excessive length has killed the thrill. <br /> <br /> Unless you are an avid fan of these types of movies (which I thought I was), don't waste your time with this.
