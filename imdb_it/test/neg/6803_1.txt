What were they thinking when they made this truly TERRIBLE movie? <br /> <br /> Arbus, one of the most important photographers and women of the twentieth century, has had a fascinating and dramatic life. What did someone own to make this film, which explains his unique artistic vision, as the result of an (imaginary) deal with a grotesque, but charismatic caprice (played by Downey)? <br /> <br /> In real life, Arbus came out of a traditional marriage and the role of women to express themselves. In this film, Arbus is an ultra-sad Nicole Kidman whose inspiration is all attributed to the "Beauty and the Beast" devotion to an interesting man. <br /> <br /> For this reinvention, the film is truly shameful. Regardless, it's just boring and boring.
