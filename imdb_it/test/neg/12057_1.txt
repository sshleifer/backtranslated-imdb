How to round off all the possible existing clichés and stereotypes in the horror genre and then insert them into a massively bad movie? The answer: "Camp Blood". This is an amateur slash nonsense done on a micro budget and a bit too obvious inspired by "Friday the 13th". Four of the most intolerable teenage characters you'll ever see ?? are they like a combination of ugly, stupid and annoying ?? go camping and find yourself quickly chased by a homicidal maniac in a clown suit. Don't even ask me what the murderer's motivations were or who he was, because if he had been present in the film, I absolutely lost him. This is one of the worst movies ever made, with no inspiration or skill whatsoever. The production values ​​were so painful that there are actors who play multiple roles without even bothering to make them unrecognizable. The only decent and noteworthy sequence throughout the "Camp Blood" is the opening in which the awesome voluptuous Meredith O'Brien has sex in the woods with her scout boyfriend. Yes, I am fully aware that this is an absolutely superficial observation to make, but then again it is a young and delayed film, so who cares?
