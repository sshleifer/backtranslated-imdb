The operative rule in the making of this film seems to have been "never do a 1 minute scene when you can do a 10 minute scene". This was a principle established from the beginning with a long, interminable portrait of the Harvard class of 1870. The point of that scene, I suppose, was to introduce some of the primary figures in history and give some of their background - which it is quite effective if we compare the idealism of Harvard's graduation ceremony with the realism of life in Johnson County, Wyoming, but it continues to come and go, and this sets the stage for a film that presents repeated traits of mental numbness nothingness, made even worse by the fact that I found a significant amount of almost incoherent dialogue. In the end, I couldn't even look at it in one sitting. I spent about half of it and had to put it aside for a couple of days before I could go back to see how it turned out. <br /> <br /> My reaction to this film in many ways is a shame, because there are positives here. The performances are generally of high caliber, especially by Kris Kristofersson as Averill, Christopher Walken as Campione and Isabelle Huppert as Ella. The basic story - interspersed as it has always been - is potentially interesting, focusing on the efforts of immigrants to settle in Johnson County and the efforts made by a local company to arrest them by killing a number collaboration with the government and the army . There are also some absolutely stunning landscape shots. That said, it could have been done in half the time - and it should have been. In the end, all those potential positives are wiped out - again - by the unfathomable nothingness that the film seems to revolve around. Seriously - 2/10.
