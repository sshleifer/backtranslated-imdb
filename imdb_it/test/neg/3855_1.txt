Ok, normally I'm pretty open to movies. I can usually see a positive side of a film that has been totally catered to by others. This is an exception. <br /> <br /> I won't waste too much energy telling you what's going on, but you think Bill and Ted will meet the worst Police Academy movie among all of them and you won "t be away. <br /> <br /> La What really struck me about this film was the stupid, purist racism that was evident throughout the film.The general theme of the Latin / black boys = cool, white guys = blades is a bit funny for the first couple of bars but when the same joke was repeated for the 500th time (it is not an exaggeration among other things) it becomes both boring and offensive. <br /> <br /> I spent months waiting for Karma's laws to return to John Leguizamo for this film, I had almost lost hope when the "My VH1 Awards" were screened live in the UK. What followed was Mr. Leguizamo who performed the rare feat of a comic bombardment on stage. You should be a complete sadist for laugh at him Ahem Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!
