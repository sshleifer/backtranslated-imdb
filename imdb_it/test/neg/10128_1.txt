If I asked you if Disney could broadcast a show with a more spoiled character from Paris, more superficial than Britney, littler than Jessica and more narcissistic than THE GIRLS NEXT DOOR, you no longer wonder. The amazing thing is that Selena Gomez is, apparently, supposed to be heroin. It should also be an outcast from spoiled, superficial, listless, "popular" narcissistic girls at school, which is no longer credible here than it was for Hilary Duff in LIZZIE McGUIRE. The lots range from BEWITCHED and I DREAM OF JEANNIE recycled to "parodies" by HARRY POTTER. The older boy alternates between being a magical genius and the inability to master the complexity of his own strings. The younger boy is just another "witty" brat that has multiplied on TV like cockroaches in New York (and with the same charm). Dad is the stereotype of stupid TV's father, and mom ... well, it's not totally horrible. But everything turns pale beside the horrible, repulsive, yet horribly fascinating (like a bad car accident) spectacle of Ms. Lopez's smug, smug performance. And, again, she is the HEROINE.
