You can see that if the film is not directed by his brother, this is the best he can do. And sad to say, his best does not cut it. "Ice Cream Man" is a very bizarre horror film, it's a real explosion to see if you're in the right mood. In the wrong mood, it is well known that people violently hurl themselves at loved ones, so please watch carefully. <br /> <br /> Clint Howard is the star (like Clint Howard's star?) "bad" "psychotic" "bizarre" (Yes, in quotes, not one of them at all, but it's approaching) ice cream maker, who tortures local children with pop bombs that are really melty and ice cream that has broken humans and dogs into them. Ick. <br /> <br /> However, the plot is really just an excuse to show the ... well, the ... um, well, it's a plot. Oh wait, I know! It's an excuse to show all the cameos of the losing actors! There are Jan Michael Vincent and Lee Majors II (The sequel?) As policemen who track down the elusive or frozen man. And even Doug Lleyweln appears as a supermarket clerk. <br /> <br /> Even better, they are some of the bizarre jokes of the film. I really like the fact that for some reason, instead of hiring a fat actor to play the group's unfortunate "fat" kid, they only do this little boy who wears the stuffing under his clothes. And the whole premise that anyone would want with a scoop of ice cream from an ice cream vendor. Who buys ice cream balls from ice cream makers? Then there is the whole scene of the psychiatric ward, where the acting of Jan Michael Vincent ranges from a slight interest to a bored beyond the state of consciousness. These are the policemen who also scour the place of the Ice Man to find clues, but they manage to complete the gloss on the ice cream truck (where, of course, the various bodies are kept and so on). Oh good, better luck next time troops. <br /> <br /> Howard acts as if he is making sure that people in two cities can see and hear him. It's all just stupid. And fun enough to laugh in the refined tradition of The Pumaman or Gymkata. You will have a GOOD laugh with the right sense of HUMOR. I love it. <br /> <br />
