The original title has always struck me as a somewhat exaggerated definition for a group of saddled tramps armed with rifles. Yet; their presence on the screen was at least emphasized by a group of high quality actors to support Yul Brynner. Most were movie stars apart. <br /> <br /> However; this first sequel was a pale imitation, with a group now composed largely of players from list B and C, who were more mediocre than magnificent. It was a similar arrangement. Brynner's "Chris" had to recruit another team of saddlebacks who armed with rifles to solve the problems of Mexican peasants again. Another tyrant was giving them pain. <br /> <br /> With the originality and freshness of the first film now spent, this remake had little else to offer. The budget was clearly very limited. This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the under-par script, which borrowed a lot from the previous classic. It was also more than half an hour shorter than the original by John Sturges. Yet we still had a revival of anguish and moralization that at times even made the first a little turgid. However, here there were no decent actions, actions or locations to balance things. The film was less expansive. He failed to convey the wide range of landscapes that were a big part of the original. <br /> <br /> In general; only imagination was missing. The first film was a resounding success, and this pedestrian sequel was evidently put together as quickly and economically as possible to cynically collect the former success. And show. There is a feeling "made for the TV" in this regard. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
