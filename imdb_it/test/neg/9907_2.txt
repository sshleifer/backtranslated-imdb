The only reason I know this movie exists is that I wanted to see what Nancy McKeon has been since The Facts of Life is over. When I looked for his name, this relatively new TV movie arrived. After many investigations I managed to find a copy and was disappointed by what I saw. D Grade acting, poor screenplay, terrible FX - it was like watching an attenuated and more amazed version of Day After Tomorrow that lasted 3 hours. Despite the long execution time, the characters remain quite underdeveloped, we are not interested in any way and in most cases we want them to disappear. Combine this with terrible lighting and cinematography and you have a real disaster of a movie. As they have convinced so many "name" actors (ie Dianne Weist, Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy) to appear in such garbage is amazing. In summary: I want those 3 hours of my life back !!!
