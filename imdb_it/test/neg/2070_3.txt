The plot of a film like this is a gift. How can you go wrong with a gay storyline and all the colors and music of India - a story like this is written by itself. I will watch almost everything, but this was unwatchable. The sad thing is that whites are the most colorful in the film. Vanessa was a riot with a sailor's mouth, and Jack was a great eye candy, but everyone else was so boring. Saeed Jeffrey, who was exceptional in My Beautiful Landrette, did what he could, but the story was so boring. The saving grace was really the background music, which made the film laugh, rather than the film, or not at all. There are many other top gay films, ethnic films, just plain movies. I give a lot of low budget movies, but this shouldn't have been done, or should have been done by someone else.
