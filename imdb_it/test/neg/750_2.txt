My first BBC / Jane Austen film was extremely disappointing. The tone is off, the costumes are off, the hair is off, the music comes from the outer space and Robert Hardy, bless him, seems really bothered by being so smelly. Some of the castings are also disabled. No, I take it back, a good director can make a silk purse from one ear, so to speak. The performances in this thing are so exaggerated and melodramatic that it is almost a farce of a story by Jane Austen, which is ironic since Northanger Abbey is a sort of homage to the first Gothic novel. I wanted to slap the female lead after a while; who made the decision that she should be so ninny? I had to see Pride & Prejudice ('95) to immediately remove the bad taste from my mouth. Damn!
