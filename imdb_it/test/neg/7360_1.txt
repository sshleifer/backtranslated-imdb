This review contains spoilers. I had no expectations about this movie. I extracted it from the video store rack with the movie "White Noise". <br /> <br /> First of all, the credits for this stupid movie last about 5 minutes. The rhythm from start to finish is slooooow. The main heroines don't like to wear a bra and the director seems to enjoy the jiggle effect while Anna Paquin comes down the stairs. If you like movies for boobs, this has a low buzz level. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is nice that the film snatches elements of Lovecraft and other mechanisms of the horror genre, but in the best films, there is at least a rational or constantly irrational behavior. This stinker tries to establish a sense of modernity and reality, but then there are situations in which nobody calls the police, even if they have discovered a treasure trove of potentially incriminating forensic evidence, and otherworldly rituals are well explained in a complete book on the afterlife rituals like on Buffy. I was waiting for Miles to show up and give some advice on how to kill a certain kind of demon like that and so. <br /> <br /> The premise is that it is possible to open a dark age in which creatures that crawl on the ceiling can cut your throat or transform the meat grinder effect on you. I have buzzing. To do this it is necessary to have a sacrificial circle and then have seven children who must have their cuts to the throat by people who love them. This opens the world to the era of darkness. At least this is what he says in detail in the book of ancient occult rituals. Which raises the nagging question of, uh, well, as did those who wrote the book and, if that's what happens, you would really leave this information in a book you can extract from the library, much less take it from a library in a world that is not already contemplated in the Darkness, an age caused by madmen who could have done it much earlier using the "Occult Practices to bring the world to darkness for mannequins, 2nd edition"? It turns out that the father in history is the seventh child, the one who escaped the ritual 40 years ago; was released by his father, who is the doctor / grandfather of the film, who wanted to try the ritual with allegedly, other stupid parents, who just wanted to see if this stupid like this opening up the world to darkness really works. The grandfather let his father go because "he didn't really love him". Aduh. Stupid stupid film written by a cruel director who seems to think he is some kind of Eurofilm Auteur. There is also a scene in the film where the child appears with large bruises on the face and the mother grabs him and has this total lack of reaction. The whole film is like that. People see really strange things and do not react in any normal way. It must be a bad plot and direction. <br /> <br /> Anna Paquin does her best to interpret her character in a realistic way without bursting a grin, and looks amazing in a t-shirt, but at different critical moments in the story, she doesn't care to call for backup. You know, more or less the same, "I'll walk into a probable evil demonic situation without any knowledge of defense or help from others who bring flashlights or firepower even if I sense an imminent fate." And even more stupid than it may seem, even if you carry the Age of Darkness, these creatures that make you bleed can't attack if you have a light source, but they appear as people you know and they tell you to turn off light. It reminds me of the video game "Alone In The Dark"; maybe this movie is a rip-off of the concept of that game. <br /> <br /> The best actors in the film are the boy and Anna. Both die in the end. The whole family dies. The creatures of Darkness brought them to death, but in reality, the stupidity of family characters was the main cause of death. The other adults could be interchangeable with any other actor from the Red Shoes Diaries fine-film series. <br /> <br /> So, to conclude, the worst things about this film are the stupidity of the characters who were shouting blindly in an obviously abnormal situation, the really lousy plot (there is an old architect in the story who designs a house with a sacrificial altar hidden in it - the architect suspected from the beginning that there would be hidden sacrifices in the house but did not tell anyone because, well, for no real reason, they could not find the children, but did not worry to tell the authorities of the HIDDEN ROOMS that he designed at home, but he likes to attend the house for a period of 40 years because he worries about what's going on inside ... derrrrh ... duuuuh), the banal use of the mechanisms of fright (more children who wander in the dark or who show themselves only in the photographs, and blood in the background), and the selfishness of the director who when you see him in the features of the DVD describing his shitty work as a new and original Finally, it makes you understand where the real horror of this film is. <br /> <br /> Is it fun? At 2x speed on a DVD player with the subtitles turned on, it can be fun, until you reach the end and make the movie crap, otherwise you draaaaaaaaags up. The cinematic equivalent of a fat shock; empty calories are horrible. <br /> <br /> The film gives the impression that the director must have seen "The Ring" and wanted to try to create something similar in the mood, that in this regard, the film fails miserably, and therefore, even to this regard, Jaume Balaguer√≥, it is my opinion that you suck at what you do.
