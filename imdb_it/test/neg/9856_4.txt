This episode sucks. <br /> <br /> In recent years I have seen all the episodes of "Next Generation" and "Voyager" and now I'm looking at "Enterprise". <br /> <br /> I am thoroughly enjoying this series. Until this episode. I stared at the screen in horror at the destruction of the character and entertainment. It's more like an attempt at slapstick. <br /> <br /> He does not build characters but throws them on a limb - and leaves the audience breathless. It does little to build the series. <br /> <br /> Because this was allowed to go on air it amazes me. Was it writing? Was it the director? Was he the producer? We will probably never know. <br /> <br /> But a bad apple is not bad, I suppose. I say I hope it's just one.
