The key scene in "Nine Lives" by Rodrigo Garcia comes when Sissy Spacek, hidden in a hotel room where she is pursuing a relationship with Aiden Quinn, finds a naturalistic documentary on television, at which point Quinn notices the invention of these things - - The movie is edited into a scene, predators and prey are thrown together to capture the moment - all to force connections where nobody really exists. The characters of the nine shorts that make up this film spill from time to time into the stories of others, but none of them ever seems to really connect. A woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her violent father is then visited in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a mastectomy. A man who meets an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life was supposed to host a dinner for an unhappy couple with his current wife. Garcia organizes some of his characters in front of each other, but none of the subsequent stories has ever really built up what happened before. <br /> <br /> Garcia's first film, the wonderful, neglected "The things you can say only by looking at yourself", also had a story structure and overlapping characters, but there were less and they had a lot more space to breathe and grow. The thoughtful premise of "Nine Lives", in which each of his nine stories is told in one, uninterrupted real-time capture, never allows the film to create a truly dramatic tension or moment of tension. It's also a pretty visually ugly movie. The internal shots are often murky and difficult to watch, while other scenes - in particular the one where a girl walks back and forth between the rooms to talk to her non-communicative parents - are made annoying by working with the camera. Since this is Garcia's third film and has a respectable history of directing for television, the direction of this film is rather surprisingly amateur. Like film partner Rebecca Miller, daughter of a great writer, Garcia (son of Gabriel Garcia Marquez) focuses on writing and on the aspects of the characters in his films, often to the detriment of those of the cinema. <br /> <br /> The individual scenes are moving and even influential. I liked that Jason Issacs kissed Robin Wright Penn's pregnant belly. And Joe Mantegna lovingly whispers to his wife as he slips into pre-operative sedation. And Sissy Spacek stole some happy moments away from her life with Aiden Quinn before returning to do it with a phone call from her daughter. But the film (unlike "The things you can say just looking at them") seems more like an exercise than a real drama. We're just watching people act.
