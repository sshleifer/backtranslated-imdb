I'm also a fan of science fiction, among other genres, and I particularly like the films of the '60s and' 70s with their premise "ideas on effects" that produced so many clever and funny stories put on the screen. In a nutshell, I completely agree with Scott's review of this film. I heard about this film, and being the one I mentioned earlier, a science fiction fan from the 60s and 70s, with a penchant for science fiction stories with the touch of the "twilight zone", I expected a lot, and my expectations had increased with reviews that rated the effects of this "second best" movie on Kubrick's "2001 Space Odyssey". What a fraud. "Journey to the farthest side of the sun" was an ordinary, twisted, half-baked and foolish film, with laughable special amateur effects (and I remember that I love films of that era and contempt for CGI), and can be completely compared to Science fiction disasters of the 1960s like "Marooned", which "Journey" reminded me of. The idea behind this is not so bad, but building the plot on a story of a twin planet on Earth, on which the same world is inverted, asked a master like Kubrick to direct. Needles to say that Robert Parish is nothing like that, so he made a boring and silly movie that looked and sounded like a morning TV series of those days. It's not worth wasting your time, even if you're a true fan of the genre.
