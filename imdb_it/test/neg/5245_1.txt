GOOD: Technomusic that accompanies the medieval sword. Furthermore, the film looks more elegant than most b-movies, but let's face it: Quake or Doom have more atmosphere. <br /> <br /> BAD: unintelligent storyline, no acting and absolutely incredible universe. I am usually able to see the potential of even very bad films; heck, I love a good B movie like "Split Second" and the like. But this has nothing but boredom and clich√©s to offer ... Completely predictable from start to finish. Oh, and I forgot the bad special effects, they look more like an old Playstation game than anything else! The use of a classic poem to sell this sucker offends me! <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: Simply boring. If you want to see Lara Croft, buy the game, it's much sexier!
