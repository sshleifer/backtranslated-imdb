I hated it. I hate the inanimate pretentious self-consciousness that masquerades as art. This film is stupidly stupid or stupid. After the first half hour, I made a quick digression through the DVD version, and saw the same young shennanigans over and over again. I got angry for having spent hard-earned money on a philosophical trap. Tinting drivel in sepia or blue does not make a film something, not to mention art.
