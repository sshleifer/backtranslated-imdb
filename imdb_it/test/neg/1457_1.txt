This is a film that has garnered some interest or praise that it has simply received on the merit of being a piece of lesbian interest. The performances are mostly emotionless compared to the best films in the genre of interest GLBT. The entirety of the film's value to watch is gathered from a modest suspense of whether and when the members of the partner's family will say something discouraging about their lesbian relationship. The best element of the film is probably the beautiful scenery of New England, although much of the film is set inside. It is hard to imagine how any viewer who watches this film and does not seek the affirmation of their own GLBT lifestyle or wishes to see that of others by affirming, even through a poorly realized drama, can appreciate Treading Water significantly. It's a terrible movie.
