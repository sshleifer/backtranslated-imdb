HBO production typically developed with a first-rate cast, a rich, small-town atmosphere and some beautiful narrative cartoons, embellished with above-average production values. <br /> <br /> But, and this is a huge "but", the various subplots, populated with funny and mostly annoying caricatures, are very thin and go back and forth in opaque sections for over three long hours. <br /> <br /> The often silly story wanders uneasily between melodrama, without being fun enough, and personal drama, without being at all profound. <br /> <br /> A pity, because some scenes really shine. Two or three, that is. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 dirty Paul Newmans
