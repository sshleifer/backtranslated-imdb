Hello. I saw the first part when it came out, and I don't remember leaving such a bad impression on me like this. <br /> <br /> First, the animation is moved, of wood, not worked, lacks naturalness - I understand that the style of the drawing was of an "Atlantean" type, but, one could do with the usual Disney finesse. .. see "Tarzan" to see what I mean. If I hadn't seen the DISNEY logo at the beginning, I would never have said it was a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the plot was more like a PC game style, like a good old search. Not that it was ugly, but it lacked a story that tied the viewer to the characters and their goals. It was not convincing, at least. The film was designed for children, but sometimes it was child's play. <br /> <br /> Third, the music ... I would say it was improper, but it fits the whole scene perfectly with the plot and animation ... <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this was kind of fun, just a kind of project by several apprentice animators, just to fill the bill for Disney movies. I'm sorry to hear it from myself, a great lover of Disney ...
