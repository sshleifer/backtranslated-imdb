A useless effort. It is apparently a typical catastrophic film: we are involved in the lives of some people involved in the Big Event. However, the script is so horrible and there is so much to explain in the background of the characters within the dialogue that we feel we are being treated like idiots. Even Sesame Street did not explain Mr. Snuffleupagus's origins or how Mr. Hooper died: we can work on it. Some thought that the inclusion of "Enron" in the script would have given him a certain value when discussing power companies. Acting is generally insignificant, with the exception of older artists (Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy), and after the first hour, I didn't care who the storms were anymore. <br /> <br /> But maybe there are special effects to watch. Unfortunately not. Even on a 20-year-old television I could see a computer-generated tractor and trailer ?? Maybe there are budget limits, so I can forgive that. The footage of a plane trying to land seemed pretty real, but I kept telling myself that I had seen it before. This site confirms it: it came from a previous film, Nowhere to Land. <br /> <br /> So, in summary, the only good bits come from another movie, and when you see the best action sequences packed into a 30- second promotion of the network, it makes Category 6 quite good. My advice: trust your network to make good 30-second movies, watch them and save two nights.
