What a disenchanted casino! Duncan Roy's film is apparently autobiographical, yet it is impossible to find a glimpse of emotional truth in this chaotic, misinterpreted and sadly amateur fiasco. <br /> <br /> In a sense, you have to admire the balls of a man who, through grim determination and a generous benefactor, manages to make a film about his rise and fall - from abused, proletarian, to criminal English gentleman. However, the tone is so self-contained or so arched, that it is impossible to interact with the characters or the plot. The raw material is potentially a great stuff, however Roy seems unable to make fun of the kind of story that you should grab by the throat, so move to tears. And the reason why it was ever created to be projected as a triptych of images is a complete mystery - presumably because a single image would have been too boring to look at. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see so many good actors - Bill Nighy, Diana Quick, Lindsay Coulson - who offers the worst career performances.
