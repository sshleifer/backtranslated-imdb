We found this movie almost impossible to watch. With such an exceptional cast, it's a shame that writing and directing were so horrible. The harrowing rhythm to which the story was told was exasperating. The flashbacks were awkward. The characters were one-dimensional. Heavy metaphors - the river, the cat - have been repeated too often. <br /> <br /> The movie Nobody's Fool, based on another novel by Russo, was infinitely better, probably because it was written and directed more closely. <br /> <br /> Photography at Empire Falls was lovely. Too bad it wasn't a travelogue. I read the novel and enjoyed the writing style, but I had some quibbles with the novel itself. I would give the novel 4 out of 5 stars. Perhaps the writers and the director were so impressed with the novel's reputation that they felt they had to include every damn thing in their movie. This was supposed to be a television movie, guys, not books on tape.
