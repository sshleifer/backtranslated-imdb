We all have to start somewhere, it was in movies like Escape In The Fog that someone like Budd Boetticher could learn his job before shooting good movies. In fact the film was dated before it reached the film in public on June 25, 1945. <br /> <br /> The war for Europe was over for almost two months, of course not even Harry Cohn could control the events of history. So I wonder why even then the public didn't ask why a Nazi espionage ring was helping the Japanese. Another very negative historical inaccuracy was that the FBI had nothing to do with peaceful or Asian theater. The mantle and dagger were the territory of the OSS in that part of the world. <br /> <br /> When you are an FBI man like William Wright, it's certainly nice to have a psychic girl like Nina Foch. He is about to leave on a mission to the East to deliver the names of the main underground leaders to start a general uprising in China against the Japanese occupation. The Germans who bothered Otto Kruger's home discovered it and the whole movie was spent with these guys who have already lost the war trying to help their allies. By the way, they are referred to as "Japs". When Foch is blown away by a racing car and unconscious, he dreams of Wright's danger and sees what's going to happen to him on the Golden Gate Bridge. She goes there and foils the plot. <br /> <br /> All you would expect from a good film noir, the foggy atmosphere of San Francisco, the dimly lit sets, Budd Boetticher did his best as the cast. But they weren't convincing, probably because they didn't believe in themselves. <br /> <br /> It is possible, but it is not likely that Nina Foch's dream and its psychic consequences could be more developed and developments were left on the floor of the editing room. I think it was just a lousy script. <br /> <br /> And Budd and Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures had fast-moving history events against them here.
