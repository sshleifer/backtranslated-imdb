After watching this movie I decided it was so terrible that I had to sign up for IMDb and write a review to warn others about the rent / purchase slots of this movie. To be honest for the film there is only one good section for this film and this is why then you know that this shit ended well. I watched it until the end, hoping to get some pleasure out of the movie. Only more tunnel tunnels and an old man who speaks for himself (If you watch this movie for too long, you'll do it too). As for Val, if he continues to select films like this, he can also say goodbye to his acting career. There is no point in writing about what has already been done in the film. Keep your money and sanity and keep yourself clean.
