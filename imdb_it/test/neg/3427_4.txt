I just took "Farewell to the King" on cable, and maybe it's just because I'm a girl, but I thought it was on the craptastic side. The script and direction are pretentious (once it was discovered that John Milius was responsible, everything became clear). Secondary actors really weren't bad - James Fox was great. The biggest disappointment was Nick Nolte, who usually amuses me. Once he becomes a native, he begins to speak with a very stiff and pungent English, and half the time, he seems rather distracted, as if he had just smoked part of the generosity of the Borneo rainforest. And then the end - what ??? Learoyd seems to be on the same boat as The Botanist (by the way, did the botanist unload the girl, or what?) ??? Does the boat seem to just barely get aground near an acquisition of a mature island from a mad defector of the army of anglo-headed fighters ??
