This is one of the worst movies I've seen for years. The plot has a potential that is never realized. Actors are the wrong choice, but considering the script, their talent is not wasted. I really wanted everyone to die as quickly as possible so they could go out and look at something else. Unfortunately, I stayed until the end and laughed at the murmurs of people complaining about how gross it was. There were no boos, after all, this is England, just kind groans about how this shit was. Then, I look on IMDb and I see 288 people who gave 10 out of 10. I don't see just how those people are able to give that score. They must be a public relations company that works with the distributor. There is a hilarious set problem towards the end of the film, when in the graveyard and in hick attacks, watch out for the sinister scenarios that break when touched (it's supposed to be a brick wall) - the effects of blood are tremendous OTT - the film feels like everyone has a horror of parody except the director.
