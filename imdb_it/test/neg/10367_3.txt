This and the previous "Toulon of revenge" and the next seem to be completely different from the first two films in which the puppets were not so beautiful. Basically choose your series, the first two go together and paint the puppets as murderers, while the next three are a series of them that are the good guys. This sounds very similar to an episode of cheese television series to be as good as the third part and I never had the urge to try looking at the fifth part of the series. Basically, a child takes puppets while some strange dark lord or something sends out his evil puppets to kill, this dark lord seems to be some sort of enemy from one of those Japanese live action shows like Ultraman. The film is finished before you know it, so you must have the credit for not having inflicted a very painful movie on you. Only for many holes in the plot and things in it to be considered an ok film. You can see the guy who played Toulon in the last movie, but then you have a very anti-climate battle and the movie is over before it really starts.
