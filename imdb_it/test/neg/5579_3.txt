From the opening blow of the meteor falling towards the Earth, you know you have something special. <br /> <br /> This is a very low budget shot in a movie about a group of teenagers stranded on a lighthouse island with some monsters. The story is irrelevant and nothing that you haven't seen thousands of times before. The acting is not exceptional but it is not completely horrible, however the special effects - of which there are many aspects - are ridiculous at best. In fact, if you can read this sentence, it's much better than 50% that you could do a more credible job creating the video explosion and compositing effects in this film than the directors. <br /> <br /> The saving grace of the film - If you're in the mood for a Grade A movie turkey - it's that something always happens and it never gets boring. And if you like making fun of bad movies with your friends, you could find this value for a dollar for rent. <br /> <br /> And I must say that I appreciated the opening joke, "this is the stupidest name on an island I've ever heard." Probably the best moment of the film.
