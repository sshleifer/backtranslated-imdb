The first word I can find to describe this film is Awful. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. First of all the plot is a very thin plot (we will not talk about this part further) and a plot that many films of this kind are following. This makes the movie so ugly, because you know what's going to happen. Secondly, the film contains a lot of questions that are never revealed. One of the questions (and this is not a spoiler) is: WHAT THE HELL ARE THE CHILDREN THAT DO IN THIS MAIS !!!!!!!!!! Third, the characters are bad, not only because the film is bad, but also for the unpleasant actors. They are as bad as they can be. <br /> <br /> The last thing that makes this film negative is that it's a horror movie. You should be afraid of murders or sudden shocks, but you're not afraid, you're not horrified because you know what's going to happen. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The film is as ugly as the film about killer ants! I was hoping it was a fantastic film but because the story is ugly, the actors are bad, the film raises many questions and because it is not scary, the film is the best ever seen.
