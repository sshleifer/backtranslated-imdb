Oh dear. This sequel has a mirror this time that houses the evil spirit of a psychopath who murdered an entire family with a gun in the Amityville house. The mirror captured the whole ugly incident of the horrified family who didn't have time to prepare for their uninvited guest. The mirror is given to a photographer, Keyes (Ross Partridge) by a tramp (.. who by chance is his crazy fool, and the man responsible for killing the family) and the evil soon terrifies those in a loft ( .. like the Keyes, Suki painter, played by Julia Nickson-Soul) where she lives when they examine her. Soon Keyes is having nightmares, looking through his father's eyes as he tears the family apart in cold blood, worried that he could follow in his footsteps. Soon he sees other events through his father's eyes like that terrible day that hits his mother's head against the floor of an institution or experiences a moment inside the cell while the doctor gives him a drug to immobilize him. <br /> <br /> Fairly solid support cast that deserve better to be stuck in the garbage like this, like David Naughton (American Werewolf in London) as owner of the loft with which he lives Keyes, Richard Roundtree as eccentric sculptor / artist , Terry O'Quinn as a detective psychologist, and in particular Lin Shaye as a hilarious ditsy, rather strange secretary-nurse in the asylum (.. the one that held Keyes's father) soon to be closed. <br /> <br /> Rounding out the film, sexy and graceful Lala Sloatman as Keyes's support girlfriend, Barbara Howard (Friday 13: The Final Chapter) as Naughton's betrayed wife (.. she was about to start a relationship with Nickman-Soul), Jack Orend as the sadistic enemy who tries to provoke his son to kill innocent people like him, and Robert Rusler (A nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge) as a rejected lover (.. of Nickson- Soul) that meets an unfortunate disappearance while ripping the paintings out of revenge for his dismissal. /> <br /> This film is a poor film of special effects that simply uses the title of Amityville as a recess. The franchise has never been so nice to begin with, but since each sequel was lit in green, it has become worse and worse. After the third film, the furniture of the infamous house becomes "possessed" objects that torment people. The cast strive, however, but the material (.. a mirror that causes chaos and murder through supernatural means) is lacking in quality ... and the rather mediocre special effects do not help make a difference. O'Quinn, no matter how little he needs to work, shows why he's such a great actor, he can even shine in droppings like this. Not all is lost, you can see Sloatman always wearing short skirts (or his man's shirt in panties), showing his legs everywhere ... hey, you have to find a silver lining somewhere. Believe it or not, AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION was the seventh film in the series! The most beautiful part of the film was the portraits of demons painted by the artist of Nickson-Soul, perhaps inspired by the mirror of evil after having examined it.
