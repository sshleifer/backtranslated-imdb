There is no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was a very talented director. Many of his films are undeniable classics that have stood the test of time and are highly observable to this day. This list could include The 39 Steps, Rear Window, North by Northwest, Dial M for Murder, Vertigo, The Birds, Shadow of a Doubt and some other films. <br /> <br /> However, "Suspicion" is not aging at all and it is really so unwatchable that it seems to me that it was probably a bad movie even by 1941 standards. The list of scenes that work well could be listed on a matchbox with a crayon. The script is loose and ridiculous most of the time, but the acting seems so forced, of wood and at the amateur limit all the time, which is almost unbelievable. Joan Fontaine tries to make things right but she is on a slippery track and Cary Grant does not provide much assistance. Sometimes his acting was so bad that I saw better performances in school plays or in Theater Theater classes where a chemical engineer acts for the first time without formal training. <br /> <br /> After about 30 minutes of watching this movie, you may find yourself looking for the DVD cover in the dark to see if you've accidentally picked up some sort of special version that has been cobbled together without any editing. <br /> <br /> The argument is serious, yet the film has a silly and trivial feeling that seems so out of place that one becomes insensitive perplexity. <br /> <br /> "Suspicious" is basically unwatchable and another highly overrated BAD movie.
