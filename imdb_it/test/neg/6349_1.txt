Last night I got bored and decided to watch a movie called "out kold" that I had once bought with a lot of other cheap movies from a video store. It looked like a good old action movie, so I pulled out the fries and coke and was ready for a relaxing evening. Well, the pain started from the beginning. The main character is a boxer who is the cutest guy I've ever seen. As a good person he must be kind, of course, but it's just a pussy! This totally does not fit a boxer who has 28 KOs and starts working for a pimp to earn some extra money. Even good guys can still be fantastic. Well, then came his first fight while working for this pimp. Each shot was clearly missed and this became even more annoying because the sound effect was not synchronized with the fists. Then there's this totally useless acting of the whole cast, and you have enough reasons to leave this movie for what it is. I gave it a 1 because I've never seen such a bad movie.
