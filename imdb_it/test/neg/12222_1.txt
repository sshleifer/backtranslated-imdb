This is probably the worst documentary I've ever seen. He seemed so delightful. Chris Hegedus was one of the directors of The War Room which was a great movie (albeit a bit sideways), but it was beautiful. Startup.com seemed to have been shot in someone's basement. The quality was so painful that I couldn't bear to look at it. I saw about 30 minutes or so and had to bring it back to Blockbuster and get something else. I can't understand how something so amateur from someone like Chris Hegedus. How the hell did he win this award to start ??? The War Room certainly deserved an award, as well as another great documentary called Ameragosa (both awarded). This documentary seemed made by an uncle Joe who also does weddings on the weekends. Flickering lights, poorly lit, unflattering, bad sound, a 10-year-old could make a better film than that boy.
