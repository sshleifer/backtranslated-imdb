There is a part of a sequence in which some water rushes into the sunken plane, all that happens in this film is the recording of a film for the airport 77. You can also see Jack Lemmon and Christopher Lee in some of the shots. A total rip-off? Well almost by definition. There may be more footage in this film than in Plan 9 From Outer Space. <br /> <br /> All the new material, the actors sitting in an airplane talking, is bland and terrible at all levels. Dennis Weaver is totally wasted on a low career film, although this is true for everyone else besides director Fred Olen Ray, who uses one of these many fake names to continue working. <br /> <br /> There is a low level of professionalism that makes this film a waste of time, it would be really better if it was shot by someone without any technical knowledge, because Ray has sufficient knowledge on how to put together a scene in the worst old school fashion TV that this film, like most of its films, is totally lifeless. The worst kind of hacking job. The worst kind of film. Boring. <br /> <br /> This type of film is a waste of money, a deal in which the crew of all levels are ghosts who hope to get any payroll checks they can and that no one will see or know that has appeared / participated in this rip-off. There are so many people who want to make movies that it's disgusting to see Ray burn the money given to do nothing but fill the time. <br /> <br /> His comment track is interesting in that it must begin by explaining that it is really Fred Ray as he is not credited on the film itself. This tricked me into seeing him not be fooled.
