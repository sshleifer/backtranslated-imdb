Well, they sent it on TV between midnight and 2:00 am - it seems like the right time to watch it, and then go to bed after ... <br /> <br /> No, he wasn't really living on mine expectations. I think the Dogma concept is good, because the film is closer to what is really happening among the characters involved when cutting out all the unnecessary effects and the music that makes the mood. But again, this concept requires some interesting action among the characters. <br /> <br /> I can't say that I know King Lear (Shakespeare's version) very well, if I had known the play, I probably would have been able to predict much of the film. <br /> <br /> Well, a crisis can bring the best and worst sides of a character on display - and we certainly see some downsides. Oh yes, the painting of civilization and culture can be very subtle, and behind this paint you could find an animal. <br /> <br /> If you then compare it to "Italiensk for begyndere" (Italian for beginners) or "Mifunes sidste sang" (the last song by Mifune), you see the same thing but the opposite: a crisis can certainly bring people to see their lives in a more constructive way. And if you dare to do it, you could win. <br /> <br /> When the film is finished, I thought to myself: "Oh, that's why I've never seen it before ..." The film has its beauty. The quality of the work of the cameraman, the actors, etc. It's good. But the script may need something more. A plot might not hurt.
