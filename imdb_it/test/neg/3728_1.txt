This was undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen. And that says a lot, because I've seen my share of horrible films. <br /> <br /> But I've never seen a movie where every single character portrayed was a non-intelligent loser. Seriously, there was no respectable character in the entire script. How appropriate it is that the plot was equally lame, devoid of any intelligence. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz would even agree to participate in such stupidity. And while I haven't seen all their other films, I've always enjoyed their performances so far. It's not that the acting was bad, only the whole plot was stupid.
