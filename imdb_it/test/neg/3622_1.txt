Zoey 101 is such a stupid sight. I don't know if this is due to the fact that the haughty Jamie Lynn Spears is the prettiest star or what, but I only know that the show sucks. It's about a girl and her brother going to a boarding school. The jokes in this show are extremely boring and unpleasant, and I hate every single character except Chase and Lola. Hell, the jokes about this show are so little fun to make Jack Black look like Monty Python. This show is undoubtedly one of the worst shows on Nickelodeon, it's right down there with Avatar and Danny Phantom in the pit of shame, and if this show were someone with some honor, he would hang himself in shame. <br /> <br /> 1/10
