It's a shame to throw away such a good idea. The main idea of ​​the film is to travel in past lives that - fortunately - are not a journey through time but a journey in man that has nothing to do with the past or the future. (Maybe they shouldn't be called past lives at all in the movie now that I think about it ... another minus, I think). It's all in the present, in a different space ... Very interesting without causing much religious stress. <br /> <br /> However, the music is totally repetitive, melodramatic, sentimental and out of place (not to mention "western"). "!). There should have been more variety and more thought about where the music should be and where it shouldn't. The romantic flashback scenes take up a lot of space and run time and are completely useless. Acting isn't bad, too if the language has prevented me from understanding it better. <br /> <br /> I think the idea needed a little more reflection, development and development.The internal scenes could have better background settings because in many cases they seem unreal: on the whole, I would say that this film leaves a lot to be desired ...
