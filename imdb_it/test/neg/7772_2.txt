Lazy writing, bad acting and wooden direction lead us to a 2005 TV movie, produced in Canada, called HUSH, not to be confused with eight other films of the same name. Tori Spelling and her husband doctor move from San Francisco to his small hometown, where they run into his old home friend, who decides to love him again. She becomes pregnant with Tori's baby (don't ask) and starts throwing down anyone who can hinder him as he plans to reunite with his old flame. The actors who play the old friend and the doctor are not worthy of mention, since they act more dishes than dishes. Tori is not much better, but at least she is something to focus on while the plot unfolds here and there before coming to a very boring and all too familiar conclusion. Look instead at the HAND THAT ROLLS THE CRADLE.
