you will probably be disappointed by this sequel which is not a sequel. AWIL is a classic. But this film is further from being a classic you can get. what a joke. special effects that are not very special, horrible dialogue, non-acting and a ridiculously ridiculous quickly and unconvincing, (not to say fleeting), mock-up attacked with about a third of the film left. I say that history is less blades. That's not what a serious horror movie should have been, yet it's stupid to be funny in every way. The evaluation he currently has (4.8 / 10) is too generous if you ask me. My rating for An American Werewolf in Paris: at 3.5 / 10
