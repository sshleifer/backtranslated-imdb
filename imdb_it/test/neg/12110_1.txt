The director of this film is a famous French TV presenter, Patrick Sebastien. He likes redneck music and humor, and his incredible film is absolutely in his image. It is the story of a retarded young woman called "Zep" (sic). One night, he sees his sister SM's sexual relationship and decides to do the same thing: he rapes the girl he loves! Zep is housed in an asylum and his unfortunate girlfriend in a clinic. A man will find them. A man will bring them together. This man is a psychologist. This man looks like an angel of hell. This man is ... Patrick Sebastien! With excessive use of clich√©s, we will see how Absolute Love can break all misunderstandings and how a humanist doctor can force a victim to fall in love with his rapist. We will also learn how to use sandwiches to seduce a girl. Not only does Patrick Sebastien think he can do better than a century of psychiatry, but he also imposes a foolish sinister ideology; with the character of his father's girlfriend, a boss, who wants to take away his girlfriend's weakness. Distressing. But it is very pleasant to laugh at Zep (mentally retarded people are not funny except in this film.)
