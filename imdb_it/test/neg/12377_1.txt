I wish I could have voted this movie for ten, it's so funny. If they wanted it to be so funny, I would have given a ten. I have to give it a 1, but it's the funniest thing you've ever wanted to see. Watch the giant screen blur on the screen! Where does it come from? What is that? Fly, terrify, it's thrilling, it's on strings! This bird has a real personality. I was about ten years old when I first saw it, and when Big Bird appeared on Sesame Street, I was sure they were the same thing!
