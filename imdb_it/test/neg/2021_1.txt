I'm speechless. This film is indescribable. I don't think there is a language on Earth that has a word that can describe how horrible this film is. If you try to watch it, make sure you stay for the "surprise end". I only did it for about three quarters through this piece of shit, before I couldn't do it anymore. Fortunately (or unfortunately) a couple of my friends stayed until the end. When they woke up from their coma and after a couple of weeks of therapy, they were able to explain to me what I had missed. This film has no story, plot, horrible writing and even worse acting. If you like watching shipwrecks or car accidents, then this movie is for you. I think my IQ dropped about 30 points from this (insert the curse here).
