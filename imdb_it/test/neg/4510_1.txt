I have rarely seen a literary work translated so badly on the screen. The hysterical cast of the b-movie and sitcom extras simply renders the characters as bad Jewish stereotypes. The worst thing of all is Melissa Gilbert, whom you hate from the first scene and never develops sympathy for. Performances like this should be noted and used against actors who wish to work again. All in all, a sick and low-budget film of that kind that gives a bad name to films made for TV.
