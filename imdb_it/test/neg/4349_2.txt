My brother and I are big fans of Asian cinema, so when I found this movie hidden in a store, I bought it on DVD because it looked very promising and I couldn't wait to see it. So I saw this movie with my brother and I have to say that at the beginning it was very promising. We both loved this brutal ball scene in the first scene. But I guess it was all. There are some interesting fights, but it's not an action movie, as it claims to be. Instead it is a love film ... with the clich√© of love so highly played over the top, even Shakespeare vomits on this title. Sorry for my language By the way: the characters behave as if they were taken from the street and given 100 ?? for playing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, my brother and I looked at it until the end, because we thought, it can only improve. But heck, it never happened. This film challenged first place among the "worst movies ever" of my brothers and mine - list, followed only by "Fantasy mission force" - don't even look at that.
