... a film arrives that becomes absolutely terrible from the opening titles to the studio logo tagged at the end of the credits. It was such a film - the same kind that you can't stop watching for fear of losing a moment of its downhill quality. <br /> <br /> Forget the low budget that is indicated by a slow and monotonous opening sequence that shows secret service agents running alongside a presidential procession with no crowd, no traffic or visible location. Forget the confused logic necessary to make the real story even plausible. Forget that Roy Scheider offers some of the funniest dialogues while failing to hide his shame. <br /> <br /> This clunker has a terrible rhythm, bombarded by a soundtrack that is simply ridiculous and seems modified by a third grade. All the while the scenarios are contorting to cover the most difficult thing of shooting a cheap presidential story: making it look presidential. <br /> <br /> I honestly feel asleep briefly on the last reel, and when I woke up, I ran back so you don't miss a single heartbreaking frame. Try this alcoholic game: take a shot every time you see it cheekily mocking another much better movie. You will also fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Since "Man" with Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy I have seen such an incredibly irredeemable project. I could distribute copies as Christmas gifts. Zero stars A thousand laughs.
