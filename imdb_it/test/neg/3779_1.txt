I heard that this move was made by a group of high school students. As an art project or high school theater is not bad. Unless you lived near milpitas in the seventies or if you know someone involved in making the film, this is pretty awful. Most of the actors are clearly not actors, but local volunteers. Bob Wilkins (the original guest of Creature Features on KTVU in Oakland appears, but only for about a minute). Some of the monster effects are done with stop motion animation and some with a man in a monster and each of them works well, but there is no continuity between the two. Looking without dialogue, assume that the film has 2 monsters. I imagine that the most unbearable aspect is that even the main characters, which I assume are the boys behind the film, cannot even pretend to act. These guys must have been involved in the theater somehow for wanting to do this project, but they show zero credible emotions in front of the camera.
