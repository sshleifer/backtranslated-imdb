This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The cast is international - Australian - pretending to be English, theater American and a character with an English name who sports an unrecognizable "European" accent. What efforts liable to be played by this heterogeneous group are totally undermined by a plot and a script of particular inanity. So short were the throws in the budget of this film and the overall production values ​​are so low that it would have had no problem winning a limbo film competition. Over the past twenty years we have seen horror and thrash movies of extraordinary quality thrillers (though not necessarily "high") that have been made without a budget. Recent examples include the "Blair Witch Project", badly made but totally scary, and of course the most recent low budget winner, SAW, with virtually unknown clues (Gary Elwes is just someone you don't even remember if you've seen him before). In DARKHUNTERS, it is shocking to find a well-known leading actor, Dominique Pinon and Hollywood, Jeff Fahey, who is fighting bravely to save the film. It is embarrassing to see the lead man, once handsome (Fahey), with a trivial trick that emits bizarre lines. I would have rated this movie as 0 out of 10 was possible!
