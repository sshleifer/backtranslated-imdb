The story of Ed Gein is a disturbing and terrifying story. And he really was a messed up character and his legacy has continued to inspire "big" greats like The Tooth Fairy, Norman Bates and Leatherface. How is it possible that such a charming man inspired a boring melodramatic piece of drivel ?? Ed Gein created nipple straps, skull bowls, leather lamps, danced around the moon in clothes of human skin. None of this came into the film because they needed to give us a fictitious story about a ridiculously awful deputy and his rather housewife and sex-hungry girlfriend. This film seemed to go astray to falsify the story. What confuses me is that many films move away from the path of truth to exaggerate history; this seems to do it to minimize it. I just don't understand.
