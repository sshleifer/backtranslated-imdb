A remake of a successful film can at best be a difficult affair; to remake a true classic, especially one that is probably the definitive film of a director like Alfred Hitchcock, is something else. And after seeing this version of "Psycho", directed by Gus Van Sant, two things immediately come to mind: what's the point and what the hell were they thinking? Especially in light of the fact that Van Sant used the same script (by Joseph Stefano, based on the Robert Bloch novel) used by Hitchcock. The final result here highlights some of the finer points of the art of cinema: first, a "remake" should be just that; a re-equipment of the original, rather than a "copy" using new players; and second, that shooting in color, using more blood and being a little more graphic, does little more than detract from the impact of the film. Although this was a noble effort by Van Sant, ironically, in the end, he suffers from the same defect with which Norma Bates was afflicted: the "mind" of the film was divided; half was Hitchcock, half Van Sant. And the two, although met, will never be bound. Van Sant, even working with the original script, it would have been better to make his film - to the end - rather than trying to duplicate exactly what Hitchcock had done with certain scenes. The opening scene of the film, for example, and in particular the "shower" scene, is undoubtedly one of the most famous scenes in the history of cinema. Copying Hitchcock, from the shots looking directly into the shower to the drainage, and using the same `skree! Skree! Skree! ' sound effects - also as a tribute to Hitchcock-- again, just distracted by the story. And, if you consider the performance of William H. Macy (as Private Eye Arbogast), you still have another division in the psyche of the film. Macy is an exceptional actor, one of the best actors in the industry, and his performance here is excellent; but however good the attitude and delivery are pure David Mamet (with whom he has worked many times) and apparently out of the context of what Van Sant is doing. So the film ends with a triple personality disorder: Hitchcock, Van Sant and Mamet. I seemed to be watching "House of Good Will Psycho Games". <br /> <br /> As for the performances, Macy's was as solid as they are, and Anne Heche (Marion Crane) did a good job of creating an original character, escaping the trap of attempting an imitation of Janet Leigh. The weakest ties were Viggo Mortensen (Sam), who made Marion's boyfriend so affectionate and unattractive as to ask you why he had something to do with him in the first place; and Vince Vaughn, who - to put it as gently as possible - was just as horrible as Norman Bates. His whole performance was that of an actor who played a role (and not very convincing); influencing the effeminate ways and punctuating his speech with "spontaneous" explosions of manic laughter made his Norman more of a caricature than a character, completely incredible and pretentious. He gave the film the feeling of a re-enactment of a "real accident" that you would see on a TV show; it would have been entirely in line with the sensibility of the film to cut Norman sitting alone in his living room to a Peter Graves shot with a sober face, intoning: "Such was the mentality of Norman Bates on that fateful, A rainy night when Marion Crane came out of her car and into her life ... "The supporting cast includes Julianne Moore (Lila), Robert Forster (Dr. Simon), Philip Baker Hall (Sheriff Al Chambers), Anne Haney (Mrs. Chambers), Chad Everett (Tom Cassidy), Rance Howard (Mr. Lowery), Rita Wilson (Caroline), James Remar (Patrolman) and James LeGros (Charlie the Car Dealer). If nothing else, Van Sant's "Psycho" is a curiosity that shows that having a good director, a predominantly excellent cast and a script that is a proven commodity does not necessarily ensure success. Certainly, the current era of psycho-Catholics, "American Psycho" and Hannibal Lecter have in fact distanced themselves somewhat from a character like Norman Bates; but there is still a singular intimacy in this particular story of the relationship between Norman, his mother and his victims who will remain forever intrinsically disturbing and terrifying; but Van Sant cannot convey that sense of terror, that fear that grips the throat, with this film. If ever a film had been made that should have been directed directly at the video, it is so. Better yet, if he had never been born. I consider this 2/10
