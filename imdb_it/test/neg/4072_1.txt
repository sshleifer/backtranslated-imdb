This film is so bad that it's worth seeing. This film will see viewers entering and leaving a coma within the first 10 minutes. It all started when a group of writers got the idea of ​​a jet hijacker being hijacked and a passenger who can fly a small plane must land the beast. However, they know it has been done many times before making it different, let's do it very badly! Major Masters has its name pirated from the 80s movie "To Live and Die in L.A." from the character played by Willem Dafoe. This saved 10 minutes of writing and production time. The plane should be a Boieng 747. That plane has a unique silhouette, even in the dark with its characteristic hump forward on top. Just ask the late Ronald Reagan who complained about this point when their Ruskies shot down KAL 007 in the 1980s. However, when the plane takes off, it is clear that a 747 no longer looks like a 767. This well-studied film also forgets to include the engineer's seat in the cockpit and replaces it with two comfortable seats. No need for a flight engineer on this complex floor! The heroine is played by Gloria Lynn Berg perpetually sulking. After binding the hijacker, despite several loads of people on this jumbo jet, no one bothered to look at this guy who almost killed them all. He's just forced to have fun. <br /> <br /> The crippled plane, which loses fuel from all the shenanigans of the hijacking, will not return to Hawaii so the Masters will try to land on an Air Force base located on an island. Only the track is 300 feet too short! Four army men with small wild cats (the type who rent to carry all day long carrying a load of horse manure on the back of your barn) will erase a 200-foot-wide and 300-foot strip of jungle in 20 minutes ! No need for a bulldozer here! Where can you find guys like this? These guys could make a highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in 3 hours equipped only with spoons, a compass and a duck! <br /> <br /> After the infernal obstacle has been resolved, the Masters will try to land the plane as a heroine looks away. The hijacker giggles to himself and without supervision he gets rid of more trouble. In the end he is subdued in a more delayed way than I can tell you. But, can you say Moby Dick? <br /> <br /> There are so many delayed scenes in this movie. The injured captain is parked prone on the plane of the plane while Masters, who presumably can barely fly, puts the plane in a 60-degree counter and 20,000 feet a minute. The pilot should be French who kisses the ceiling during these demanding stunts, but does not move an inch. <br /> <br /> I think that if they had chosen different actors to play the parts, this movement could have been better. If we need a sullen heroine in the film, why not choose the best-known actress Bernadette Peters who seems to be perpetually sullen as well? Also, she can sing and the old busty Peter could present some free cleavage shots. Now with the singing angle this could be a hijacking, Let's Land the Plane Movie MUSICAL! Launch Luciano Pavarotti as a pilot. They can sing a duet in the cockpit before the hijacking and there is no way that the tubby tenor would fly to the ceiling while Masters works his magic on that big bird. In line with the musical theme, the Masters could be interpreted by Andrei Bocelli, with whom Peters sings while landing the plane. Not only is he totally blind, he only knows a couple of words of English. This is a plot! Think of the edge of your conversation between Masters (Bocelli) and the air traffic controller: <br /> <br /> ATC: "Sir, please reduce to 180, flaps set to 25 degrees and keep 230" <br /> <br /> Bocelli: "What?" <br /> <br /> ATC: "Sir, the arm spoilers now confirm the brake pressure at 250 psi. Keep the descent at 500 fpm" <br /> <br /> Bocelli: "What?" <br /> <br /> The hijacker could have been played by the late great Rodney Dangerfield, who can throw up a plethora of his one-liners while sitting tied up and unattended: "I have no respect. Wife has group sex Yes, he cheated me in front of the judge and the jury! "Do you take the idea? <br /> <br /> MISSING OPPORTUNITIES The film has your weeping and wailing passengers that have never been developed. Woody Allen could have been behind offering one of his neurotic monologues: "He said I was great in bed, I told her I practiced a lot ...". THIS is a movie! <br /> <br /> Furthermore, according to the similar film "Executive Decision" in which Steven Segal's lazy eyes are mercifully killed in the beginning giving the film a chance, the 747s have huge attics at the top. The plane was introduced in 1969, so who knows what has accumulated over almost 40 years up there? My uncle has old clothes, a sled, magazines and all kinds of things in his. Wouldn't it have been nice if Masters had opened the trapdoor and seen Chevy Chase with tears in his eyes in a woman's dressing gown watching old Super 8 movies from his childhood? Just a recommendation. <br /> <br /> So give it a chance, and as you come in and out of consciousness, imagine how great this movie would have been if I had my hand in it ...
