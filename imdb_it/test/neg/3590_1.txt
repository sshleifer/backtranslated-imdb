I voted for this movie at 1/10 and I did this in a good way. this film is not as it seems and I don't understand it. take the first joke, for example. Theirs is that sign at the beginning to start. well, this was OK but then they started talking to someone about the hood and then he dies, then the other guys who talk then die after the other says that people don't get to birthday without dying. and now he has a cake. then he dies. <br /> <br /> The jokes are simply stupid, they are so clever and I would have thought they would have been better by someone like the directors of the horror film: <br /> <br /> Shawn Wayans (written by) & Marlon Wayans (written by) & Phil Beauman (written by) <br /> <br /> but sucks and I, the next time they want to do another comedy, make good jokes that are not lame.
