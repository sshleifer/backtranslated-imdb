This film is absolutely terrible and horrible. It's not a low budget, it's a film without a budget that makes Ed Wood's films appear as art. The acting is abysmal but the sets and props are worse than anything I've ever seen. A normal subway train is used to transport people to the evil area of ​​killer mutants, Woddy Strode has a bullet and the fighting scenes are shot in an abandoned gravel pit. There is sadism as you would expect from an Italian 80s video. No talent was used to make this film. And the female love interest has perhaps a huge Italian taste. Even by the Italian standards of the 1980s this film is damn terrible but I imagine it came out at a time when there weren't so many movies available on video or the viewers weren't really insightful. This piece of shit has no entertainment value and is not even fun, just boring and extremely cheap. In reality it is insulting the most stupid public. I just wonder why an actor like Woody Strode ended up with a turkey like this?
