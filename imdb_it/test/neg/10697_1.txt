This piece of Crap is actually the BOMB, as in Bottom of the Barrel. I can't understand which is the worst; The boring portrait of Norris of anonymity (not a big trait in an action protagonist) or the hysterical exaggeration of Christopher Neame. This film does not offer any level level. The action sequences are domesticated, the plot is very thin and the scenes that should be horrifying look like a clich√© from the 50s. You can't just fill a smoking room and men in rubber clothes, and expect the public to scream in terror. <br /> <br /> Visually the film does nothing for me. Actually, it looks like an unfortunate mix between a cheap porn movie and a Miami Vice scam with a splash of hellish spawn. Do not wait. That should have been a real yawn.
