A malfunction in space sends astronaut Neil Stryker (Glenn Corbett) off course and heads for something in a parallel world, called Earth, that surrounds the sun exactly in front of the Earth. Since a being from space would pose a threat to the order of this world, Stryker is detained until it is possible to establish precisely what to do with him. Stryker, however, becomes suspicious of his surroundings and flees. With the help of a friendly nurse and an old scientist who opposes the government, Stryker will try to get on a spaceship and return to Earth. <br /> <br /> Stranded in Space (or The Stranger if you prefer) is another one of those 70s made in TV movies that would have been turned into a regular weekly show. In this case, it's easy to see why he didn't make it. First of all, there is nothing new in the show set-up. It was undoubtedly designed to follow the same formula used by The Fugitive or The Incredible Hulk or Planet of the Apes. You know, a stranger in constant motion who goes from one city to another taking any strange work that can be pursued by a government agency or journalist. It is a formula that was made to death. The second attack against Stranded in Space is his advantage, Glenn Corbett. Could this guy meet someone less likable? I was rooting for him to be discovered. Without sympathy for the main character, this type of show would never work. Finally, this should be science fiction. Just because everyone is left-handed and someone has hung three fake-looking moons on the horizon, should I jump to the conclusion that this is a distant planet? So is it a simple coincidence that they all speak English, dress like people on Earth and drive the Plymouth Furies? Yes, right. <br /> <br /> The highlight for me was the inclusion of Cameron Mitchell in the cast. Sure, it's hard to look at it in something so terrible, but you know the old saying - any Cameron is better than no Cameron (yes, I've never even heard it). <br /> <br /> As with much of these '70s TV movies, I watched Stranded in Space courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I wouldn't call it a big episode anywhere in the imagination, but there are some good jokes along the way. So in the end, while I consider the film a 2/10, it gets a 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
