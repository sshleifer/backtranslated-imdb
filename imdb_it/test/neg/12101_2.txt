What a waste of energy and money. What a waste of that talent was there. <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez was completely wasted and mostly unused for everything. Jon Lovitz was very slightly funny but useless. Harry Dean Stanton - why bother? And it was just me or Kari Wuhrer barely acting in this story. <br /> <br /> The story was rather non-existent and very disconnected. One of my biggest problems was the characters' reaction to the events that emerged. Like the surf "dudes" who give up their lives whenever they've been threatened in the last half? How about if you've never seen them surf once !! The set-up of some scenes got the upper hand with not enough pay-off to let us cheat. Nothing in this "film" was really true or genuine. <br /> <br /> The only positive things I can say are some (very little) of the landscape was well shot and some scenes were slightly interesting. Don't see it when there are so many useless films out there.
