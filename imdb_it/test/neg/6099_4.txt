The Three Stooges are probably the greatest comedy in the history of cinema. For this reason alone, they deserved a much better ending in Columbia than they received with this short. <br /> <br /> "Sappy's bullfighters" is not really good. Of course, it's not all Joe Besser's fault. I personally think that some of his short films are quite amusing, simply because of the departure from the usual fanfare of the Stooges they contain, and for the fact that sometimes Larry is put on more show. However, this brief will not work. And the fact that it is known that it is their last short film that has ever been shown, well this only adds a general disgust. <br /> <br /> This film perfectly sums up how the short subjects were in the last dying breaths during this period and how little effort was made to achieve them. This short is so sloppy. It's a simple remake of a curly short, "What's the Matador?", Shot years before. As if this was not bad enough, the studio actually threw the filming of Moe and Larry from the original (which was shot almost 20 years earlier). Aren't these things obvious? Ridiculous or sad? You are the judge. <br /> <br /> Another part of this short that makes him unhappy is the fact that he is basically a showcase of Joe Besser, with him showing that everything that is (at least in this film) is a Curly- wanna-be-gone-completely-wrong! Moe and Larry have little to do in this short. As a fan of Larry, I also have to say that it seems a bit shameful to me that Besser could use the joke that Larry had initially disclosed in the short film "Ants In The Pantry". To see Besser say "I can't see, I can't see!" and you have Larry saying the simple "Why don't you see?", while Besser gets to beat "I have my eyes closed", it's just wrong at all levels. <br /> <br /> The two brave soldiers who got stuck for all those years, Howard and Fine, have so little to do in this short. There are almost no funny bits with them. The only thing that qualifies is Larry hiding under the bed of a jealous husband, trying to be "Pepe", his dog. <br /> <br /> You can't blame the dynamic duo. Larry and Moe do their best. As ridiculous as could be (and I'm sure they had their opinions at this point in their career), Howard and Fine have never given anything less than their best. Their efforts do not pale from 1934 to 1959. <br /> <br /> I often like many short films that some will find horrible. They are all for their most "experimental", unusual short films. At least those contain new ideas. However, this short, I think everyone can agree, is simply not good. <br /> <br /> Thankfully, TV later discovered the guys after the shorts department was closed. If they had been forced to leave this way, it would have been a great injustice for all the years they invested in making the public laugh.
