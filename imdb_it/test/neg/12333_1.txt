The worst movie I've ever seen. The sound quality was bad, the cut scenes were even worse and above all it was not logical and had no speed ... <br /> <br /> Before I thought, "Oh no, I don't want the track that shows that the poor Patrick was an innocent murderer ". But this turned out to be even worse. Typically in this American film you get a super hint or no suggestion. I want small little tips to direct you to the murderer. The public is not involved. And now, when I don't understand anything, in the end we can expect a pair of "he / is-the-killer" scavengers to finish. And that's not all. ah ... This is hopeless, let's make it end ... <br /> <br /> In a word: Disgusting .. <br /> <br />
