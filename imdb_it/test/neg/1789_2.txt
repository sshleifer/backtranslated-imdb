A handful of young university stepsisters decide to go camping with a professor. A giant druid wants to sacrifice them to prevent the apocalypse from arriving in 2000, they must also fight with motorcyclists, an Indian monster and a kind of monster. It's worth watching for just 3 reasons, George 'Buck' Flower (a sadly unknown staple) is available as a hobo and the other 2 belong to the beautiful Savannah (in one of the only 3 non-porn roles he had). Both have very small roles. Too bad the rest of the film is terribly ugly. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD Extras: Original Trailer <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: 4 pairs of breasts, 2 donkeys
