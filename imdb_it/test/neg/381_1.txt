Mr. Bean is just a bunch of slapstick humor. It is the most humorous television series ever made in history. The scenes are often disgusting and the horrible canned laughter sends chills through the spine. Mr. bean is a selfish and rude character and one can only sympathize with how pathetic he is. It is incredible that such a low quality TV series can be supported for 5 years. It is a complete waste of time to watch even 1 episode and one cannot help but express disgust and pity for which Rowen has portrayed herself as such a two-dimensional character, little fun and ridiculous. Or take pity on yourself because you took the trouble to watch an episode. Watching this is an aggravating experience.
