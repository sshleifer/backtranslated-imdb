While the dog was cute, the film didn't. It was not the premise or theme that was a problem. The premise had great possibilities for both humor and pathos. The theme is worthy. Helping other people is more important than amassing a fortune. <br /> <br /> Sadly, the adorable dog, the unique premise, and the theme were undercut by poor acting, stylistic dialogues and amateur shots. <br /> <br /> Even my youngest child who will sit down almost everything gave up before we got half way through. How many times can that dog run up and down the same corridor? I can't ruin it for you, as I've never seen the end. It was not worth looking at the end.
