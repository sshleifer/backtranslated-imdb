I loved this movie 10 years ago when I was about 16 years old. My biggest mistake was watching him again, 10 years later. It's not the worst "I-wanna-be-a-pilot" movie ever, but it has so many flaws that you can hardly overlook them. <br /> <br /> The Queen's "One Vision" (along with the rest of the soundtrack) makes this film better than the patriotic nonsense you usually see;) <br /> <br /> [**** ------]
