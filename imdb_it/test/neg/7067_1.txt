. . . and never, never see it. Now, I've been watching bad scary movies for years. I love watching bad scifi movies. I think this was the only reason I could watch this movie until the end. I was tempered by "Nukie", "Indian Superman" and that terrible "Fantastic Four" movie, just to name a few examples. Usually, I have to bang my head against the wall after seeing a bad movie to get rid of some of the pain. No, not with this. With "TDB", I had to hit my head with a shoe in the middle of the movie. Temporary correction. I can't believe I want to see it. I cried. When he finished, I cried. It was horrible. It was worse than when I saw * the chills * Wil Wheaton in his underwear in "The Curse", which, by the way, never looks. Apart from the fact that Wesley Crusher is in his white heels, it's really bad. But this review is about "TDB". The worst part is that someone wrote this film and said: "This deserves to go on film! It's fantastic!" and Wayne Newton, Rob Lowe, and everyone else in the cast said, "Oh, that's what I want in my movie history!" I watch "Indian Superman" until the cows return home, but I will never see this steaming dren pile again.
