Other reviews have talked about how sincere this film is, especially in terms of male frontal nudity. Well, those who have seen Grande Ecole with their often naked actors and expect something similar are in great disappointment. Apart from a few seconds in the judo team's locker room, the two pilots' shower has a total duration of 15 seconds. The female protagonist has relatively short frontal moments. Much of the marketing of this film is for the gay male audience, but those who expect even a hint of homoeroticism between the two male protagonists (the best friends who have a triple with the girlfriend of one of them) will be more disappointed. There is not even the hint that one is interested in the other, or even barely aware that the other is part of the menage a trois. As a film, Douches Froides is curiously not engaging; the viewer has very little sense of who these three young people are, how they feel, why they behave like them. About an hour of the original cut was canceled; perhaps this is why the finished film seems frustrated undeveloped. Attack with Grande Ecole, a French film that more than keeps its promises.
