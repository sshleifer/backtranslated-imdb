The whole movie is so terrible that it's a complete mess. The story is so stupid that I can't believe anyone actually sat down to write about this and thought it would be a good movie! Acting is probably the worst of all the b-movies ever made. I've seen a lot of science fiction b-movies before and some of them are actually pretty good, but some of them - like From Venus - should never have been made. <br /> <br /> Some filmmakers think that just because they put something together and somehow got on the shelves of a movie store, they made something - which is good and should be watched by people. This is not always true, and it is absolutely not true for Venus. This film loses on all the stories: horrible acting, stupid plot, very weak special effects, ugliest costumes ever, unrealistic dialogues, bad direction, etc. It can only be said that this film only took about $ 20, and I could give it too much credit there! I urge you to stay away from this wreck movie train for your own good!
