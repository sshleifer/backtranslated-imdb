Ravi Chopra wrote this film 40 years ago, he wanted to play Dilip Kumar at the command <br /> <br /> The film was finally rewritten and made in 2003 and therefore the subject seems dated and too superficial sometimes <br /> < br /> As the reason why Amitabh-Hema is separated is too superficial, even the way young people are shown is as bad as Gulshan in AVTAAR <br /> <br /> The message comes along well but things are presented so clich√© Salman's character is the worst, he seems to have come out of a storybook while Bachchan's climax is good and even the final of not forgiving children is good <br /> <br /> Ravi Chopra does a good job The music is decent, the songs sung by Bachchan stand out <br /> <br /> Amitabh excels as always, he played an elderly strict father first but here plays a victim and portrays her well His last speech is great Hema is good for his part Aman Verma stands out Samir Soni is fine, N aseer and the rest the children and wives are decent even if Divya Dutta stands out Salman Khan is fa ke, Mahima is ok Paresh and Lillete are adorable
