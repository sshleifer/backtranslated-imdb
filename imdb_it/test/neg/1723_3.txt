Not only that the cover of VHS and DVD (at least in Europe) shows a scene that has nothing to do with the plot of the film, the acting is so bad, that the film desperately asks to be teased. If you have nothing to do, you are with some good friends and you want to laugh about a movie, which should be serious, look at Tycus and Peter Onorati, a man who will teach you how to hit bad guys with empty cardboard boxes! Shame on Dennis Hopper, following Travoltas's example in his "battlefield". For those who want to see a good film about the destruction of the earth by a terrible force, please don't choose Tycus, but do yourself a favor and look at "Armageddon" for the twentieth time!
