I went to see this because of snipes / statham, but honestly, chaos is terrible. This film has absolutely nothing to do - it should not have been done. <br /> <br /> Don't read this review if you don't want to read spoilers, because I'm going to face a lot of plot-holes here. <br /> <br /> First of all - the opening scene. It is the great event that made the two characters semi-protagonists (Statham and Snipes) turned in a distorted way. But it's boring and trivial. Only at the end will we see what really happened and for the moment it won't interest you anymore. Furthermore, the whole event, in which a villain and his hostage are killed, is not news big enough to fill hundreds of newspaper articles, as indicated in the film. <br /> <br /> So bank work - it doesn't take off for any second. The bank robber makes some unnecessary references to the chaos theory (which has NOTHING to do with the whole story, by the way). The way Statham is summoned is very "Die Hard With a Vengeance", but more boring. So the things that happen in the bank are strange and useless. -That is with the safety deposit box. There seems to be some plot going on there, but then, it is not. - Why go through the problem of putting two people together, when it leads to nothing? It involves a lot of preparation and is not used at all! - Why doesn't the SWAT commander listen to the officer in charge when he tells them to stand up? <br /> <br /> And it's only the first 10 minutes. It keeps getting worse and worse. <br /> <br /> - The story of romantic / love interest (with "he was not just a better cop, it was a better comment to finish him off) is painful to watch. It's just useless - Because the character of "Statham points out the change of position of the camera in the video reviewed by the bank. This essentially leads to finding the" virus "that will get him all the money." Because going through the trouble of forging some guys signs and killing him, but then NOT killing the boy which can identify you. <br /> <br /> I could go on for centuries (really), but it's like this movie is ... useless. The whole script is a mess. "Smart" references to the theory of chaos are really ridiculous and quite pathetic.The plot "twists" can be seen from miles away and the main characters seem to make mistakes all the time.It's really painful to watch a movie like this, where the audience is taken for granted as a mut or popcorn that creaks people, of which the director hopes not to see all the holes in the plot and the ridiculous script of all. The "explanation scene" ultimately adds only insults. It's really, not really a good movie. In any case. <br /> <br /> People who come to see an action movie don't get what they come for. People who come to see a movie friend of the cop don't understand. People who come to see an intelligent thriller do not understand it. In essence, everyone gets the same - a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and skip this.
