A thinly veiled attempt to push Hulkamania to the fan of the non-wrestling film. What could be worse than Hogan in the movies? The bad actors in the wrestling ring and this film both produced, while Tiny Lester made his way to the WWE that summer in the mother of all promotional mistakes. See the dictionary under Oops. Like a card that brought a stupid kid from the world with me, he paid to see it in the cinemas and when I left I immediately got in touch with H.A. - Hulkamaniacs Annoynimous. I am proud to say that I have been off Hulk for 17 years and have never had a craving since. Since this was done to bring more fans to the juggernaut that was the WWE in the Hogans, the first day must wonder if there were no more fans like me who turned to other times gone by that do not poison the mind like this celluloid offense made, like gas or Russian roulette.
