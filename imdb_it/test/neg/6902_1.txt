I can't find any saving value for this movie. It seems to be freely inspired by the school of thought of the Lion King. The father is killed, the son cannot fill his shoes and tries to escape, etc. Etc. Etc. The only difference (besides being in a courtyard instead of a jungle) is that Barnyard tries to "rekindle things" with the club-type of music. They go a long way in trying to be cool. The problem is that it's not really nice. It's like "that boy". Everyone knows at least one of those "kids" who are older and still frequent the younger crowd in a futile attempt to hold on to their youth. They try to be cool to fit, but in reality they are not. This is the film. <br /> <br /> But hey, if you have money to burn and you want to pay someone to suck 90 minutes of your life, don't let it stop you.
