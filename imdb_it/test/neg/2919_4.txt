Although this is not an all-time classic comedy, it is a nice little movie to watch if you find it on a rainy Saturday morning with not much else at that time. <br /> <br /> Harold Lloyd plays Ezekiel Cobb, an American who returns home after growing up in China where his father was a missionary. He returned from China to find an American wife and plans to return to China to continue his father's work. Bob is involuntarily recruited to run for mayor of his corrupt hometown when the existing political machine that controls the city realizes that it would be perfect to run against the current mayor, who is also the head of the city's underworld. They imagine that the Cobb stumbling block has no chance of winning and therefore the current mayor continues to run the city and execute his schemes that make them all rich. <br /> <br /> Lloyd is not doing the physical comedy here as in his silent films. He makes a convincing portrait of Cobb with a discreet dignity reserved. The acting was nice to everyone involved and the plot and script were pretty good too. <br /> <br /> Having been created in 1934, the film has a rather racist language when it speaks of the Chinese and also has a typical black character from that era but these stereotypes are not as petty as those I have seen from other films era. <br /> <br /> Although not close to Lloyd's best film, this movie is entertaining and Lloyd is as good as Cobb. You won't be swept away by this movie, but it might be enough to increase your interest in Lloyd and get you wish to see more of his work.
