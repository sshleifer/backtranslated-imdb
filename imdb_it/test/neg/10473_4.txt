I really don't know if this should have been science fiction or horror. To say the least confused. What really upset me, however, was the lack of story development among the characters. <br /> <br /> The sheriff's seventeen-year-old daughter (Bruce Boxleitner) (Clara Bryant) stayed with him for the summer, and it doesn't take 30 seconds on screen at the same time. <br /> <br /> The Native American hot (Jennifer Lee Wiggins) seems to have the sheriff's scepter, but they don't spend any time together. <br /> <br /> The hot secretary (Kristen Honey) ends up dying and has had more acting skills than the other two put together. <br /> <br /> The bad developer against Native Americans is an overused story, but personally I like the evil developers who get theirs while I live in Florida. <br /> <br /> The only reason I stayed was the creature. It was original I've never seen anything like it and I'm a sucker for new creatures.
