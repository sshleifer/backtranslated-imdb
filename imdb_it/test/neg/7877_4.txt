This is not a good movie. Clear and simple. He brings out hardcore sex scenes and what you have is a mediocre plot, average acting (at best), driving direction and boring dialogue. Add the grot and you have mediocre plot, average acting, tiring direction, boring dialogue, with lashes of hardcore porn. The problem is that porn is nothing special. So it's not a good movie and it's not good porn. It fails on both fronts. They can say that women made this film and they intended to do it with it, and with it, etc. But talking is cheap, the end result is what counts, and what we have here is a mediocre film with some sex thrown in for the value of shock to try to convince you to waste your time looking at it. One of those movies where you'd rather have the time you spent looking back.
