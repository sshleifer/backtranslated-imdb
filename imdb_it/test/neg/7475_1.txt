When the opening blow is that the US marines are seriously lacking in respect for the US flag, a film has a difficult road, but unfortunately it has been downhill from there. There is an accredited military consultant, who is also apparently a retired former US Marine, making it even more disconcerting that this incredible violation of the protocol and the law has gone unnoticed. Even more puzzling is the way in which they simply flew over the way a Marine is reported KIA, then buried, in a very short time, without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body, or if there was even a body. The US government is still finding those missing since World War II and it takes months to identify the remains. The slaughtered soldiers remain MIA for months or years and are declared KIA only when the remains have been positively identified, or after years of bureaucracy. Here we expect that we believe it happens within a few days or weeks. Perhaps this happens in Denmark, but not in the United States. Clearly none of the people involved ever had the slightest involvement or respect for the US military. Beyond that, there are a number of other moments to laugh about when the characters come with gypsies from nowhere. There must have been really extensive meetings between the author and the actors as they struggled to find their motivations for such nonsense. Having a script that would have worked could have been helpful, but this seems to have been invented on the spot, working at Cliffs Notes. There is no way of knowing if the script was horrible originally, or if it was the author, or the middle management guys in the studio who have responsibility. However, this is a terrible film that should never have been made.
