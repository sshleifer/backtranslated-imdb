ANY GUN CAN PLAY (2 outta 5 stars) Totally routine "spaghetti western" starring that guy who played "Kookie" on "77 Sunset Strip". The plot is a twisted nonsense on some stolen gold coins and various armed men of dubious motivation trying to trace it. This is one of those "carefree" westerns ... which means a lot of laborious attempts at "comedy" ... and really atrocious music during most of the action sequences (we can say that this is not the work by Ennio Morricone). George Hilton plays a bounty hunter called "Straniero" ... but does not leave much impression ... he simply does not have the style of Clint Eastwood or Franco Nero, who are able to do a lot with a poorly written character. The ending is a complete tribute / parody of the finale of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" ... although it's barely funny enough to be considered a "parody". The highlight of the film is the first 5 minutes ... with actors modeled on Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and someone else (should it be Eli Wallach? Franco Nero? It's not very clear ...) that they have to face from the foreigner. It's a funny joke for fans of Sergio Leone fans and spaghetti western fans ... but I guess no one else would see the point.
