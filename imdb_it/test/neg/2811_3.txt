I didn't see any other Antonioni film and the people who saw this with me agreed to share themes and images with the rest of his works. Perhaps if I had seen other things from him I would have liked this, knowing what to expect. <br /> <br /> I saw it as a nearly complete failure for many reasons. First of all, the film introduces interesting and profound questions about social relationships, feelings, the nature of reality against fiction, but this is very often done in the most sensational way that makes the characters talk as if they were giving speeches, wandering forward and back, juxtaposing statements rather than having dialogues. The writers seem to be so worried that we won't get the point they prefer to tell instead of showing. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film has no rhythm, especially in its first half. It's not just that it's slow. Some slow movies have been made with an excellent sense of rhythm and rhythm (Victor Surice's El Sur or Scorsese's The Age of Innocence are examples I like), but to be successful you need to find the characters so engaging or the story like that touching that we can adapt to it. This does not happen in Beyond the Clouds, where the first episode seems to drag on to infinity, and the relationship between the "reality" of John Malkovich and the love stories "fiction" is sometimes fluid, others sudden, others confused.
