Special special previews are always a good time. Regardless of the movie you are watching, the theater will always be crowded with people who have been waiting for the movie, like free stuff, thought it would be something to do or simply lost. However, no matter how good or bad the film is, only the public will make it enjoyable. Now, when the film is a pseudo-horror movie PG-13 (can you really get into the horror when the MPAA is on your back to censor everything?) You know there will be talk, laughter and sighs. With The Messengers, the crowd did not disappoint giving numerous bangs and warnings to the characters on the screen. As for the actual film, I am sorry for those involved because it could have been much better if it had been rhythmically right and allowed to stretch the legs beyond progression / disappear / show progression subsequent to these films. In the end we are shown a boring and tiring story, without surprises and a few moments of real suspense. <br /> <br /> History is common. A family moves from the big city to the country after a traumatic event to try to rebuild their relationship with the other. Once settled, the spirits of the house come out of the reformed thug whose past makes it even easier for parents not to believe everything they are told. Obviously the child does not cry the wolf and those around him only discover it when it is too late. I will give credit to the Pang Brothers, (directors of the acclaimed The Eye that I'd like to see more than before to see what they can do without Hollywood's interference - presumably the shooting on The Messengers was done by someone else, but the brothers have keeping the merit is a real pity what our study system does to foreigners, especially when it was the creative independence to make the films that introduced them and not the underlying interferences, to really have a suitable style and to maintain somehow the tired plot is fresh. Unfortunately, however, I also have to give them credit for the almost unbearable slowness. Similar to the reason why I didn't like what's below, I couldn't stand the suspense that came out, which went so far as to make it Ridiculous: When our heroine and her brother stand in a corridor with a ghost behind them, the scene lasts about eight minutes with only static, strangely composed and changed close-ups. Focusing in depth to finish with nothing. For just 84 minutes, I almost think it would have worked better even shorter. <br /> <br /> In addition to a very effective opening sequence, with the fantastic Jodelle Ferland, (strangely interpreting a boy), and a great sequence atmospheric credit, the only thing that saves the film from total garbage it's acting. Except for Penelope Ann Miller, who first made me wonder what ever happened to her and then, after a few scenes, made me understand why I never asked that question in the years she was absent, and Dustin Milligan, completely lacking of credibility, acting is very strong. Dyan McDermott does a good job while his father tries to keep his family together at all difficult times. He has many small moments of light comedy to counter his serious and dramatic role. William B. Davis (everyone's favorite Cancerman) is used effectively as an almost premonitory character, unfortunately no longer used. Our real stars are Kristen Stewart and John Corbett. Stewart interprets the emotion well and shows some promises as an actress with this and Panic Room in her resume. As for Corbett, if he hadn't played his role, the whole movie would have been completely unraveled. I wish it would have been given more work as I liked it since the unpopular "The Visitor" series ?? I still need to take a look at his first role in "Northern Exposure", a show I haven't been able to recover yet. It is a pity that it will probably be more recognizable for the supernatural My Big Fat Greek Wedding. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, The Messengers gave me a nice introduction to the work of the Pang brothers and reinvigorated my desire to take a look at their Chinese horror catalog. The mood and performances were there; it was just the simple, empty story that required too much padding to make a feature film. If they had gone deeper into the other characters, rather than just those of Stewart, it could have been more effective despite having something more to show then scenes of ten minutes of nothing. If our protagonist is the only one to be attacked, there is no suspense about how much the creatures will hurt her. The moments of danger had no gravity for them and until the end stopped. I'm excited, however, for the free comic book released after the special screening, as it is hoped that the medium will allow a faster story that it absorbs before trying to surprise.
