I had avoided this movie for a while ... because I saw it as a useless bet on a series that should have had only 2 parts. But, after reading some pretty favorable reviews ... from some IMDB observers ... I spent $ 1.50 and rented it at my local video store. I have to go further ... when I say ... this was a buck-50 lost. This film is one of the 10 worst films I've ever seen. First of all ... I realize that nobody wanted to see a 33-year-old Macchio in this movie ... But, because they couldn't have made Miyagi read a letter or something about Daniel-san ... maybe explaining what it happened to Daniel ... hell, they could at least have made a quick reference to daniel or something. But, no ... and to compile the already bad script ... they added those stupid monks ... I thought the monks made a vow of silence ... I guess these ignorant monks don't take their votes seriously ... hehehe. The training that the girl went through in the film was hasty and stupid ... and the paramilitary group of young males ... it was a confusing concept to say the least ... it wasn't even a martial arts film. ..with the girl who fought only briefly in the final scene ... and then she didn't even come close to being hit once ... by the male who fights her ... give me a break ... she would have been struck at least once ... I guess the writers and directors thought it would be shocking to see a girl get pummeled by a male in this one. I could go on forever ... but, after all ... I'll finish by saying that this movie was so bad ... even the girl they chose wasn't even cute to look at (it was kind of a "butch" looking). ... I can only think of a handful of films I've seen ... that compare with how bad this movie was ... DON "T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE .. ....... .
