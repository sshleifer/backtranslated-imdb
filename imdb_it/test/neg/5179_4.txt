"Rise of the Footsoldier" follows the relentlessly cruel journey of the gangster Carlton Leach and his associates through drugs, violence, sex, violence, weapons, violence and did I mention violence? <br /> <br /> The protagonist Carlton Leach (Ricci Harnett), member of the ICF (Inner City Firm); a group of soccer thugs transformed professional gangsters, guiding the public through the events that led to the 1995 "Range Rover Killings", in which three gang members fell victim to particularly vicious "blows". Leach's success as a goalkeeper and talent in finding justly violent friends to control unruly bettors in a local nightclub throws him into the company of notorious drug traffickers and gangsters, profitably benefiting from the rave scene of the 80s and 90s drug. <br /> opening the dead with brutally realistic blows, the viewer is left open-mouthed to understand what happened, but left completely unsatisfied. The next 2 hours unfold through a series of countless character introductions. Each of these fundamentally establishes yet another typical "hard man", shows him to attack the usually undeserving victims, before coming to an even uglier end. That little emotional understanding that the public is able to train for some of the characters (for example a family man accused of missing drugs) is quickly destroyed when they are killed in an anticlmatic way, or their plot remains unresolved. The references to a plot introduced at the beginning are not sufficiently concluded with vague impressions on how the murders occurred, since the events were fielded with a small reward to persevere with the confused confusion of the previous events. <br /> <br /> This film was made with a standard formula in mind, for an audience that prefers violence and bold jargon to a real plot. "Rise of the Footsoldier" borrows too much from the "Football Factory", leaving out the positives, demonstrating any moral ramification of the hooligan subculture or establishing empathy with the protagonist. Violence, although brilliantly resumed, seems excessive and implausible because no one is long enough to allow the public to create an emotional attachment. The implication that the gangs are untouchable by the police is fairly fair, but macheteers who regularly commit blatant murders in public places stimulate the imagination of even the most willing spectator. The public is baffled by the relevance of many key events and developed characters that had no effect on the final conclusion. The attempt at "gritty realism" is further destroyed with a substance called "Truth", which the Turkish mafia uses to persuade honest responses from unwilling individuals. This is NOT the kind in which to invent psychologically unrealistic drugs, and makes the interrogation almost absurd. <br /> <br /> The real scenes of violence (before becoming repetitive) maintain a bit of tension, coming together with quick flashes of color or the end of a film reel. Rough choreographed seamlessly accompanied by a forced but effective free-hand camera job save the film, but unfortunately the plot (or lack of) limits it to a demographic niche. <br /> <br /> In essence, the events of this film are based on are not deservedly represented, and a suitably sequential plot is sacrificed for stereotyped characters and a non-original plot. This film has a place in the market, but if you like a little brain with your brutality, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> http://www.obsessedwithfilm.com/
