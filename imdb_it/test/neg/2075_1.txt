This film was promoted everywhere in Spain with a huge advertising campaign, after seeing it, you realize that someone stole your money. Paz Vega is as horrible as Carmen, not at all natural and it seems that she is doing a cover of a fashion magazine in all the shots ("the best" is when she as an Andalusian woman ... I can speak Basque and Leonardo Sbaraglia is very better than her like Jose, but the plot is very slow, the plot doesn't work and the script is really bad ... I think Penelope Cruz (the film was written for her) would have been a much more credible and sexy Carmen. br /> <br /> What a waste of time and money
