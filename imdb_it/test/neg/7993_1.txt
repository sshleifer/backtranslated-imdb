I came across this movie late at night on TV. My brother and I couldn't stop laughing at how awful God was in this movie. The crappy sound effects whenever the White Ninja or the Black Ninja hit, kick or use a weapon is fun. This movie is almost on the same level as the Evil Dead series, but you can only watch this movie once because of shear slavery. I'm not sure the director wanted it to be so lousy on purpose because he knew idiots like me would have bought it.
