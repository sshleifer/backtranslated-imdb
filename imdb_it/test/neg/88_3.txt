Wow, what an overrated movie turned out to be! It had to be "an extremely suspicious story about a mad killer holding a woman hostage and terrified in his home". Well, I doubt he terrorized the public in the early 1950s and I know he would put today's audience to sleep. <br /> <br /> "Send shivers down the spine," proclaims the New York Times. No, the only thrills I get is that someone has stayed on the planet who believes everything the NY Times prints about something. <br /> <br /> Well, it was a deranged man who held a woman hostage for a short time in his home but the man. "Howard Wilton" (Robert Ryan) was actually harmless and friendly. In fact, this was one of the most beautiful roles Ryan ever played! Yes, "Wilton" was crazy, but he never hurt the woman and just wanted to trust a friend. <br /> <br /> The film even became boring after a while, with very little success except a lot of yakking. <br /> <br /> Attention, my reader ..... this sucks.
