I'm speechless, honestly I can't understand how anyone could have admitted a script like this, throw anyone in the movie and just say it. The fact that I am writing this review seems to me an insult to my fingers, this film should be thrown into the dustbin rather than be revised. I'm disappointed with Flex Alexander for even thinking about accepting a BAD SORRY FOR A SCRIPT, not to mention the role. OMG! I think I just insulted the word "wise" ... oh yes, I did. You know what, the less I said about this senseless nuisance, the better. You have been warned, no one warned me that I had to experience the horror myself. SEE YOUR RISK.
