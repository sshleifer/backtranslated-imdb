Sex Lives of the Potato Men is about the sex lives of several men involved in potato delivery. So there are no surprises there. It is, in fact, more or less what you would expect from the title: that is, it is a bizarre comedy that involves sex and men of potatoes. Sometimes the movie works. It is a sharp comedy, sometimes uncomfortable on the lives of some rather insignificant and rather mediocre men who have various problems with women. Where the film clearly does not work, and because it failed at the box office, is that the bizarre and uncomfortable parts are perhaps only a shadow too strange and uncomfortable. Instead of laughing during the scene of a man suspended from the ceiling of a basement masturbating on another man while making love with his wife, I think many of us moan awkwardly and wonder what Andy Humphries thought. Well, maybe we are shown what he was thinking too clearly.
