"The Man From Utah" opens with a cowboy who sings strumming a guitar on horseback. This is the way we are introduced to John Weston (John Wayne), headed to the city and looking for work. When he helps Marshal Higgins (George pre-Gabby Hayes) foil a bank robbery with his shootings, the marshal offers him an undercover job as a deputy to investigate the Dalton Valley Rodeo. Apparently, the annual winners of the rodeo jackpot are a band of tight boys serving Spike Barton (Ed Peil), who also happens to direct the rodeos committee. Serious challengers to the supremacy of Barton Cheyenne Kent's top henchman (Yakima Canutt) end up seriously ill or dead. <br /> <br /> Even in these 1930s Lone Star Western Stars, John Wayne had a charismatic presence that suggested the future quality of the stars. If nothing else, seeing Wayne so young in these films is a real surprise. The film itself records a rapid fifty-three minute pace, largely occupied by footage of roping, bulldogging and parade and Indian dance rodeo stock. In the decisive event of the rodeo, Weston avoids disaster by uncovering a poisoned needle inserted in the saddle of "Dynamite", a previously unprotected bronco on which he must survive in Cheyenne. <br /> <br /> The ending is not a surprise, given that the bad guys from Barton abandon the rodeo events and choose the entire thirty thousand dollars of the prize pool deposited in the local bank. But Marshal and Weston are there to foil their plans and save the day for the Dalton Valley Rodeo. And as we've seen before in films like "Neath the Arizona Skies" and "Randy Rides Alone", Wayne's character closes the film in a deal with a very pretty girl, this time the daughter of Judge Marjorie Carter (Polly Ann Young) , who suffered for him throughout the film.
