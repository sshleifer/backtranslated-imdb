Uzumaki, which translates into "spirals", arriving in this new wave of Asian horror films after hits like Ringu, Ju-On and The Eye (two of them with remakes ... and much more like Dark Water and Tale of Two Sisters ), is not the supernatural thriller element so characteristic of other films, the only thing that remains is the strangeness and not in a way by Tim Burton or David Lynch, but in an irrelevant and boring way. <br /> <br /> Start with a girl, another guy with a crush on her, her best friend and her uzumaki-obsessed father! All that happens is about the Uzumaki, people die and you see the Uzumaki. So it's fine, it will go on, I enjoy the spirals a bit, the characters don't seem to go anywhere, but I'll play with them. We discover that the city is cursed by Uzumakis, people start screaming at Uzumakis and the point is that the Uzumaki are everywhere, the film is a disaster, it doesn't know where to go, except to show you the power of the Uzumaki !!! ! !!!!! There are some interesting concepts like when the mother cuts her fingers because she sees uzumi on her fingerprints, but then there is another scene in which she hears her husband (from beyond the grave !!) tell her that she too has the uzumi in his ear, the way they handled that scene was just ridiculous, not even funny, there are also some (some) of interesting images, like the collection that the father has of Uzumakis and the girl with the hair Uzumakis ... yes, the Uzumakis hair, its outs however, seems to have been taken from a fruit snack spot, where if you eat a Uzumakis fruit snack, its taste is so incredible that your hair turns into Uzumakis , now if this was not bad enough, suddenly, out of nowhere there are snail men ... or ManSnails ?? everything?? and do you know why? right? Because in their shells they have Uuuuzuuumaaakiiiis ??. This left only enough time for a bad anti-climatic final and from that moment I was sick of a little uzumakis ... uzumaki here uzumaki there, of course, look around, how many Uzumakis can you find? If you want to see a film about spirals go see PI (3.1416) now there are some very interesting uzumaki concepts between the meaning of life and Dark City also has a bit of a spiral in there. <Br /> <br /> This movie could have worked as a music video, it has already collected a cult following and this is why I was forced to see it, but after doing so, I'm not sure why people think it's great. I was really disappointed.
