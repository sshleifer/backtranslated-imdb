Even my five-year-old was bored. <br /> <br /> Very predictable, and overcrowded. This film failed to understand if it was a crap or an ironic comment on the state of "pee-wee" sports. <br /> <br /> The characters were underdeveloped, they could have done more with the connection between father and son who both came from an orphanage. <br /> <br /> I did not like the reference to the goalkeeper who slips the laxative to his teammate ... very mean for a child's movie. <br /> <br /> The typical behavior of the "mafia" was boring and stereotyped. <br /> <br /> The dog, however, was so cute !!!!
