Let's see. This film is many things for different people. For the Finns, as shown by the comments, it may be OK or terrible or boring. For others, it can be something different. First of all: if you don't speak Finnish (I do it), you'll understand half of what's going on, since the subtitles are terrible and even the title is incorrectly translated ("Paha maa" would probably be idiomatically translated as Badlands in British English). <br /> <br /> Why didn't I like it? Because it is a Tarantino-style film: it simply takes a very hard reality and rejects it, in the most brutal way possible. I, however, am not an American, so I am not particularly interested in this process, because all he does is show that the director really has nothing new to say. Technical capacity (camera work is brilliant), the script (not the non-original one) does not save this film from the background to which it belongs. If you want to see a Finnish film, go to one of the Kaurism√§ki brothers' films, which combines talent and directorial skills, with very good actresses and actors. <br /> <br /> This director should review his intentions and priorities: none was intelligible, and therefore this film failed. Not looking at it, you won't miss them much.
