Did my partner and I choose to look at this obvious piece of trash based solely on its tagline ?? After almost 30 years of rude and rudimentary teenage crap, I can't believe that only some horrible nerd horror invented the brilliantly brilliant slogan "They Axed for it"! Besides that, "Miner's Massacre" is just as casual, annoying and forgettable as everything else out there ?? Perhaps even more! The script contains all the typical clich√©s and presents all the terribly stereotyped characters you want a horrible and painful death. The effects of gore are computer-engineered and therefore beyond problems and the "big" mandatory stars (Karen Black, John Philip Law and Richard Lynch) are entirely wasted despite their billing. Do the cursed mines and abandoned ghost towns form an ideal horror environment ?? have the creators of "My Bloody Valentine" already understood it in the early 1980s? but his boring film simply didn't have any innovative ideas or even remotely surprising elements to offer. Bunch of gluttonous losers, who refer to themselves as friends even though they clearly cannot stand, to profane an ancient mine in search of the gold that is supposed to be hidden there. Obviously they unjustly awaken the zombie miner in this way and have only 150 years of rest to prepare for a massive massacre of teenagers. Yay! The cast is exceptionally irritating in this. The girls all have impressive shelves but refuse to show anything. Instead, they prefer all endless whining and taking unnecessary risks. The obtuse boys clearly act as fillers for the screen. In her just five minutes of free time, Karen Black still manages to make a fool out of herself, describing the woman as the most prototypical and hysterical local nut ever. The zombie has a stupid and very unconvincing face, but it looks okay and reasonably threatening when shown in the distant shadow of moonlight as it swings around its ice ax. Since the best thing about "Miner's Massacre" is the above tagline and you can read it on the box in the video store itself, there is very little to recommend here. Director John Carl Buechler scored some modest successes during the 1980s, such as the original "Troll" and a sequel "Friday 13", but it's obviously time to retire.
