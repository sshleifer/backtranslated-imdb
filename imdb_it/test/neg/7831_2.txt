You have to start worrying when you see that Michael Madsen is leading the Cast of any movie. I will not go through the list of shame that is his career in cinema. <br /> <br /> I watched 45 minutes and still wasn't sure what was really going on. The film consisted of a relationship of hatred for love between Madsen and Argento, who basically Madsen was insulting her, threatening violence and generally treating her like a sewer. Instead she loves him, then shes no, then he does it, she wants it, then she still loves him ... what's wrong with you woman !!!! <br /> <br /> The Script is a horrible, horrible soundtrack and an aggressive and crude, useless sexuality, which I believe has been added to entice some viewers as the film has little else to offer. I would have given the movie a 1 but managed to manage a 2 with a bit of excitement in the last 20 minutes. He actually answered a question in the last few minutes but I'm not going to share it, I'll make you suffer for the movie like I did.
