I am not familiar with the other works of the producer, but this film is a piece of shit. <br /> <br /> I've never seen the MST3K version, but I can tell you that Mike and the Bots probably didn't save it. <br /> <br /> I love a grade-z movie as much as the next fan of bad movies, but this was almost unwatchable. <br /> <br /> There was no credit for those who made the voice of "The Dark One". Sometimes he looked a little like Patrick Stewart. <br /> <br /> A group of high school students who found a super-8 trash camera in the garbage pile could make a better film than that.
