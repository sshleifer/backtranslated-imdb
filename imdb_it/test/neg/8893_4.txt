This film came very close to being a good movie. The direction must be a little easier to progress from one piece to another to make it more plausible. In particular: the main character's need to escape is not explicit enough. Are you trying to kill yourself? Are you trying to escape? His life doesn't seem to be so bad, so it's harder to swallow that wants to leave his life so much. Moreover, it is not very clear how "lover" fell with Jennifer Jason L. If the film had been reworked with more attention to these details, it would have been fantastic. On the other hand, for an indy movie, it's pretty good! Perhaps if you have a couple of drinks, to mitigate logical thinking, it would be more fun ... <br /> <br />
