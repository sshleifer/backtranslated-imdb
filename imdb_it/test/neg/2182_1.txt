The daytime TV of the movies. I have rarely felt so little attachment to the characters. I have rarely been forced to shudder from such a terrible dialogue. The thirty-year-olds of London with nausea trudge around the grim BBC series that emits blatant pinion. Avoid this movie as if it were your grandmother's clang.
