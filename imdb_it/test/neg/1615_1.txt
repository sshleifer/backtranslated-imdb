Greetings; <br /> <br /> I never thought I'd see the day when I would be so disgusted by a movie that it would be a burden to finish it ... I've always been a fan of horror movies, B'C and C included. But in this case it is difficult to describe how a film cannot qualify for any letter in that scale ... <br /> <br /> The film focuses on an underdeveloped background, a mix of folklore with an after taste. And to complete it all, the actors' performance is questionable. The horror films B usually fall into two categories ... 1) A gem that was underneath, and under funded 2) So bad is fun, laugh or repaid. Well, this movie falls in between. I wasn't scary, I wasn't laughing ... So I suppose if you really need to see it you could, but I recommend you don't ...
