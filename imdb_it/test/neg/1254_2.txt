Having just finished reading the book "One of a Kind" a week ago, I was thinking "This would be a great movie, especially now, when people know a little about poker and poker players." I was completely surprised to find him while I was browsing the video store last night. I had no idea that someone had turned it into a movie. I immediately grabbed it and looked at it with great anticipation. What a disappointment! <br /> <br /> All the intriguing things about Stu Ungar were quickly browsed, and instead I had a biopic that could have been anyone's. Ungar may have been a burnt asshole, but he was also a brilliant thinker who could read people instinctively. This is what made him so fascinating. Why not focus on that? <br /> <br /> And talk about watering down the real truth. This guy was excessive for absolutely everything: drugs, women, gambling, hunger, sleep deprivation. He played on sporting events from dusk to dawn, he would disappear for days while he was hanging in the cracks, his body was perpetually emaciated, and yet, if he ever needed money, he could always beat anyone who played cards. Now this is a story! <br /> <br /> Too much time spent on his childhood and his personal relationships (although his ties to "Vincent" and his daughter were barely touched) and almost nothing on his drug use (which was exorbitant ), his crazy gambling and his incredible card-playing skills. <br /> <br /> It is probably too late now, but I hope that someone does this film correctly. I had no problems with Imperioli. He is excellent. The script left him with nothing interesting to say.
