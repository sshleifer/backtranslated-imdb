Guys, what can I tell you? I'm Bulgarian. I can't remember how many times I talk to the Americans and, not to mention the fact that they have no idea where Bulgaria is, but they say things like, "There's a war going on there, right?" or "I never imagined that in a place like Bulgaria people have Internet" Go look at "The Man with the Brain Who Screams" by Bruce Campbell. I was curious about this movie, because 1) I'm a fan of Bruce Campbell - The trilogy of "Evil Dead" and "The Adventures of Brisco County Jr." 2) The film was shot entirely in Bulgaria, the second after "Alien Apocalypse", which is also almost unwatchable. 3) I like the good films of series B <br /> <br /> Well ... The film presents our country as an incessant Gypsy Town where you raid your car, make waves of illegal guns and you can be killed any time . And Bruce's line "Bull $ h1t Bulgaria" is more than offended. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Ceach form a great team, Bruce makes his special - he just beats. Nothing more to see here. <br /> <br /> Peoeple gives this film 10 only for the status of Bruce sect, but it doesn't deserve more than 3. Waste of films.
