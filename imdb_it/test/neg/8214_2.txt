My bad movie guru (and the president of the Exposed Film Society) introduced us this week last week. There was no denying the dull flash in his eyes as he pulled it out of his brown paper bag and announced what he had in store for us: "The Most Dangerous Game", shot on a budget of about $ 2.95. <br /> <br /> Of course, $ 2.95 went much further back in 1962, but still ... <br /> <br /> However, there is certainly a lot to dislike about this movie. It abounds with serious technical gaffes (my favorite was the 'repeated musket' which fired twice in two minutes without the benefit of a refill). The hero is a wuss who stands while his injured friend fights the henchman and is killed. <br /> <br /> Other? OK: the plot is a mess without continuity to talk about. The film spends five minutes with a "special guest star" who acts as a physical embodiment of the villain's madness and paranoia, but never shows it again. The hero is strangled by the henchman, but does not mention it when he wakes up and meets his guest for the first time. The dumb girl is captured, put in the rack ... and then the movie (and the hero, who put her in this situation), simply "forgets" her. <br /> <br /> Other? Well, the sets are cheap and the special effects are cheaper (the trick is an exception to this). Much of the plot is carried by the hum of the narrator, a monotonous off-screen voice, which has a less dramatic impact than the recital on Denny's menu. Most of the dialogue is simply ridiculous and pungent, as if it had been translated from Japanese. ("I demand that our conversation be pleasant !!!") And the color values ​​tended to move violently from one shot to another, as if the stocks of low-cost films and problematic lighting equipment were in the order of day. (Note: this may have been the fault of a wrong press rather than of the television crew). <br /> <br /> But there have been a couple of good moments here and there. The effects of the trick were surprisingly good in contrast to the rest of the film, the actors were very interesting, especially the dumb girl and the Countess. And despite everything, there was a decidedly disturbing atmosphere to be found, very unpleasant and disturbing. <br /> <br /> So what was the deal with this film? I thought about it a little bit and realized that the director / screenwriter Pat Boyette basically tried to put a story of the old "EC" horror comics on the film. This would explain the dialogue drawn up, the sketched development of the character (in a comic, the physiognomy = character even more than in the film), the intricate internal logic of the story ("The horror stories" of the EC have done everything possible to include a ugly "shock" end and they were not great on psychological realism), the excessive reliance on the narrative voice (which is part of the captions on the panels), and the interesting makeup effects that imitated the macabre images that the old CE artists made so well. <Actually, I'd be willing to bet that when Boyette saw his protagonist during the casting, he immediately saw that the boy was closest to the equivalent of the lanky, shivering and cracked faces that artists like Johnny Craig and Jack Davis drew as a true human could exist and still exist in the real world. He used costumes and lights to emphasize the cartoon aspect of the images and turned everyone into living EC comic characters. (See: the dark beauty of the protagonist, the strong bony features of the Count, the strange bronze skin and the sharp chin, the platinum that makes up, bony black henchman, etc.) <br /> <br /> This would explain the film lacks. Boyette knew how to "frame" things, but he didn't know how to deal with three dimensions and moving bodies. Boyette knew how to tell a gruesome story within the confines of a comic book page, but the nuances of the film and the live actors escaped him. He wouldn't be the first person with this problem, of course - see what Joel Schumacher did to "Batman". But he didn't have a big budget to hide behind. <br /> <br /> In any case, I imagine that Boyette has moved away from this train wreck and probably spent less time thinking about "Dungeon of Harrow" than the people who are posting the boards of this movie. He did, within certainly vague boundaries, what he decided to do, and you must respect him for that ... even if you don't care about "Harrow".
