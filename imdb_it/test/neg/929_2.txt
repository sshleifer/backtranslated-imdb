Is it an FMV game or a movie? In all honesty, I looked at this out of "choice-less-ness". It's a huge waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> It seems that the HK films are heading in the opposite direction of the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Try to put more effort and money into a production and make us want to look, rather than something you want us to look at. <br /> <br /> The graphics are so horrible that they look like something out of low resolution games from the 90s / 90s (compared to today). <br /> <br /> The way they made this film is almost exactly what they did in the 90s Wing Commander game, the third installment in the series. Stop regressing and make Asian people look so bad compared to the big Hollywood cannons. <br /> <br /> Sure! They have big budgets and better actors. But we have some of the oldest stories, myths and legends, the best technophiles and perhaps the greatest computer graphics talent base in the world! So what went very wrong? Did you start using the same old companies that worked with you for so many movies ?! Please stop wasting time and money. This is why Hong Kong films are going downhill so quickly. Didn't you pretend to be the Hollywood of the East? Don't guess.
