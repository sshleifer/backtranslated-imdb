I hesitated to see this film, having really enjoyed the original, "Mostly Martha". What a disappointment. Catherine Zeta Jones is a good actress, but this was not her film. The original had moving moments, perfectly punctuated by an incredible soundtrack. No reservation seemed to be ever connected. The food, the characters - nothing felt passionate. In Mostly Martha, food has become alive - every scene has been filmed so you can enjoy it with your eyes - the smells, the textures. The food in "No reservation" was in the background - we rarely got a close-up of the preparation; the characters weren't real enough to bring the movie without it. It was difficult to finish the film - many scenes felt embarrassed. Look at the original: it is a truly enjoyable film; the incredible soundtrack.
