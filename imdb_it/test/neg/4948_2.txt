This is a terrible film. Angie Dickenson is a class act and always does good, but she doesn't get many roles and must have needed money to make this film. By the way, it's less than 10 minutes on the screen. Oooh, wait, there's a saving feature in this film: Meg Foster has a small part in this film. Now, Meg has been on the screen for 35 years and is not particularly large but has the most terrifying eyes of any actress I've ever seen. By name, you probably don't know her, but take a look at her eyes and you'll recognize her. To sum up: acting is horrible, bad history and even filmography is terrible. A screen that turns black every time the director wants to change the scenes is rather idiotic. Look at something else except this, even Mr Ed's replicas!
