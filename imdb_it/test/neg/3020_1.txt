This is just what we need, a show about people who don't like high school or college. Man or woman. The people who objectify others and congratulate themselves on doing it is exactly the opposite of intelligent thinking. And this show is simply disgusting for doing exactly that. <br /> <br /> So four men sit in chairs and watch two other guys looking and picking up women to have sex with them. And in the end one of the two victories, great ... only f-n grandiose. I should also accept these four shower bags as "judges" of people's "Game". The term "game" must be the most idiotic thing that comes from modern English because the term "Bling Bling", added to the fact that these men are called "experts", makes me want to vomit what's left of my respect for modern culture. These are not real role models, they are the result of the MTV culture that gets to bite us in the ass. If you like bullshit coming off the sides of this monstrosity, you probably think Paris Hilton and Britany Spears have talent. It is not true and you should be ashamed of yourself for having thought of it. <br /> <br /> And for all those people who will say that I would like more if you fuck me, or that I'm just jealous. Go fuck yourself, because it's obvious that a REAL girl certainly won't.
