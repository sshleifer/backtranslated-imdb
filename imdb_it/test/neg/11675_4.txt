My wife and I met a professional production of "The Merry Widow" in 1982 - in English, but a direct translation. <br /> <br /> Only the basic skeleton of the original plot is visible in this "adaptation" ". Most of the characters have been deleted, along with the entire plot B, and all but one of the remaining characters have been Most of the characters in the film are not in the operetta. The action was moved from Paris to, initially, Washington, DC, and then to the imaginary country of Pontevedro, which the film renamed "Marshovia", and only later in Paris.The net result is that we do not reach the beginning of the original game up to about 45 minutes in. <br /> <br /> And the main source of tension in the plot is also eliminated. years before, Count Danilo and the heroine were very much in love, but his family refused to allow them to marry because he was poor, it is his broken heart that made him a distracted playboy Now that he is a widow, she is the woman most rich in the world, she still loves him, and he still loves her, but i his pride will not allow him to admit it to anyone, not even to himself, and must pass three acts to make the mind play to bring it down. The trope of the aristocrat with money problems who will not admit to being in love with a rich woman for fear of what people will think provided the main plots of a considerable part of Viennese operettas for decades after the "Vedova" of 1906. In this films, they have never met before, which not only rips the heart of the whole thing, but almost all the comedy. <br /> <br /> Lamas does a pretty decent job, though. <br /> <br /> An interesting musical point is that many times we listen to a fragment of "Tr√©s Parisien", an extra written song (in English, despite the title) for the London premiere, which was not, as far as I know, usually found in American productions until about the 80s.
