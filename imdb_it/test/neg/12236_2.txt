There was nothing remotely funny about this movie. He makes fun of various sports films and clich√©s, but nothing he does is remotely funny. Most films that make the parody don't even fit into the movie and are actually just them, so they can be in it. Not the main actor was well cast but it's really the only good thing about this movie. The various cameos were also pretty to look at, but I have no idea why they waste their time on this piece of junk. Thank God I spent only $ 4 as it's not something worth spending money on. Absolutely watch if you have absolutely nothing to do or just want to lose an hour and 30 minutes.
