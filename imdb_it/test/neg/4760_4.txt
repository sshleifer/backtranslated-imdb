Susan Slept Here turned out to be Dick Powell's swan song as an actor on the big screen. Naturally he directed other films and appeared frequently on television until his death. It's a pity he didn't come out with his performance in The Bad and the Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Frank Tashlin has made so many better films, I'm still not sure that anything has it to do this. The premise is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is a screenwriter who is trying to do more serious things than the fluff he wrote. He had an idea for a movie about juvenile delinquency, so two friendly cops from Herb Vigran and Horace McMahon deposit Debbie Reynolds, 17, on the doorstep of his house. She's not a really bad little girl and they don't want to put her in the system. Then they give it to Dick Powell at Christmas. <br /> <br /> I mean is there anyone out there who doesn't see a problem? The term jailbait immediately comes to mind. Powell also has a girlfriend, the young and sexy Anne Francis. Because Debbie Reynolds is a competition here is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Susan Slept Here has been nominated for an Oscar. The song Hold My Hand, sung by Don Cornell in the background, was nominated for Best Song, but Lost for Secret Love. <br /> <br /> Powell and Reynolds have some fun moments together and Alvy Moore as Powell and Les Tremayne's factotum as his lawyer also does some laughs. <br /> <br /> But it's not enough.
