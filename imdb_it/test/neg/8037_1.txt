I will repeat - what a stupid scenario. <br /> <br /> Is there something new inside? I don't know who wrote this. But I think this guy has seen all the Hollywood movies, family movies and always made ... all the scenes and floods you can see everywhere. Why do people make this movie? are children like adults? they like gold money cars ... and are they positive? have luck ... and emotions of course ... without it you can do it. or the young actors - wow :-). Do I like it when the camera is focused on their beautiful faces? that sucks ... there are 90% better children's movies than this! This is not a creative or fun movie. This is simply nothing. <br /> <br /> D.
