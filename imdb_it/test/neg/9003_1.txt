Take it as a cameraman who worked for Republic Studios from 1946 to 1950 and then Warners Bros and Paramount from 1950 to 1993, this is a piece of shit. Of course it would be nice to show it to your favorite friends at a house party, but trying to sell it on a DVD is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I've seen bad acting in my time but this is NOT acting. The hero is almost ridiculous and really thinks he's something judging by his comments on special offers. I hate to see his fan club. The old films did not participate in the action in many scenes. What the hell was that garden scene with three of the worst actresses. I've never seen a garden on a ship. They couldn't even emulate. I wouldn't mind if they could have only one acting time, but the only one was the boy with the traditional accent. I'm sorry but this is not an intelligent film as some people say. I would think that fans of horror movies would be insulted by this piece of film.
