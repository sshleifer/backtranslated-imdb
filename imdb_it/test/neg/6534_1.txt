Plot: <br /> <br /> - A Chair from EBay <br /> <br /> - Random people <br /> <br /> - Random characters speak ("Friend, that's right." " I'm hearing it. "" We're getting married now! ") <br /> <br /> - If you're a" hippy ", then you'll love this movie. (You must be tall or drunk, otherwise you question yourself about life by looking at this stuff.) <br /> <br /> This film was clearly not thought from beginning to end, and other comments are probably the filling of the crew reviews If this was not aimed at my demographic, I don't know what it is intended for. I found the plot boring every day. It is something I would do, and believe me it is not worth turning. Taking a trip and filming half of the silence doesn't make a movie!
