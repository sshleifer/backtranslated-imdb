This film is one of the worst remakes I've ever seen in my life! The acting is ridiculous and Corman hasn't improved his piranhas since 1978. 90% of the special effects are removed by Piranha (1978), Up From The Depths (1979) and Humanoids From The Deep (1979). Makes Piranha II: The Spawning as if it belonged to the American Film Institute List.
