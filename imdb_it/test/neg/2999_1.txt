It is usually me who criticizes the twenty-third Neanderthal man for not being able to appreciate a movie unless he has plastic t-t, shootings and car chases. However, in this case the film could actually have been improved with some of these additions. At least I wouldn't be bored after an hour and I changed channels. <br /> <br /> I don't mind surreal, and I certainly don't mind having to pay attention to find hidden subtlety or meaning, but there should be a point in the whole thing. I didn't have the feeling that even the writer or director really had a broad view of something, but they were, instead, simply so absorbed in their supposed visions as to be deliberately dispersed. Or maybe they are simply confused by themselves. Anyway, I don't care. He bored me for a little over an hour without any saving grace. <br /> <br /> Although a whole bunch of other spectators have filled this site with enthusiastic disappointments about the alleged symbolism and masterful cinematography, I must respectfully disagree. Maybe I didn't film enough film lessons to appreciate some inspired techniques not visible to mere mortals ... Or maybe this movie was just crap. <br /> <br /> I give him a "1" and register it next to "Ishtar".
