How do two great actors get a piece of junk like this on movie goers. My only conclusion is that they and their director believe that ALL the films in which they play MUST be seen and applauded, <br /> <br /> Now at the movie - probably the worst "thriller" I've ever seen. The actors showed minimal emotion; the plot was reasonable for a time interval of 1/2 hour (not 91 minutes). The FBI agent was almost a foolish spoof: his companion was apparently stupid and didn't speak a word. To paraphrase Robert Redford, the villain was a piece of senseless shit! The film was designed and meaningless - the only question was whether the hero was dead or not. A really bizarre part of the story - The waiting family seemed to go on for at least several days; the hero and the anti-hero seemed to take only one day. <br /> <br /> All in all - waste of time
