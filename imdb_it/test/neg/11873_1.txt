to start, I'm easily satisfied. I'm not a real critic at all, and movies that genuine critics, friends, family and newspapers might find horrible might even be fun to watch for me. <br /> <br /> not this though. <br /> <br /> I took it since it was the most recent wesley snipes movie in my DVD shop. I like snipers, but this was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> bad story, bad actors, continuity glitches, lousy sound, depressing places, a pseudo-cool snipes, I really had to force myself to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> they also left some marks in the shots in which a car had to stop. <br /> <br /> and I'm not talking about "small production company / young director / low budget" kind of ugly, in which you can ignore some mistakes because you feel pity. <br /> <br /> a block-buster action movie that hasn't been disappointing for a long time.
