I'm a big fan of the first Critters movie. The second episode is good, but it's not as good as the first Critters. The third episode is a bit boring, but adorable. And what is this?? How disgusting! It's stupid and really, really boring. It's the worst in the series. I can't watch it again, because I felt asleep at the first watch. And the evil side of Ug ... eeewww ... is one of the film's most horrible moments. In the first 50 minutes, we can't see the furry little monsters, which is why the public fell asleep at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> It could have been much better. <Br /> <br /> 2/10
