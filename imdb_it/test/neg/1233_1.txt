I just watched Lonesome Dove, Return To Lonesome Dove, Streets of Laredo and Dead Man's Walk. All excellent. This lousy piece of junk is cheaply made and misinterpreted. <br /> <br /> In the previous series, Captain Call and Gus McCrae broke away from respectable respectable cowboys. Despite the fact that Caption Call is played by a different actor each time, everyone quickly won me over. In Dead Man's Walk kids are as credible as the younger versions of the experienced Texan rangers. In Comanche Moon they are just a pair of plump rednecks. I had to stop watching. <br /> <br /> I suspect that many of the positive reviews for this show have been written by the people who created this smelly pile. It is an unpleasant end for an otherwise exceptional franchise.
