I took this DVD from Cheepo's basket to Walmart because the cover showed one of the planes I flew during Viet Nam (C-123k). I didn't fly to Air America, but I knew I was a C-123 pilot, I knew a lot about it, including those who flew into my spare unit at home. I'm not a film critic, but I wonder about the subliminal motivation of directors and writers who make films like this. The best part of this film has to go to the cameraman. The shots and flying acrobatics (even if totally cartoon) are excellent. The film starts with Hollywood's favorite fall boy in 1969. But the fact is that Nixon didn't start Air America, it didn't start lying. Johnson was in charge of Air America and Nixon inherited the lies, the war and Air America. It is not right or accurate to portray Nixon as a liar on the subject of Air America. All presidents have inherited the lies of their predecessors. No one smart enough to fly a C-123 was stupid enough not to know what they were joining. This makes Downey's character incredible. A C-123 was a sturdy airplane. It could easily fly on an engine or on two auxiliary jet engines. The three stooges who shoot a duck with a blow are more likely. The pilots who flew with Air America were civilian employees of the CIA, they were not rash of luck. They had a good reason to behave and believe in a future if they survived their extremely dangerous work. He was given a double time for a retirement pension. They were not required to sell drugs or guns to get a good pension. Dope was legal and a lifestyle in SEA, as it still is today in Afghanistan. If individual pilots tried to make money on the side, it was not CIA policy. The CIA was fighting a war against communism, not against drugs. The writer based his story on "war stories". Pilots love BS, anyone will buy them a beer and listen. The writer and director who had an ax to grind Vietnam and Nixon. Watch the movie and remember how it starts: he blames Nixon for what has existed for years. Remember, he did not become president until January 20, 1969. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the jungle landing in the hills. Air America pilots put planes in places that aircraft designers have never considered possible. They were a lot of funny stories that could have been shown. Instead, the director chose to use the oversize rubber scene to show how stupid the CIA was. This scene shows that the director and the writer have fallen in love with some pilot chatter and the joke is on them. <br /> <br /> MDS Fort Valley Virginia.
