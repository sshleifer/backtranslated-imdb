Young couple on the road, taking care of their business and having casual sex with their car in broad daylight. And yet, suddenly, they are threatened and terrified by a deranged psychopath in an old rusty pick-up truck. Hmm, where did I see this premise before? Oh yes, now I remember, we have already seen thousands of times before and about nine hundred and ninety-nine of the other cases were much better than "Rest Stop"! This new film, weak and pitiful, is offensive even to the intelligence of the most demanding horror fans, as it does not present a single original touch or a memorable gimmick. He's very sadistic and evil, but every teenkill-slasher movie is sadistic and mean today, so it's no longer a real surprise, either. The absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of stupid weft holes and meaningless under-rugs. Writer / director John Shiban has damnably realized that the ultra-thin basic plot was not nearly enough to fill an entire film, and then fills his film like a Thanksgiving turkey with foolish and meaningless stuffing material. Nicole's boyfriend vanishes in an abandoned and dirty resting place in California. Killing his character immediately would not involve a very long film and then he would later encounter a family of camper enthusiasts, suffer from visions (?) In which he speaks to the previous victims of the killer and has a deep emotion (and boring conversations) with a police officer that he simply will not die even if a truck hits him ... twice! The devious plots never lead anywhere and are certainly the most pathetic and desperate attempts to lengthen the length of a film I've ever seen. Instead of all the unnecessary stuffing, Shiban should have paid more attention to creating tension and making his characters a little nicer. The character of Jaimie Alexander, Nicole, is an annoying and brainless girl, and you won't really care if she survives the ordeal or not. Her boyfriend Jesse and the cop are both whining and their brutal deaths are still not painful enough if you ask me. I counted exactly three sequences, all of which included torture and free mutilation, which were cruel and exciting enough to bring a sadistic smile to my face. This is still too little for a horror movie today. Basically, "Rest Stop" is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of films like "Wolf Creek" and "Hostel", but it is better to look at the originals. This was the first film of the new production company called 'Raw Feed'. They are promoting themselves as the new name in great horror, but they will have to come up with something much better than "Rest Stop" if they want us to believe it.
