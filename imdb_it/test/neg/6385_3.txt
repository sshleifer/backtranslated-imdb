Well ..... the horror is not, but ....... !!! ??? A terrible low budget-low-back of the worst kind, a kind of AND ... so quite fascinating and fun to watch ... at least on my TV !!! A cross between Pete Walker, Herschell Gordon Lewis and ... let's say ... damn, I give up ... I can't find any "prettier" resemblance to this trash movie. Everything is really wrong that I just have to enlist it in my movie collection along with ... Death In Venice ..... Nekromantik ..... Blue Velvet and The Good, Bad, Ugly ... right !! ?? People with a bit of talent to add gory inserts or sexy events to the movies they buy from other people should immediately pick up this movie ... of course it's a gold mine waiting here, oh maaaannnn !!!!!
