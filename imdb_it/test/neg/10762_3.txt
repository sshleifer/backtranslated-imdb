Although it's better than most TV movies, "Buried Alive" is nothing but a story of revenge. There are so many holes in the plot in this, I ask you why the writers haven't gone through a series of rewrites. The finish has a nice effect, but it is hardly credible. <br /> <br /> The acting of Jennifer Jason Leigh is exceptional, as always, but Tim Matheson sums it up with a background note reminiscent of one by Jack Nicholson in "The Shining". Do not worry about it.
