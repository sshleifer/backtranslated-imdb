... in search of the most cheerful film "so bad is beautiful", I have repeatedly laughed at the first fifteen minutes of various films, remaining only disappointed and bored in the end. Not this time !!! My eyes were torn, my belly and my cheeks hurt from laughing so much during the movie. Surely Hulk Hogan is a sub-contractor and the plot is absolutely predictable, but everyone is immersed in this film knowing all this - all those who want to see when they rent this is Hogan that breaks a can of madness, with a group of "YEAH BROTHER" if "WHATCHUGONNADO" fly from his notorious whorehole. And while Hulkster on the screen pales a little compared to Hulkster in the ring, the seekers of the final cheese will certainly not be disappointed by this backside jewel of a movie. A riot of laughter.
