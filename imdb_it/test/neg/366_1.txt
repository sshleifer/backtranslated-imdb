Okay, this movie is a job. It is full of stupid Jesuits and dialogues that would make most human biennials doubtful whether or not they should be wattching films. Big names like Roddy Piper and David Carradine attract you but, take it from me, this movie sucks. History is incomprehensible and completely lacking in intelligence. The sets, the vehicles and the costumes are like a cross between the bablon five and a slavery blow. I'm sure there's porn with better dialogues.
