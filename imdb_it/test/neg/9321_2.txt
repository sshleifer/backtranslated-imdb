Let me start by saying that I have been looking forward to the release of this film for a while. Having finally had the chance to see him last night, I'm sorry to say that I was incredibly disappointed. It's hard to imagine a film that could make "Exorcist: The Beginning" last fall, but "Dominion" does just that. No waiting ... it looks like a GREAT movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe I got too excited about this movie, and this contributed to the disappointment. After all, the idea that Warner Bros. was releasing two versions of what is essentially the same movie in six months of each other was an exciting attraction. Also, I'm a big fan of Stellan Skarsgard, and in his true way he gives a great interpretation, despite the film's often ridiculous content. On the other hand, the supporting cast in this film is abysmal. Clara Bellar seems to be capable of a single expression - a fixed gaze, and delivers all her lines in the same monotonous tone, while Gabrielle Mann's Father Frances is simply ridiculous. The effects of this film are at best laughable and the sheer generosity of all this is enough to steal from the film any chance of being taken seriously. This film caused more muffled giggles than anything else, and with the exception of a truly chilling shot that lasted about three seconds and made her eyes cover and whine, she neglected to offer anything in the fear department. I could go into details and possibly give some spoilers, but honestly I'm too tired to think how bad this movie was for writing all the things I'd like to say. <br /> <br /> The saddest part of it all is that the basic idea that both versions of the film tried to give ... a story about a priest who lost faith and then regains it after being coming to terms with his troubled past ... he had enormous potential, especially with Skarsgard as the protagonist. Unfortunately for us, that potential was wasted. Go see this movie only if you are really curious about how it differs from the Harlin version, but don't expect to see a good movie or you will regret wasting your money and two hours of your life. Otherwise, settle for the released version and move on.
