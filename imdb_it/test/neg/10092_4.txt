Wow, I was really disappointed. I wasn't really thinking about seeing this movie at the theater, and I'd like to stick to that plan. It should really be a movie made for TV. I was pretty excited to see it, since I'm a big fan of Fairuza Balk, but this film didn't do it justice. In fact, I'm a little disappointed with the acting all around. What a horrible cover for Fairuza Balk's tattoos, it bothered me every time I saw her on the shoulder. <br /> <br /> There was no flow in the film, it was very difficult to get into it. A scene makes us angry, we exaggerate, we want blood, anticipation goes up, just then the director takes us to another scene to show the love between Annie and Bobby. It would have been more pleasant to follow if it had been divided into three side-section comics. <br /> <br /> There was also little logic behind the characters chosen to play some parts. The gangster's leaders were thin men, not very credible. Matt Dillon head of a gangster organization? Come on, give me a break. There was not only intimidation there. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack .. wow. I think this is one of the worst music scores I've ever heard. What a horrible guitar solo, my god. The sound of my teeth was more pleasant for my friends, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> However, there is a positive comment that I would like to make about the film. The settings were well done. I liked the colors, a good job that transmitted that period of time.
