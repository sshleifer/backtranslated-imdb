Clint Howard, Ron's most talented brother, plays in this horrible horrible comedy of a mental case that serves children ice cream and kills people. Striving to be a film that is of the "so bad it's good" variety, this film lacks that mark of a good millet and instead must be seen as "so bad that it is ... well ... BAD". Because it is the constant cinema of the "advertising shoe", the pillow filled with "fat", or the sleep that induces "the horror" that bothered me in the film, I don't know, all I know is that I hate the movie ( and this from a guy who has a weakness for horror films B). Paul Norman has chosen to continue making films in the porn industry both before and after, his only mainstream film. A wise choice, in fact, as horrible acting, meaningless plot and ridiculous dialogues are much more appealing in seeing a porn star do his thing. Strangely, this turkey has absolutely no nudity (another reason to stay away) <br /> <br /> My Grade: D-
