This film must be the worst movie I've ever seen. There is a reason why it was made to be a MOW (film of the week). The continuity was completely wrong (palm trees in a Chicago setting even though it was shot in Toronto, Canada), the effects were left to be desired for the year 2004. HELLO. "The Lord of the Rings" had a better CGI than that. But I guess they also had the money to do it. The budget will certainly influence the result, but all those who call this MOW more than 2 must return to the school of cinema and TV. Next time, remember that care and time make a classic that does not rush for a box office or a television hit. <br /> <br /> Also, do I know that networks can reuse movies from old networks or affiliates but using the 80's footage for 2004? I have trouble buying it.
