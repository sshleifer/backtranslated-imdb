A trio sits at a restaurant table and stares at space without words. Later, they lean on a track and look across the canal in England. A man repeatedly works a hoe in his garden, only his head and upper torso are visible on the screen. A man and a woman look at another man peeing against a stone wall. Each of these silent shots lasts about a full minute. Absolutely no information is given that could not be given to us in about a quarter of the time. The publisher had to be half asleep. I know I was. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a surprising shot of the rough vagina of an obviously dead body. The throat rises. But then the policeman (Schotte) exchanges a few words with a neighboring couple and starts to tag them behind and the case is forgotten for the next half hour while Schotte and his friends exchange unsatisfactory insults between themselves and with strangers. In the end the thread of the case is resumed but proceeds slowly, almost without purpose, following the already established stylistic scheme. <br /> <br /> Sometimes in films like this, the location shooting offers a sort of atmosphere that compensates for the dullness of the story, but not here. The houses of the French village are attached to each other in long lines. The fronts of the house rest directly on the floor, without steps. The pediments have practically no decorations and are practically indistinguishable. Flat agricultural land is shapeless. What may have been one of the most interesting episodes - a visit to a stone fort on the coast - bores the trio until they act like brat and are asked to leave. <br /> <br /> Acting is minimal. No one seems particularly anxious to say something. No jokes are made. Nothing fun happens. The cop has an almost interesting face like Randy Quaid's. The girl, a tall and robust blonde, resembles the type of steroid machine gun that the East Germans used to line up at the Olympics. <br /> <br /> I sat for over an hour before giving it up. Maybe I'll take a crack at another time. Unless I missed something or until it turns into an unbalanced Monty Python routine towards the end, I don't think you'll get much of it out of it.
