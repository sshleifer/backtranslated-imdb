I felt compelled to write about this film after I signed up for IMDb because I thought it was the worst script I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> The acting / directing / other areas of the film are fantastic. I love Brad Pitt with George Clooney. It works. The jokes were still present even in the first film. My question is: why did they leave this script in the drafting process? I thought that not only the plot developed like a snail run until the end of the sidewalk, but that turn? (I can call it that) It was so incredibly stupid that I wanted to go get a refund from the ticket office. I've never felt so acted and used by a movie in my whole life. Here I was expecting something similar to the first film (good chemistry, good acting, good direction, fantastic plot) only to discover that they had taken my 8 dollars and made a joke. <br /> <br /> a part that makes me feel comfortable is that this film has now grossed over $ 125 million. <br /> <br /> In summary, I heard that this film insulted my intelligence. I still feel like the only part the writers focused on was that with Julia Roberts acting like Julia Roberts. This film made me sad and angry.
