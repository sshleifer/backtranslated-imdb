Seriously, I can't imagine how anyone could find a single flattering thing to say about this movie, much less find it in itself to write the glowing compliments contained in this comment section. How many methamphetamines was Bogdonovitch during the filming of this movie? Was he giving a bonus to the actor who spit out his lines with maximum speed and minimal inflection or thought? The dialogue is bad, the plot atrocious, even for a "dejected" comedy, and claims that the film is a tribute to the classic cinema comedy is the silliest thing I've ever heard. Cinematography is below the quality and innovation of that exhibited by the worst films made for TV, acting is terrible (although I have the feeling that the fault is right in the director's lap), and speaking of which, I said that the direction is so random and inscrutable that it escapes the definition of the word? The whole thing is terribly unpleasant (even in the much vexed world of such clunkers), soul-sucking, waste of two hours of your life that you will never come back. Be afraid, be very scared ...
