Herman made the Nordic drama with Little Voice and Brassed Off, but the formula falters in this creepy, flat and artificial fable of two delinquent teenagers trying to get seasonal tickets to see Newcastle. <br /> <br /> Truancy, minor smoking and drinking, underage sex, adolescent abortion, school bullying, drug abuse, drug abuse, depression, child violence, child sexual abuse, shoplifting, car theft, violent assault and armed robbery are all put here. None of these problems is explored, they simply serve to shift the story from one implausible situation to another. The film is not as sharply observed as Trainspotting, as poignant as The Full Monty, or as the reflection of times like Wonderland (from which it shamelessly steals music in an excessively manipulative way). I suspect that none of the filmmakers is from Newcastle and certainly has never known the social problems the film talks about. I'm all for entertainment, and Herman's curriculum shows that he is aware of the need to balance the social message with laughter and tears. Very simply, it's incredibly short here. <br /> <br /> The film has a nice finish, but there are too many flat and trivial moments to sit down to get there. Well shot, not very well acted, and eventually fails on three crucial points: script, screenplay, screenplay.
