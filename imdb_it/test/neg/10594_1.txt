The film was slow, the dialogue between actors / actresses felt "flat" and after all there was no development of the characters in the story. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps wanders around with a crazy look on his face all the time, pouting and basically looking annoyed by everyone. Danes has no magic on the screen, and the character of Ribisi is a goober that nobody would want to attend even if he were paid to do so. <br /> <br /> Throw yourself into the strange scene where Epps has to dance with an old man, and you have what could probably be the worst movie in movie history. <br /> <br /> I saw it on satellite (thankfully I didn't pay it), and I wished I didn't have it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and order your underwear and sock drawer if you need anything but you are tempted to watch this movie when / if it arrives on your TV. Terrible movie if you ask me, and in general I have something good to say about almost every movie out there.
