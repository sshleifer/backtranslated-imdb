Let me tell you something ... this movie overcomes Troma's laughter and cold-blooded films pass their hands while REALLY TRYING TO BE THROUGH LIKE A SERIOUS FILM. From the terrible acting ... "I knew it, I knew it was possessed!" ... to the priest who accepts sexual favors and takes a shower with naked teenagers ... this piece of dung takes the cake. I'm at a loss trying to compare this with another film just as bad. This could only be in a class of its own. The kicker is that presumably some cardinals supervised the production to make sure it was true to the current situation. I didn't know Backwoods USA people behaved like idiots. I'm not sure if I'm upset about renting it or stumbled upon a comedy jewel. This was a very guilty pleasure ... so terrible that I looked with my hands over my eyes for half the time (while I wasn't laughing so hard that I was crying). The finish simply didn't make any sense, pulling everything together perfectly. If you want to see something so terrible it's fun, here's your movie. If you want a scary movie about exorcism ... go ahead.
