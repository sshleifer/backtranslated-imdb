Jeff Powers (Lou Diamond Phillips, "Young Guns 1 & 2"), a policeman with a history of abused criminals, is recruited into a clandestine elite in the LAPD division. This does not go well with the girlfriend of Jeff's journalist, Kelly (Chelsea Field), who is looking for a story on the team. Soon Jeff's conscience got the better of him which put him at odds with Dan Vaughn (Scott Glenn, "The Hunt for Red October" and "Backdraft"), the head of the unit. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly normal routine, dare I say banal, detective / drama that is not surprising thanks to a cookie-cutter plot that is content to go strictly from point A to point B. The acting is fine however, for what the actors gave to the work it is not a real reason to watch the film. A little sad given that the six previous films directed by Mark L. Lester before this (from the 1984 class to the Little Tokyo showdown) were all very fun vehicles. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Chelsea Field gets briefly topless <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
