An annoying group of former students of "Monte Alto International High School" decides to spend a night in the now abandoned institution where a "mysterious" killer called the guardian played by the horror legend Paul Naschy kills them one after the other. "School Killer" presents some references to such teenage staples as "Scream" or "Friday the 13th". The final climatic twist seems flattered by "The Sixth Sense". The uncertainty that the homicidal guardian is alive or dead provides a slight interest, but the characters are one-dimensional and the endless scenes of walking through the dark corridors of the school really got on my nerves. The presence of the charismatic Paul Naschy almost saves this slash clich√©. There is also a fair amount of gore on display including a beautifully bloody beheading. It's nice to see Manuela Velasco of "Rec" fame in a small role.4 out of 10.
