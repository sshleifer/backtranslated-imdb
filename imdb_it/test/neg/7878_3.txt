I never really understood the controversy and hype caused by this movie. Especially in French and neighboring countries (in Belgium, where I am, for example), "Baise-Moi" was announced as the most shocking and inspiring social drama that one can ever experience. Yeah, for sure! It might be a bit shocking, perhaps (how many times do you see someone getting their asses kicked?), But the weak and meaningless plot certainly didn't make me think much. "Baise-Moi" is another one of those who "blame everything that goes wrong in society" - films and are generally not very convincing. About 99% of people work perfectly in this society, so why would you blame this very same society for the vile and hopeless acts of two deranged nymph girls? The two main characters and their miserable lives are introduced separately and in flash. Nadine just killed her roommate; Manu shot his brother and the two met at an abandoned train station late at night. They decide to travel together in France, leaving behind a trail of sex and blood wherever they stop. Although we are constantly exposed to pornography and violence, this film is very boring to sit. As the girls always indicate, the dialogues are lame and the people they meet (and kill) are very uninteresting. If people want to make porn movies, that's fine with me, but please don't pretend that it's an arthouse movie. If the oath and chamber work are omitted, all there is to see is (not so) to arouse pornography. Cool soundtrack, though!
