This is one of the least romantic films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Casting: Richard Gere is simply too old to look for romantic lead roles. Diane seems a little eager to be satisfied and frowning as usual, but she doesn't seem convinced by the same love story. The supporting cast is not too memorable. <br /> <br /> History: The medical drama with which he must confront does not convince and is not interesting. The story is weak - not enough to make a movie. There is nothing new to say or any new way of saying it here. <br /> <br /> The setting is a bit shabby and the house in which it is set is not attractive. <br /> <br /> NOT intended to be great to remember.
