Ted Nicolaou has made a lot of great horror and fantasy films. I'm looking for all his movies to see. I couldn't find it for 3 years, until I found it unexpectedly on YouTube. To tell the truth, I wanted to see more ghosts and less talk here. It seems that in 1999-2001 Ted had a crisis, perhaps in money. Its characteristics of this time look more like real low-budget thrash junk movies. But I don't think he is a bad director this time. Everything happens. The finale has some gruesome details and suspense but the whole movie was boring dialogues. <br /> <br /> only for real Ted fans. <br /> <br /> www.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab
