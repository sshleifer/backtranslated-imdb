Barney is that idiot dinosaur who (unfortunately) did not die out with the other dinosaurs many eons ago. Instead he sings stupid songs and has a stupid morality about life that is 100% useless and / or extremely dangerous: that is, "THE RIDERS ARE YOUR FRIENDS THAT YOU HAVE NEVER KNOWN!". Why do I say it's bad? Well, on YouTube, there's a video of a Barney song on toy balls. When it is played backwards, "EVERYONE IS APPROVED! WE PUT THE STICKS!" You do not believe me? Watch it for you! I also read about another review that they are reading PC folklore and fairy tales. Now he is simply stupid with a capital S! I mean, really! However, I do not recommend your children to watch this filth because it contains stupid costumes like strangers are your friends (as mentioned before), there is never a reason to be sad and if you are sad eat junk food, be a individual is taboo, magic can solve all your problems and heaps of other ridiculous crap.
