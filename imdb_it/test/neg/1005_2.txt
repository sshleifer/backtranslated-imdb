Three businessmen are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men. The three businessmen retaliate, which turns into a murder after another. Presumably the story is about the violence that could happen to ordinary people. <br /> <br /> The plot has too many holes. The details have been ignored to advance the story. The acting was irregular. The color balance was terrible even though I watched this movie on DVD. The small budget and tight schedule were evident. The whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot the final shooting, and the ending was simply incredible.
