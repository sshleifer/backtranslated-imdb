"Five characters in search of an exit" must be one of the most boring "Zones" ever created. This morning it was on Sci-Fi and, as usual, I changed channels. I put it on my list of the top five of the worst "zones" ever produced. Boring and predictable, and not worth looking at. Serling worked on this subject until his death (earthlings in the hands of the aliens, who were often giants), and in this particular version, it simply doesn't work. Anyone who hasn't seen it before will understand it quickly. This is another fragment of Serling's philosophical mood, perhaps in parallel with the situation of those who are prisoners of war or in concentration camps, where prisoners may lose interest in finding where they are or fighting their captors. William Windom, as the soldier who is the last to "fall" is the only one curious to make the effort, and it does not take much to understand the result.
