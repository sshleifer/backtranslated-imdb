Well from where we start, there was great potential for this film with such important actors playing a role. But the whole story was ruined by a horrible plot. This film is not what I would expect, the good guy makes it come alive, I mean that nobody wants the good guy to succeed. The finish was worthy and very clich√© I didn't think about what ever, YOU ARE UNDER THE PLOT ALL WRONG THE BAD BADS ARE DEBT AFTER. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste 1 hour and 2 minutes of your time spent doing something else this movie was the epitome of CRAP. I really think the actors made this movie for some quick Vegas awards without a doubt. Save your money watch a better movie.
