This film really misses the mark on most fronts. Accents are ridiculously weak, amateur acting and comedy weak at best. <br /> <br /> They have a great idea, it may have been particularly pleasant but for the reasons mentioned above. <br /> <br /> The writer seems to think putting the word f * ck in every sentence that will make it more fun and the main character seems to try a little too much. It is certainly not the top of Brick. <br /> <br /> Next time at least one cast can keep the accent throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> It is a crime to compare it to films like The business, block the warehouse and snatch.
