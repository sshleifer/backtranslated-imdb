... But not this! I always wanted to know "what happened" later. We will never know for sure what happened because GWTW was Margaret's baby. I'm a life long fan of Gone With the Wind and I couldn't be more repulsed by the movie. I compared "Scarlett" with the original GWTW because any movie worthy of GWTW had to be on the same quality level as the first. Rhett was magnificently cast, although no one can ever compare to Mr. Gable. I'm also a huge fan of Vivien Leigh !! She was Scarlett. She has adapted to the account. Not another actress in this life or another will ever adapt to the same shoes, but with "Scarlett" the work could have been done better. It was not thought enough to find the appropriate Scarlett, it was obvious. <br /> <br /> In general, something to look at but if you want to know what happened to Scarlett and Rhett, I suggest you write it yourself or find fiction fans. This film is not worth it.
