The remains of an ambush army unit join a group of cowboys to make their way among the Indians on the war path. Looks like it could be an exciting western, but that's boring, boring, boring. It moves like molasses, the action scenes are not inspired, the acting is pedestrian, the writing is flat, even the photograph is not very good. Eastwood, in a very early role, plays a former confederate who doesn't like the idea of ​​fighting on the same side as the Yankees. This is the only remotely interesting situation in the entire film, but Eastwood has not had enough acting experience to make it, and his character appears petulant rather than angry or bitter. A very normal western. Actually, a much less than normal western. It's worth a look if you're an avid Eastwood fan and want to see him at the start of his career. Otherwise, don't worry.
