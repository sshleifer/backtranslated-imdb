I'm thinking of some things for this film: First of all, it's really a bad movie. This is really "Superbad". The film looked very promising in the trailers but fell flat ... Maybe the original idea was good, but between a bad script and a bad acting the film became boring and empty. My advice is not to waste 2 hours of your precious time. You have been warned. This is the first movie I classified as 1 star on IMDb.com ... Secondly, none of the characters is nice. You really don't care what happened to them ... Thirdly, the villain is very easy to identify. The grandson kills his father, sodomizes his friend's son, buggers the woman, suffocates his grandfather ... As JT says, "If you like evil without retribution, this is your film" Nothin 'else to say...
