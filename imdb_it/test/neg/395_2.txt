This is one of those movies I've seen, and I was wondering, why did I see it? What did I find so interesting about it? Being a truck driver myself, I didn't find it very realistic. No, I have never used a lizard lizard, nor have I ever seen or heard of a trip across the country in a brand new RV of seventy thousand dollars. The same goes for a pimp who has never tried the woman in question (until the end of the film, and well, he hasn't done it yet ...), and only got $ 50 "a cut" when the prostitute gets $ 200.00 (well, $ 150.00 after his cut, yes ...). I still laugh at the comment on the lizard that Ivey did (they are the Lizard of the Wolf, they will mess up anything with 20 dollars, and some are men dressed as women ... or something equally strange), that is, we are better than them, because we could still be prostitutes, but we are paid BETTER. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's just the story of a young woman who wanted something more out of life, so a lifeless job while living at home (she's 18, remember?) and embarrassed by her mother who basically did the same thing (endless work). At least she had a roof over her head and a job. He turned the FIVE tricks on the road ... I wonder if the $ 750.00 he made was worth it? I guess not.
