This is by far the worst movie ever made. I have no doubt. I've seen crap like Manos, Space Mutiny, and so on, and I can honestly tell you that they don't keep a candle to Science Crazed. <br /> <br /> Science Crazed has no plausible plot. Something about a boy who makes a woman pregnant with turkey baster, and the baby born * hours * later is fully grown and ready to kill. Of course, being a baby, it takes about an hour to kill people. The director loops continuously and takes about fifteen minutes to create an embarrassing death. There is a page of dialogue for the entire film, however the dialogue comes about one minute after it was pronounced. <br /> <br /> Scene example: the monster is walking along a corridor. We know this because there are about ten minutes of looped footage of his feet. Between one ring and another, we are treated by two working women. Repeat until you are sick for about 20 minutes. When the monster appears, no one moves and everyone looks like deer in the headlights while the monster takes another 10 minutes to get to kill them. From the level of acting, you will guess that people are already dead. <br /> <br /> I know my description doesn't seem too bad, but believe me, I can't completely describe the pain that is Science Folle. <br /> <br /> Stay away and boycott all the video stores that carry it. :) <br /> <br />
