I keep waiting for Peter Fonda to start acting. For someone who comes from such a talented family, it's a mystery to me why Peter Fonda can only play Peter Fonda while trying to play someone else. And this is the good news in this disappointing dog of an adaptation of The Tempest. A series of freely connected ideas that suggest only a relationship with the great work of the Bard is what is offered to us. The setting is the bad brother of the Civil War and Prospero (here Guideon) who looks like a bad melodrama from 1890, complete with a Snidely Whiplash mustache. I kept waiting for him to go "Uh ha ha!" what would have been a high point in this sad presentation. None of the supporting casts were memorable and Peter Fonda's lack of expression and wooden body movements made the story dragging back and forth. <br /> <br /> The Tempest is the affirmation of the Bard on the anger of the unjust treatment of the man of man. The only credible character was the Gator man, Caliban's counterpart. The transfer to the swamp had some possibilities, but the setting of the civil war did not make it. All in all, a very disappointing production. I've seen it on video and would recommend it, if you want a Willy Shakespeare fix, save your money on this. Rent something else, like Branagh's Much Ado about Nothing, or Kevin Kline on Midsummer's Night Dream.
