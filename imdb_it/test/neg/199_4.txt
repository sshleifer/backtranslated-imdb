I just saw on UbuWeb this first experimental short film directed by William Vance and Orson Welles. Yes, you read that right, Orson Welles! Years before he became famous for the radio war of the worlds and for his film debut Citizen Kane, Welles was 19 and was finding his muse. In addition to Vance and Welles, another player here was a Virginia Nicholson, who would become Orson's first wife. A woman plays on something that swings back and forth by courtesy of an African American servant (Paul Edgerton in blackface). During this time a man (Welles) continues to pass it (thanks to the scene that is constantly repeated). I will never reveal it again except to say how interesting the silent images were while they were constantly jumping. This does not mean that it was a good thing but it was fascinating to observe also with the guitar score (by Larry Morotta) added in the 2005 press that I saw. Welles fans and anyone with a taste of the avant-garde are worth a look.
