The robot against the Aztec mummy was one of the silliest and least credible films I've ever seen. Oh, I can buy it that the woman in the movie is a reincarnation of a virgin who was sacrificed to an Aztec god. What I can't buy is the incredibly fake-looking mummy and the even worse looking robot. When you want to watch a movie like this, you want to see a lot of combat action. But the robot and the mummy fight for about a minute in total! Probably the worst thing was the art of the dia de los muertos that they had in the credits. It's the worst I've ever seen. Avoid this if possible.
