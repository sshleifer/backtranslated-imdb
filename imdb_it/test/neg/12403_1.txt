This is one of those movies where acting, setting, direction and effects were so bad that you need to hire a copy of 5 or 6 friends, a barrel of beer, sit and watch it. To borrow from the late Douglas Adams, "Watching this movie will be like having your brain broken by a slice of lemon ... wrapped around a big golden brick." <br /> <br /> What's wrong? Everything. The British actors who pose as Americans, there have been many who manage to make it as Bob Hoskins, but he's not in that. Nor was it necessary to choose North America as a location, why not say that it took place in England or something like that? The director seemed to like taking pictures of boobs and asses for girls rather than inventing some sort of character motivation. So at this point the drunken comrades will say: "ALL RIGHT! Another T & A shot!". There is not much dialogue so feel free to jump into the kitchen and prepare those sandwiches. What do I like about this movie? After my friends passed out, I managed to collect $ 185 from them and told them I spent them at the bar after I finished watching the terrible movie.
