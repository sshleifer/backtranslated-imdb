The first time I saw it was when I was on a date, and she thought it was a fantastic movie. I did not. <br /> <br /> The second time I saw it was last night on TV. It still sucks. <br /> <br /> As a love story this sucks. As if Julia played a prostitute, this is repulsive. For me it was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels. He had no hard shell for her. She was not tortured, distressed, angry, hungry or anything else. His character "HOOKER" was so imperfect, like comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond. The two simply don't fit, no matter what they are. <br /> <br /> The only cast I felt was worth looking at were the two shrewd women, who were excellently expressed. They did a great job I hated them for the few seconds they were on the screen. They had a real definition, for minor roles. OK, so the movie wasn't completely trash ... the two ignorant women saved the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to those two sales women, the rest of the cast ... including the big names was just shit. Either everyone was an ass kisser or they had absolutely no reason to fill any dialogue in the movie besides complimenting Julia Roberts or kissing Richard Gere's ass. <br /> <br /> This was a film about how when you walk around in high heels and a tight skirt in Beverly Hills, people look at you badly and guys working at hotels with their mouths open as if they had a bat baseball hit in the face. <br /> <br /> While in reality, women who are dressed up in Beverly Hills are prostitutes and prostitutes at a higher level, but since they don't wear the flamboyant Madonna in search of jewelry or patent leather boots , they can look down on others who do it. <br /> <The hotel cast was disgustingly sad to see, and whoever had a real character had less than a minute of screen time. <br /> <br /> This is an insult to romantic films, comedies, dramas and even prostitutes who face wealthy clients on a daily basis with the hope that their lives will be perfect. <br /> <br /> The story is about Julia Roberts being PIMPED (yes PIMPED) from a multimillionaire in a suit and tie. <br /> <br /> It is still owned, it still tells how to behave, how to move, what to wear, what to say, where to go and what to do. It's more influential than a street pimp, but the people of Disney / Buena Vista pack it to make it easier to swallow. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere had been a black man with a gold tooth and an AK-47 at his side instead of an attached case, this film would be about how a woman has to struggle to get away from the harshness of the prostitution. Same story, different characters will make a very different perspective. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, change the white man to a black or Asian or Spanish man, make the deal of land change to a deal of weapons or narcotics and the whole concept of romantic comedy is thrown away. <br /> <br /> For me, Pretty Woman is still trash, dressed in ribbons and bows. <br /> <br /> I didn't like it 15 years ago, when I didn't understand it and was led by the Hollywood advertising campaign. I hate it now that I can see beyond the beautiful decorations called "love". <br /> <br /> This film is NOT a romantic comedy. It's a story about controlling a woman as long as you have the means and the income to do it. <br /> <br /> This is an insult to strong women, weak women and women in general, as well as to my television screen. <br /> <br /> Hate? Yes. Does it suck? Yes, would I recommend it to you? NO ... well maybe if I really hated you. <br /> <br /> Will this review be published? We'll see. <br /> <br /> Anywayz, that's all for now.
