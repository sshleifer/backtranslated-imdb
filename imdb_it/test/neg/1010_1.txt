This is a little less disgusting than the first two films, but otherwise it is a business as usual: a slice of sick, sloppy, shabby and unbalanced cinema. Charles Bronson is back, explodes into action when his friend is killed by you who terrorize the neighborhood. The crime, you see, has increased by 11% in the South Belmont area ... so what should you do? A stronger police presence? Harder jail? More severe sentences? No, the only solution is to send a loose cannon like Bronson to inflict the bloody revenge ?? or, as writers would like, justice: this time it is the personal killing machine of police chief Ed Lauter. <br /> <br /> The writers lean back to make Kersey the hero, sending the useless cops to the area just to confiscate a weapon from an elder who protects it for protection and provide a scene where Kersey he stole his camera and shoots the thief in the back, applauding from the crowd watching. Capital punishment for theft? Then OK. Everyone's attitude in the film is that this is a solution, and the dishonest twisting of the characters into figures that exist only to cheer Kersey or to support him is terrifying. <br /> <br /> Of course, these villains are scum, but shouldn't the film leave the public to make a decision, rather than tilting the whole affair towards Kersey and its brainless response? Strangely, the besieged residents do not fear gang reprisals or blame Kersey for any of the violence, which is strange since a character is killed because of Kersey's involvement. At the end of the film they take all the guns from their drawers and happily join in the massacre, never stopping to think about things or struggle with the thought of having to kill another human being. <br /> <br /> atrociously shallow performance does not help ?? Bronson literally has a facial expression in everything and can't even put the inflection on the right words. New levels of stupidity are reached here ?? a machine gun? A rocket launcher ?! ?? and new minimums of misogyny: the film forces us to desecrate every female character in sight, whether through rape, explosion or throat cutting; and prepares them in a supremely stupid way, like a victim who ventures into a crime-controlled neighborhood, controlled by a gang to ask a stranger, or another who goes shopping alone at night. This is rubbish, pure and simple, unreasonable garbage put together without style or sense.
