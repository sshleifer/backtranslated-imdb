Being a big Disney fan, I was really disappointed when I saw this junk. The animation was nice, and the backgrounds were fantastic, but I think good animation doesn't compensate for a weak script and a weak story. I have to disagree with people who say it is not suitable for children. Yes there are some deaths in the film, but isn't death something children should at least be exposed to? But I digress. The script is full of bad word games and limping jokes ... the kind I could expect from most dream movies. The music was sloppy, the morality forced (and forced without any charm.) And the characters would burst into songs at moments that were totally inappropriate. The characters were also cold, and I could not really gather any form of emotion towards them (bar irritation). I'm a big fan of the jungle book, Aladdin and the emperors of the new groove, but this Disney movie was a total and total waste of time ..... don't watch it !!!
