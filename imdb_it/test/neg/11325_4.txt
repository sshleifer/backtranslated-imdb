. . . and this is only if you like the sight of a beautiful woman with beautiful inflatable jugs that run around the so-called African jungle. So there are no problems for most males out there. <br /> <br /> I saw it as one of those bundles bundled together. Forget the plot which is essentially just a subtle plot to let our heroine flash her jugs on the screen whenever possible. Just to give you a sense, our heroine swings from the vine to the vine and climbs on the best animals on every possible occasion, for no good reason, just to show you its jugs from every angle. Once again, no complaints. <br /> <br /> The "fight scenes" are ridiculous and borderline pornographic. Our heroine has been captured by the bad guys at least five times in the movie. On occasions when he has to fight, "fighting" involves rolling around in the ground, grunting unconvincingly and basically fighting like kittens. I am surprised that the traction of the hair is not involved. It is so serious that the bad boss had to remind the "fighters" that "I said he wins the first blood!" to avoid watching more stupid fights. <br /> <br /> The sorcerer Kuku was a bloody blast. From being a big tender bear at the beginning, he became manic-depressive when captured and then openly psychopathic. He spent the entire movie muttering lines without any irrelevance. <br /> <br /> In addition to Liana (our heroine) who bounces topless, you can also see many other Amazons and a woman who decided to jump naked in the lake to swim without good reason. Yes, it's that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Look at the beautiful Liane in its exuberant glory. Although the film is over 20 years old, the fascination of watching blonde women blinking their beautiful carafes on the screen never gets old.
