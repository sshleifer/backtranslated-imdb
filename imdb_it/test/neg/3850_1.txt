This film is pathetic in every way possible. Bad acting, horrible script (was there one?), Terrible editing, bad cinematography, poor humor. Simply horrible. <br /> <br /> I saw "The Wishmaster" a couple of weeks before this movie and I thought it was a dead-ringer for the worst movie of the year. Then, I saw "The Pest" and suddenly "The Wishmaster" didn't look so bad. <br /> <br /> Bad Bad Bad. Strangely bad.
