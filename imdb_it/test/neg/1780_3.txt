Some giant scorpions are on a submarine and kill everyone. Two months later, some marines and scientists in charge of the scorpion project go to the diver to recover their cargo. After finding 200 bodies, the naval commander tells the doctor "I need to know if there is something here that could be a danger to my men". Uh, eh ... do you think? She refuses to tell him what's down there, citing "need to know". Yes, that makes it pretty good. One of the scientists is apparently a kind of idiot savant - really heavy on the idiot, light on the savant. It has the task of repairing the lights. Find the lights control panel, cut a wire and scream like a banshee. So he does it again. Then he takes a hammer and tears the control panel to pieces, which causes all the lights on the submarine to start working. <br /> <br /> And so on. Apparently this was done in Sweden; I'm not sure if the Swedes have a really strange sense of humor or if they're just really horrible film makers. I am inclined to think that they are horrible filmmakers. If you guessed that there's a big explosion at the end of this thing, well, I'm sorry, but it's a question of necessity, so I can't tell you. <br /> <br /> If you absolutely have to watch a giant scorpion movie, let me suggest Tail Sting, which is a fun and funny movie about scorpions on a plane, or Bugs, which is a B movie rather descendant of scorpions a tunnel. Watch this movie as an absolute last resort. Oh, it's watchable, it's hard to turn it off just for the sheer madness of it all, but that's all for him.
