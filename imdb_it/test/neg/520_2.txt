This is a terrible film that gets worse and never seems to end. The acting was bad, the plot was worse and the special effects seemed to have been created by a 5th grade science class. Dennis Weaver is such an exceptional actor and he should never have taken such a part. My advice, DON'T LOOK AT THIS FILM!
