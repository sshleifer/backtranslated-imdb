This film is perfect for any aspiring screenwriter, actor or director. Watching this movie you will see all the things that don't work in the film industry like today. There are so many clichés that it hurt me to sit in this movie. Nothing is original and every single beat has been torn from those cliché films that we all saw in the 90s. Even if he has some economic laughter, on the whole it's wrong wrong. I was so immensely bored and the film was so predictable and pathetic that I actually noticed how much makeup was caked on Tara Reid's face to hide those huge bags and wrinkles from her endless parties. Seriously, she wore so much foundation that she could literally scratch it and fill a whole bottle. <br /> <br /> What shocked me was the fact that so many talented and popular cast members would sign up for this piece of junk. And I DON'T know how I sat through that horrible scream that Ashton Kutcher does, do you know when he's angry or something and shouts his words that annoying way? Ashton's horrible "spoken", Tara's face ten shades darker than his neck, a drugged owl, a script that looked like the work of a three-year-old boy ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, in my whole life there was no film I saw that I didn't like in any way, no matter how bad it was. This deserves a prize for being the first. BAD BAD BAD ... I don't think there is a single word in the English dictionary that can describe this trash movie. Today I was trying to look at it again but I had to shut it down like ten minutes because I was about to cry from the overwhelming amount of clichés. <br /> <br /> Don't even worry about renting this to your blockbuster, it's not worth a penny, I'm actually willing to pay anyone out there considering watching this movie so they can do something decent with their lives .
