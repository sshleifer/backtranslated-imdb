"The Thomas Crown Affair" is a terrible remake of a not very good film, redeemable only for the topless shots of the former top model Renee Russo. <br /> <br /> Done. The plot is negligible, Pierce Brosnan called in his side, and Dennis Leary (as usual) plays an annoying Irish cop, but I couldn't take my eyes off the beautiful Russian lady. There's a beautiful love scene on a ladder, a terrific sexy ballroom dance, a topless beach scene, and a roll in the bag. Oh, and there is a painting stolen from a museum and a catamaran is sunk. <br /> <br /> But we hope that other directors will recognize the pungent attributes of Mrs. Russo and throw her into more visible roles.
