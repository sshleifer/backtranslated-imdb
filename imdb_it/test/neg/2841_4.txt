(Some spoilers) A bit boring as a fool who has this upset homeless Harry, Darwyn Swalve, who is assassinating a real estate agent across the city of L.A due to the high prices they charge for their properties. It looks like an extra from a "Spaghetti Western" by Clint Eastwood, Harry who lives in abandoned houses eating dog food and gets upset when his abusive lifestyle is interrupted. This happens when a number of real estate agents have invaded his space in an attempt to sell the houses, which remained to their potential customers. <br /> <br /> Joseph Bottome is the protagonist of this bottom jar the horror film in which the radio talk show hosts Dr. David Kelly, the beautiful and popular guest psychologist of the KDRX survival line. DR. Kelly was sued by the family of one of her callers, Tracy, who ended up pulling her brains out while she was up in the air with the doctor who could do nothing to help her survive her ordeal to take him to him. <br /> <br /> The real estate killer talks to Dr. Kelly live about his adventures and the police try to get the document to get his phone number and address, keeping it online, but he refuses to order not to damage his rating by having potential callers who don't call for fear of being monitored by the LADP. <br /> <br /> Kelly also has a very warm relationship with a real estate agent and the tectonic agent Lisa Grant, Adrienne Barbeau, who is Harry's main salesman in the film. Harry also arrives to assassinate Lisa's main real estate competition, the barbaric and exaggerated Barney Resnick, Barry Hope, who threatened to take Lisa out of the way anyway, even if he kills her. <br /> <br /> By obtaining Berney alone and with his pants down, Harry smashes his head while being entertained by one of his clients, a prostitute, who leaves dead and hung with the headless Barney. The film ends with a deranged Harry who takes Lisa hostage and Dr. Kelly tries to come to her rescue just to have Det. Shapiro (Robert Miano), who looks like and hasn't slept in a week, pops out of nowhere and blasts Harry's brain. Harry quickly returns to life without the gay matter between his ears and gets himself killed for the second time in the film by being thrown from a balcony and landing on the ground like a dozen LAPD members, M16 armed and ready, come on the scene. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the film "Opean House" worked with the laughable almost non-existent tension. Even the hot sex scenes between Dr. Kelly and Lisa did not save the film as there were too few, only two, and sexy Adrienne Barbeau was a little too underexposed, with too little light and too many clothes, in all . <br /> <br /> Harry, the killer of the film, was a bit too comical to be taken seriously in trying to make a point, with Dr. Kelly on the phone and in person, about high rents and real estate prices in the country and how people like him find it almost impossible to find a decent place to live. You can sympathize with Harry's concern about the high cost of living, but be very critical of him in the way he went crazy in correcting him.
