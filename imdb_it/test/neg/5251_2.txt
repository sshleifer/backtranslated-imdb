What. Uh ... <br /> <br /> This film is so dissociative and messy that I literally lost some of my balance after it was finished. I will never be the same person again. I'm trying to put my finger on what, exactly, is so completely crazy about it ... It's not just the hilarious techno music, or the "out of time" medieval / Blade Runner / Wild West / Highlander, or the weird CGI monster "Grendel" that looks like a man made of animated sausages, or even the monster of "Grendel's mother", which looks like an Alabama dancer who cultivated claws and tentacles when she had been in the tanning bed too long. All these things are strange, but the strangest thing about this film is acting. I simply can't explain. This script is obviously incredibly stupid, but the actors exude deadly gravity through all this. Lambert is always weird, and it's usually pretty boring, but that's why he entered the territory of Dolph Lundgrin: I can't help but start laughing every time he speaks. <br /> <br /> I will give this film a little credit for being completely derogatory and crazy compared to the conservative and boring. I will always take a bizarre disaster from a film about an absolutely mediocre one. <br /> <br /> Attention: if you are planning to watch Christopher Lambert as Beowulf, get ready to spend several hours later wandering the streets in some kind of nightmare, hyperactive-catatonic daze. It's true. When I finished my journey in the spirit of Beowulf, I woke up in the middle of the Siberian tundra in a pool of blood and milk. There was a dead wolf beside me, and later I discovered that I had a handful of human teeth in my shirt pocket. My VHS copy of Beowulf was sitting on a stone altar hastily built nearby, guarded with candles and faded flowers. The tape told me to walk. I got up and walked.
