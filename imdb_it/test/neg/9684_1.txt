How offensive! Those who liked this movie probably never opened a bible. I can imagine those of NBC who say "Ok, let's make a movie to appease those annoying Christians, but they will never know the difference if we don't have anything done or in the right chronological order". Well, they were wrong. Anyone associated with this atrocity must find a church and repent for their involvement in this blasphemous atrocity. I only gave this movie a 1 because I couldn't give it a 0.
