This film distorts the facts of Anne and Mary's life into something unrecognizable. Making Mary Boleyn, who was actually a rather weak and crazy creature, and making her the "good" sister is simply silly. It is Anne who was in fact the character much more interesting, and that is why she is her life, and not Mary's, who has been told so often. <br /> <br /> In response to a previous review, I fail to see how Anne's life was so "criminal" ... for me it's Henry the real criminal. Whatever Anna's motivation to win the king and keep her loved ones to get a crown and a husband must be taken into consideration when these real-life events occurred. Anne, compared to most of the courtiers of her time, was a relatively innocent figure. Most modern historians discount or deny most of the myths and slanders that this film perpetuates about her, and I've never heard of anyone really believing the rumors of how she slept with her brother. This film is so sensational and fake that it goes crazy that someone, without knowing anything about this historical period, can go away believing anything that this film presented as "done". <br /> <br /> I won "I'm even able to get into the weird footage of the movie ... but I'm pretty sure the cameras weren't invented in the 16th century, so I don't understand why Anne and Mary are speaking throughout the film ... it's a really bad plot and it's baffling and annoying, to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> Anne of the Thousand Days is not accurate, but it's infinitely more fun and at least comes closer to tell the story of one of the most intriguing women in history Do not even think of renting this ... you will never return for two hours!
