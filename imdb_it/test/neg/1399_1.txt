This is one of the most ridiculous westerns that Hollywood has ever made. Gary Cooper plays 'Reb Hollister', a former confederate officer wanted by the law. He meets an idiot named Weatherby, played by Leif Erickson, who is a US marshal without knowledge of firearms. Weatherby is traveling to Dallas to see his girlfriend, Tonia Robles, played by Ruth Roman. Senor Robles, Tonia's father, has a lot of men, but they can't keep an eye on his cattle, which is regularly searched by the Marlow brothers. Will Marlow, played by Raymond Massey, financed the loan on Robles' estate, making things completely absurd. He even has the power to request mortgage payments before they are due, simply because he wants them. <br /> <br /> Since Weatherby is a Boston guy who can't fight, since he became just a marshal he could visit his girlfriend, Tonia, (just another instance of other nonsense of the plot. ) Should we assume that you only need to pass a written test to get this job? Wait a minute, even this guy couldn't pass the written test. ) changes identity with Reb Hollister, who is obviously an expert hired assassin. Reb takes the freedom to greet Weatherby's girlfriend with a passionate kiss, while Weatherby looks like an idiot. Gary Cooper, the number one pivot in Hollywood, is in great shape here as Reb. Before the film is finished, he not only takes Weatherby's work, but also steals his girlfriend, and Ruth Roman in the role of Tonia, falls in love with him so strong and so fast that he gives Leif Erickson some rubbish before movies just over half over. <br /> <br /> There is not a shred of credibility of the plot in the whole film, so despite the good cast and lush photography, the film is a real disaster. And the character of Cooper is a complete heel. The film is also played by Barbara Payton as Brant Marlow's girlfriend, a beautiful and talented actress who wasted her chances, unfortunately, making too many titles for the wrong reasons. I strongly suggest you pass this.
