This film actually starts quite interesting, but for my taste it has degenerated too quickly into a boring and predictable melodrama. None of the performances are particularly interesting and the cameras only work for standard TV movies, so there's really no reason why nobody can see this movie unless they are big fans of Jeff Bridges as I believe. <br /> Bridges plays Mike Olson, a young man who announces at a family picnic that he is leaving college to tour. His parents believe that they are "acting" and that they talk about "not having a plan". He assures them that he has a plan and that he needs to discover his true self and his place in the world. So much so that he actually invites them to travel with him and buys an old bus to travel, which he and his father repair in a real movie for the father-bond TV. Up until this point in the film I was a bit interested in the plot and the characters and wanted to see how his blocked mother (Vera Miles) would react to life on the street. There is a fun scene at the beginning where father and son have to convince her to make the trip with them. They show her the inside of the bus and she gradually becomes more and more interested, finally starting in a breath with some kind of talk about curtains against blinds on the windows. Bridges marvels at his father (Carl Betz, who has a radio announcer) who has changed his mind. Dad assures him that "the electric oven ... works every time!" <br /> <br /> But the film goes downhill as soon as they arrive on the road. It turns out that Mike's only "plan" is to present them to some of his "friends" who turn out to be random people who meet at a hippie rock festival. As soon as I saw the rock festival I was a little disappointed ... especially because it became evident that the entire rest of the film would take place at the festival campsite and not actually on the road. But at least I thought there might be a decent band like, well, if they couldn't afford Hendrix or the Stones they might at least have had Canned Heat or Little Feat or something like that. No dice - apparently the only music in this festival is a horrible choral group with orchestra that sounded like a poor imitation of the Fifth Dimension, along with a boring announcer that should be humorous. <br /> <br /> We too are introduced to a series of hippy festival lovers and their various medical melodramas. Kathy (Renne Jarrett) is a beautiful blonde girl with existentialism and nature in her mind, who falls in love with Mike before revealing the fact that she needs kidney dialysis to live and has fled to the festival to die. And two other campers are determined to keep a child in their rough tent, introducing the struggle between modern medicine and hippy ignorance (or something like that). More generally this becomes more painful, the film becomes for all those who hope for some element of surprise or real drama. <br /> <br /> Basically this film is a waste of time, although it would probably amuse anyone who is really in the period between the late 60s, early 70s and the movies of that time. I would be just as happy if I never saw him again.
