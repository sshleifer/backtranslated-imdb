Corben Bernsen directed horror films about a chemical weapon released at a sporting event and turning everyone into crazy monsters. Let's watch as the staff of a radio station takes the reports. <br /> <br /> His moments are important, but mostly it sounds like a Lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood. There are some good ideas here, but they just don't work. In reality the film's ideas are better managed in a film called Pontypool that practically works to the end and creates tension by showing nothing. This shows us stuff and looks cheap. Given the choice, I would look at Pontypool again rather than watch this movie again.
