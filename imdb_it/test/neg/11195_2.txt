This show started well, but then turned into a nightmare. The worst part was that of the competitors. Many of them were strange. They did stupid things and even did strange hobbies. In the second season, a boy said he spoke with his pants. That is sick and repulsive. Besides, nobody cared about winning money. All they ever wanted to do was make alliances like "Survivor" or something like that. Men were always afraid that women would join forces. Even the women were the same. I could not do it anymore. I had to stop watching it. It was really one of the worst shows ever.
