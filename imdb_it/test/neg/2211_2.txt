Meltdown opens on a scene of scientists preparing to conduct an important test on a missile system developed to divert asteroids if they are on a collision course with the earth. Nathan (Vincent Gale) mentions some doubts in his, but the test seems to be a success without reservations. Then the asteroid breaks and the largest piece is pushed into a path of direct collision with the earth. Fortunately, the huge rock jumps out of the outer atmosphere of the earth and bounces back into space. Unfortunately, the deviant blow is sufficient to alter the Earth's orbit, and the planet begins to spiral closer to the sun. <br /> <br /> While all this is happening over their heads, LA cops Tom (Casper Van Dien) and Mick (Greg Anderson) are up for grabs. They should collect evidence against a suspected drug dealer, but the deal they're looking at quickly turns into a shootout. Later, Tom takes a few minutes to be interviewed by a local television journalist who is also his girlfriend, Carly (Stefanie von Pfetten). <br /> <br /> In a nearby hospital where Mick is treated for a minor injury, Tom has a brief conversation with his ex-girlfriend Bonnie (Venus Terzo), who is a nurse. He tells her that he is concerned that their 17-year-old daughter Kimberly (Amanda Crew) meets a man named CJ (Ryan McDonell). Once Tom explains to Bonnie that he has discovered that CJ has a criminal record, he is a little worried. <br /> <br /> It is not long, however, before everyone has anything else to worry about. The temperature is rapidly increasing all over the world. Carly is one of the first non-scientists to know what's really going on. Nathan, who is his brother, calls her to say he could have a way to survive. Carly calls Tom; he, of course, promptly contacts Bonnie. <br /> <br /> In a relatively short order, the diverse group is on the road. However, before they can reach their final goal, they must make their way through gangs of looters, face a catastrophic lack of water and be able to travel at temperatures high enough to kill. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien is a good-looking guy, and I actually liked him in Starship Troopers. Maybe because he's good at action scenes. It could also be because he didn't talk much in that movie. In Meltdown, he has unfortunately given enough lines in situations that are simply dramatic enough to show his completely normal acting skills. Amanda Crew also agrees, and Ryan McDonell is not bad either. Even Vincent Gale and Stefanie von Pfetten are both reasonably good, but Venus Terzo is unfortunately on a par with Van Dien. <br /> <br /> But what really makes or breaks a movie is the story and the script. While the story here is ok and actually has real potential, the script is simply horrible. The scientific part of science fiction is non-existent starting from the asteroid that pushes the earth out of orbit and intensifies with the notion that "the gravitational equilibrium of the solar system" could "bring the earth back" in its normal orbit "over time ". When the temperature in Los Angeles reaches 120 degrees, the cars start to explode. <br /> <br /> Do you know what's worse than bad science? Bad continuity. Okay, very hot. Why do people in the film wear not only long-sleeved shirts but also jackets? Why do people attack each other for bottled water instead of turning on the taps at home? Why are the streets completely empty, but the highways are completely full? And why are highways full of unexploded? It is almost superfluous to note that sets, costumes and production values ​​were good, especially when this forces me to say that the changes were not. <br /> <br /> So basically, you get a good idea of ​​history and combine it with mostly mediocre acting, a terrible script, low-end special effects, absolutely irrational twists and bad changes, and what you have ? A film that is even less than the sum of its reckless parts. I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend Meltdown: Days of Destruction to anyone. <br /> <br /> POLITICAL NOTES: here it was said that Congress loosened the purse strings enough to fund the tests that started the film in rotation. While the tests here were completely irresponsible (targeting an asteroid with a nuclear weapon and not knowing that the composition of big rock is, indeed, far beyond the irresponsible and approaching madman), the fact is that such scenarios are a very real danger to the planet. Unfortunately, we have not drawn any neighbors near all the asteroids of the nearby land that could be worrying in some orbit one day; and our ability to identify something in a collision course with us is limited to the maximum. <br /> <br /> Once we discover that we will be affected, we have virtually no system capable of dealing with it. There are no nuclear-tipped space missiles that we can launch; the spaceship is completely incapable of going beyond the Earth's orbit, and if it were, we could not launch enough or launch them fast enough for this to be important. I'm not big on the government doing anything beyond its constitutional mandates, but I think protecting the planet from the destruction that comes from space could be interpreted as a defense of the country, right? FAMILY FITNESS: Meltdown: Days of Destruction is classified as R for "some violence". Frankly, I didn't find the violence here beyond a typical T-rated video game. If your kids are eager to see Meltdown and can't talk about it, the R rating shouldn't deter you from showing it to them. It is not, however, a good idea to leave younger children in the room with their older siblings. While the shootings are not too graphic in the main, some of the corpses are.
