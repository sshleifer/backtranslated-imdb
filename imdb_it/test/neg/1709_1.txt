Holy Sweet Murder This is probably the least fun movie I've ever seen. you can take my word for this as truth because right now he is playing on television. it's really one of the most pathetic productions I've ever seen. there is not a single redeemable aspect of this film. it just lacks any humor. the only good thing that could have it is that it is so unpleasant that it is absolutely unattainable. in fact, I sat in a ridiculous sub-plot and can't really tell you what happened. the only reason I can even remember seeing this movie is because it is so utterly devoid of humor that it will remain in my mind forever based on that alone. <br /> absolutely not to be missed. if your friend wants to show it to you, shoot it and save yourself the boredom.
