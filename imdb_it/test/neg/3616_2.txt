I don't think it's really necessary to write a review on a film with a derisive title like "Snake Island", but even in the abstract boundaries of its genre, this hit a new low, so my anger must be known. The only reason I even bothered watching this incredibly bad movie is because I knew it would be bad, it was really late at night, I couldn't sleep, and in the past, really bad movies would drain the energy of me and make me want sleep. It became very early very soon that this film would have been horrible, but it even went below those expectations. <br /> <br /> The film was directed and written by Wayne Crawford, who is also the protagonist in the film as a tour guide on the African river, who ends up having to run aground on a remote island called Snake Island until when another boat comes down to get them. They stop, get drunk and then become subject to the onslaught of poisonous snakes that are on a mission to purify their island of human beings. <br /> <br /> If your jaw dropped to the last sentence of my second paragraph, don't worry about rereading it, you got it right the first time. Honestly, I prefer the characteristics of my creature when creatures simply attack the foolishly stupid hunger-stricken humans, not because they have a kind of mission. These are not mutant snakes. They are not giants like the one you see in "Anaconda". Are they just ordinary, every day African snakes like mambas and vipers ?? only that they have brains to form armies, collect causes, work together to trap people, understand our language and even dance! Has your shot fallen again? Well, it's going to fall further. In the middle of this horrible B series film, about the part I had already given up, the human characters started drinking around a bonfire and then suddenly turned into a kind of orgy. And while they dance naked and so, the snakes that hunt them suddenly stop and start to freeze. The combination of this scene and the scene in which we discover that snakes, some of the most evil creatures on the planet, have formed an alliance against humans for a strange reason, has simply proved too much for my poor brain. And just when I thought the filmmakers couldn't take it to an even lower level, the snakes began to sing. <br /> <br /> The people in the movie? Well, let's say that I've never been a fan of creatures before to kill everyone so fast. I couldn't stand it anymore. <br /> <br /> I don't really think I need to go on; get the picture If there is something that makes "Snake Island" different from its other rivals, is that it has the courage to try to be even more stupid and this is not a free success. Because, just because, I keep getting these really bad movies, I guess I'll never really know. But "Snake Island" hits a new historical low. It is an inexpensive and trashy excuse for a film that makes "Anaconda", a film of brainless snakes, with a brilliant, sophisticated and electrifying look like Steven Spielberg's "Jaws". You have been warned.
