I never understood the attraction of Karen Black. He always had those small eyes and a kind of strange expression on her. He seemed to be often eccentric or cast like the other woman. In this, she is the psychic consultant and expert of the occult for a poor producer of bad advertisements while learning astral projection. He's crazy, even without the new luggage. Apparently this is the way to immortality, because if you can, you can inhabit the bodies of future generations. I think Star Trek had a story like this with Jack the Ripper hanging for several centuries. Anyway, this guy is really dangerous. He has a nice family and makes them unhappy. He starts killing friends, just because they have a rude comment for them, or he doesn't like them. You can see the ending from the back row in the left field. It is a very tough film without humor. Most must be considered as truth. Why are some called but few chosen? I found it long and not very satisfying.
