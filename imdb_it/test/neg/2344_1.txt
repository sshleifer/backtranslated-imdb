I saw this movie on Telly last night and I didn't know it would be a bad party ... I knew it would be stupid but not so bad! This film exemplifies all that is terrible in Australian comedy. Regardless of the scenarios and the most tedious and uninspired characters I've ever met (apart from the questionable French tax comedies produced by the American tax!), Most situations were boring, incredible, stereotypical and SO NOT amusing alone .. terrible! <br /> <br /> One of those scenarios that really bothered me was the nerds on the bus scene. From the point of view of the script, the writers used the most uninteresting - not to say unbelievable - scenario to get these three stuck without their luggage ... They are on vacation for their lives and risk everything (including $ 300 deposit, luggage and room) to exercise their rights to dance on a bus? I mean, I'm about half an hour from their destination! At least they could have asked for the bus driver, but no, they willingly leave because "they can't take it anymore!" And they spoil the holidays ... However, I can't believe the writers didn't organize this scary scenario. I think a ten-year-old can invent five smarter, fun and credible set-ups. <br /> <br /> I can go on with many others - the truly unimaginative stereotypical psychopath, the whole relationship with the unhappy girlfriend and long virgin tag, the 'Wow Man! Over there the goth girl 'inhaled stuff on the train - EVERYTHING was just painful! I can't think of a saving feature of this movie except that maybe the third wheel nerd was pretty nice. He ruined his career by appearing in this junk though!
