This film has several famous actors that I usually like, so I had at least modest expectations when I rented it on DVD. I was very disappointed. In fact, during the last half hour I went out for some snack somewhere and somehow ended up in the kitchen rather than going back on TV. The actors' performances, in which the poor practically all across the board and none of the atmospheres of the film, seemed very convincing. Virtually all the scenes had that feeling "just a movie" for them, I sat there waiting to hear the director he called "CUT!" followed by the crew with a brief chat on the scene before moving on to the next. <br /> <br /> Since the film is about gangsters, most of the characters are hard and absurd, the problem here is that all this bad The kid's attitude is played so badly that it seems like a joke. The constant guitar soundtrack also pushes to emphasize this atmosphere, but when the same track is played for the eighteenth time it only adds to the already strong feeling that everything is just fake. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was just a really bad script, maybe it was just badly executed. I'm not a film critic, in fact I consider it rare to see something that is REALLY good, but this was simply wrong, no matter how objective and tolerant, I'm trying to be. NOT recommended, not even as a rental!
