If you saw this film for the first time with Maria of the Fourth Form, then perhaps it is possible that the haze of nostalgia encourages your charitable side. Otherwise, he has no chance. The whore song of young things is total nonsense, people may have used the occasional word you'll hear here, but not a huge group of sentences in sentence after sentence. It is not so much the date of Dracula AD 1972 as if he were tearing it to pieces, since anyone under thirty opens his mouth, it is impossible to take the film seriously and because it is a laugh, it is not even a smile. The idea of ​​launching Dracula in modern times is good and worthy of a screenplay much stronger than what Don Houghton can offer. The River Thames and Chelsea Male cannot compete with puppet masters, castles of models and terrified extras, but one cannot help but think that with a better writing it would have been so different.
