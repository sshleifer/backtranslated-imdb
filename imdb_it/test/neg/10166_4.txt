This review is for the UK three-disc DVD box set. The first record is called Caught in the Act and contains Model Behavior, Chasing Jamie and Fast and Curioso. Disc two is called Bedroom Bedroom and contains Blue Plate Special, Fall in Lust Again and Love Potion No. 10. The final disc is called Anything Goes and contains Chatroom, She's the Boss and Legally Yours. Because the other four episodes of the series are not included is a mystery because there is certainly enough space on the discs for much more material. <br /> <br /> Each episode opens with the reading of the hotel manager Chloe (Lauren Hayes) a letter from a satisfied customer. We will then see the story that takes place while the guests register in the hotel. Blue Plate Special is the exception because this story comes from a waitress. Writers should have the merit of having a good variety of stories. For example, Model Behavior concerns two competing models for the attention of the photographic crew; Falling in Lust Again talks about a man and a woman who separated and rekindle their love when they meet again at the hotel; She's the Boss speaks of a male secretary / dog put in place that proves to be more of a man than his female boss had realized, to his great pleasure. All episodes lead to a lot of nudity and sex. <br /> <br /> It should not be surprising that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and beautiful pieces. Even the brilliant secretaries are transformed when they remove their glasses and drop their hair. Sexual action is abundant but to me it seems too frantic and false. Camera work could also be a little moderate, spend too much time up close and move around to capture everything, and as usual we get loud music during sexual action. Finally, the closing credits mention the Palm Canopy Hotel, Singer Island, Florida, although my Florida map does not show Singer Island. The scenario certainly looks more like that of Utah or Las Vegas that some people have mentioned. This is a good effort and it's a shame that the second series is still waiting for a DVD in the UK. 4 stars.
