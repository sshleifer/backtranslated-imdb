This is a poor movie, a pretender to a genre of surprise films. It is a genre that has been done much better before. The plot limps, with a predictable ending. (Yawn) The characters are unlikely and some are so unlikely that they are almost unwatchable. Matt Dillon, a fine and intense actor, is totally unbeliever here and is rigid and polite. The others are forgettable. Much of the dialogue is sophomic, again a suitor who tries to be witty. I would not hire the writer to write my shopping list. Yes, it's so bad, that it goes from misogynist to coarse, like beyond brotherhood. With so much talent out there, I'm really surprised this movie was ever made. Show the total lack of imagination of office suits ...
