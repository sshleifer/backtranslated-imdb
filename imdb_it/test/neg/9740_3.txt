This is a stupid movie. When I saw it in a movie theater, more than half of the audience left before it was halfway finished. I remained to the bitter end. To show the fortress? I took it back on television and it was a lot more fun. Still not at all a classic, or even decidedly hilarious, but the family has grown on me. I love Jessica Lundy anyway. If you have nothing better to do and it's free on t.v. you could do worse.
