I was looking forward to that Man of the Year, a couple of girls at my job said it was a pretty good movie, and my mom said she liked it, so I waited for the rental and saw it last night. I must honestly say that this film was a huge disappointment. I barely did it, because to tell the truth the start was pretty good and very well structured, but then it got too dark and not in the movie I saw from the trailer. It seemed like a good comedy, then turned into a very dark drama, which wasn't even that interesting, considering how many of these types of stories we had on the government's conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Tom Dobbs is a very popular comedian with a high-level show and has an act where many people would like him to be involved in politics, just because he seems to have a good grip on what should be improved . So he does, he runs for the presidency, but many people doubt he can win because he is a comedian, but he won! But Elenore Green, who makes sure all the votes are counted, tries to solve a technical problem, but when the government tells her not to fix it, they try to get rid of it, and Tom soon realizes that this may not be the job he does he. She wanted. <br /> <br /> The acting was fine, the direction was OK, it was just the story that didn't work for me. As I said, it turned into a dramatic change of genres, because if you saw the trailer, you would think it was a comedy, and when you start watching it, that's what you get, but then it turns into a real dark drama and a little scary. I would not really recommend this film, it was one of the biggest disappointments I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> 2/10
