This film is basically outrageous, but you have to try them for 3/10. Blood is rubbish, but the grandmother who kills them is pretty funny, and I think the concept is good, and the trick is good for a movie at home. Anyway thanks to God it's only been 55 minutes, and the twist at the end is literally Fight Club (like in the garbage of the film). Just read this comment, don't watch the movie.
