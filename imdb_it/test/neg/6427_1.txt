Wow, what a bad movie. Not scary at all, and barely understandable. The plot doesn't get stuck at all and the acting is absolutely terrifying. What is the phrase of a famous critic? "Manages the emotional range from A to B." Yes. This sums up. Not even good for the value of the field! I didn't expect any Oscar material, but this? And god, is his friend a ghost? You should have IQ of a particularly stupid mollusk to not see it coming. <br /> <br /> This film (and I use this word freely) is an insult to the public going to the cinema. If only someone involved with it knew how to put together the narrative! This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there is nothing lower. On the bright side - at least it's not two hours long.
