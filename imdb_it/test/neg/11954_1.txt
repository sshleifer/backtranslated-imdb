I have a friend who works at the blockbuster and gets 5 free movie rentals a week, so one day while we were scouring the corridors for something interesting, I came across 18 Weapons of Kung Fu and judging by the box alone, this movie it seemed rather strange, but nevertheless we succumbed to the temptation and we rented it - after all, it was free ..... and thank god it was .... this is by far the worst movie I have ever seen .... the budget had to be a pickle and a piece of string ... the plot was ridiculous, the only mention of the "18 weapons" is that there is a book that teaches the ways of the 18 weapons that a bad person follows: and this that's all! there is not even a weapon that fights in this film ... that and the action sequences are simply BORDATE .... 9 times out of 10 the fists and kicks of the other person arrive about a foot from the landing of the other guy, and there are MANY times the movie will skip frames (the result of a ridiculously poor editing) .... dubbing is just as laughable, and it's hardly understandable ... and we don't even get into acting. .. the ending will surely let you say "wtf ??", however to be honest I have to say that the fighting techniques used by the actors were a bit decent, and the old man is a crazy brat .... but that's all. .. luckily I didn't have to pay for this movie, but I guess at least now I know exactly how dangerous a movie can be ....
