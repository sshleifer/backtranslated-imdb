I'm a big fan of horror movies and I know a lot about serial killers. Obviously the director of this refused to look for the film he was creating, because half of the film was fictitious. Furthermore, Ed Gein's character was portrayed in the wrong light. I didn't rent the movie to worry about the deputy and his girlfriend Erica. I rented it to see Ed Gein and his legendary story. This movie was horrible, the only reason I gave a 2 out of 10 is because the blood wasn't bad. Acting = horrible Actors = sub par Movie = waste of time. <br /> <br /> A great upheaval all around, but I will not give up my search for a good horror movie.
