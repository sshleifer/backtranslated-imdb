I saw him in a drive-in when I was 9 years old. All I remember are some scenes (those in which the main character Elle is chased by a guy in a mask) and being unscrupulously scared. Seeing it now, my opinions have changed. It is a pathetic film of "horror" on a film directed by Gloria Grahame (sad) and which has to do with a young and talentless girl, Elle, who is sent there after her mother, the tramp of the city, was beaten with a hammer (pictured graphically). The film has teenagers (actually actors of twenty) beaten, tortured, killed, hungry, attacked with meat cleavers, raped, etc. The brutal hammer murder is the opening scene and then gets worse and worse. There is NOTHING to recommend on this shit. The plot is stupid, all the dialogues are bad and the acting ... the less you say, the better. How did this patient get away with an evaluation of the GP (now PG)? He would get an R now. Without value. One last thing ... such a repulsive ending suggests incest!
