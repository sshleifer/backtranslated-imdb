This film is embodied in total stupidity. Still, I've already seen this movie several times and I plan to watch it several times because, despite its sheer stupidity, it's very funny. And he has one of my favorite movie actors, Casper van Dien, who is here in his full cinematic glory. Here, Casper van Dien is completely Casper van Dien, and you must love him for it. If it hadn't been in this film, it would have been decidedly unwatchable, or at least dreckier than it already is. <br /> <br /> The "science" of "coughing" used here makes absolutely no sense at all. Has no one else in the world noticed that great asteroid approaching the Earth besides that small group? Not even with thousands and thousands and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers who are constantly searching in the heavens just for such a thing? Such a large asteroid would have been made completely obvious to anyone with a pair of eyes even vaguely able to see. And a piece of the asteroid bounced into the atmosphere and nobody noticed either? A rock so large that it hit the atmosphere would have caused enormous shock waves that would have caused an enormous amount of damage on the planet's surface. Surely someone would have noticed something like that. Bwahahaha! The "science" used in this film is so completely ridiculous, that it somehow works to make this movie so funny. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed was that despite the excessive heat, all the characters were not dripping with sweat and their clothes completely soaked. At most, the characters seemed to have been slightly spat out occasionally by someone outside the camera with a bottle of water to give a "shine of sweat". Authenticity was * not * a goal to which this film aimed consistently and consistently. Which, in a strange and exhilarating way, gives this film its fascination with entertainment. <br /> <br /> Is it really worth watching this movie? Definitely! Assuming, of course, that you have absolutely * no * expectation of something that remotely approaches reality. And, it's your desire to bask and enjoy the total luxury right now.
