First of all, Blythe Danner looks nowhere NEAR old enough to play Capshaw's daughter (and indeed he isn't - just ten years away). <br /> <br /> I understand that this should be one of those magical Moonstruck supernatural novels, but this is beyond the limit. Very, very weak in terms of acting, script and direction. <br /> <br /> The only one that really shines here is Ellen DeGeneres, who makes this film watchable - if not quite credible as if it were a cast of a heterosexual hound. But still appealing. In fact, DeGeneres and the skin shots of the young boy Capshaw dally together make this watchable. But no one can really tell if Capshaw is really in love with the boy or not; neither the script nor his acting do it together for us and we are left wondering how he really feels.
