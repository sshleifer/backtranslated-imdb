It's hard to know exactly what to say about this little film so bland and boring. The story is predictable when it's not completely ridiculous. It is all a question of "respectful gestures" which, as presented here, do not bring any conviction at all. Yes, MGM's "production values" are wonderful, and yes, Mrs. Lamarr was exquisitely beautiful, but she and the great Spencer Tracy have absolutely no "chemistry" together - and that's the only thing that would have done this parade of clich√©s to everything effective ... I realized that this film received negative reviews when it was released; the passage of time has not improved it.
