Flesh Feast begins at Miami airport, reporter actor Dan Carter (Harry Kerwin, is also credited as a production designer) calls his partner Ed Casey (Phil Philbin) to let him know that he has just returned from South America where he studied Carl Schuman (Doug Foster) and that was about a great story, but as he continues talking on the phone he is stabbed in the back and killed. Schuman meets Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake, also an executive producer) who was recently released from a psychiatric institution, together they discuss their gruesome plans. The news of Cater's death came to Casey and he decides to resume the story by himself and do some investigation, indeed, in fact, he gets his secretary Viginia Day (Marth Mischon) to do most of the investigations and report back to him , lazy bugger. Virginia informs Casey that they have someone inside her named Kristine (Heather Hughes) since Dr. Frederick leases his spare rooms to the nurses, Kristine reports to Casey of the grotesque juvenile restoration experiments of Schuman & Dr. Frederick involving human flesh and specially grown larvae ... <br /> <br /> Co written, co-produced and directed by Brad F. Grinter Flesh Feast is a rather poor film on all fronts. First we start with the script by Grinter & Thomas Casey, who was also in charge of cinematography (you have the feeling that most of the cast and crew had more than one job), after all it's terrible. The characters are idiots of one dimension and have no personality, I didn't like anyone in this film. For what it's worth, I like some of the ideas here, the carnivorous worms, the underground laboratory, the theft of bodies from a hospital and that unforgettable final 'twist' that is almost worth watching the rest of the film on its own. Unfortunately the dialogue is so badly written, the rigid and unnatural sound is false, I mean, there is a scene in which a nurse says "they won't let us out of the house", which is fine, apart from the fact that is talking EXTERIOR in someone's garden. No thought has been included in the story as no explanation is ever given as to why carnivorous worms are able to restore youth, in fact at some point towards the end, questioned about this same thing, Dr. Frederick states that there is no time to explain at that point that it seems to me that even the people who wrote this didn't have the slightest idea! Even at extremely short 68 minutes, Flesh Feast is very slow and boring, bad editing doesn't help with scenes and shots that last too long, for example there is a scene where an ambulance stops in front of a hospital, guide up to the doors, the boy goes out, goes to the back doors and opens them etc. etc. Do we really need to see every single detail? There is also another sequence in which Dr. Frederick enters the room and puts on gloves, then takes them out of the opposite room and puts another one! Personally, I think Grinter probably didn't shoot enough material, so he stretches every scene as much as possible to make the running-in time. I like that bizarre ending though, really. The meat festival is technically complete, I'm not sure what the budget was, but it had to be small, very small. Almost all the film takes place in a house, the laboratory of dr. Frederick is composed of a table, some plastic glasses and test tubes, some old-looking electronic medical devices and a strange screen with funny colors (don't ask). The cinematography is poor, the music sucks and the whole film seems dubbed, even if nicknamed. Also the elements of exploitation are disappointing, there are some strokes of worms but in reality they do nothing but wriggle away a little, there is a brief scene in which a corpse has a sawed leg and a corpse and limbs dismembered looking OK hung with hooks. The acting is horrible on the part of everyone involved, and I mean really bad that it makes the dialogue on waste even more difficult. Do yourself a favor and avoid Flesh Feast, yes there are one or two unintentionally funny moments and that ending is, to say the least unique, but for the most part this is a real amateur movie that quickly becomes painful to watch. I doubt that most people will be able to cope with this session, I can tolerate anything, but I also thought about turning it off. Definitely one to avoid, you'll be glad you did and if you really have to see it don't say you weren't warned!
