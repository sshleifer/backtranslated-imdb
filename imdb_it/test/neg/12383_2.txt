This is almost the territory of Ed Wood. Yes, that ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between a turkey buzzard and a bad day in the dentist's office. And that strident sound effect makes nails look like a Mozart on a blackboard. And why The Giant Claw when the stupid critter devours his victims with a mechanical jaw. We get great close-ups of the ugly chicken foot, but nothing more. I imagine the producers thought that a more appropriate title entitled Big Mouth could suggest a Jerry Lewis comedy. And speaking of comedies, all that "anti-matter" gobbledy-gook is more fun than anything else in a Lewis movie. I imagine the writers were stuck for a reason why an ordinary duck hunter couldn't take care of a flying threat of the 1950s, so they invented a real ulcer - anti-matter of another galaxy. Yes, this KFC fugitive should have arrived from another galaxy behind an anti-matter shield, as explained in a harrowing detail by one of the film's resident geniuses. In this case, it's Jeff Morrow, a pilot I collect in his opening hours, advises Einstein on the secrets of the universe. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is also Morrow who keeps the ridiculous proceedings out of the bad hall of shame movies since he actually offers his jokes with a straight face. Moreover, it even sounds like he believed them. This is a triumph of the first cinematic order. To joke with the Oscars, Morrow deserves a combat medal to perform above and beyond the call of duty in the worst circumstances of the film. Look at the protagonist Corday, so you can evaluate her fortitude under the fire. It seems that she has just woken up in a bad dream and maybe if she stays still, nobody will notice her. I just did. Oh well, the first time I saw this drive-in disaster was through a beery haze in the last row of what is now a housing development. I should have learned the lesson and broken down another 12 pack this second time.
