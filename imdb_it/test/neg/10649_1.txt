The Joe Cool Review - Hellraiser: Bloodline <br /> <br /> Starring: Bruce Ramsay as Phillip The Merchant / John Merchant / Dr. Paul Merchant, Valentina Vargas as Angelique and Doug Bradley as Pinhead <br /> <br /> Plot: follows a timeline of the lineage of the Merchant bloodline, which began with Phillip L'Merchant, who created the box that opens the door to hell. From the eighteenth century until the time when Pinhead meets Merchant and tries to cut the bloodline .. (he is the only one who can stop Pinhead, see) and finally in the future, in space, where Paul Merchant finally discovered how send Pinhead to hell forever. <br /> <br /> Openers: This is a film hated so much by the people who did it, they declared that the imaginary director Alan Smithee would be the accredited director. They get Smithee out of the woodwork only when they really think they made a terrible movie, like classics like The Birds II: Land's End or Bloodsucking Pharaohs in Pittsburgh. No I did not. How did I like it? You're reading this, so I'm sure that's what you want to know. <br /> <br /> The Good: This movie is not as bad as you have been led to believe. Oh, I'm not going to cover it with sugar. This film has been filled with so much potential and ended up being a disaster, but it has some positive aspects. Cooler cenobites this time for beginners, like the twins and the demon Angelique. The pinhead is still in a main role, and it still has good jokes ("Pain has a face, let me show it to you") and it's a bit funny in everything. The Gorehounds will love the movie because of its endless supply. There's also a bit of continuity with the rest of the series, though you'll have to look good to see it. The Chatterer Dog is fantastic. <br /> <br /> The Bad: But for a story about Hell vs the Merchant's bloody bloodline that could shut down the gateway forever, it was really complicated and held together with duct tape. Nothing was really explored for its full potential and there were some really stupid things included. Pinhead kidnaps a child and keeps it for a ransom! Random deaths only to present more blood (not always a bad thing, but not for the sake of history). The pin head is at its worst here, it makes a mockery and scoffs and replies even when it's about to die! For the very clever demon he used to be, he was reduced to nothing more than a Bond villain at best. If Hellraiser fans have ever needed a reason why he was moved to a cameo role, this is it. Bloodline ruined it for all of us. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: Gore is always mentioned here. This has skin tearing, puncturing, impale hook, beheading and other gadgets. The Chatterer Dog, although fantastic, smells like bad special effects during the chase scenes. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: this film has the potential for something big, even great Hellbound levels. But all this was wasted. Who knows exactly what went down to produce this shit, but we can only blame Alan Smithee. <br /> <br /> Compared to the rest: this film is the worst of the Hellraiser series. Only for completers. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: 1/2 * of *****
