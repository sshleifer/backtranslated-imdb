That's boring. <br /> <br /> It's slow. <br /> <br /> Where are the murders and brutal murders? Where is the tension that should scare us? It's like watching Sesame Street without the funny characters of Ernie and Bert or Grover. <br /> <br /> It's really lame. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the script ... maybe the direction ... Maybe acting, maybe editing, maybe cinematography, maybe special effects, maybe the trick. <br /> <br /> Perhaps all this has led this to something barely able to keep your eyes focused on. /> <br /> I wanted to scare me ... don't get bored. <br /> <br /> This didn't scare me ... it didn't even interest me ... I had more fun watching time in the microwave instead of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about buying it ... and if you see it on television for some strange case, there's no need to roll up the sleeping children.
