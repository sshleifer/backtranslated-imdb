What is it with studios like Paramount that have a series of proven films in their hands, and I imagine they can fool with the budget and the formula? Paramount spent less on this film than it did on the TMP, which doesn't sound bad until you realize that there is a gap between the time the films were made. The $ 40 TMP cost would be about $ 75 million in 1989. This film is why Shatner has never been given a good chance to direct other films as well. Every time we turned, the studio was cutting the budget and making requests regarding the plot. The fact that this was the only plot on which Roddenberry and Shatner could agree for the most part made the task of director quite difficult, but after all the machinations were done, they all ended up with an irregular story and a load of badly executed special effects not worthy of the original series, much less an important film. The most striking examples: - All Phaser effects have been severely turned off and fake. - The hit of the Enterprise that entered the great barrier was obviously a shot of framing from which the zoom was moving away. At least the popsicle stick that contained the Enterprise was successfully stopped. - God "chases" Kirk up the mountain ... Egads, they might even have just done Godzilla strokes climbing the volcano at the end of "Godzilla 1985", and they used drawing pins to scratch the emulsion from the film do electric lightning come out of his eyes against Captain Kirk in danger .... Yes, friends, I have a real problem with the appearance of this last scene, especially. <br /> <br /> Thank God Star Trek VI was such a redeemer of a movie ...
