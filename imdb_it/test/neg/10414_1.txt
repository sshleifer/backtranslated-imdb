I was attracted to this film by its unusual, low-key, "real life" lifestyle. That is, a boy of twenty slips into the Big Apple and returns home to live with his parents and even more floppy brother. It may have worked, but there is a problem. And the name of this problem is Casey Affleck. <br /> <br /> Casey Affleck is almost catatonic in this film. His recitative mantra must "exert the least possible effort at all times". Or "why talk when you can murmur?" Or maybe "put yourself in a coma as soon as the camera rolls". Lips moving when talking? As soon as. Facial expressions? None. Muscles in the face? Atrophied. Something? Anything. Nothing? ZIP.
