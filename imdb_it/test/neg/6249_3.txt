When Jim Wynorski announced for the first time that he would make a new sequel for my favorite series of all time, the "Slumber Party Massacre" series, I was ecstatic. I was waiting for a new episode for literally years. Thus, production began and very small fragments on the shoot and the actors involved were released until the shot. Thus, the announcement of a title change. This new sequel would no longer be titled "Slumber Party Massacre IV", but "Cheerleader Massacre" instead. I was a little disappointed, but having a different title would have been a very low price to pay for a movie I had waited so long. I was still extremely fascinated and on the edge of my seat to see it. <br /> <br /> Maybe a month ago, some very advanced copies of the film were released to some extremely lucky viewers, who got to watch the film months before its release date. Some reviews have leaked on the net and, judging from them, I started to worry about Jim Wynorski's "Cheerleader Massacre". <br /> <br /> Tonight, I saw the film for the first time in all its length and I'm still scratching my head. As I read in another review, "Cheerleader Massacre" is definitely NOT a new installment in the "Slumber Party Massacre" series, but a slasher moves on its own. And a bad look. <br /> <br /> Before going into the specifics of the film, I would first like to specify which huge fan of Jim Wynorski's films are. I always thought he was a true genius of the field, with a winner almost every time. Yes, his films are made with limited budgets and do not contain the most important acting in circulation, but they are still fun. I'm what I am: Campy movie you watch when you want to have fun. From "Sorority House Massacre II", to "Hard to Die", to "Chopping Mall", Jim has produced the products on more than one occasion. One of the reasons I was thrilled that this film would be his last project. <br /> <br /> "Cheerleader Massacre" does not reflect (in my opinion) any of the films I had seen creating this director / writer in the past. First, the production was extremely cheap and the film was shot on videotape, something I had never seen before. The actors were mediocre, to put it mildly, and the story is almost ridiculous. The killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your old cuddly grandfather, rather than a mad escapee. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is full of female nudity. This is a Jim Wynorski film we're talking about, folks. But some of the boob-shots seen here seem almost as if they were made in time. There is an extremely long shower scene, containing the cheerleading trainer, which seems to go on forever and very much reflects a shower scene in Jim's "Sorority House Massacre II". Even the girl bathes almost in the same way. <br /> <br /> "Cheerleader Massacre" is also extremely stereotyped, to say the least. The opening scene is literally something we all saw in CENTO of previous slasher movies. A boy and a girl coming out, on the verge of consuming their relationship when ... you guessed it. They are torn to pieces. <br /> <br /> Brinke Stevens, who I never considered a great actress in the first place, also gives one of his most rigid and forced performances in his little cameo. We are talking about possible starting cards here. Remember some episodes in which his character was endured by the murderer seen here twenty years ago to the police, while the filming of the original "Slumber Party Massacre" is reproduced. Why was the original movie filmed if it was definitely not a new "SPM"? I have no idea. There are also two explosions seen in this film that are almost certain to have been recycled from other films. <br /> <br /> Not only does this film recycle the film of previous films, but it also recycles the scores of other films. Part of the music used in "Humanoids from the Deep" (which was also recycled first for "The Coroner") can be heard throughout the film. There are at least two others that I can't identify, but I'm sure they were used before. <br /> <br /> After witnessing the horrendous acting, the ridiculous story of this movie, non-existent effects / gore / special effects, and video-like quality, I have serious concerns about Mr. Wynorski's career. Has the man who delighted audiences with films in the past finally lost his niche? Only time will tell. Oh, and let's not forget his latest film. A new episode in the films "Sorority House Massacre", now entitled "Final Exam". I think I see a pattern here ...
