I couldn't wait to watch this movie and was therefore extremely disappointed when I found out it was complete and absolutely rubbish. Akerman's direction is both heavy and cliché (how much more cliché can you get than in Paris at night?). The male cast seems to have been chosen entirely for their re-writing to Egon Schiele's distressed self-portraits. Yet the themes of jealousy and betrayal that should have been the main focus of such a film have remained practically unexplored. What remains is a turgid melodrama that requires an age to start and even more time to finish. The only advantage of this type of film is that it realizes how good Goddard and Truffaut are.
