After the general, a film that romanticized the life of the Dublin gangster, the general in such heroic proportions that he got the average person in Dublin sick, along with Kevin and his attempt to play Mr. Lynch or Martin Cahill, or the general, acting is so bad that this criminal drama becomes a comedy for the native Dub, and a tragedy for the Kevin Spacey fan. in short, it's worth a look at the movie ... No, unless you like playing badly with hilarious 'real Irish accents, sure you're sure you are sure'. The story is torn from the commercial success "The General" which, despite the glorification of a well-known Dublin animal to Martin Cahill, is still worth a look, on a national scale because it shows the true working class of Dublin, and on international scale for his true Irish acting and killer cast, including John Voight. All in all, "Ordinary Decent Criminal" is anything but a decent film. To avoid.
