After the book I became very sad when I was watching the movie. I agree that sometimes a film should be different from the original novel, but in this case it was more than acceptable. Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) because the ranks are different (eg Lt. Diestl instead of Sergeant etc.) <br /> <br /> 2) the final screen is very poor and makes Diestl a soldier who frees himself and wants to die. But it is not true in 100%. Just read the book. He was also a bull dog in the last few seconds. He didn't want to die by destroying his gun and simply walking towards Michael and Noah. <br /> <br /> So this is kind of a happy ending that doesn't fit at all in this movie.
