I think this film was a terrible waste of my time, and I would have known it after watching it 5 times in the classroom. this film does not show what happened perfectly in these times. no one can really say that these things have happened to the letter. if anything the only good part would have been the actors, even if they were really disgusting. They were reading the script without expression. quite boring. I'd rather watch the game school. so I would definitely like to never see this movie again in my whole life. it's a complete waste of time, unless you want your time to be wasted and if you want to see an unrealistic view of what happened in 1981.
