"Glen or Glenda" was the first attempt by Edward D. Wood Jr. to direct a feature film. This is why he chose a topic close to and dear to his heart ... transvestism, the "art" of a man who wants to dress in women's clothes. To his credit, Wood tried to tackle topics that were largely taboo in 1953. Unfortunately, Wood had neither the budget nor the know-how to make the film. <br /> <br /> The story opens with a prologue by Bela Lugosi that makes little sense and then goes on to discover a dead transvestite Glen / Glenda (Daniel Davis aka Ed Wood). Inspector Warren (Lyle Talbot) with the help of psychiatrist Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell) tries to understand why a man would like to live (and die) in this way. <br /> <br /> Glen is engaged to Barbara (Dolores Fuller) and is reluctant to tell her about his obsession. And this is all. We see endless archive footage of anything from highway traffic to soldiers landing on the beach, interspersed with shots of Wood walking down the same street as Glen or Glenda and looking with desire at women's clothes in a shop window. Poor old Bela, who was unfortunate and a friend of Wood, continues to peep into history. I'm not 100% sure, but I think the Bela scenes were added for its face value after the body of the film was completed. <br /> <br /> To add to the confusion of Lugosi's narrative, Farrell is also Dr. Alton provides off-screen narration. Lugosi goes on to say, drink, drink ... take care of yourself, take care of yourself, as well as a few meaningless words about snakes and snails and tails of puppies. <br /> <br /> The story also deals with a transvestite who has had successful sex reassignment and tries to explain the difference between that person and Wood's character (s). The dream sequences are ridiculous. A wedding sequence in which someone dressed as a devil appears is a good example. Wood also gives us an apparent rape scene with the actors (?) Completely dressed but leaving little to the imagination, bold for 1953. <br /> <br /> This film along with Wood's other "classics" were like this bad guys to become embraced by the public as cult classics over the years. For this reason, they have survived until today.
