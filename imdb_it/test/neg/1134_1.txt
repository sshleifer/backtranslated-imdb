Note, I only saw roughly the last half of this movie, so feel free to take my review with any grain of salt you think is appropriate, saying that seeing what I saw was more than enough to make me quite convinced that a one- star rating is sufficient. <br /> <br /> In short, it is a gruesome plot of the marvelous forerunner (NL Christmas Vacation) with Chevy Chase, only that it has no Chevy Chase in it, and takes place in a generic tropical island, essentially without any connection to Christmas. <br /> <br /> Chevy probably didn't want to because the plot is so lacking in real fun, instead they took the vicious cousin Eddie, who, once again, was exceptional in the original, but in this he is just above the lines and an extremely poor base for any film, considering the plot and the acting. Attempts at humor are generic to the extent that even contemporary television comedy surpasses it, and considering that this should be a comedy, I doubt I have to say more. <br /> <br /> This is not visible for its qualities, because there is none, but for its flaws and again, as Hollywood is shedding the blood of life of the past in pursuit of a dollar. <br /> <br /> I think I will look at the original before the upcoming Christmas season just to try to regain my innocent childhood, a lost time when the movies were more of a high-budget but mindless garbage .
