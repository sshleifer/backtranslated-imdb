I saw a movie called Dark Talon, dated 1974. The credits of this film are exactly the same as Dark Star, so I assume it's an alternative title. Dark Talon wasn't nearly as funny as everyone else says here. The acting was lame, the assembly slippery and on the whole stupid. At the beginning there is an annoying 1970s truck song called "Benson, Arizona" which has absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Basically the plot revolves around a small crew of an interstellar bomber that goes around unstable bombing sites. Bombs are sentient and respond to people. The compulsory disaster interrupts the communication between the bombs and the crew. One of the crewmen comes out and has an absurdly idiotic conversation with the bomb that makes absolutely no sense. The film I saw was done in less than an hour and a half, with commercials launched in, so I suspect that Dark Talon is a new version of Dark Star. <br /> <br /> The alien is an inflatable red beach spray painted with a pair of monstrous hands on which it walks. He was foolish and unconvincing as an alien. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that John Carpenter gave us a hand. His other films were much better.
