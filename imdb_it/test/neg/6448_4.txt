Amanda Bynes is a very talented actress and in the past I enjoyed all her roles, especially in the fantastic "She's the Man". For this reason alone, "Sydney White" was a huge disappointment for me. The real reason for my dislike of this film is the misuse of the characters. In a fun teenage comedy, it's perfectly fine to have a cast of all reality-based teenage characters. In "Sydney White", this idea is thrown out the window. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is a good Sydney, but she really misses much of what usually makes her shine as an actress. I blame the script, which makes her character too bland and sober, and the hairdressing / makeup department, which gives her a detestable plastic appearance and an annoying hairstyle. The seven "idiots" that Sydney eventually makes friends are much worse. They are so crazy that it is impossible to appreciate them or even respect them as characters. They are essentially vomiting fodder. As is the "Prince Charming" of the story, which is absolutely incredible as a character and looks rough. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest movie star (with the possible exception of Amanda Bynes) is Sara Paxton, who is actually as good as the conniving Rachel Witchburn. It's just a pity that the writers didn't make it a little more gray than black. <br /> <br /> The plot is essentially that of "Snow White". What kills is that a re-imagination is too blunt and obvious. Connections to "Snow White" are thrown at us so much during the film that they are both annoying and exaggerated. The Prince Charming is incredibly charming, the "witch" is too contemptible a witch, the seven "idiots" are too crazy and Sydney is too pure of heart. Now this does not mean that the film is all negative. Even if Bynes is forced to abandon the script, she still has her moments. As does Sara Paxton, who brings physical comedy to its fullest in scenes. Sydney's roommate, called "Dinky", is also very funny as a character. It is a film that is a bit funny in some parts, which in the end is too poor and skeptical to recommend.
