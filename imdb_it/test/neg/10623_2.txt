When I borrowed this movie, I didn't expect high quality performances, but this was just sad. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting was so incredibly bad that you couldn't easily get into this movie if you tried. There is nothing better than seeing a child announce things like "Oh no! My father is invisible!" or "I wonder what he does?" in the same monotone you could announce traffic announcements via radio with. There are some good actors, but they are wasted on smaller parts. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, although it would be fairly easy to guess, considering that there aren't too many real plot changes. A lot of holes, too. For example, the father is invisible and the inventor discovers which part is necessary to make it visible again. So the boy goes and steals the part from an electronics store. Couldn't he just ask his father for the money? <br /> <br /> This comes in the Comedy category, but most of the comedy in this film was pretty stupid, like the Invisible Dad taking off his clothes while he is invisible and then almost reappearing naked during a meeting , or go around with your head covered at all times. Funny at the beginning, but it gets old. <br /> <br /> 2/5, because it's watchable, and it's one of those movies that are fun in their own way ... like the monotonous acting lines.
