Allow me to understand ... "The Church" has a security "lock" mechanism to prevent spirits from leaving, but the final solution is to bring it to the ground ?! LofL! Maybe I miss the plot. Maybe this guy is from Ed Wood's movie school or something. This film is as useless as the church itself. Hey ... maybe that's the point. Rosemary's entire Baby-esq segment was hilarity. I can go to my Halloween costume corner and get a better endurance than that. The entire film must be redone. Properly. There were so many things that were being played ... so many things that would blow me out of my seat and across the ceiling. I'm not sure the blame depends on writing or editing, but what I saw shouldn't have such a high score.
