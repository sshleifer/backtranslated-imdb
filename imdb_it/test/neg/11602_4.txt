This was Hitchcock's third Hollywood feature, and it looks like it was not yet in a coherence pattern, going from the faithful adaptation of Rebecca's classic novel, to the espionage thriller in the Foreign Correspondent, and now this romantic screwball comedy "" The images of the 1930s. Hitchcock's formal method, on the other hand, had by now stabilized into something coherent, to the point that he was not able (or at least he did not want to) to depart from it. he came out of his usual genre, and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate.In Rebecca it was really nice to see Hitchcock forced by his producer and by the original text, forced to transform his technique into a heavy Gothic drama, but for Mr and Mrs Smith there is a huge discrepancy between form and content. In other words, Hitchcock was not Ernst Lubitsch. <br /> <br /> First, let's look at the romantic angle. and in the Hitchcock movies have they been wild, passionate and a little bit dangerous ?? the "never in love with someone you shouldn't have?" situation, and was very good at representing it. This is something that makes a much older film, Rich and Strange, one of the few non-Hitchcock thrillers that really works. Hitch is not so good when it comes to a kinder and more familiar romance. A light and tender touch is needed and Hitch does not have it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, take the comedy. Sure, could Hitchcock's movies be fun ?? The Lady Vanishes is probably the best example ?? but only when the lines have been scattered throughout the story. The master of suspense is simply not enough a director of comedies to create a film that has funny bones. Cut scenes like you would in a thriller ?? the opposite snappy corners of people talking, close-ups of hands and feet, point of view shots ?? but does not take into account the comic timing or the focus on the gags. For example, the business with the Carole Lombard dress that explodes at the looks is shown to us with a couple of close-ups, but these are timed more as if it revealed some crucial points of the plot, and have no comical impact. From time to time does Hitchcock's style roughly coincide with the play? for example the disposition of the characters in the scene of the club, where Robert Montgomery tries to make to seem that it is with the attractive and sophisticated woman to the next table ?? but these moments are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Even the cast of Mr and Mrs Smith are not up to standard. I'm not sure this was the strength of Robert Montgomery, and he's boring here. This was, of course, the point where the strength of "Queen of Screwball" Carole Lombard resided, yet while clearly playing the scenes they are not simply oriented to capture comedy shows. Even Jack Carson, who could be hilarious when he was allowed to let go of the camera, can't recreate things. Of course, none of these good comedy actors is helped by the script, which is not exactly full of laughter, although the basic story is a pretty good premise. <br /> <br /> The only complete - the comedy Hitchcock made after this was the problem with Harry, and that kind of work worked because he played on his familiar suspense. However, was it only when the story could exist regardless of humor, when the basic structure was suspended? how is it in The Lady Vanishes or Family Plot ?? that Hitchcock was capable of doing good comedy.
