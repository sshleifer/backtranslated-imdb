I've seen the MST3K version of this movie and it's a bad movie - but it's not as bad as its low IMDB rating (currently 1.8 out of 10). At least the film has some production values ​​and apparently has a competent editor (unlike films that are really horrible). The main problem with this film is that it didn't have any catchy characters. The main character, Marv, is so pathetically gloomy, that he practically asks all the bad things that happen to him. And neither is he very intelligent, or he would have understood to stay away from the conniving girl Betty. And even more pathetic than Marv is his father, who is nothing but a drunken loser. The highlight of the film is the robbery sequence at the end, but even that was performed weakly, the enthusiasm that could have added to the film is completely absent. At least this movie was made for a very fun MST3K episode, as Mike and the Bots do a great job of making fun of it.
