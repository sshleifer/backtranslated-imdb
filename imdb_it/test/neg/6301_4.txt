This is one of those little harmless and slightly funny films that try to make you appreciate more. But like many others, his material is not strong enough to successfully fill a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> The field is promising: three drag queens drive a bus through the Outback from Sydney to Alice Springs. They run into many problems - with homophobic locals, with the engine, with their past. <br /> <br /> The real problem is with dialogue. Gossip is good (although Pearce's continuing anxiety becomes boring), but the jokes and epithets feel obligated where they should be thrown away casually. The characters don't have to laugh at their own gags. <br /> <br /> The writer / director Elliott also feels the need to accumulate pleasantly incongruous shots of imaginative dragsters against desert desert backgrounds as economic tricks. For a film about self-confidence and being yourself, it all seems very insecure.
