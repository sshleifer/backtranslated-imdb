First of all, the idea of ​​remaking a classic like "Psycho" is ridiculous to say the least. A lot of time and effort has been wasted here. I'm sure they're smart enough to know that they couldn't improve on the original, so they must have had a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock in their minds. However, the idea that started as a well-intentioned tribute translates into a slap in the face to the master of horror. This film is poorly produced, misinterpreted and unnecessary to begin with. The original classic stands well on its own, even after 40 years. The Hitch event that comes back from the grave and comes after the people responsible for this piece of junk are unlikely, but if I were them, I'd like to sleep with one eye open for any eventuality. Do not waste time.
