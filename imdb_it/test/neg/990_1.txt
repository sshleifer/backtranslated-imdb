This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen, it was done horribly, it wasn't flowing, it was very rough, because many people didn't understand the movie at all. I had to watch this movie several times before I had an idea of ​​what was happening, OK, it's like a kid stealing someone's car and running away from the police amounted to it, for some reason the cops left him out and he he had to face his parents who sent him to live with his uncle in the desert, there he meets a girl who loves rock climbing and he enters the sport and has to beg his uncle to let him enter a competition for climbing, and yes this it's all it's like I said a horrible movie.
