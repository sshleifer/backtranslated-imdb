This was screened at Sundance last night to a receptive crowd if it changes. Clearly the story is worth relating to, it's powerful and true, but did the director have to play every single role with a recognizable face? I mean, really, you spend your time saying "Oh look, it's the kind of 'Armageddon'", or "Hey, it's Easy Rider!" and you lose sight of history. Maybe it's the only way this guy can make his movie, but it's a bit of a distraction, kind of like "The Love Boat", or those old Towering Inferno movies that were "stuffed with stars!" . I wish it were I just told the story simply with less famous faces, moreover, the work with the camera seems a bit lazy, as if there was no thought about where to put the camera to tell the story at its best. I thought it was fine, but it could have been really good
