There is a part of me that would like to give this film a high rating. Considering that it was made in 1953, this is a very brave film about transvestites, which tackles the problem in a fairly serious and comprehensive way (and offers the viewer a lot of information on the subject) and tries very hard not to stereotype. The film clearly states that transvestites are not homosexuals and that in addition to wearing women's clothes they lead a relatively normal life. This is the pain of not being accepted into society - the plot revolves around a police officer (Lyle Talbot) desperately trying to understand the problem because of a transvestite's recent suicide. So, you have to give all those involved with this film for dealing with such a controversial topic (in the context of 1953). <br /> <br /> Having said that, I'm also sorry to say that this film is absolutely terrible. In an attempt to portray the pain of Glen / Glenda (Edward D. Wood), the film is reduced to fantasies (and sometimes surprisingly - again given the fantasies of the epoch - sensual) that make the story very difficult to follow. The acting is made of wood at its best. None of the dialogues appears real; the actors seem and look like people reading speeches written by others. And - worst of all - there was no reason to have Bela Lugosi in this film. This was another of the increasingly embarrassing roles that this poor man took on in the last stages of his career. "Pulling the strings, pulling the strings", the character of poor Lugosi (called The Spirit in the credits, but who actually turns out to be a mad scientist) continued to cry. And nothing he has done seems to have much connection with the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> For artistic merit, the film does not deserve much more than 1/10. However, for the courage involved in putting him out, I'll give him a 3/10.
