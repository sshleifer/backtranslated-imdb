The first movie I saw from these people was "Children of the Grave" and when I felt that this was happening I thought it would be nice to watch especially because Waverly is a real place that is said to be haunted. This documentary / film was AWFUL! There were too many false comments from producers, directors, cameramen ... they needed to keep their faces out of this movie. It is said that Waverly has been obsessed for a long time, but if anyone had any doubts about this film, they will no doubt start to believe that every story in the place is as false as this documentary. The demonstration of the paranormal was horrible and almost non-existent. I listened to the best EVPs of high school students with recorders in a bathroom! They tried too hard to make things scary and the end result was that nothing was scary. Not the stories, not the blurry ones to see any video, not the images, not the tape recordings! Even Children of the Grave was bad, but at least it had a certain substance and some viscosity factor. The only reason I'm giving a 3 is because the historical part of the show was very good and informative. Learning how the hospital was born, the daily life there, and how it ended was the only thing worthwhile in this piece of shit of 2 hours.
