I imagine that when people say this is beautifully filmed, they are talking about close-ups of frogs and cooking meals. It certainly does not refer to the set that appears to consist of about 3 rooms without external shots. Even everything is turned too close. <br /> <br /> I got sick of the kid who keeps farting at Miu or pours hot wax on the ants ... do the Vietnamese spend all their time sitting on their thighs? A bit coarse, at least in the way this film depicts it - a close-up of it would have been abundantly no more than a dozen or more. <br /> <br /> Then finally the second arrives ... a shot of chicken for the Vietnamese girls with the perfect handsome rich man who spends all day playing the piano (he is caught). The beautiful girl steals it like the fruit of the forbidden green mango. Deep. <br /> <br /> With the exception of some beautiful close-ups, this film is a real disaster. It's a kind of soap opera without dialogue. He is deployed. How beautiful ?? The set seems completely fake. <br /> <br /> No, don't make the mistake I made and rent it because someone recommended it. I was expecting great shots of the Vietnamese coastal mountains or something when I felt it was a visual gem. I wanted to like this movie. I also like foreign films I prefer them. But this film is stupid and boring. It will leave you irritated that something like this has won a lot of prizes.
