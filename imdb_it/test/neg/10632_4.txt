I would say this is a background movie. Play in the background as your tendency to busy work (laundry, checking e-mail, etc.). I thought it was a movie that was made before Amy Adams had succeeded after Enchanted. Mistaken! It was made in 2009! The script / screenplay is pretty horrible. I love musicals but singing is only average and does not move the plot along. Ughh. It almost looks like a film based TV movie. Am I watching a television program? <br /> <br /> Even the secretary bursts into the song. What's going on f @ # $?! In fact, he seemed to have the best voice. Amy Adams was so good at Enchanted. The protagonist is average. Disappointed for sure. This film would have been good for life, but that's all. :(
