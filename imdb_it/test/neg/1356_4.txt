Really crazy. Even if you haven't seen the original George Cukor film with Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine and a cast of thousands of other stars, you could dismiss this forced comedy, politically correct and depressing. Depriving yourself for many different reasons. Meg Ryan for one. What did she do to herself? His face hardly moves. This alone puts his miles away from Norma Shearer. Annette Bening should sue the DP and Debra Messing, what the hell was she doing here? Actresses without any connection in the subconscious of the public who try to pass for friends, in a totally unconvincing way. Eva Mendes as Joan Crawford is a scandalous piece of miscellaneous. What a terrible idea! His character is like a transsexual actor with no taste or subtlety. It is bizarre to think that a woman has adapted and directed these women. The only positive things I can mention are a brief but very funny appearance from Bette Midler and Cloris Leachman as a housekeeper.
