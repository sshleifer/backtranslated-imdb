I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience. <br /> <br /> It is a visually rich film but with a slow direction, a poor plot and a two-dimensional characterization. <br /> <br /> I knew it, however, when I entered. I was willing to trust the two gentlemen I was going with (known buffo buff) that the images would be out of the ordinary and so they were. Unfortunately, the inexperience of directing meant that one scene after another passed with little tension or dramatic conflict. However, this is a comment that could be made of many artists whose work is transferred to the screen and who is given the task of directing. The rhythm of the story has been lost as the camera lingers lovingly on the beautiful photos. <br /> <br /> I would never have left without that reassurance that it would have been worth seeing the style of the film. I tried Neil Gaiman's work but I always remained with the feeling of the "emperor's new dress". I live in hope, but last night was no exception. <br /> <br /> I don't think I can continue with an analysis of Gaiman's work without losing the will to live. Read the rest of the comments and all its flaws are described eloquently. I cannot understand, however, how he imagined he had any understanding of the mind of a fifteen-year-old girl, nor that what he had to say added something to the sum total of human knowledge in growing up and assuming the responsibility of adults, or change the relationship a girl could have with her mother. These are the central themes of the film and are managed in an inept, stereotyped and without depth of imagination. All the beautiful photos of the world cannot compensate for a piece of work that is imperfect in the center.
