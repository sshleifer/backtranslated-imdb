I've read all of Shakespeare's comedies, I've seen productions of a majority of them and even recited and directed some of them. I don't necessarily think that Shakespeare should be done in "traditional" fashion, but I hated this film. <br /> <br /> Nudity is free and unnecessary. There is a grotesque that goes far beyond what I think Shakespeare intended. Some of the dialogues are incomprehensible, and there are those elements, such as singing and dancing that do not add meaning to the film, but replace Shakespeare with the director's self-indulgences. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say I wasted the money perfectly to buy the DVD of this movie.
