I agree with what many of the other reviewers have concluded. An argument that could have stimulated reflection and shed light on an inverted double standard, which failed miserably. <br /> <br /> Rape is a crime of violence and forced abusive control, the scenes here have been mostly pathetic. It would have been a good idea to cover short glimpses of what was happening and let the public imagine the action. And the victim laughed with the policemen, when he interrupted the police report, he seemed as sincere as that of the policemen. No embarrassment, no hesitation to simply participate. I don't know if this was bad acting or bad direction, but someone missed the point completely. As for his supposed search for half of his attackers, pathetic. They should have skipped most of the sex scenes - another monumental failure in themselves, and had them meet Colin Friels when he first went to the police. The story could then have been worked out with a good dialogue and the occasional flashback - and saved by acting and superior presence Colin Friels - the only reason I saw this film - leads to any project he does. <br /> <br /> The only concrete revelation of this film is, it was crap.
