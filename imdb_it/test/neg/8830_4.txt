This is a good project for a study of corporate power and the dichotomy between the required public life and the need for privacy. Robert Taylor was chosen by Burl Ives as a surrogate to replace him as head of the company. He sends him to England to negotiate an agreement, in which Taylor is taken aback by the ethics and morality of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a refugee while doing so. He returns empty-handed again, having done his duty but having told the English of his motives. He attempts to marry the refugee rather than the chief's niece and thus begins an attempt by Ives to discredit the refugee as a suitable wife for a corporate executive. It could have been sweeter, more mischievous and less romantic - the amount of time spent on romance diverts the film from the points it is trying to make on corporate ethics. <br /> <br /> Somehow the costume was (undeservedly) nominated for an Oscar - it's all work clothes and the two women in the film dress conservatively - the studio's work policy once again no doubt. <br /> <br /> However, what is stiking is the CinemaScope cinematography in black and white which is excellent - this is what the Oscar nom deserved. (It was the first film of Purpose of MGM in B & W). <br /> <br /> It wasn't as good as it could have been, but neither was it terrible.
