I found this film a great disappointment, especially considering the cast. The characters are not credible, as are the ridiculous circumstances in which they find themselves. The only part of the movie I appreciated was when the most annoying characters were killed. Special effects consist mainly of dead or dying bloody body scenes. A typical slash without fantasy. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe, making it impossible to believe that a solitary creature that creeps up on goats in the middle of the night can be captured by a group of clumsy and noisy idiots. Equally impossible to believe is how they knew exactly where to find it, even though the creature has evaded capture, or even photographed it. <br /> <br /> The man who takes away the impossible to capture the live Chupacabra is our one-dimensional Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito). The only thing Dr. Pena is more obsessed with than the creature is her dart. A dart rifle that worked was a simple bullet shot. <br /> <br /> The ship's captain (John Rhys-Davies) is presented as a "war veteran". He uses his military ability to shoot his men at the creature, regardless of whether they were on the ship. The Navy Seals that appear from nowhere repeat the pattern of shooting at everything. <br /> <br /> Dylan Neal plays an insurance investigator brought on board the cruise ship to capture a thief. He spends most of the film tagging with anyone trying to kill the creature at the moment. <br /> <br /> The creature doesn't even look much like a Chupacabra. Nor does it behave like one. Instead of a small, shy, reserved animal that hunts secretly at night, we get a Freddy Kruger bulletproof, killing everything in sight. A simple Google search would have been very useful for writers and the special effects team.
