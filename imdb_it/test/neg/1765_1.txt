This movie was so bad, I thought I was going to scream in the middle. It was all I could do to sit down. The beginning of the film in which I am at war has been promising. Only it struck me "Save Private Ryan" ... or at least try. Only we don't care for these people. There was nothing for the characters to do. I imagine the child who dies supposes to make us cry ... but for some reason it has irritated everyone. Then we have to listen one line after another to a sloppy dialogue that has desperately tried to imitate "Wuthering Heights", which of course was also mentioned in the film. Go figure. There was nothing original about the film, it was like I was sitting in the most mundane parts of any war movie ever made, with a little humor thrown in to make you hope it would improve. Unfortunately not. 3 hours later, I leave the theater feeling cheated. Anthony Menghilla should be shot for trying to duplicate the English patient, who was a good movie for the moment, but now I wonder ... should I rent him and make sure I wasn't involved in the IPPE ??? Maybe I was, but I certainly wasn't taken by the enthusiasm of this film. I really went to the theater to like this movie. I'm a passionate fan of Nicole Kidman. Save your money, rent it on DVD and laugh, like I did.
