The slogan for this show is: "He's saying his opinion, we're hiring extra lawyers". If you look back in time, any surly classic comedian has never boasted of being controversial. Richard Pryor's slogan was not "I'm Crude, Racist and Daring". This is basically the way Comedy Central markets this show - in the face, not for the PC and "honest" - but how can a TV show be proud of being this way? Where is humility and humility? And what did Carlos Mencia suddenly make this huge figure for Comedy Central? Let's start from the beginning - Dave Chappelle clears his show (which has become UNFORGETTABLE popular and controversial) and Comedy Central is looking around to find someone new to push. They hire this guy named Ned who claims to be Mexican, even though he isn't. They slap his face on some TV commercials and make it look like they are "daring" by unleashing it on the public. <br /> <br /> I've seen many obnoxious topics in the forums for this show, and I disagree with the detractors of "Mencia". This is not a horrible sight. It made me cry with laughter a couple of times. When it's fun, it's very, very funny. Yes, it's young - but so was Chappelle's. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlos is that he always uses the same material over and over again. And it's too obvious. The obvious marketing put aside, "Carlos" has now said beaner so many times that I lost the account. He's trying to make it the next famous line (like "I'm Rick James, b ****!") But it's too obvious. <br /> <br /> In terms of repetition, Carlos uses many of the same lines over and over again. For example, in one episode he said he would like it if all Mexicans disappeared from America during the night. He would wake up and an American boy would say, "Room ser'vuce!" in a southern accent. <br /> <br /> He used exactly this same prank - verbatim - when he appeared as a guest on Adam Carolla's talk show. It was a lot less fun the second time, because he seemed more desperate. <br /> <br /> "Carlos" is fun? I think so. There are some outrageous moments in his show. But he focuses too much on TRYING to be controversial rather than just following the flow and letting his play progress naturally. Repeatedly stupid repeating small sentences with funny faces and loud shouts, in fact, it gets old fast enough ... I just hope that Carlos - or his writers - can give a new advantage to this show, because right now it's starting to fade repeated hell.
