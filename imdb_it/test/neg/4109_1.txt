I wish I could use the time travel machine to go back when I thought I was going to see this movie and make other plans instead. I saw a free screening of A Sound of Thunder, so I can't complain about the price, but I wish I could get my 103 minutes refunded. The acting was mediocre and the special effects were deplorable. People shouldn't make dinosaur films if they can't afford to make prehistoric creatures better or better than those in Jurassic Park. Spielberg has spoiled us. Edward Burns as Travis Ryer was the only saving grace of the film. I noticed that the girls under the age of 18 judged the film to be the highest, and the only explanation is that they kept up with Burns all the time. The whole 103 minutes long. This film should have been finished in about 80 minutes. He simply dragged on and on and on. Don't waste time or money in this far-fetched movie.
