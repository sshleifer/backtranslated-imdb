I was 19 in 1970 when it came out and after hearing how much fun it was when it came out and reading the reviews here, I finally rented it and watched. I didn't laugh once - a very unpleasant movie - and I usually love Reiner. I can't understand why this is seen as fun for me. I didn't have a laugh. And I love comedies! Oh well, at least now I know what it was. It's not my idea of ​​a comedy. Go and rent Buster Keaton's The Navigator or The Love Nest - now THOSE are comedy classics! If you rent this - you have a spare rental so your entire evening is not a loss. Get 3 points out of 10
