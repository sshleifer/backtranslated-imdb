Milo is a complete rip-off of Mikey's 1992 movie, if you really control both films they have the same slogan! But if you want to see an incredibly funny movie with absolutely no plot ...... well then this is the movie for you. The acting is terrible and the flashback scenes are overwhelming and confusing. The story behind this atrocity is simple Milo Jeeder is a child with serious family problems, his father is an abortion doctor who keeps an unborn fetus (NICE!) one of these children aborted life and called him ............. MILO !!!!! <br /> <br /> Apart from all the bad acting, terrible direction, annoying the sound of Milo's voice and the piercing sound of the bell ear on his bicycle, if you take away all that evil it is still a bad but funny attempt of a film. <br /> <br /> I will give you 1 in 10 bankruptcy
