In the 1930s, Hal Roach Studios was at the top of the comedy world with stars like Laurel and Hardy, Charley Chase and the Little Rascals. Most of these films are exceptional and have stood the test of time. However, a lesser-known product of Roach was the pairing of Thelma Todd and Zasu Pitts (later, Todd was paired with Patsy Kelly, equally unpretentious). Try how I could, I can't stand these images - they just aren't funny. Also, unlike Laurel and Hardy, there wasn't an ounce of chemistry between Todd and his two co-stars. Before you think I'm an idiot, I understand that I've seen and reviewed several hundred Roach films and many other early comedies, so I know the genre well and within the genre, this team is among the worst. Part of the reason I think I'm right about the team is that as a team below Roach, they received all the scripts that nobody wanted. If Stan or Ollie hated a certain plot idea, it was often given to Todd and Pitts / Kelly - and it was usually shown. <br /> <br /> In this film, however, the team is at an absolute minimum. It is hard to imagine a comedy with less laughter and a more elaborate plot. The film begins with Zasu in the jury and Thelma as a defense lawyer. As for Zasu, he is a completely boring moron. NOT the kind idiotic (like Stan Laurel or Lou Costello), but just a totally irritating and irritating person who is intrusive and hateful. As for Thelma, as usual, she is a rather bland "heterosexual man" and as such has little to do except react to Zasu's rude behavior. <br /> <br /> The plot involves Thelma in defending a client who is accused of selling by exploding diet pills. Considering that the pills are very dangerous, when the lawyer asks Zasu to try to swallow one it just looks stupid. And, while they were called "pills", they were more like giant black blobs that were bigger than golf balls. Swallowing them seemed only artificial and meaningless - even for a low-key comedy. When they find that he has swallowed the pill and it is really explosive, everyone panics and they go wild like idiots until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> As I said, I'm not a fan of this team. However, even for those who want to enjoy the film, there is no legitimate laugh in the whole short! When I talked about this review with my wife (who also saw the film with me), she thought my score of 2 was too generous !!
