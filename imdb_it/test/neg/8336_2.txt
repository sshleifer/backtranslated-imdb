A horrible mixture of predictable story lines and PC clich√©s delivered poorly and poorly (nauseam, breeds working together, the heroine who is smart and pretty, a man who sacrifices himself to save another life, a relationship father / daughter etc. etc.). The film looks like something created for network television and probably would have stayed there. Even the talented Tommy Lee Jones can't save this BOMB. I urge you not to waste money or time in this cinematic ruin from the moment that disaster films roamed Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The two stars are given only to the people of the CGI and to the ability of the PR peoples to get even a single spectator to sit through it.
