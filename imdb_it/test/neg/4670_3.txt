I remember thinking that because of the cast, the subject and the director, I would have loved this movie. <br /> <br /> Entering the theater and taking place, I was like a light-hearted little girl, anticipation for the constructed opening scene. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed by the opening and felt that I really would have loved this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie and feel that anything that gives the scenes could be seen as a spoiler, please stop reading. I'm not going to give anything really important, but it could be seen as such, so this is the warning. <br /> <br /> Spoiler could be included below, attention. <br /> <br /> I think the first scene that really struck me as absolutely absolutely ridiculous was the scene of the Russian space station. I mean honestly, refueling with a shuttle without real warning, and then simply showing the station so fragile that a simple little mistake can blow up the whole thing. <br /> <br /> While all this is possible, it seemed really exaggerated. I'm not sure if it was just the situation or if it was the acting of cheese, the stupid vision of Russian technology, or just the campy attitude of the scene itself. <br /> <br /> It only got worse after this, we endure what seem like 2 hours of constant high-intensity explosions in space ... you know, that place where there's no sound because it's a vacuum. <br /> <br /> But the coup de grace for me, honestly, was the gun scene. (possibility of spoiler) - Earlier in the movie, we see Bruce Willis destroying their land vehicle (the vehicle they will use to get around when they get there and to help them drill) when they are told that this is what they'll be using He is picking up pieces and complaining that much of what is on it is heavy and not required for what they are doing. <br /> <br /> So, while we are wandering the asteroids, we see that they have decided to add a huge gatling like a gun to the vehicles ... you know, the standard rate of NASA is to have heavy weapons on all missions spatial in the case, you know, aliens or something. <br /> <br /> I could have taken the 2 hour explosive, the stupid gas supply scene of the Russian space station, the shoddy love scene towards the end, the Bruce Willis character is nothing but most of his other characters from the past, but Steve Buscemi goes crazy and shoots the spacecraft gun all over the place and causing chaos / damage, well this threw the whole thing over the top for me. <br /> <br /> Save time and money and avoid this movie. If you want a good meteor movie, see Deep Impact, if you want a fun space movie with fantastic special effects, see Space Cowboys, but no matter what, avoid this movie.
