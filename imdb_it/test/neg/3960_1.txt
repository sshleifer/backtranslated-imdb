This adorable dog (called various names during the film) is apparently loved by the whole city ... but it is alone. He is a friend of two children (Cindy and Paul played amazingly) but their father won't let him have a dog. Then Benji meets Tiffany - ANOTHER lovely dog. They (instantly) fall in love and lead to a hysterical montage between the two having fun in the grass, drinking from a fountain ... in slow motion no less! Benji also lives in the cleanest abandoned house I've ever seen. Then the two children are kidnapped by the most inept and senseless kidnappers I have ever seen and - you wouldn't know - they hide the brats in the exact house where Benji lives! <br /> <br /> WOW it was so bad! A great success (for some reason) in 1974 which led to many sequels (which I will NOT see). The film is played in a terrible way with "humor" so little fun and battered that just watching TV in amazement. The film also has a song that is played NONSTOP during the movie - so much you want to scream. He was inexplicably nominated for the best Oscar song - he didn't win. Yes - dogs are adorable and much better than human actors - but I need more than nice dogs to get me interested. <br /> <br /> You might think I'm a little tough on a children's movie but I've seen it with my 5-year-old nephew. In 20 minutes he was bored and practically stopped looking. I kept looking in the hope that it would improve, not so. Really bad - but VERY patient children or dog lovers might like it. <br /> <br /> Note to parents: it's G rated but a dog is brutally kicked a few times. You don't see it, you feel it and the dog survives, but this could disturb the real children.
