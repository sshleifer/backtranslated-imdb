Zoey 101 is basically about a girl named Zoey who moves all the boys into a boarding school during the first year they integrate the girls into it. This raw line is, I admit, a good idea. Although this show was meant for children, a five-year-old could probably indicate his fatal flaws. First, Zoey is a clich√© character, her being super popular, super attractive, super smart, and there, there's nothing wrong with her; no girl is like that. It seems that the show has turned the spotlight on Jamie Lynn Spears and increased his fame. Dana, who appeared at the beginning of the first season, is simply trivial. However, in my opinion, she was probably the most realistic character of all of them, which is sad since Dana is never pretty. Nicole is too lively and behaves like a complete empty head, but mysteriously takes A straight. Lola seems to be able to fool anything with her acting skills for Emmy. Quinn should be super smart, and even if he is able to create the most unrealistic things, he is also made to be weird, and he never gets any guys, although he is both beautiful and smart, while Zoey, Lola and Nicole take boys and are all beautiful and without personality. Chase and Michael are very similar and sometimes confuse them. Logan is unrealistically rich and distributes millions of dollars as if they were dollars. No one is so rich. I also noticed that every character on the show is bad for that girl from Stacy, who does nothing but behave well with them. It's not funny! This is mean and influences young girls to behave in a petty way with totally nice people. Finally, the school adds the icing to the unreal cake providing students with 5-star services such as a panoramic position, a sushi bar, a hot room equipped with vending machines for drinks, swimming pool and jacuzzi, cinema and indemnity for boys and girls to go freely in the dorm rooms of the opposite sex. In most colleges, if a boy were to enter a girl's dorm or vice versa, he would be expelled. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Zoey 101 was poorly written and would have had to spend a few more years drafting the processes.
