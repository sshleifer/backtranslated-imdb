I am admired by the number of people who consider this film as decent ... much less beautiful! Do most people even have basic standards for a movie they watch? I do not know anymore. <br /> <br /> This "commercial film product" does not really deserve the respect of being called a film. Calling Dean Cain's talent is a grave injustice to anyone who is really talented. I had a lot of respect for Lori Petty but most of it went straight down the tubes. At least his role was extremely small. Perhaps he had an account that he desperately needed to get paid. <br /> <br /> The ignorance I saw while watching "Firetrap" was surprising. Let me start by taking off this chest: if you can't realistically show fire, don't show it at all. All right?!! It's embarrassing for everyone involved when you show blade effects that don't even come close to simulating a burning building. <br /> <br /> Some curiosities: 1. A janitor opens the doors to a large wardrobe and finds the whole room swallowed by the flames. What does he do? Try to put out the fire with his broom! 2. The same janitor (who knows that the building is on fire) runs into a door marked with "DANGEROUS MATERIALS". His brilliant mind tells him it would be a good idea to open the door. Big mistake! 3. A woman is giving a generous donation of $ 100,000 to a greyhound rescue fund but ... wearing a fur coat for the charity event they are holding! (Do people who care about animals don't care about this kind of thing?) 4. Many of the people in the film are forced to climb into a kind of vault with massive steel walls that even an electromagnetic pulse (!!) could not t penetrate. Yet they have a spacious air intake that leads directly to the back of the thing that anyone could crawl through. This certainly sounds like a security mistake. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I got tired of thinking about this lame movie. Our "hero" for whom we should support is a career criminal who tries to kill some police officers. What a beautiful guy! If the general public wants to waste their minds on this madness, then more power to them. I just hope I erased it from my memory. 1/10
