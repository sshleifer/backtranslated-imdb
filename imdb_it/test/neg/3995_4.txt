Italian horror master Dario Argento is called a lot of bad things by non-fans. And it absolutely deserves none of the repercussions. In fact, every time I hear something negative about Argento, I think they're really talking about Michele Soavi. He simply does not get the same attention because his films have never had success in theaters. In fact, his best film - The Graveyard Man of 1994 - was probably his least successful. Or simply did not get the attention he felt he deserved, because later, he left the film and went to direct television. He never came back. So people don't know how inferior their other films are, because when they saw them, they are already fans of the aesthetics of Italian horror. Which means you have to accept the fact that they make almost zero sense and are usually very unattractive movies. This is where the Church stands out from the group. Because visually, it's so cheap and old looking, you can smell the dust. But it also has its charm, even if they are few. The work with the camera is truly amazing and the soundtrack is enormously elaborate and grandiose. <br /> <br /> Because Silver is the reason why people have seen all of Soavi's work, I don't know anyone who captured The Church before the Suspiria of Silver and Deep Red. Soavi is a bit of a hack. A bit like an Italian Mick Garris, the greatest example of a director who prefers style to substance. The faults of the Church are constant and abundant. The film opens with a somewhat interesting prologue that shows knights on white horses pouring into a peasant village similar to those seen in any adaptation of Robin Hood, a few centuries ago. These scenes are quite intense, energetic and quickly get to the point. Then we limit ourselves to the present, where the style of the film takes over. Yes, the film is fine to watch. And for about 35 minutes in the present, in 1980, everywhere, in Italy, the film is interesting enough to take us to the elements of horror that slowly reveal themselves. So now we know that the purpose of the film is the accumulation of his horror. And it's a fair amount of storage, for the most part. But as the film approaches halfway, we realize that the film is passing, and ... nothing is happening. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple. I think. Two people working in a church, one as a catalyst for books and the other as a restorer of the works of art of the building's wall, discover a parchment / writing that man thinks will lead to a sort of buried or priceless treasure artifact that can sell and get rich of. So he follows his 'map' only to discover a force under the church that hallucinated him, while he is slowly becoming a demon that will make all the others hallucinated. So while he is doing his demonic work, someone who has passed the force kills himself in a way that traps everyone in the church while the "contagion" of the demon spreads over everyone, leaving a black preacher and the little girl who slips out of the church every evening to go to the disco like the only 2 people who can prevent the plague from spreading beyond the walls of the church. This probably seems full of action and Soavi's style is much more lethargic than Argento. But never before have I seen an attempt at a surrealist film this boring pain. I'm not kidding. Absolutely nothing happens in the whole movie! I've seen expressionist films (or impressionists, they're not high school films) before, but many of them actually show things that happen (John Carpenter's Halloween for one). <br /> <br /> Follows quite closely in the footsteps of the demon films of Lamberto Bava (since he co-produced Argento). We are shown a place where a group of people gathers, turns into a demon, all the others are isolated, that person infects all but a couple of survivors, then the demons either come out infecting the world, or the survivors get out when the demons die. This film puts all those same elements in place. Except that, unlike the work of Argento, nothing happens. Ok, some things happen. But only a bizarre sequence has the sparkle of the much more entertaining Demon films than Lamberto. A casual woman's neck is impaled by a demon using a fence section that tears off the floor. What's strange about this, you ask yourself? It happens in front of about two dozen people. What are they doing? Anything. She dies, her head drips blood into the foreground. But all those people do not notice it, even if it happens in plain sight and not less than 8 meters from them. Perhaps 4 people notice that the demon is running to stab anyone he can as he runs towards her, so they hide. She is killed and in the shot after her death, everyone is simply sitting in silence while a boy plays a saxophone. I'm not kidding. This is what happens. This is more than logically inconsistent - it's simply stupid. <br /> <br /> The scene suggests that the woman disappears and no one has seen her die. Everyone just forgets about it. And this 15 second thing is absolutely the only event that takes place in the film. I'm not saying it's the only violence, blood or murder we see. It is not. It's just the only thing we can say is happening. For example, in a scene a beautiful woman sees herself in a mirror that looks old and ugly. He begins to scratch the skin from his face, but when he reappears a few minutes later, no scratches. People are devoured by fish and their faces are crushed by subway cars. But later they present themselves as completely free members of a demon worship, in a scene that commits the supreme horror heresy - by copying a famous scene from Roman Polanski's 1968 masterpiece, Rosemary's Baby, the largest horror film ever made , shot per shot. Even if Argento did it, I would be furious!
