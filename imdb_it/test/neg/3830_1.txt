I was invited to a first screening of the film about four months before it was published. I had to watch the movie and then fill a package about my thoughts. It was the hardest thing to sit on the earth. The show has just crept in and you quickly start wishing you were dead. The fact is that there are two types of Mormon films. The good with the good stories and the lousy ones that simply stink. Saints and Soldiers, now there's a good movie. But with these plays, writers and actors try too hard. Basically, they try to be funny when they are not. No wonder why there is such a small audience for these films; they are full of 'jokes inside' that are not fun to start with, and they just try to draw attention to normal things. It is the story that makes the film, and the stories of these films are only weak. I bet you can guess my package when I was told to fill it after the movie. ;)
