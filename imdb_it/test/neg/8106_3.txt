The jumble of MGM by Jimmy Durante organized a big party for everyone in Hollywood. There are no more big stars - we get Three Stooges, Laurel & Hardy, Durante and Lupe Velez. I didn't recognize anyone else - they were probably unknown (for good reason). The film contains annoyingly little funny jokes and some really terrible songs and choreography. The only things that save this from total disaster are the "battle" of Laurel & Hardy with Lupe Velez and a wonderful Disney-colored cartoon called "The Hot Chocolate Soldier". It's a beautiful and very colorful comic strip that gives the film a huge boost. Otherwise, the film is a colossal boredom. There is no accredited director - what does it tell you?
