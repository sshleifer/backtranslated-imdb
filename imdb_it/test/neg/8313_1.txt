What a huge pile of smelly bombs! Ye Gods from which to start also with this .. <br /> <br /> Well, mix the shit that acts (including a bloody exasperating woman who talks as if it is a) chew painfully on some ice cubes or b) has just woken up after undergoing extensive root canal surgery), the montage would seem to donate that the celluloid was cut and spliced ​​through the use of an angle grinder, some "actions" of martial arts really irreparably choreographed, a script that was apparently written by a two-year-old child and some of the most horrible and intrusively noisy background music ever committed in each film and hey Soon you have Death Machines aka The Ninja Murders (though you notice that surprise, surprise ?? there are actually no real ninja from any part to be found in this fucking disguise!) <br /> <br /> Simply put, if ever there was a cinematic equivalent of a particularly vehement attack of dysentery, then this must surely be! Avoid at all costs!
