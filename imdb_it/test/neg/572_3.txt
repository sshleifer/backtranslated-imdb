A film about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town to its ear should be fun, romantic and casual. Instead this film speaks more than things unsaid and unexpressed, so it gets to the point where you are grateful for all that is said, even if the dialogue is not exactly quotable. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - <br /> <br /> When the relationship that says the most is the least viewed on screen (Danner and McEwan), you know you're in trouble. But those two actresses are a very welcome vision in a film that screams for sincere people. <br /> <br /> FINE SPOILER <br /> <br /> Capshaw has the task of creating a character not long ago and she doesn't have all the success. As I said above, the theme seems to be repression and I understand that it is an element of life and love, but I don't even want to see a movie, at least not this one. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend it at all, despite the talent cast that was left to itself.
