Ok, maybe the acting was not bad, but I'm writing this review as a public service to prevent anyone else from happening to the intriguing beginning of this show to throw away two hours of their lives waiting for a development of the plot that will never be to come. The chief investigator has an instinctive feeling that has eliminated the missing marine officer (Guy), and a few people other than the uninvolved spectators and the accused seem to dispute it. So what's the point of being with this drama? It makes me lose my mind. I kept thinking (or hoping) that there would be some sort of twist or new revelation, but no one was imminent. In summary, I can't think of a single reason to sit down and watch this nonsensical TV movie based on a true story or not.
