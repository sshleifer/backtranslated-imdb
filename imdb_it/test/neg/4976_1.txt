Unforgiven is the last tribute of Clint Eastwoods to the great west. But while I thought this would be good and raise the bar for future Westerners to come, I was sadly wrong. Ruthless, though simple in plot, he falls flat on characters and emotions and I would say without doubt that Unforgiven is Eastwood's worst film to date. Eastwoods himself seems too old to play the part of acting and directing, which also adds to the overall look of the film. <br /> <br /> All the characters seem hurried and jagged along the edges, in particular the character of Eastwoods. The acting does not seem to flow and contributes to what the characters experience. The management is poorly misled by bizarre shots. So, in general, Unforgiven is not the best of Eastwood and by far one of the worst westerns around.
