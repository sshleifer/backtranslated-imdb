The lines in the title of this review are the first lines of the theme song of this film, a wonderfully demented parody of the song (in my opinion horrible) "My things favorite" by "The Sound of Music". And this little funny detail is not the only aspect that makes "The Body Shop" alias. "Doctor Gore" (1973) recommendable to my Gore / Trash friends. The film, which was created almost entirely by J.G. Patterson Jr., who worked as a producer, writer, director and star as the namesake Dr. Gore, is crap, no doubt, but it's also beyond doubt that it's funny, and that everyone involved, probably Patterson in particularly, they were aware that they weren't exactly making a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dr. Brandon (Patterson), a famous but totally crazy plastic surgeon, loses his beloved wife Anitra, a model, in an accident. Together with his hunchback assistant Greg (Roy Mehaffey), he immediately kidnaps beautiful young women to build a new, perfect wife from the body parts ... <br /> <br /> "Dr. Gore" is undoubtedly a film by "so bad is a good guy", but it also has qualities beyond the usual ridiculous trashiness. Crazy science has always been one of my absolute favorite horror topics and, in fact, it is also one of the most interesting topics for Gore Trash's ridiculous films. Obviously filmed with a minimal budget, "Doctor Gore" pays homage to the "Frankenstein" films, in particular James Whale's masterpiece "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935), and resembles the appearance of the first Troma / Herschell Gordon Lewis films Gore as "Blood Feast" (1963) - only this seems much cheaper and lousy. Obviously J.G. Patterson's motive was not simply to make a funny movie: he was a rather ugly and bizarre guy, his role as Dr. Brandon gave Patterson the opportunity to distinguish a couple of hot, poorly dressed young women (who later they would end up as body-body donors in Dr. Brandon's lab. <br /> <br /> Most of the blood is actually pretty well done with regard to the tiny budget of course. The dialogue includes some extremely hilarious jokes ("Take it this could be the door ... and put a coat on so they don't see you're a hunchback "). In addition to the aforementioned acronym," Doctor Gore "also includes the appearance of a country band called" Bill Hicks and the Rainbows ", my new favorite band, NOT. For the rest of the film, I kept wondering if Bill Hicks and Roy Mehaffey, who plays the assistant hunchback, are twins or even the same person - the two look exactly the same, and having d Two obese boys with unidentified red beards, looking at this strange in a film would be a huge coincidence. Different from J.G. Patterson, most cast members have never made any other films. This is the first movie I saw on some of Patterson. Unfortunately, the man died of cancer in 1975. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Doctor Gore" is a film that certainly is not for everyone. Actually, it's total crap. But it's also fun and recommendable for my fellow fans of oddities and cheap camper stuff. The dictionaries should show a screenshot of this movie under "trash flick".
