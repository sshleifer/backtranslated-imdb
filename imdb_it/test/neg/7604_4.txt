This was a real disappointment for me. The original Bride with White Hair is a great kung fu fantasy movie, but this one was pretty weak. I didn't care about the new characters that unfortunately dominated the time on the screen and the story was not well developed. While the first film was tragic and involving this was boring (as I only counted the time until the end when the unlucky lovers would actually meet). The action was poor even in this. The fights were not very well choreographed and there wasn't really much kung-fu. Only a few weak fights with the sword between the extremely unpleasant He and one of Lin's minions. Lin herself mainly uses a kind of telekinesis to throw people into the walls and sometimes her hair, far from the impressive display with the whip and kung-fu shown in the previous film. However, I gave this film a 4 because at least it was fast and I wanted to see what would happen in the end, even though I (like most of the others who watched the first one) had predicted that it would go down as it did and after seeing it, I found it anti-climatic and wished they had done an appropriate follow-up or left the story alone. I highly recommend the first one, but with regards to the sequel only fans of the genre and those who really want to see Lin as the bride once again needs to apply.
