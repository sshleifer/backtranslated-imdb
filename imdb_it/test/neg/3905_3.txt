The hypothetical situations abound, the director of the past Harry Ralston offers us the maximum post-apocalyptic view with the dead world, left in the streets, in the shops and in the whole landscape, in the middle of a forgotten desert. A lone survivor, trying to rekindle his sanity, brings food from the city to his bungalow in this desert. All alone, hoping for something more, but with no one around, he was left with white underwear and a passion for a local Indian tribe ?? until the discovery of a camera that opens new doors and breaks the barriers of human coexistence. Alan, a man from the book, is left on Earth after an unknown disaster. Thinking of being alone, do you start living life your way ?? until, Jeri Ryan, appears (as if in any dream) out of the woods, disheveled and unhappy to find the last living man to be ... well ... like Alan. However, they try to coexist, fail, get drunk and before creating the last dystopia, they come across Redneck Raphael (played by newcomer Dan Montgomery Jr). The bonds are torn apart, the confusion begins, a couple becomes a third wheel and the battle between physically inept nerd and mindless jock. Even with no one left on the planet, it becomes a truth that even the darkest human nature will arise. <br /> <br /> Using a variable film technique, Ralston offers us a mediocre story based freely on another film called "The Quiet Earth" (which I will soon see) strangely to which he never gives credit. With a borrowed story, I imagine he does a decent job of reinterpreting it. His fist seems to be missing at first, while Ralston tries to find the right way, still borrowing from the techniques of other directors to try to find his own. It opens the film quite interesting, but does not respond to any direct answer. Of course, the last few days have arrived, but there may be a concise answer to "how" or, better yet, "why" these few selected survivors. A more ghostly start would have led us stronger in a comic film. The juxtaposition would have been like "Shawn of the Dead", but it left us with the feeling that we were watching a "made-for-TV" program. Listening to the audio commentary, I have respect for Ralston because he worked diligently to make this film, and his passion almost sells the film, but from his interaction with the cast it was clear he wasn't so happy with his overall Product ending. There were mistakes, those he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out. While this makes independent film production decent, it sometimes seems cheap, and in Ralston's case, it was the latter. <br /> <br /> I must admit that the portrait of Alan Arlington attracted me. He played that role as a wimpy, scholastic and adult nerd very well. It was fun both to watch and to listen, and so became sympathetic to the viewer. He was a key actor in holding the film together, unfortunately, I can't say the same for the rest. This was Dan Montgomery's first film, and was it obvious ?? I mean ?? really very obvious. There were scenes where I thought the cue paper was going to come out and read the lines for him, maybe even giving us a more realistic performance, but alas, that wasn't the case. Then there was Jeri Ryan. He attracted his character towards the end of the film, which for me was the culmination of the entire work of art. Go from stranger stranger to mad girl irritable and bitter at the end. Confused? Once again, she fell into her character at the end, giving us just a taste of what she could probably do while her acting matured. As the comment progressed, all that contributed was a laugh, a chuckle, or a "ohhh, look at that color" moment. While his beauty could sell tickets, one might want to consider knowledge as beautiful. This was his first film, so can I be too hard? <br /> <br /> Overall, this film seemed to be missing something. I thought the idea was strong ?? the premise that, even with only a collapse of people who remain on Earth, the evil of human nature still exists. Jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs (perhaps because it is consumed by zinc?) And we as a race always want what we cannot have. Ralston is not a surprising director, his techniques are imperfect and pre-used, but he knows how to make a low-budget comedy. I think our idea of ​​"fun" is different, so that's why I couldn't find myself laughing at many of the pieces he found "hysterical". His actors provided the level of acting necessary for this film, which was below average. His film was loose, which means that there were elements never fully explained or addressed (for example, something with surviving wings?!?), Which generally damaged the intensity of the film. This was a comedy, but it could have been much darker and much more fun. For those who think that Roger Avery was a big part of this film, as we learned from their comments, was everything that was there money? the era in essence, the bank of "The Last Man". Don't hope for any classic Avery moment. <br /> <br /> Don't expect anything else from Ralston ?? and that's how I'll end up. <br /> <br /> Vote: ** on *****
