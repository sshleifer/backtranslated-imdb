It was terrible simple and simple. What was their message? Where did the movie go with this? It has all the ingredients of a lower grade B movie. From the plot without plot the bad acting to the creamy slow-mo cinematography. I'd rather see a movie I've already seen as Goodfellas, A Bronx Tale, even Grease. There are no nice characters. In the end you just want everyone to die already. Save 2 hours of your life and skip this.
