"The Capture of Bigfoot" by Bill Rebane is one of the most horrible horror movies ever made. An avid sawmill owner Harvey Olsen (Richard Kennedy) decides he wants to capture Bigfoot at all costs. However, the local game ranger Dave Garrett (Stafford Morgan) learns that Bigfoot used to live in peace upset by a geological expedition, and set out to protect the creature. There's nothing interesting in this piece of shit. The film is extremely boring and full of horrible songs and low-cost special effects. gore, without suspense - just a gigantic boredom. Avoid this horrible garbage like the plague.
