... BREAKER MORANT and ROMPER STOMPER. He also gave us watchable movies like BOOTMEN and THE ODD ANGRY SHOT. Unfortunately for all those involved in this debacle, THE WOG BOY will not join either list. <br /> <br /> I couldn't wait to see this movie simply because of the politically incorrect title, so politically incorrect that when it was broadcast on BBC 2 late at night the announcer didn't even mention the name of the film, so I was expecting something so profoundly offensive that my jaw was about to fall into disbelief. He fell incredulous, I found myself unable to believe that the financiers thought this would be a great international success <br /> <br /> The problem lies in the cast and script. I know that Australia, with its small population, does not have a large group of actors, so I will forgive for the most part, but this does not stop my criticism of Nick Giannopoulos as Steve. For this type of comedy at work you have to be struck by the comic abilities of the main character and I'm sorry to say it, but Nick G doesn't have the skills. I had never heard of him and I didn't see anything else he was, so maybe he's much better at other shows. Here, however, it is simply irritating, unconvincing and I have lost count of the number of times he has attacked the camera. The jokes are very flat and predictable and going back to the script seems very underdeveloped, I mean, who thought that a running gag on a female Minster of Work that was enjoying it in the back of a limousine was fun to begin with? You have the feeling that someone in the production should have been more honest and said "Look, friend, this script is not good enough. Go and make it thinner and more structured" <br /> <br /> I was hard and the hardness was request in this review. I gave the film four out of ten and I would have gotten only three if it hadn't been for the only really funny sequence in which Steve is watching a topical show only for himself that flashes on the screen and has labeled a "Dole blodger" . This shows that the writers were aware of the comic times and of the social commentaries. It's a pity they didn't come with a much better written film
