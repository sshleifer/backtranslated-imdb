Oh, the horror, the unspeakable horror of this movie. If you can even call it a movie. It looks like a hastily crumpled first-year art school project. <br /> <br /> The "talents" here subject you to a painful mix of subtitles and overacting, and practically all the scenes were terribly invented and pretentious. <br /> <br /> The film in no way reflects the Malay culture or social conventions - nobody talks like that in those parts. I live in Malaysia, BTW. <br /> <br /> Spinning Gasing seems tailor-made to receive an award in the foreign film category of some Western film festivals. And unfortunately, that trick seems to have worked. Some reviewers may undoubtedly describe it as "exotic", but a more accurate word would be "atrocious". <br /> <br />
