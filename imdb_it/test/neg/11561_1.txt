Robot Holocaust is the meanest and most pathetic attempt to create a post-apocalyptic film I've ever seen. And I thought the Italians were the masters of the miserable Mad Max aspirants. Some of those films like Escape 2000 are definitely brilliant compared to this piece of poop. The plot is meaningless ?? even with a narrator who creates each scene. And the boy drags him. Scene after scene without any interest occurring. The special effects (and I use the word "special" freely) consist of stocking puppets. You are right ?? stocking puppets! The acting is abysmal. Angelika Jager is in the running for the worst performance I've ever seen. Sure, you're French or German or anything else ?? but man is bad. I can't think of one positive thing to say about the film. So I stop here because ten sentences on this garbage are about ten. <br /> <br /> However, and fortunately for me, I saw the MST3K version of Robot Holocaust. Some of the things that made the movie so bad helped make this MST3K episode a winner. For an episode of the first season, the riffs arrive fast and furious and hit their brand almost every time. On my MST3K rating scale, I give this episode 4/5 ?? look for it.
