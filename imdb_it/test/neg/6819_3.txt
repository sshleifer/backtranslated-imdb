certain that this film may have had its funny moments with the question sat people and I know that the film should not be totally credible, the film made it too outrageous for example a girl like that would never come out in a million years with a boy like that even the people in the movie have had lackluster shows in which acting was so bad. Even the bad plot could have a better job on the script and focus more on the comedy, even the comedy was a bit dry and it became very boring after the first few bars, it was as if the laughter was 10 minutes and the old ones when it will end up kick off The bottom line, if you want a little acting fervor mixed up with a stupid storyline and a love story go on and watch this movie.
