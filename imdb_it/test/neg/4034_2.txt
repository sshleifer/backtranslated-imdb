No film I've ever seen before has even come close to being boring and stupid like this piece of junk. And I've always been a big fan of the B movie. After seeing this piece of total shit, I can honestly say that this doesn't even come close to being a B-movie. <br /> <br /> No one in this film could act if his life depended on this film. The script is so stupid that I don't think I've ever heard anyone speak like that in my life. The writer should spend a few years studying real-life people to see just how they act and talk, even if they would not be able to make a watchable movie because it is so obvious that no one involved in this film has any talent in driving them at all. <br /> <br /> I could make a better movie with a digital camera and some monstrous toys. Also, forget the sexy scenes, the women with leather outfits are so grotesque, you would vomit before they were activated! <br /> <br /> Avoid this useless drivel unless you want to get bored of your mind!
