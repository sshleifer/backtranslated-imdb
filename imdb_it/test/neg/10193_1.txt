This film should have contained a disclaimer that was similar to the Left Behind series. I didn't know it was going to be a bible movie. I expected it to be a movie about UFOs and alien abductions for entertainment. As a previous commentator, it would be nice to show in a church, but not in a public theater, at least not without the consumer's prior knowledge of what the film's premise is. I felt cheated by my money spent on this film, since nothing in the summary refers to its religious tones. If you go to church, it will probably be shown there for free sometime. Apart from covering his real topic, the film was fine as far as acting and script were concerned. But I must say that I went out for an hour in the film when I saw in which direction it was headed and that I would not have entertained myself, but I would have preached.
