Gene Hackman is a former Marine Corps colonel who runs a handful of Vietnam veterinarians to return to Laos and rescue some Americans who have been listed as missing in action. Hackman suspects that, in fact, half a dozen MIAs are secretly detained in a remote camp by the Laotians to be tormented and to provide more hard work. Hackman is paid by the rich Robert Stack, whose son, like Hackman's son, is considered among the MIA. But the circumstances are such that Hackman can only buy old and obsolete weapons, even if he manages to gather the help of a fervent anticommunist Loatian and his two daughters along the way. <br /> <br /> I don't think the film was deliberately invented to support the myth of the Vietnames that still hold our MIAs for propaganda purposes. The myth was quite real. If anyone remembers, in 1982 and 1983 there were a lot of bumper stickers, YOU SHOULD MIA. I think, instead, that the film was made partly to cash the myth. It was absurd at first sight. Why should our former enemy refuse to return MIA? Propaganda? Where is the value of propaganda in something that is kept secret? To add the job offer? Do they need one hundred more workers in Vietnam and Laos? The reasons behind this film - with its triumphant music and its large number of bodies - were scurrilous. <br /> <br /> But what about the movie itself? Stripped of his theme of rescuing the mythically abused MIA, he is a routine paramilitary action, neither better nor worse than dozens of others that appeared in the 1980s. Gene Hackman's performance is the only one that manages to keep its head above water. It is almost always reliable. <br /> <br /> Of the others, being a formidable plot, derived from "The Dirty Dozen" among others, I kept trying to guess which of the gang would have sacrificed for the mission. Of the three Asian anti-communists, I thought one or more were dead meat. That's why Asian helpers appear in movies like this. (I was right twice out of three.) I also imagined that Patrick Swayzie was the former debut officer, the youngest in the group, who had never "earned the respect" of others because he had never seen the fight, he would have to go somehow heroic. Mistaken. Become a hero, true, but survive intact. I thought there was a fifty percent chance that Hackman would have to go too, but it's fine. The formula does not really stretch for originality. Charles Bronson's claustrophobic loophole from "The Great Escape" is here in the former rat tunnel of Fred Ward, a claustrophobic who is forced to crawl through a drainage tube with a snake inside, so he can do a reconnaissance on the prison camp of Laos. <br /> <br /> The title, "Uncommon Valor", is taken from a tribute that Admiral Nimitz made to the men of Iwo Jima - "An uncommon value was common that day". Nimitz was certainly right about this. That the men who fought in Vietnam were all equally valiant is far from the point. Anyone who has seen the fight or even approached, putting their lives at stake for the boys in the row next to them, was quite heroic. This film, and the way it exploits our bitterness for the Vietnam War, does not really make them justice.
