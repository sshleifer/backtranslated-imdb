This movie is about people living in a trailerpark. later in the film it becomes obvious that those people are comedians out of work, mainly old males. Well, more or less they sit around the whole movie and talk about fucking. but there is never action, only those people who speak. at first I thought it was perverted stuff, but after a while it became boring. I mean, how many versions can you think of saying f *** ing, d ** k & c ** t? for sure, this can be fun - for half an hour maybe, not 80 minutes. but it was fun to see those people trying to act. I'm pretty sure they were often reading their text on some paper during playback. but it doesn't disturb the film, it's beautiful like this. because those individuals seem so poor, fucking, they crushed a bone that the style fits perfectly. their reading in wood and defenseless of the texts creates a quite good atmosphere, I fell in love a little with the characters. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD *** later in the film the f *** ers make some comedies (rhymes on f *** ing) with themselves as an audience and imagined applause. then you get an eviction council and so they decide to defend the trailer park and get into their roofs - armed with some weapons. then they shot. fin. it looks like action, but it's not. just take a home camera. *** SPOILER END *** <br /> <br /> but the film is totally consistent with his style and I'm pretty sure it's exactly what the director wanted. it is the portrait of those f ** k-ups in a home-machine-style fogged with characters that can't act but seem interesting personalities, so they are kind to look at. but the lyrics speak - you know what - all the time gets boring after a while. <br /> <br /> handsome young director who also looks like an interesting person, since he has acted in some films for boys / TV series but now I have entered other horror films that I think is more his cup of tea. and this, his first management effort will be distributed by Troma now. I don't know anything about a release, I took this as an "advanced screener" from this year cannes which says "for bootleg purposes only".
