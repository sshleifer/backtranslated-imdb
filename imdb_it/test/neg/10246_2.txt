I still have to look at STARCRASH (1979) - notoriously a mess of the Italian on STAR WARS (1977) - but it can't be much worse than this unjustified piece of junk that, suffice to say, makes Mel Brooks so-so SPACEBALLS (1987) seems like a real and own work of art! In fact, the main reason why GALAXINA is remembered today is because of the tragic fate that struck its protagonist - Playboy midfielder Dorothy Stratten who was killed by her crazy jealous foreign husband - before the film had his first officer! <br /> <br /> Although Statten (who later produced two biographical films about her in which she was played by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays the lead role, for the first half of the film she is reduced to being supported on a chair that apparently leads a spaceship on a 27-year journey on a planet or other; in fact, Galaxina is an android for all uses that also serves the extravagant troupe of their snacks, makes them all warm under the collar and even goes scouting for the Blue Star (choral music cue) once they land! That said, Statten certainly looks bright in his white suit and, although his role hardly requires much effort than any acting talent he could possess, it is not exactly humiliating. <br /> <br /> Yet, it is ironic that for a film that bears his name, it is overshadowed by the campy and the aspiring antics of his fellow crew members, especially the annoying Captain Cornelius Butt (who you gives an idea of ​​the level of the comedy on show here), a long-haired boy with colored wings, a smoker, citing the old Chinese and, above all (relatively speaking) a hairy alien creature, a rock eater, alien holding prisoner. The villain of the piece is a non-metal-clad entity that, however, has the best laugh in the film when, after listening to the choral music that follows his every mention of the Blue Star, he exclaims: "What's this? T?" It makes little sense to list the classics of science fiction that are tainted by this stinker in its ridiculous attempts at such spoofing, since they are not only lame but obvious; Incredibly enough, an alien that breaks his chest but is eventually benevolent is apparently played by diminutive Hollywood veteran Angelo Rossitto! <br /> <br /> For what it's worth, then, the scenes shot on the planet they visit (which looks more like a western set of a planetary landscape) have a yellowish shade, similar to the sun and its inhabitants are human gourmets '(delicacies in their menu include Skin and Tonic, Scotsman on the Rocks, pie thighs, baked Alaskan, etc.) mentions a band of bikers who serve their particular deity (the Harley Davidson) and when our heroes flee to the back, they dare not shoot them for fear of hitting their "Lord". God (terrible) really ...
