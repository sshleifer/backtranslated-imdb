Not like I was expecting a lot, but at least I was hoping for a funny and big movie. This is not even that. This element is in the lower half of all the vampire movies I've ever seen (and trust me, I've seen a lot of them). Poor acting, characterization to zero, plot from little to nothing, almost non-existent (and that is there, you can drive semitrailers through holes). Of course, it has action and is noisy, and has more action, and more noise, blood and action ... These things alone do not make a good film (or even half decent). It makes me understand how some people can say that this is the best vampire movie ever made - all I can imagine is that they haven't seen many. I suggest seeing Near Dark instead.
