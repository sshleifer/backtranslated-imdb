In reality there was nothing funny about this monstrosity !! This film was a complete abomination. The absurdities in this film almost made me want to throw up !! I think the people responsible for this movie took advantage of their viewing audience. They did a relatively decent series of movies (I said decent, NOT GOOD !!) and I completely destroyed it trying to put money in their pockets. The realization of Airplane! it was a way for Hollywood to fix this shitty movie. The worst thing is that no one in 1979 made the film's Asinine events (like the Concorde door popped up by some unholy altitude or Patrons who shoots a flair gun from the Mach 2 window to avoid a NUCLEAR WAR WAR!?!?!? .... what were they thinking ???) they were totally unrealistic or just didn't care! I think it's the last of the two. The writers and the director of this "movie", if you want to call it that, have really tried to suck the airport dynasty with this shit!
