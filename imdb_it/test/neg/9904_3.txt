What is this!! it's so ugly. The animation looks so terrible, it looks like a ps1 game. The actors are horrible, they can't act to save their lives. I sat through this whole movie and finally got annoyed when I realized I had wasted 3 hours of my life. I have never heard of this film, has it ever been released at the cinema or gone straight to the DVD? A girl has been hit? What happened was just a stupid movie. They totally copied "The Day After Tomorrow". It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I strongly advise people not to waste their time with this. You could spend your time watching "The Day After Tomorrow", it's much better. Well, this is what I think of the movie. Actually, because I wasted my time writing it, ah dam! It's really annoying, 3 hours and 10 minutes is wasted now.
