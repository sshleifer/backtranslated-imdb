Perhaps if you've never read any English literature or if you've never seen the Hollywood version of any book, you could find the credit in this horrible movie. He has the Shoreditch directing and screenplay skill. The BBC adaptation of 1995 is both very pleasant and close to the book and captures the atmosphere between Elisabeth and Darcy very well. <br /> <br /> The characters in this production are discontented, Sutherland as Bennet looks like a real buffoon. In the same way Bingley acts as a fool and it is incomprehensible that he is my friend of Darcy. I can't imagine how Judi Dench could have accepted the role, perhaps he thought it was a surreal version of the play. <br /> <br /> Quotations from the book are thrown out of context. Huge pieces are missing, the important episode with Wickham has been over. <br /> <br /> Mr. Collins is still very good and dominates the other cast members. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is that we didn't pay to see it. Wait for the DVD and use it to prevent a table from moving.
