** May contain horrible ** spoilers. Simply horrible. I loved the Stephen King novel, and this is just a horrible adaptation of this. The end changes. They change the plot. They changed the character of Alan Pangborne from a grieving husband to a happy boyfriend. If you are a fan of the Stephen King novel, stay away. Even if you're not, stay away. <br /> <br /> The book was incredibly dark, even for Steve King. An eleven year old kills himself in the novel. A principal of the middle school is found with child pornography in the novel. It's not even close to the novel. <br /> <br /> This film is my favorite movie of all time. I hate this movie with a vengeance.
