I'm the kind of person who can enjoy a good B movie if it has some ransom value, but Dead Space has nothing to redeem! This is the kind of film that will make you frustrated, restless and sick to the stomach. <br /> <br /> Bad acting. Limping history terrible effects. Horrible and heartbreaking dialogue. Dead Space has it all!
