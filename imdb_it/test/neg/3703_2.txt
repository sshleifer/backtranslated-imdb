If it were not for the modification of cursed words and an overlapping blur when one character takes another, it would be easy to confuse this low-cost snoozer for a Sci-Fi channel pilot. The plot of the government's attempts to destroy a group of telekinetic drugs it had originally trained as military weapons ends ambiguously with the gifted hero, in search of a telekinetic survivor determined to take revenge. Alas, the film is talky, boring, predictable and even without interesting special effects. Louis Gossett, Jr. has a secondary role as the evil government bureaucrat who originated the program and now wants to eliminate all traces. He walks through the part and it's hard to see why he took the trouble. Other cast members do a decent job with a script that requires little.
