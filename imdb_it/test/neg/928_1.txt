A horrible, horrible, horrible film. I saw the original when I was a child and gave me nightmares in my teenage years. When I found out that a remake was in progress, I complained. WHY OH WHY make a good movie again? Well, we can thank Dark Castle for annoying yet another classic horror movie. This time they replaced a somewhat interesting story with cold blood, slower than a slow rhythm and characters inspired by the yawn. Someone previously said he was surprised that Paris Hilton could act. Uh, were you watching the movie? A vagabond vaguely sounds. Sounds like typecasting to me. Half the people in the audience actually HURT when she died! This tells you why people see this movie. If this is your only reason, then find a better one, because like a black hole this thing will suck more of your life than you want. If I had been alone, I would have left 10 minutes in the boring exhibit. This thing is like driving a moron to make movies: in the south of git, stupid but attractive clues, knives in abundance, a lot of people, a threatening truck, I could go on. After watching this movie, I really started to like Jeepers Creepers, and I thought the film was crap. Save yourself and avoid this crapfest at any cost.
