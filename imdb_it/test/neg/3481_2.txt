This film is highly unlikely. Read the other reviews to see why. <br /> <br /> I would say that most of the characters were plastic, but they didn't even give themselves that little luxury; they act like cardboard cutouts. Obviously, they had to be real surfers for the surf contest roles, so it's a good shit if they can act. At least Occy didn't give a shit and left. But "Lance" ??? Fuhgeddaboutit. <br /> <br /> The only character who played the truth was played by Gerry Lopez who didn't really act, he was more or less himself. He is used to trampling people. :-) The only reason I gave this movie to 2 instead of 1 was because I was writing a newsletter on my laptop when it arrived on a cable channel late one night. This spared me from having to pay all my attention to this foolish fool. In no way would I want to go out of my way to look at it.
