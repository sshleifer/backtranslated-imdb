I must say that this film was not what I expected. Even if I haven't read the book, the fact that the plants can come out and then wait for a murder to occur just to make them drag a corpse at lunch is the worst scenario anyone ever invented. With the ruins of the title, you would think that in 3000 years such a deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit. This is like another primordial film in which one might think it was something strange that villagers fear most, but not a crocodile. In both cases this film was like this, it makes you think of the ruins of Maya or Inca folklore leading to awakening and the old god, or people have another agenda for sacrifice or something. But plants? .... come on, is there nothing else that producers can invent to amaze a crowd? As for this film, it will hit the "b" list in no time. I have to say that some of the gores were excellent to see, but they didn't make up for the rest of the film. And a plant that mimics the sound of a cell phone or people's voices is simply too much to be believed. I'm a fan of horror movies, but I'm not a stereotyped fan that relies only on mechanical or gore effects. I rely on great suspense and what will happen to the next scene to get more suspense. It had a better plot than this. Even the ring blew me up more, but the ruins are just ... ruined for using a plant to convince the victims to kill or be killed by the villagers. The premise was fine for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple torch and a sack of napalm can easily do the trick to end those pesky plants with a meat disorder.
