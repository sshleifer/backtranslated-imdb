I just watched this movie on TNT and let me tell you, this movie was definitely trivial and cheeky. But after a certain point, I started laughing at my socks and to tell you the truth, they should classify this film as a comedy rather than an action / adventure. The most exhilarating scene comes when Delon and Kennedy make 360 ​​loop loops to avoid the French missiles that Wagner ordered to destroy the Concorde. Our fearless leader, Kennedy, decides to shoot through the window to stop the heat-seeking missiles ????? Stupid but fun --- the kicker arrives here though - after a shot, the rocket launcher fails and Kennedy tries to fix it in the cockpit and well ... if you want to know what happens take this movie. The silly parts of this film include the total lack of plot ---- you leave it for 25 minutes to land in Paris and go ONE HOUR with love scenes with prostitutes and flight attendants. Now let's move on to the saboteur for ten minutes, then to a wasted rest of the film and to a plane that breaks visually and THE PASSENGERS DON'T WANT "EVEN SEE IT ???? HIS RIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES !!!! - --- final vote for this move --- (1/10) on 4 stars if it was action 2 on 4 stars if it was a comedy
