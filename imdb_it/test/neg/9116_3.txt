Personally I saw it because of Lea Thompson's appearance and I didn't really expect to enjoy the movie as such, but surprisingly I kept watching it until the end. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - it's just one of the saga-like stories and it's not particularly original or funny, but strangely it just keeps you on TV. My opinion of Will of Their Own would be much better if there was no point where I don't understand. <br /> <br /> There is a lovely and very touchy scene in which the character of Lea Thompson is turning the road holding you in her arms, snow falls, she is cold, scared and has no place to stay, he doesn't know what to do next. And then about 10-12 years later, when things are better for her, she simply leaves the same child without warning to embark on the career she was dreaming of. <br /> <br /> I simply do not understand - I do not see how it is possible that he would do such a thing, it was the action opposite to everything he has done so far in his life when all he was doing was aimed at survival of that child. After the launch of this character, I could not enjoy the rest of the film.
