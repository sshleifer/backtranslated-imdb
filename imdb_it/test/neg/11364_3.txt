An obvious cash-in up * Insert Monster Here * On A Plano gimmick, Flight Of The Living Dead talks about what you would expect it to be. <br /> <br /> The film has a minimal plot or nothing, and that's what you would expect from a film of this type. Although, it's funny in part, I have to say. The Zombi action is particularly fun. Once the film resumes, it never stops; the rhythm is solid. <br /> <br /> The practical special effects are pretty good, but the CGI is terrible and distracting. <br /> <br /> The ending seems to leave the film open to a sequel. We hope it doesn't happen. <br /> <br /> If you are a huge fan of the zombie subgenre of horror movies, I would recommend it; at least one clock is worth. However, if you're just an avid fan of the genre, leave it on the shelf. <br /> <br /> 3/10
