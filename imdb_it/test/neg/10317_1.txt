My first warning should have been that this DVD was for sale for $ 5.00. But since it characterized Sandra Bullock, which I generally like, I bought it. My disappointment with the film began almost immediately. The dialogues are slow and rigid. The color is distorted I continued to adjust the volume to listen to conversations. Acting is amateur. Killing scenes are also a failure. Twice, the dead have moved their legs. When my daughter lacking liquidity offered me a dollar to shut down the film, I immediately and with complacent joy. This is an incredibly ugly film. Tomorrow I will give this DVD to the company of white elephants Christmas party.
