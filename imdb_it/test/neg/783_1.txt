It's really sad that it was born from the same mind as Donnie Darko, perhaps one of the best films of this genre. Where do I start too? I think one of the maddening aspects of the film is that we should criticize humanity, yet in the film we don't see humanity. No more than 5 minutes of the film are spent in agony on the possible death of another human. These are horrible scraps of one-dimensional cardboard of human beings. Unfortunately, this is how we play with what can only be described as a terrible acting. Is this really how Kelly sees humanity? Judging by the reaction of the spectators, this is a horrible encapsulation of humanity. Why don't the film's characters ask the questions that all viewers have? This is not an accusation of humanity. It is an accusation against the straw men that Kelly shows that they have almost no resemblance to the real humans in this situation. <br /> <br /> To those who say this was an inspiring film, what are you comparing? ? Armageddon? I even saw someone compare it to Kurosawa's. How deprived are you really to think that this promotes a good existential discussion? For the love of all that is good in the film! Even the indecent proposal is ten times the accusation of humanity that is so. There we see people really distressing about greed and the human condition. Yes, even the indecent proposal makes this film uncomfortable for a philosophical discussion and yet it gets 5.3 vs 6.0 for this brainless tripe. I have rarely seen a more pretentious, pontificating and self-encouraging film, so smoothly on his face. This has the depth of a high school film project and a poor one in that. Actually, this is the level of the discussion promoted by this film. If you want to see a good psychological movie, do yourself a favor and take a look at Das Experiment. If The Box had also survived this goal, I would have been willing to forgive some of the atrocious acting, gaping gaps and pure nonsense plot. Unfortunately, he can't even do it. <br /> <br /> The real indictment of humanity is that there are people out there who think this film is a deep introspective look at the human condition. This is not Sartre! This isn't even the Sartre version of Cliff Notes! This is an article by Sartre hastily conceived and written in IX style on Sartre based on some digressions of messages on the Internet. If Sartre was alive, he would sue Kelly for libel.
