I was disappointed with this documentary. I thought it would be the second chess game between Grandmaster Garry Kasporov and Deep Blue the supercomputer designed by IBM computer experts to beat any human chess player. Kasparov was and still is considered the greatest chess player ever. The film takes us back to 1997 where Kasporov had agreed to make a revenge with "deep blue" after defeating him 1 year earlier. but instead of focusing on the game, it focuses more on what happens before and after. There are fragments of the game, but not much, many of the films revolve around Kasporov's paranoid obsession that the game was rigged as part of a conspiracy theory and that he lost the game unfairly. The film also includes interviews with people who are not interesting in any way. They are also chatting with the manager of the building where the match took place. I also found it very dry and slow. Ultimately this film was unsatisfactory. This is just my opinion, of course. If you like stringy theories, this movie might interest you. For people who are not part of chess or theories conspiracy, this film would probably have no value. I'm a chess fan, and I only blocked it for that.I do "Game Over: Kasparov and the car" 4/10
