I had no idea what these films were, they jumped from the plot to the plot line that mistakenly linked incoherent ideas to each other. it just doesn't make sense <br /> <br /> the diminished timeline doesn't even help. we begin today to flashback the past and then return to the future only to go back to the past. <br /> <br /> this film is also full of horrible sappy lines and cliché themes like the princess and the poor, "you can't even have me in my death", "you don't even love me enough" line. the cliché to the fullest! <br /> <br /> fighting scene was horribly mushy, lighting was constantly out of place that made up for the CG with the actors (in the sense that it could be said that some of the backgrounds were clearly CG). <br /> <br /> Although the company in di moon was quite interesting. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone, avoid it if possible. <br /> <br /> having found this comment difficult to follow, the film would be just as bad.
