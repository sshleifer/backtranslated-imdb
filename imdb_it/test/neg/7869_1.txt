Dear Director: <br /> <br /> In the future, when trying to create a sense of urgency, it might be better to have your hero * run * instead of jog / shuffle. Especially if you're trying to reinforce a timeline. For example, if you're trying to convince the public that the villain will really kill the hostage if the hero doesn't find it, it's probably a good idea to convey the feeling that your hero believes it could actually happen ... Let's face it though. Making a movie * good * obviously wasn't your goal. Your goal was to pump out a garbage that will make more money than it costs. Otherwise you may have hired some actors. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Bored Viewer. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I can't say it's the worst ever, because I was able to finish it. It was ugly, bad, bad though. Friend, where is my refund?
