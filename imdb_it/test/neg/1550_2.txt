Well, the episode I just saw saw the oldest "Gastineau Girl" complain about why people keep mentioning her husband (Mr. Gastineau, a famous football player apparently). She doesn't seem to want to accept that it's the only reason she's not throwing hamburgers, she's married someone famous and that's why she has cameras pointed at her. <br /> <br /> When challenged by an interviewer to explain what he actually does, he gave a wonderfully circular reason that people should pay attention to her: "I work very hard on my reality show." Then he said "I'm not a celebrity ... I'm a personality". <br /> <br /> I'm not quite sure who this series is to appeal to, except for people who have had all their intelligence removed. It is certainly not a model for anyone, except for the gold diggers, because the two stars do nothing but spend money, and all that tells you about the rich is that they have no money problems.
