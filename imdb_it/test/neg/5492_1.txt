I don't care about the strange artistic film. But when they are tangled up with arcane symbolisms and dark dialogues and when it is obvious that they are made for the ego of the filmmaker rather than for the benefit of the viewer, I get angry. I'm not a stupid person, but I just didn't understand what this movie was trying to say. Or do. The film is a magnificent form of human communication. Why do some filmmakers use it for obfuscation instead?
