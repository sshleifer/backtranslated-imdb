Well, I started with some friends to watch this movie, we went an hour before the show started getting good seats. So how can you probably imagine where we came out to watch this movie :). But that excitement soon turned to horror, this film is a complete failure, just trying to be funny that it's sad, the script is poorly written and relies on the actors to make up for ... <br /> <br /> L the only good acting of the entire film was Stefan C. Schaefer who was fantastic, the plot was weak and even the "funny" scenes felt forced and unnatural, considering that the main actors are some of the best Icelandic comedians very special ... <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone, because it is difficult and never really offers.
