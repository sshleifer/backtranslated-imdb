I couldn't wait to see two brilliant young actors appearing in "Dear John", but he was very slow in moving; and I felt that both the script and the direction hindered the flexibility of the main actors. I usually like the film adaptations of these novels. Ironically, I thought the film did a great job in describing realistic military actions. <br /> <br /> Cinematography has been very good at following love letters, concentrating only enough on one key word or phrase in each letter. I felt that Channing Tatum had mired in what had become a series of "sticky dog" expressions in response to the loss.
