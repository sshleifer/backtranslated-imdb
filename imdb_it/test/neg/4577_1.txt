I had the misfortune to take this flight recently. I had the greatest misfortune of having played it on my RETURN flight. Obviously Demi's attempt to get some "artistic" credit, the film is a mess because of its bad acting ability. A better actress could have done this work, but a simple glance at Moore's face shows the inner emptiness. At least it's not ruining American literature this time.
