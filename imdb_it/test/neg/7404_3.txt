I was hoping that this would be the likes of Das Boot and echoes the crude realism created by acclaimed German director Leni Riefen Stahl in his documentaries, unfortunately I was hugely disappointed. The plot is implausible and challenges credulity. An aviator of the RAF is shot down and somehow goes to a hospital in Dresden. Anna, a nurse whose father runs the hospital and is about to get engaged to a doctor she works with, falls in love with aviation and makes love. The next evening, in a rich engagement party, the aviator disguises himself as a German officer and dances with Anna. Although it is well directed and acted, for me it is a low-level soap opera.
