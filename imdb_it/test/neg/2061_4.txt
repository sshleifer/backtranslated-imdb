A girl is looking for her soul mate - this film was very strange - many sequences that seem like a hallucination. Tommy Lee Jones is the only stable in the photo. It was hard to understand what the director was trying to say ... Most of the time the main character is dressed in strange clothes and makeup. A strange combination of reality and madness.
