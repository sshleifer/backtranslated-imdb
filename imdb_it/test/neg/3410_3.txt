Being a fan of science fiction from my early childhood (a long time ago) I always hated implausible conspiracies. It is a pity that most authors of science fiction stories for children do not show this kind of respect for their audience. I always suspected that they thought: "children are stupid to do, so we don't have to fight". The writer of "Science Fiction (2002)" is no exception. The story is about a boy who is instigated by his new friends to spy on his parents because they think their parents are aliens. As intriguing as the idea seemed to me, I was so bored by its realization. It seemed to me that the filmmakers had exactly this idea and tried to extend it for over 90 minutes by immersing it in a dark, elegant and meticulously slow atmosphere. The only thing that kept me in my place was the question "how do they get out of this implausible garbage"? And then - bang - they didn't even try. So if you are looking for good entertainment for children and parents, go and see "Klatret√∏sen (2002)" instead.
