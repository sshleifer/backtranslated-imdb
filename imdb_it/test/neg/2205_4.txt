I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott, so I was surprised and disappointed to see that it's barely in this movie! The film really belongs to Robert Ryan, who is the hero in the jam, and the one involved in the love triangle. Nice pain, Gabby Hayes has more time on Mr. Scott's screen in this movie !! For many viewers, this is not a problem, but I come from the Walter Brennan school, not Gabby Hayes ... although I will say that his lines were a little more fun than the annoying ones in this film than in many his films with Randolph Scott and John Wayne. <br /> <br /> Personally, I found the film very slow, with a twisted plot that was even more annoyed by the unnecessary subplot of romanticism. By convolution, I do not mean impossible to understand or understand, I only mean too much disorder for his own good. <br /> <br /> Management is not inspired, and the two main villains have the most unsatisfactory as-uppance in the end. The entire film appears to be false, unrealistic and poorly filmed. <br /> <br /> Just so you don't think I can't find anything good here ... <br /> <br /> Plus, Anne Jeffreys is very sexy in her too short parts of this movie. I'm not sure she's actually singing, or someone else, but anyone who has had a very nice voice. Mrs. Jeffreys also had a couple of good acting moments. The script needed much more than her or to completely remove her character. Instead, his good times weren't enough to help the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is Mr. Scott. He looks fantastic in this film and is a real lawman ready to fix things. Some complain that his pre-1950 characters were too good, but that never bothered me. I'll wear it before the 1950s, or after 1950, violent and violent ... however Randolph Scott was a true western hero. <br /> <br /> It saddens me to have to say it, but I should recommend passing this film, unless you are a huge fan ... there are so many better films than Scott out there that this will not fail.
