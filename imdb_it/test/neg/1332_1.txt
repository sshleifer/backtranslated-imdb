Woa, it's terrible. Do not waste your time. I wish I had seen the other comments on the use before. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I didn't look at it all. It was just too horrible. The worst dialogue, the most confused ... I could go on forever. But what really made it unsuitable was the management. The poor actors. You can't even tell if they have talent because not only do they have pathetic lines to talk, but the director didn't give them any action. If you check the director's filmography on this site, you'll see why this film didn't have a chance. <br /> <br /> This would not even be as good as it was for the TV movie. <br /> <br /> Ouch!
