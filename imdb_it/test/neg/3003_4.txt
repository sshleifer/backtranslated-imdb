"What a symbolism!" exclaimed a woman as we left the theater after seeing the paean of the Polish brother with Ingmar Bergman. Some symbolism is all right. But not much. "Northfork" adds a beautiful acting weakened by a gloomy cinematography that fails to make any coherent statement and a confusing story that irritates rather than captivate. <br /> <br /> Northfork is a city that is in extinction after a new hydroelectric dam operates. It is the first half of the 1950s and a team of identically dressed state agents, all with the air of having just answered a call for "The Untouchables", have the task of relocating the recalcitrant inhabitants who fail to appreciate both their immediate danger and the generosity offered to move. An exciting anti-development film is always a possibility, but we become reality: rural electrification is one of the greatest advances in bringing decent living conditions and an economy boosted in American history. Can dams be built without forced relocation? Not in this country. <br /> <br /> But this film is less about the condition of homeowners than it is a fantastic creation of the imagination of a dying boy. Nick Nolte is the priest who tends to the boy and much of what he says might have been interesting if the sound were clear enough to hear. <br /> <br /> Alternating between the black evacuation agents (who work for the "lakefront" "land when the dam creates that surface of value) and a phantasmagoric collection of oddities, the film neither develops nor coherent themes, neither interesting. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is poor, a washed-out, subdued and depressing color permeates the entire film for a less dramatic purpose.There is no reason why this vast terrain is so bleakly described Indeed, a contrast between largely unspoiled natural beauty and the massive and gloomy solidity of the evolving dam and power plants would have been very effective. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
