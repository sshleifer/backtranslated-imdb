This film must have done well at the box office, to give Gator the budget it deserves. This film had no budget, needed a script rewrite and a better ending. There is a flash of brilliance in this film. The scene of the boat ride, Burt driving the bad car, and his chat with his parents. You can tell Burt that he is a southern Italian and not an actor. This film shows how Gator, Burt's best film, would look. Too bad this movie didn't get the same funding and was done on Rush. 4/10
