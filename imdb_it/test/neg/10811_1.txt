That's how I was when I walked (staggered) out of this "movie". I couldn't leave because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people. I was stuck in the middle. Trapped. <br /> <br /> The small fragment of original film that attempted to tie this film together presents some of the worst acting ever on the big screen. The daughter was a prominent performance - it stands out in the worst sense. <br /> <br /> Thge's cinematography was horrible, composed of disjointed fragments and some of the strangest lights I've witnessed. <br /> <br /> As for the repertoire ... well at the beginning ... <br /> <br /> Wait. <br /> <br /> Why am I reviewing this film? Why do I recognize his existence? Please don't watch it. Do something useful with two hours of your life and go see some dry paint.
