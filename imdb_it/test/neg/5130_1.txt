I registered on IMDb.com only to be able to comment on this movie. My God what a bunch of horse crap was disgusting! It shouldn't even be advertised as a real movie, this is very misleading. this is a film project of a maximum of 15 years. The acting is terrible. But even good actors could not save him. Dialogue is probably the worst part of this film. Who the hell wrote this shit? And that constant joke from the plump lesbians that Kaye was a "damsel in distress" became very fast. God, I'd rather a camel take a damp deposit in my ears than look at this shit again. Don't rent this movie. If they gave you the movie for free, don't watch it. destroy it with a hammer. Even if destroying this video has made you lose your Hollywood video or successful video account, it will be worth it. this is an abomination. I suppose I said all I can about this without being redundant. any questions .... email me.
