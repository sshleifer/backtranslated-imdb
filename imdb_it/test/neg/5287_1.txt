The acting was very sub-par, you had Costas Mandalar acting like the brother of the stupid Triple H ranger, a Scott McMahon look-alike like his defendant who I imagine you should be interested in but there's no emotional involvement from any part. You have the stupid lesbian, not that I have anything against lesbians, not just the stupid ones who keep running into a punisher like a shirt and a grunge-like hat that keeps asking if anyone saw his dead lover. <br /> <br /> The Bad could be scary and there is a story about morality somewhere in trying to fight age and death, but it's lost in this movie. Costas Hurst Helmsley points out how soon the victims return to the city, while of course the city lights are behind him. <br /> <br /> Even an error of pronunciation by Ed Gein, but Gine pronounced it. As a citizen of Wisconsin. We had our share of Monsters Gein, Dahmer and McCarthy, but if you use it, say it well. <br /> <br /> God Why do I watch all these terrible films. Oh yes, I'm a glutton for punishment and I watch them so you don't have to.
