I looked at him out of curiosity. I liked Stargate SG1 and saw many other TV shows and movies that the main characters worked on. <br /> <br /> My expectations were not high, so I was surprised to be so monstrously disappointed. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible and the script is worse. <br /> <br /> Zero research on the bad science being launched during the film, or in the martial arts (which many cast members engage in throughout the film, although they clearly have no martial arts training (the stick that vault does not make a warrior make)) the formation makes the already plausible plot even less credible. The same weapon (brought by Michael Shanks), when struck from one side of a mountain, causes extreme damage, but when hit by a wicker wall, it creates a small pyrotechnic effect without damaging the wicker structure - OK, I suppose Michael Shanks fans will be sued for seeing him in Stargate SG1, where a staff weapon creates a superficial burn on a main character, or blasts a hole in a section of the castle wall, as required), but still ... An ugly CGI snake 'God eats one of the faithful in the way a dog ate - snakes do not behave this way. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of an Amazon warrior cult on a distant planet is foolish at best. Matriarchal societies have always been based on a lack of understanding that men are required in the process of propagation of the species - for example, the Picts, who did not understand the role of men in sexual reproduction until the ninth century - moment in which, the balance of power has passed from women to men. They carry technological weapons and demonstrate a certain knowledge of science - in particular of medicine, so the idea that a matriarchal society can exist with this level of scientific knowledge is based exclusively on the wet dream of the original author. Of course, the few references to stellar science made in this film show that the author knew nothing about this (except for some key words he must have heard in other films). However, it could have been done better - as "Lei" in 1965, for example, which showed the matriarchal society with a certain reverence, much more credible, and even after 45 years it seems fresher than this fetid exercise in stupidity. Marching some women in "armor", pouting aggressively and spitting their jokes like a kiddie in search of a fight in a nightclub ("Come, then, I'll do you!"), It seems to oversimplify the complexities of a culture matriarchal. <br /> <br /> The cultural references are so simple: "everything proclaims the mother snake", practically summarizes everything. Even the smallest village shows more cultural variations. <br /> <br /> There is nothing intelligent, inspiring, interesting, visually exciting or remote entertainment on this film. The soundtrack is of similar quality. I can only assume that the few positive, overly charitable reviews received by this film are from hardcore Michael Shanks fans who will give their thumbs up to everything he's involved with. Don't be fooled. Low budgets are not a reason why a movie fails: cheap B movies can be brilliant. This is not one of these, and there is no reason to inflict this movie on yourself.
