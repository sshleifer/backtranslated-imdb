I saw this movie at a party, we were very puzzled by the ending, it's pretty bad. although the whole movie is not too surprising, I was expecting something slightly better. This film is pure junk, but I suggest you watch it if you find inexpensive horror movies with a weak script that is pretty funny. Personally I loved advertising, it was my main attraction, the fighting scenes were fundamental, a knife blow, some shadows in a window, fake blood. I have to say that the granny costume was pretty scary, this film is a mixture of joy of killing, field blood and boggy breek 2, except that this film has a slightly better camera wok and color treatment than the camp blood .
