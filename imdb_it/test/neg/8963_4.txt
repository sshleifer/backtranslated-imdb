**** SPOILER MILD _ BUT IT IS PROBABLY KNOWING THE FIELD **** <br /> <br /> The woman is raped and decides to vent her anger on the whole human race. Oh, did I mention that the rape victim was mute? This is the problem with MS 45, Thana, the rape victim, decides she will kill men, but is there any logical explanation for this? Surely the whole movie would be better if we had Thana give a voice about why she's banging out any man she meets? There is not enough development for this plot <br /> <br /> As you would expect from a Ferrara film it is not a complete waste of time. it is much better than THE SPIT ON YOUR SERIOUS and the pseudo intellectuals will have a field day that emphasizes the irony of the woman who holds a knife in her hand like a penis while Thana ends up in a murderous madness at the end. But the script is rather silly and underdeveloped and hinders any serious comment that the film could have made
