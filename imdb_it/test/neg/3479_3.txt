Equipped with some very nice special effects by Rick Baker and Deran Serafian in a small role, this rather lame Italian film deserves recognition. Cerchi gets the credit for having still made crazy movies while most of the other Italian directors (Ruggero Deodato, Sergio Martino, Lamberto Bava and Enzo G. Castellari) have switched to low-profile TV movies. As for plankton, it is half Piranha - half The Thing, with people turning into monsters, rape women and cause general chaos. The film's ultra-gritty, squalid and too sexy atmosphere makes it difficult to enjoy it. Available only in working prints in Italian.
