Few videos in recent history have been amateurishly produced like this - at least none that have been released by such a reputable distributor. Every plot of this film is a plagiarism of the best films of the past. The word "clich√©" has a new meaning from a talented writer / director who should reserve his imagination for minor masturbation efforts that do not affect viewers. Assisting in the amateur nocturnal "horror" effort is a number of less capable technicians who contribute to poor cinematography and laughable makeup and special effects. Unfortunately, one or two of the amateur actors in the film show a bit of talent that will go unnoticed because of the reputation that this atrocity will produce.
