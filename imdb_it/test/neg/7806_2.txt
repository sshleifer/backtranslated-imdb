This film is the worst I've seen in a long time. Terence Stamp's talent is totally wasted and almost the only thing I liked was listening to a favorite song of mine, "If I Had a Million Dollars" by BNL, in the opening credits. <br /> <br /> Ashton Kutcher plays the main character, a good guy who is tied up at home sitting for his boss. The result is mishaps. Blah blah blah. If you have time to lose and you have nothing better to do, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, look at something else. <br /> <br /> There are not necessarily positive moments, but it's nice to see Molly Shannon and Jeffrey Tambor on the screen. They are always pleasures to look at even if this film has managed to dampen even these bright spots.
