As the title suggests, this is not the particularly beautiful film I was hoping it would be. I thought it would be great with Mr. Monty, but tragically not. From the beginning I literally lost interest when 2 women are just making tea and then suddenly she points out that there is random water coming from under the door, so bombing a flood flood through the path of the house is hard to believe that they didn't do it. Notice the rising water level outside or at least listen to it. Sorry if this seems like a rant, but it really hurts me and it hit me. Most of the acting was poor and the story tried to copy almost all the clich√©s in every catastrophic movie ever, but it failed in that sense. CGI was poor, I could do a better job with MS Paint, also directing the poor, and in the end I didn't care about 1 character at all !!! don't waste your time, people are not surprised that it was published directly on DVD. Well, thanks for reading xxx
