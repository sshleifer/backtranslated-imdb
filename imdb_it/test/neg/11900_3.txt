I have already rented this type of "soft core", but I can honestly say that I didn't expect it to be of the same type as "Rod Steele: You Only Live Until You Die" - which was both sexy and fun. He had a good script, a sincere protagonist and a sense of purpose. He also has Gabriella Hall who is hot. The reason I didn't expect this movie was because the box "Miss be 18 to Rent" was missing from the box. I was looking for more "cheese" and less "cheesecake". <br /> <br /> First of all, I think that films shouldn't be able to start with "actors" who try for a part in a talent agency (or wherever they try "actors"). In this film, seeing the "actors" try highlights the lack of preparation that went into reciting the real characters of the film. <br /> <br /> Ok, having discovered that this was a soft core film, I didn't necessarily turn it off and request my money back. But the dizzying way in which the "erotic" scenes of the extended video are added to what was probably a late-night paid version is very annoying and easy to forward quickly without the sustained quality, for example, of Rod Steele. You know they must have had some money, because I think some of them are filmed abroad. <br /> <br /> I will have to say that the main actor who is trying NOT to spread the invisibility potion on himself is one of the most staggering acting jobs I've ever seen. And I saw Torgo di Manos! Actually it could be worth the cost of renting the dollar (the one and Gabriella Hall). Still, there are more beautiful movies to rent with your friends.
