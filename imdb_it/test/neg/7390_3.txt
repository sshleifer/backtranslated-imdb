"The King is Alive" is a wrong and forced confusion of a film that presents itself as an excuse for the self-defense of the auteur to transport a group of actors in a Namibian desert forgotten by God where he can act in major-Dogme-domo and film his selfishly conceived, a foolish, exaggerated drama, with total disregard for the true forces of human nature, the call to the market, common sense and even good art. In other words, this is a dumbassed movie and if you don't believe it, your penance is watching it. Only for movies, critics, amateurs and the like. (D)
