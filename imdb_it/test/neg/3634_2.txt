I saw about five or six episodes of this stupid show, and many of them I was forced to watch. And I didn't like the episodes I saw. What happened to Dan Schneider? After doing such fantastic shows like Drake and Josh, why did you decide to create a stupid show like this? My problem isn't just with Dan, it's also with the guys who nominated this show for an Emmy, were they drunk that day, or what's the problem? Drake and Josh have not been nominated for an Emmy, but it is much better than Zoey 101. The creators of this show should be ashamed of the existence of this show, we just hope that your pregnancy will know who will influence the show, or better yet the will cancel.
