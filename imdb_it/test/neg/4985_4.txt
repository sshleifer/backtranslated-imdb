Jason Lee is right to give this fleeting promise of dog movies, but it's not enough to distinguish it from any other bland family comedy <br /> <br /> This CG-enriched live-action adventure sees a shameful police dog (Jason Lee ) transformed into a super-dog through an accident in the laboratory of the engineer Simon Dr Barsinister (Peter Dinklage). Underdog decides to save the city while trying to keep his identity a secret - a challenge since he can talk and fly. <br /> <br /> The strange joke raises a smile, but Underdog's human flanks (James Belushi and Alex Neuberger as father and son) are as boring as the predictable plot. One for children too young to have seen Superman. Or Spider-Man. Or even Shaggy Dog ??
