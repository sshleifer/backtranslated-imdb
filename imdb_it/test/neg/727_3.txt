When I saw this series for the first time, I had the impression that the characters were fascinating and amusing, in particular Lorelai and Rory were witty and intelligent conversationalists, albeit a little too talkative. However, after looking at it for a while, my opinion changed. <br /> <br /> The main characters have slowly turned out to be self-obsessed narcissists who have treated the small wounds to their pride as the worst insults in their existence. For example, Rory didn't talk to her mother for months when Lorelai didn't consult her about her impulsive marriage, while Lorelai abandoned Luke simply for taking some time to adapt to her new life circumstances. These people are superficial, they consider themselves the center of the universe where everyone else should behave exactly according to their strict rules, and if they don't, they will hold a grudge against them for an eternity. They do not want to see the problems of others and treat the smallest minimum as the most serious crime. Most characters don't seem to have the ability to behave in an adult way. They think they should do whatever they wanted and everyone else be damned. <br /> <br /> The series is based on characters, so when the main characters became so unlikely the show became impossible to watch. I still have the rest of the series, but I doubt I'll ever finish watching them. I will also keep anyone who thinks much of the show and its terrible characters with the greatest suspicion - they must be just as horrible as Lorelai and others.
