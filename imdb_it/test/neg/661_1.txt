OK, let's start with the best. the building. although it's hard to believe that it had electricity and running water after 35 years and a fire, the gruesome walls and odd objects found in everything were interesting. apart from that, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> regarding the villain, it's made by the WWE movies. WTF? is that what should make you want to see it? if anything, stay away. horrible, horrible idea for them to make films and allow Gregory Dark to direct it. Wrong choice. advance previews were more interesting and fun. <br /> <br /> I can't even begin to discuss how bad this movie is. actors without talent and a disappointing and vague plot. apparently many of the actors come from that show "all the saints". it's a wonder because I've never heard of them or their show. apart from that, the bus driver, whom you have never seen, only he who closes the door, had more action than almost all together. at least he runs stunts for some decent movies. <br /> <br /> I like to see scary movies, I really do. but this blew so much, the whole audience was laughing at it and cheering for the characters halfway. very boring. the child behind me was screaming more during previews of other horror movies. <br /> <br /> this is not a movie to see, much less if you have to pay for it.
