God bless Randy Quaid ... his flattering cousin Eddie on vacation and Christmas vacation has hilariously stolen the show. He also made the horrible vacation in Las Vegas at least worth a look. <br /> <br /> I will say that he tries his hand at this TV sequel, but that the script is so NOT funny that the film never gets anywhere. Quaid and the rest of the returning vacation vets (including the original Audrey, Dana Barron) are wasted here. Even Eric Idle of European Vacation cannot save the show in a short cameo .... <br /> <br /> Pathetic and sad ... actually painful to watch .... Christmas Vacation 2 is the worst franchise Vacation.
