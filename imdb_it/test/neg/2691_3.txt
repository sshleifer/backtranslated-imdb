I have to admit that, even though I'm a fan of Shakespeare, I've never been really familiar with this game. And what I really can't say is if this is a poor adaptation, or if the game is just a bad choice for the film. There are some good deals in it, but the execution is very big and the plot is obvious. The theme of the game is on the nature of debt, using the financial idea of ​​debt and justice as a metaphor for emotional questions. This becomes clear when the question of the rings becomes more important than the business with Shylock, which unfortunately descends into the anti-Semitic garden variety, despite Bardo's best attempts to save it with a couple of beautiful monologues. <br /> <br /> of the dignified turn of Jeremy Irons, I didn't think there was a decent performance in the group. Pacino's Yiddish consists of a slight wail added at the end of each pronunciation, and some of Shylock's best scenes are reduced to variations on the standard "Pacino si angry" scene that his fans know and love. But Lynn Collins is totally embarrassing, to the point that I would have thought to see her immediately out of the field. When he incognito as a man, it's hard not to laugh at all the things we shouldn't laugh at. With Joseph Fiennes standing there trying to look sincere and complicated, it is difficult not to make devastating comparisons with Gwyneth Paltrow's performance in "Shakespeare in Love". The big problem, however, is that overcoming everything in this film is just a lack of emotional attention. It's really hard to tell if this movie is trying to be a rather serious comedy or a strangely silly drama. Surely a good summer warehouse performance would have ripped more laughter from the material of this gloomy production. The actors seem embarrassed by the attempt at humor, and unsure about where to put the dramatic and comic accent. All this is fundamentally the director's fault, Michael Radford, who seems to think that the material is much heavier than it seems.
