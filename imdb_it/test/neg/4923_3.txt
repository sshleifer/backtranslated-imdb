The fact that a film is on DVD does not guarantee that its quality is very good. The fact that the quality of a film is worn does not mean that you should not buy it. This review actually applies to 2 paired movies on a single DVD. <br /> <br /> The plots of these films are of little importance. Are they interesting only for the people who collect Holmes films? someone who just wants some of the best deals would do well to buy some of those made by Jeremy Brett ?? or, in a pinch, Basil Rathbone. Are there any other very good Holmes movies with good actors on a one shot basis? like "Seven Per Cent Solution" or "Private Life of Sherlock Holmes". In any case, these films are considerably less estimable. <br /> <br /> Here we have a couple of films with some of the best actors to make Holmes, even if the results tend towards disappointing. This seems to be the only disc with these films (even if "Deadly Necklace") appears alone in the same version on other discs. <br /> <br /> "(Sherlock Holmes and) the Deadly Necklace" dates back to 1962, although it does not seem nor does it seem. Some who have seen this may be surprised to learn that it was produced by Hammer Studios. Not that Hammer didn't produce something really schlock, but where Christopher Lee was worried, they usually did a better job. Print a direct transfer from a 1: 1.33 copy rather consumed in black and white. The color quality suggests that the original may have been in color, and the cut ends of the film's appearance suggest that it may have been originally 1: 1.66 or more. <br /> <br /> The film is set in the early 20th century ?? not unlikely, since Holmes still worked (and actually didn't die until 1957). However, the script is not adapted from any Doyle story. It involves an Egyptian series, and Professor Moriarty introduces himself as a world famous archaeologist and also as the Prince of crime. The plot is melodramatic and banal. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in this film is that ?? for any unfathomable reason ?? Hammer shot it in Germany. However, it was shot in English. He was then nicknamed in German and then renamed in English. So what you hear isn't Lee or any of the other original actors, but a bunch of unknowns ?? not that, outside of Lee, I doubt anyone could meet any of the other actors. This is a shame, since Lee (see his "Hound of the Baskerville") makes a Holmes quite decent. As it is, his double voice is condescending and simple as bread pudding without raisins or cinnamon. <br /> <br /> The music of this film is mainly jazz, in a possible attempt to be "period". Too bad nobody thought of ragtime. As it is, music does not refer to what happens on the screen, and is often at odds with action. <br /> <br /> The other film is "(Sherlock Holmes e) the Speckled Band" from 1931, played by a young Raymond Massey. The quality of the image and sound is fully up to the effort of 1962, and in fact a little better. Massey is a rather respectable Holmes, although he certainly doesn't have the role in the way Rathbone and Brett did. The other actors taking part in this production are unlikely to be of interest to modern readers. The acting ?? how is this true for many films of this period ?? owes much to the post-Victorian stage and silent films. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that while "The Deadly Necklace" is available on DVD alone, "The Speckled Band" is only available with the first movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little else to say about this film. The settings seem to be a strange combination of the 1890s (horse-drawn carriage) and the 1920s (electronic devices like a primitive dictator). Overall, it is an interesting curiosity and a sufficient incentive to buy the DVD with the matching rather than a DVD with "Deadly Necklace" only.
