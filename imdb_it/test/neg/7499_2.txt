Am I the only one who thinks this is a bad movie? <br /> <br /> I admit that horror films often lack things like a great story or acting or even special effects. But the way these deficiencies come together in this film is surprisingly painful. <br /> <br /> Miserable story: the idea of ​​a raped vagina who takes revenge by turning into a man-eater seems rather amusing, but what the writer has made of it is stupid. <br /> <br /> Bad acting: the actors move like puppets. They sound and look like people, they really try hard but can't completely act. <br /> <br /> Bad FX: Especially the explosion of the Van seems inexpressibly cheap. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that a director who has made some good films during his career has turned into such messy things.
