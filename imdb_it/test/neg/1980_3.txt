I was stunned by the feminine joy when I discovered this film shortly after seeing the Spirits Within. <br /> <br /> After years of waiting, they gave the release date of November 2005. Well, November has arrived. And he went. Followed by December. Oh, look, today, January 31, 2006. It's not out in the US yet. Well, I'm so happy to have a friend with a fake subtitled copy. ; D <br /> <br /> Well, the cg was fantastic. Not as good as expected, but almost perfect. However, I limited myself to unnatural movements made by children during the film. I thought we were gone by now. Furthermore, I didn't really care about the appearance of souls given to their faces. I had the impression that they were turning to take a realistic look at the film, yet most of the characters have eyes larger than normal, especially female characters. They had personalities, though, I'll give them to them. <br /> <br /> Even if I'm not a big fan of anime, I have to say I was impressed by the wild fighting scenes. They were beautifully animated and made me dangle on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> For the first two. <br /> <br /> And here is the biggest flaw of Advent Children. Mostly they are just some hyper-stylized fight scenes. A sequel of FF7 epic proportions had been promised for years. Instead, they gave us a nice piece of CG with just a plot to excuse the execution time of just two hours. <br /> <br /> Where Final Fantasy is famous for its intricate stories, this film is not up to par. You don't really know the characters. The only way to understand most of what happened in the film would have been if I had played. We barely saw them before they faced each other with any current threat. <br /> <br /> What hurts even more fans are the terrible cameos that most of the FF7 characters have received. They were nothing but Cloud's "I'll call if I need you, but I probably won't." And, to increase the damage, each character individually launched Clouds higher and higher. This small part here was so poor that I almost turned it off. I would have been much more impressed if he had simply jumped on it all by himself, bouncing off the walls to rise higher. <br /> <br /> It hurt even more when they reduced the Turks to less than a comic relief. This was fine for the game, but this is the cinema. People don't act like cartoon characters in a tough fight. They took away their dignity: / <br /> <br /> And, spoiler (yes right, most of you probably already know, anyway). Who remembers that Darth Maul was highlighted in SW: Episode 1? Yes, now, imagine this, but with Sephiroth. Quite right. He had maybe 5 minutes of screen. Maybe that. End Spoiler: P <br /> <br /> If this movie was made for fans, then the way to go Square. If this is an indication of the direction you are taking in the FF series, I doubt you will see much of my money. I played your games for the wonderful story and the excellent characters. <br /> <br /> You had the chance to create something epic. Something really beautiful, a masterpiece that flies in the face of all the CG movies of Disney. <br /> <br /> Instead you gave us a nice piece of meat with almost nothing underneath to keep it together. Well done. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure if the rest of the fans stopped for a moment and tried to pay attention to anything but the CG, they would know what I'm talking about. Well, I was evaluating this 5/10, but after thinking about it while straightening it up, I'd give it a 3/10 because they could have done better. They did better. And this is just sad. <br /> <br /> If they do something about FFVII, they have to do it first.
