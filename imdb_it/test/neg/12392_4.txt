Grosse Pointe Blank was really a below average film. The theme of his hit man is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than a successful thriller. The acting is very normal. Sometimes the performances are extremely embarrassing, with many characters that seem very "eccentric" and this really annoyed me. The whole meeting and the "Wow, I haven't seen you in 10 years!" the element is extremely mischievous and many scenes drag on, especially closer to the end when they are at the actual meeting and the characters are going through each of their former classmates one by one by greeting them. It all seemed very bad, useless and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> The role of Dan Akroyd as a "rival" murderer is very poor. It just seems to appear once at the beginning and right at the end in a "final show down" that is highly publicized but doesn't provide at all. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also very mediocre. Most of the songs on this film came out directly from the 80s and with the exception of two or three, they are very bad. Listening to duff songs on a fairly duffy movie only adds to the negativity surrounding this movie. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on about how little things were annoying and they were just as bad as the very few action sequences that came and went very quickly, the lack of character development and how little everything had been built in that department, the way half the time forgets that Cusak's character is even a hit man as the element is so non-existent. <br /> <br /> Also the way in which the play thinks it's funny; but it is not. I didn't laugh once during this movie. Of course, maybe I smiled from time to time but my only real strength was when I realized that the film was almost finished! <br /> <br /> Please, don't waste your time with 'Grosse Pointe Blank' despite the relatively high (but badly) high grade IMDb. I've seen better films from this movie that have a lower rating on this site that tells you that there are better movies out there. Do not worry about it.
