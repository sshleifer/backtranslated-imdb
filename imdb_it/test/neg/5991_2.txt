Sometimes Full Moon creates funny movies. This is not one of them. Full Moon is like a low-key Troma. Their films are not so violent or off the wall, but they are usually just as lacking in talent. The acting in this film is not terrible, but the script is pretty ugly, and overall it's pretty boring and doesn't even contain nude scenes (like many Full Moon movies) to redeem it. Skip this and go hire "Head of the family".
