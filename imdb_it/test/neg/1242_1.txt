Maybe I'm just here, but this is crap. I'm sorry but I've been attracted since I found out about Lil 'Bill O'Reilly (who I had no idea about this show until months later, and honestly he lost his charm since then), but I gave the show a big hit. Spike tries to turn himself into something he is not, that is to say, he tries to be human. Fox didn't even bother to hide the ropes when they took him out of the box he entered. His sketches are striving, he himself is not funny, and writers are struggling to write material for a guest without talent. There is too much good TV out there to waste your time with this show, and Fox ..... Fox we had some good times, but you need to get your f $% * in place together and find something original instead of trying to be just another "Me-too" network.
