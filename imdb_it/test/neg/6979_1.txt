I put up with this film just to satisfy my curiosity. It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I am surprised that this film currently has a rating of 7.5 stars. The acting is horrible, the script does not exist and the characters are so predictable and empty. For a funny movie, I don't even remember laughing and I can't see how it could be called a comedy. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this slag and take a look at some more worthy alternatives that would give you much greater pleasure. Watch movies like the holiday or 27 dresses, these films would offer a much more satisfying cinematic experience. I sincerely hope that the most educated film-goers will vote negatively for this film, in the way that it sincerely deserves to give it a more realistic assessment that other cinema fans could base their judgment on them. Let's go people, let's say we are honest with everyone involved and we will give the people involved in this film a real reflection on what they have produced - an extremely mediocre picture that deserves to be forgotten very quickly.
