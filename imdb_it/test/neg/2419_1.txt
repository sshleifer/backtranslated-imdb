If the directors / producers / publicists want to promote a film as "based on real events" and make a film that aims to inspire and make sense, then, to start, to maintain any kind of credibility and integrity, you would like to keep a film as honest as possible. <br /> <br /> A team that wears "all black" sweaters and that makes the haka in America is simply stupid. Any half-smart person would know that the "All Blacks" are New Zealand's national rugby team and their sweaters are all black and the Haka is played by them as part of a traditional Maori dance. <br /> <br /> Having such stupidity in a movie, without explanation, simply reduces the credibility of the film to zero and nullifies the message and inspiration that the film is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> The question is "Why"? Why should you do such a stupid thing and for what possible gain? <br /> <br /> I can only conclude that the writers, directors or producers have seen it on TV before a game of the international rugby championship and they thought "wow, that would be nice in our film, nobody will know that it never happened, they are all too stupid to know about NZ and all blacks, it will be fantastic. "<br /> <br /> How would an American audience react to a film made in New Zealand on America in iron iron, with a team wearing an American Indian costume and war painting, doing a native American Indian war dance, circling around shouting "oh woo woo woo, oh woo woo woo" react? They laughed out loud! <br /> <br /> The people who made this film and the industry that generated it should really read their head. For some reason the industry thinks it can "fool all people at all times". <br /> <br /> It's just stupid!
