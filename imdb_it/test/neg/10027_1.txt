Even by the lowered standards of the 80s slasher movies, this stinks. The usual bunch of guys too big goes to a "forbidden" part of the forest, which burned in the 1940s and apparently left only one angry survivor. Fast forward (in reality, you will want to advance quickly in most of this chaos) to the present day, where a couple of campers are massacred; teenagers follow their wake, while a semi-interested park ranger (a sleepwalker Jackie Coogan) and his healthier cohort (who spends a lot of time tuning his banjo) manage to direct our attention from the courtyards of the run-of-the-padding for natural filming. Finally, more murders - but nothing that you haven't seen before a billion times. If you want to see slaughtered children, opt for SLEEPAWAY CAMP or the first FRIDAY '13 on this
