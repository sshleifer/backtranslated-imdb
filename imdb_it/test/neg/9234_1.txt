Altioklar: Master of thieves. <br /> <br /> Watch some movies, steal some parts of them, write a script ... It must be very easy to be a director in Turkey. I think that Altioklar has looked at "Identity (2003)", "Saw (2004)", some series concerning crime, murder, etc. Then he said "Eureka, eureka" (I found it!) After he wrote the script for the film. <br /> <br /> You can guess the killer at the beginning of the film. It only took 10 minutes for me. He shouted "I'm the killer, I'm the murderer". There is no mystery. <br /> <br /> Tamer Karadagli is the same (sux). Exaggerated mimes, funny macho man. <br /> <br /> There is only one good thing in the film. Demet Evgar's performance is very good. You could see the movie just for that.
