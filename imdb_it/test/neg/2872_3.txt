this movie was really bad. it has that quality that many indie films have: moments of humor full of long spaces that are completely boring. All die-hard BERA magher fans will love this movie, but again it's probably the only person who would see it. someone gave me this movie to see knowing I'm a fan of Jackass and was a fan of the bam alive, before the scrambled nature of that show got thinner. To explain why this film doesn't work, I should just say that the premise itself is interpreted by <br /> <br /> by a guy who is with a girl who is horrible to him. And pretty much the whole movie that you got this guy from Ryan Dunn whining and Bam Magera walking around like a cheerful trouble maker. Dicamillo's performance is strange at best. It is a not very specific and non-specific French Canadian accent that is practically an extension of his performance (basically fun for 5 minutes and then it's like "ok you're already pretending to be quite foreign") <br /> <br /> would work if they wanted to make a parody, but all they can do is make a movie with a zero IQ, I love toilet humor as much as the next guy, but it's not low enough, it's just stupid. the humor to be obtained from this film is completely inside and the public, even those experienced by Magera and the company, are left out of the joke. <br /> <br /> The next time magera is handed a bag full of money, we hope he won't blow on a bad home project
