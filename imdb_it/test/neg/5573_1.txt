I see that most comments so far have been if not overly positive, then at least positive. I can't understand it. The only explanation I can find is that the people who commented had something to do with the film, because this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Makes "Boggy Creek II" and "Mutant" as masterpieces of horror. Acting is at most tremendous, and horrible for the most part. The whole film is almost pitch black, probably to be able to shoot everything in the same position. The monster looks something of one of Roger Corman's worst films. And the plot ... well, the less we talk about it the better. <br /> <br /> One to avoid at all costs.
