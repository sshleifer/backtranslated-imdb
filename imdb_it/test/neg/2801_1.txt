This is probably the worst of the worst. I'm a big fan of the horror film industry and I can believe this movie could have been made. The acting was youthful and the story completely idiotic. Camera work was also youthful. A scene that comes to mind is outside a store. It's night and you can see the moon, but the characters have all the shadows cast on the wall. There was no lamp post to see. A character is gutted at some point, but manages to re-emerge later after being removed from a post. Come on!!! Looked like I was watching a middle school game. I kept expecting the characters to greet their family members out of the camera and from the "hi mom" mouth. I can only give two positive comments ... it's over and it was a good laugh. Please don't rent this movie !!!!
