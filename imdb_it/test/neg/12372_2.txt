This terrible film is fun on many levels - the most obvious is the lame bird puppet, which looks like a fake floating around cheap sets, without ever flapping its wings (like it was on a rope, maybe?) engine trains and toys. Is "science" asinine - a Masonic atomic gun ?? And what happens with the huge amount of Brylcream in everyone's hair? I imagine the 1950s were the decade of Slimeball! Apparently, this bird puppet comes from "an anti-matter universe abandoned by God", and is here to build a nest and lay eggs in New York. Seriously. That they can kill the puppet is almost a sin. I give 1 plinth out of 4 - it's silly and stupid, but it's more fun than Armageddon. : = 8)
