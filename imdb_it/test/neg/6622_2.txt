the top of the carrot in a full length movie, quite said. only the reason why this is not achieved is through my personal voting system of only 1 and 10, and this is not an extreme case. horrible horrible god. there are some films that are so bad that they are unintentionally funny, then there are films that make you physically sick and then there are those that lead to serious contemplation of suicide. burn all copies of the film, photograph anyone who has had a non-creative input in this film, torture anyone with some creative input and as for the star, there are just so many things that can be said online, but should beg for the final ten seconds of existence with a severed head at the end of the work.
