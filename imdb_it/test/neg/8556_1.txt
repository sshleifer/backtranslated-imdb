As some of you can call this propaganda a family film. This is nothing but a PC, an insensitive insult to the faithful of a small city. The film portrays a woman as the great white savior of a small Midwestern city, and all the others in the city (mostly men) are just simple damsels in distress, incapable of honor, who can't look after themselves and have to do reliance on the main character for redemption. This film is just a love story that the producer has with a small, unruly, arrogant, intrusive picky, who expects the public to admire. <br /> <br /> The person who made this film has probably spent his whole life in a searcher-sensitive church, and had the freedom to dump rubbish on little church members like crazy and not the majority. The same people who give money to the Salvation Army at Christmas, collect donations to help the missionaries, the poor and the homeless, sing, make friends and make friends. What is wrong with this humble group that offends these hypocritical traitors? Most Christians in this world would face a train and give life to any person in need, even if they disagree with them. Most Christians would not mind if the pastor or some church clerk from some church took his coat (or outer shirt). They would not have condemned her. This film is ridiculous!
