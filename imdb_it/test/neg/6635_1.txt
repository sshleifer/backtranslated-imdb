Yes, the votes are in. This film could very well be Plan 9 from Outer Space for our generation. But while Ed Wood's film, despite all its faults, maintains a certain charm despite everything, this film defines the word "without charm" to the nth degree. In fact, I would recommend publishers of Oxford English Dictionary to quote this film as a key example that defines the word in the next dictionary update. <br /> <br /> Carrot Top is an interpreter of this abyssal genre that normally rational people I know when they hear his name become homicidal maniacs dedicated to killing Mr. Top as soon as possible. In fact, if you go to Amazon.com and look at customer reviews for the Carrot Top movie and other performance DVDs, you'll discover several that could be interpreted as Mr. Top's death threats. <br /> <br /> Another curious one Regarding this film, I remember that Mike Nelson, the chief screenwriter of MST 3000, in his book Mike's Mega Cheese on the movies, beautiful and ugly, said he saw this movie and a little later he could not remember any of this, including the title. Obviously Mike was suffering a classic reaction to the trauma. Seeing this atrocity was so numb from the soul, Mike Nelson had to block it from his mind. (Evidently, in a later chapter of his book, Mike Nelson had retrieved his memeory from this film. From the review he offers, Mike Nelson was absolutely not grateful for the memory he recovered.) <br /> <br /> comment I offer the film, and it is not a spoiler, it is simply the honest truth of God, it is not funny. None of this, not even a nanosecond is fun.
