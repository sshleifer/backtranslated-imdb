The square pigs as a way to efficiently use the cargo space is the only intelligent moment in "Space Truckers". Believe it or not, Dennis Hopper has done worse, see "The American Way", but this film is very high on the "cream of shit" scale. I think the best way to describe the visual experience is that "Space Truckers" will not satisfy anyone. Even the cartoons are taken too seriously, an almost total lack of humor and a poor development of the character practically ensure disappointment. The crowd of beer and popcorn could tolerate a vision, but everyone else was warned to avoid "Space Truckers" for all the above reasons. - MERK
