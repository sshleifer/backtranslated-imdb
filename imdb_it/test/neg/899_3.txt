I really didn't care about this. If they had gotten rid of the comedy / slapstick and focused on the dramatic / philosophical aspects of the script, it might have been worth it. <br /> <br /> The further the film went, the less I liked the main character / postman. He has interesting things to say, but he's also a hypocritical and insecure fool. <br /> <br /> 3/10
