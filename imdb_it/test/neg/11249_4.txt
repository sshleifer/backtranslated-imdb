Barbershop 2: Back in Business was not as good as it was original but it was just as fun. The film itself lacked small things that the original contained and made it much more pleasant. Back in Business seemed to be just another worthless sequel done to bring money with a very thin storyline. Cedric the Entertainer's terrible apology for the flashbacks ruined the film and seemed to be a bad way to try to get the audience to adapt to the character. Overall Barbershop 2: Back in Business was an unnecessary sequel, without the original charm, soul and spark.
