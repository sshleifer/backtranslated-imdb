I read the recent comments and couldn't wait to see the movie. however, after spending 80 minutes of predictable "surprises" that didn't even make me jump and an unrealistic villain, I was hugely disappointed. I thought cartoons were the only films that lasted only 80 minutes. I thought this might have been due to the modifications to make it 'R' evaluated, but the original only contained another ten minutes of "Kill Bill" type blood. When blood sprays like a tube, reality loses its charm. Add the killer who should be a "ghost", but he can tear someone from the jaw (wing King Kong with the T-Rex), lives through everything and has an ending similar to the ending of the sopranos and you maybe have the most exaggerated movie in the last year. After watching the movie I felt like I had seen countless films with the same storyline and method and I also felt largely dissatisfied. I don't know what everyone else has seen, but if you want a good horror movie this weekend, see Halloween, it's definitely worth the $ 10. When it comes to Hatchet, we hope the next one is based on the book.
