Pretentious treat, updating Herman Melville (!), On the vaguely incestuous relationship of a young man with his aristocratic mother who is transferred to the recently lost sister who was raised by the gypsies. Or something similar ?? not that anyone really cares about unraveling his multi-layered plot decked with pornographic sex scenes, pseudo-symbolic images (the brothers swim in a river of blood) and other bizarre touches (a gypsy child repeatedly insults passers-by on the street to is beaten to death in an anonymous way, the deafening music of a rock band used in the demolition of old buildings). Considering the starting material and the presence of Catherine Deneuve (who at least manages to bathe naked), I expected much more from this; apparently, is there an even longer TV version of POLA X out there ??
