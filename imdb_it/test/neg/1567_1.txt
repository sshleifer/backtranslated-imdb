G & M started a strange couple downstairs in Man About the House and continued to entertain the nation in their sitcom. <br /> <br /> What was the typical small-scale personal charm of small-screen couple chemistry, G & M's transfer to the big screen was terrifying as Genuis' Morcombe and Wise and countless television programs. <br /> <br /> Unfunny. Unsatisfactory and with a sick Yootha Joyce dead before the release of the film.
