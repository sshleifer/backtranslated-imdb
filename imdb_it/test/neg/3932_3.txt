This film was not good at all. Here is the first clue and that it will not be a strong film, the name of Harrison Ford does not only appear first but is also bigger than the title. The music was nominated for an Oscar, what the hell was it? That music was probably the most annoying thing in the movie. The acting was at most comparable, except the Amish guy who did a decent job to be so young. Then you have the story that was weak and a little out of place, and won for adapted! The music was awful, I know I said something but it was really bad. The premises were really good and should be redone. Well, that's all I really have about. <br /> <br /> Your average movie guy, <br /> <br /> -Trever
