"Death Machines" takes a fairly decent premise for an action movie (unstoppable machines to kill martial arts sent to eliminate the opponents of a crime boss) and turns it into an unwatchable mess. I have rarely seen such a threatening combination of tiny budget, bad acting and inconsistent script released as a so-called "movie". It is undoubtedly the worst martial / action film I have seen in years, even eclipsing "The Ninja Holocaust" (which at least has had some energetic fighting scenes). <br /> <br /> The current "star" of the film is the white "death machine", (it is basically his vehicle), so he is the protagonist in many scenes more than his two cohorts. He's in good shape, and he's not ugly, but as an actor he is barely there - thinks Chuck Norris in "The Octagon", only without energy or emotion. This is obviously a deliberate choice by the actor and director. ..but you must be Arnold to pull this kind of thing out, and this guy isn't Arnold. <br /> <br /> The film (and the director) does not seem to find the time (or the budget) to film the scenes that would answer the basic questions that it originally asked, such as: Who was the dark figure that gave to the Asian lady with the lips marbled her orders? How did the "gang war" end? Why does the open-mouthed Asian lady decide to have her zombie killers killed? And what the hell happened that he left his dead assistant and she handled a katana like a broomstick? <br /> <br /> He manages, however, to find time to film a completely unrelated fighting bar in which a sailor (well, it looked like Popeye) destroys a bar because the juke box didn't work. He is linked only to the rest of the film, because in the process he also KOs the "hero" of the film, a barman / karate student who was the victim of the first main job of the "Death Machine" (he cut off his hand while they were killing his teacher). It follows one of the most "unloved" love scenes between the hero and his girlfriend I've ever seen. The sequel makes no sense - at the end of the fight with the bar, he is making a grimace on his wide open floppy body, and the next thing is in a "tasteful" montage of sex and love that seems to come from a Hallmark card. By the way, we never see the sailor again. <br /> <br /> And wait to see the clash between the homicide detective and his captain - it seems that the director and screenwriter never saw a scene from a movie placed inside a police station, but he heard about it second-hand and decided to include some without really knowing how it worked. <br /> <br /> The film is a textbook case of mediocre actors and theatrical level actors who struggle without decent direction. The three "machines of death" appear as clods; the "hero" knows his lines but cannot bring the film, since his character is an ineffective ineffective; his girlfriend is a charismatic void; and all other minor parts are barely watchable. All this makes a film rather scarce, but the "dragona" does more to drag the film into an underground and smelly territory than anyone else. She looks ridiculous; his small, expressionless face is overwhelmed by his ton-o-hair hairdressing wig, he wears his red silk dress like a bathrobe, and speaks with a terrible mouth to mouth that screams "he needs time with a trainer of dialogue". Poor lady - she was obviously out of her element and, as far as I know, never appeared in a movie again. <br /> <br /> Add to this a low-budget one-synthesizer soundtrack that never closes and never sounds something appropriate or interesting; stocks and lighting of bad films; to combat the choreography that is closely linked to hunger; and a general all around sadness and lack of energy in the block and in the business of the scene ... and you have a lame film. <br /> <br /> I took it as part of a collection of 50 DVD movies, so it probably cost me about 50 cents to watch it. It wasn't worth it. Feh!
