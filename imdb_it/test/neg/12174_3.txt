I am absolutely amazed that the overrated "Men's Graveyard" is among horror fans! Now, I usually welcome films that combine two or more genres of genres into one and I love almost every zombie comedy I've ever seen. To my dismay, this Italian cult classic didn't show me much to get too pumped ... It follows the unusual duties of a full-time charlatan and his retarded son, Curly Joe seems like an assistant because they seem to have primarily of the dead who jump out of the earth seven days after their initial death. He meets a widow who "amazes" with the atmosphere of a horrible courtyard and develops a brief love story, soon having sex with her on the grave of her late husband. The corpse of her husband flows alive and bites her, triggering a series of events that seem to consume the rest of the film. "Cemetery Man" attempts to incorporate every possible element, such as horror, romance, comedy, action, and completely fails in the long run. It moves along, never able to concentrate on any aspect long enough to make it interesting for the viewer, like the relationship of the paunchy companion with a living severed head, a motorcycle that rides zombies that launch out of the ground, the main character who decides to shoot random people on the sidewalk, etc. This thing is so complicated and boring that it's almost impossible to take it seriously. Of course, it is elegant and often "elegant", but even the most "artistic" type of film needs the right kind of lineage to allow it to make sense. "The cemetery man" trudges, appearing unable to concentrate on something for more than a few minutes that becomes very tiring after a while. People say "it's a more sophisticated zombie movie". Frankly, when it comes to zombies, I don't want anything more "sophisticated" than Romero ... There's a bit of blood and nudity - mainly in the scenes where he wants to play "horror movies", but not enough to compensate for its lack of uncompromising structure. Terrible movie
