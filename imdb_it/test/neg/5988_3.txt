SHRIEKER is a Full Moon production. I knew what to expect (very little quality) but I didn't expect this to be as painful as SHRIEKER would have been. <br /> <br /> It's just awful. Bad acting, confused script and direction. Annoying characters that I wanted to kill. The whole thing was probably done in a week. I have seen episodes of CHARMED that were more complex and convincing than this economic. <br /> <br /> It looks like an orphan episode of a poorly conceived TV series that no one has ever seen. It was a task to watch and I could feel my mind becoming dimmer and dimmer by the minute. Watching a movie shouldn't be hard work.
