A sister of a robust and festive brother is brutally murdered by a street gang, sending the young man to a sudden psychotic robbery. He and his friends massacre half the city to bring his sister back to life. <br /> <br /> SAVAGE STREETS was released a year after this movie and it was more fun. Linnea Quigley, who plays a costarring role in this film as the sexy (and briefly naked) girlfriend of one of the guys, also starred in SAVAGE STREETS. <br /> <br /> This movie is poor, although it offers enough entertainment and free nudity to satisfy the intended audience (me). <br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated R for strong violence, nudity, language and a bit of sexuality.
