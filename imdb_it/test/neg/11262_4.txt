I have read and enjoyed many of James Lee Burke's Robicheaux mysteries. When I read "In The Electric Mist With The Confederate Dead" was filmed and Tommy Lee Jones was in the front row, I was thrilled. After seeing him last night, I ended up turning it off with twenty minutes left, not wanting to see other people hit or beaten. Don't get me wrong, I don't care about blood and blood - I love "The Untouchables" and "The Godfather Trilogy". Maybe it was just that I had already seen "Birth" and "What Just Happened" before watching this. I know Burke's books are violent, lyrical and, especially in the case of "In The Electric Mist", they can be like the Cajun swamps he writes about, full of things that are never completely explained. In a book, that's fine. In a movie, this is confusing. Many of the previous reviewers are also ardent admirers of Dave Robicheaux, which makes it more understandable that they really liked the movie. Or they are admirers of Bernard Tavernier or both. Even though I was a fan of all the actors (and in particular of Vince), I felt that it was such a loss of talents as a whole: they gave good performances in a film that didn't hold together. Now, I say this, having only seen the US DVD and hoping that Tavernier's cut will make a big difference. The positive side: the soundtrack was wonderful. The Robicheaux scenes were perfect, just as I imagined the bait shop. Mary Steenburgen was excellent as Bootsie, as was Walter Breaux as Batist. If you read the books, you know why Robicheaux is a balanced person at the beginning of the film, and then starts hitting people with various tools. In general, I hope they filmed more of the "Electric Fog and Confederate Death" and excluded most of Robicheaux's interrogation methods, explaining Elrod's gifts and his connection to Dave, as well as Dave's to General . Then I wouldn't feel like I did last night when I turned it off, "What happened?"
