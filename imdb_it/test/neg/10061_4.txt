This is indeed one of the weakest films based on the work of Agatha Christie, a lifeless and confused mystery that clearly lacks the grace (and budget!) Of its predecessors ("Death on the Nile", "Evil under the sun ") and Donald Sutherland is a pale shadow of Peter Ustinov regarding screen detectives (obviously, he plays a much less interesting character than Poirot). The film manages to escape to the full with the power of Christie's plot (all its plots have a certain amount of intrinsic interest), but the direction is hopelessly flat. (* 1/2)
