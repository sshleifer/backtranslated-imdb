I imagine there are two ways to make a movie with children as an expected audience. You can tell yourself a) "Let's make a movie that kids will love today!" or b) "Let's make a film that I would have loved as a child!" The second approach explains why Steven Spielberg often makes films that attract a younger audience. Primary examples are E.T., The Goonies or Indiana Jones. That Darn Cat is an example of the first approach. See these flat and incredible characters who say things that should be fun but are not. The plot itself is enough for ten minutes, but instead goes on and on. And even if I'm not a child, I don't understand what in this film should be fun for children? The clumsy cops chased by a dog, the old lady with a ticking bird or the sarcastic onelineri of Christina Ricci? An actor showed a spark of talent with his very acrobatic humor: Doug E. Doug playing the FBI agent.
