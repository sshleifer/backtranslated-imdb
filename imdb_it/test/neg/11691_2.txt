A moderately interesting beginning, some beautiful scenes from sixteenth-century Japan and a promising idea. But the execution? The comparison that comes to mind after about fifteen minutes is "Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death". Really. An "oriental history" specialist who does not speak Japanese, walks on the mat without taking off his shoes and is generally as stupid as celery? Please. It looks like a student film: the sets are laughable, the acting (except, perhaps, for the title character) next to the wood, the absolutely arbitrary plot. At least "Cannibal Women" was fun! This is best looked at with someone who knows something about Japan, only to see the disbelief repeatedly crawl over their face.
