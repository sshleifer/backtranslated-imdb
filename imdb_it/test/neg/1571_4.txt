The film was disappointing. I saw him on Broadway with Bernadette Peters and she was exceptional. Perhaps while she, she herself clings to the end of her musical career, her hopelessness lands her in a role that she flaunts, reinvents and triumphs as his. Bette's song is always tied, always flat and without showing her actress skills. To be fun, this performance was dying for a stronger lead and a stronger cast, so that the others would be memorable in the absence of Bette. Another criticism: he smiles directly into the camera every time he starts singing! I know it's a musical theater, but please leave some social grace - Middler can't perform as Liza or Streisand could on a retrospective tour - out of character and out of context.
