I saw this movie once in a kiddie matin√©e at the North Park Theater in San Diego in 1959 when it was released and I was 11 years old. It was one of the three features that were shown that day. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen him since then, but I wanted to do it because I'm a movie buff and I appreciate the terrible along with great, good and average movies. <br /> <br /> What I remember most vividly is that the most sophisticated members of the public, made up of children between 8 and 15, screamed with laughter at the tree monster. <br /> <br /> A triple account in a theater showing 3 adventure films is something an 11-year-old child does not forget, but I don't remember the names of the other 2 films. (One starred in George Montgomery and David Farrar.) UPDATE: The other two films on this triple bill were much better. They were "Watusi", 1959, starring George Montgomery and David Farrar starring and "The Angry Red Planet", 1959, starring Gerald Mohr and Naura Hayden. Ms. Hayden has also written a couple of books on health and fitness.
