As much as I hated the movie that follows this series, I can at least say that Zangief was fun. The animated series is probably one of the worst things ever produced. Animation is quite often inconsistent, although it remains constantly bad. The shape of a character's face is even able to change drastically in the same roll. Even the script and vocal acting leave much to be desired, as most of the cast seems as talented as the cast of a third-grade drama. Characters like Cammy and DJ are so forced in the stereotypes of their nationalities that the episodes that contain them are almost physically painful to watch, not that the series is not painful on a regular basis anyway. The plot lines of the episodes seem to strive to reach new lame levels at every turn and are so full of holes in the plot that it surprises me that they have had time to show commercials. Honestly, I wonder if someone pays to advertise during the show. Besides being a bad series, it's an even worse adaptation of Street Fighter. Many of the characters keep the film's failed adaptations. Examples include Ken and Ryu as idiots cheaters (although Ken should be rich), Blanka being a friend of Guiles Charlie and Chun Li as a reporter. It takes talent to take something bad like the movie and make it worse.
