Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) is a university student with some serious anger problems. His family was brutally killed when he was a baby by a monster, and now he brings out his anger on everything and everyone. <br /> <br /> So when his professor (Robert Englund) begins to show signs of showism, he learns that he must control his anger and use it for good instead of evil, and fight the creatures that have haunted his nightmares since that fateful night. <br /> <br /> It really gains its B rating, but what was nice to know was that it didn't focus on poor CGI graphics with B rating. In fact, 0% of the movie was CGI. The monsters were actually decently put together, and although the plot was missing, it was somehow watchable ... if only for once.
