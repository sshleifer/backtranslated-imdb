There is so much wrong with this movie. Greico with a girl's wig, old-time scientist staring at the car, a tough guy Jones standing behind with a three-shotgun, spiders with tentacular hands and bad teeth, etc. The make-up was so ugly and they only had a few spider people visible on the screen at the same time (the technique of Aliens Cameron could have been used) instead they chose to dress every spider person in the same way ... badly. The nice thing about Greico's acting is that he has his weight with every syllable as if he were counting how many words he can pronounce in the script. It amazes me that with all the information out there about DVD comments, there are still people who make movies. This film could have been worse, as I don't know. Oh and one last thing. I'm looking for a SCI-FI movie. People who run that channel should not be allowed to procreate to continue the nepotism that exists in Film and Television.
