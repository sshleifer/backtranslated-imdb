In 1913, at Carlton Mine, Addytown, Pennsylvania, a cruel mine owner uses poor children in exploration and after an explosion, a group of children is buried alive. Nowadays, Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal illness when family savings were spent on treatment. Without money, he moved with his daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) to an old house in the mountains that belonged to her husband. Karen is advised by her neighbors to stay home during the night, and Sarah feels there are zombies in the area. When Emma becomes a friend of Maria, the mother believes she is an imaginary friend. However, when Sarah's friends are attacked and eaten alive as zombie children and Emma vanishes, Karen and Sarah chase her next to mine. <br /> <br /> "Wicked Little Things" is not a totally ugly film: acting is good; the trick is creepy; and the cinematography and the soundtrack are excellent. However, the story, and consequently the script, are very weak, indeed a bad collection of clichés. The beginning is reasonable, with a widow moving to a house in a remote location because the family spent all her resources with the patriarch's illness. But when it comes, by coincidence, the little zombies attack people without consequences, for example, families don't look for missing persons. Then the evil Mr. Carlton arrives at the place with the most disgusting attitudes, a typical cliché that will eventually die. There is no explanation as to why the children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after killing Mr. Carlton. When Sarah is running away with her mother and says she's tired and can't run anymore, it's one of the stupidest lines I've ever seen in a horror movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Zombies"
