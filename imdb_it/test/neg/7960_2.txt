Water shows the plague of Indian widows in the late 1930s, says at the end that the problem still exists largely giving statistics in the end, refers to Gandhi several times in the film before finally having a scene that paints it and does nothing extraordinary or new in the film. Yes, cinematography is pretty impressive but it can't be the soul of any movie for me. <br /> <br /> India has had several problems like many other nations, but has eliminated many of these problems in general. What if a film is made about racism in America in a particular year that ends with "the number x of Americans continues to experience racism today". <br /> <br /> a) How relevant it would be, and, b) How would such an extraordinary thing be represented in the cinema. <br /> <br /> A vision I read from Deepa Mehta about the interview was that this film is interpreted as a voice for the marginalized everywhere. From the reviews I've read every where, the common thing I've heard is how the director did a great job and was brave in bringing a problem to the world. The film speaks more of a specific problem faced by a company (and has freed itself from reforms in general). <br /> <br /> I see nothing shocking about the film. Furthermore, the film lacked soul and moved between the plots of Chuiyya and Kalyani. Sarala, the young actress from Sri Lanka, superbly played the role of Chuiyya and this was the only thing that struck me about the film, unfortunately.
