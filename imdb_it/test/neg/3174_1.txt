This film is tremendous. It can be said that all the actors are embarrassed to be associated with such a terrible film. There are obvious budget constraints but with a little attention and attention to detail the film could have been much better. For example: take a look at the scene where Mickey goes to the morgue first and is talking to his pathologist friend while the murdered taxi driver lies on the slab. You can actually see the body breathe! What, couldn't they afford to take an extra half decent that could hold their breath for a 2-minute scene ?!
