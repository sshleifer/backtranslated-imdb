How anyone can praise this version of the raw film after seeing the wonderful WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor is beyond comprehension. <br /> <br /> MAE CLARKE's Myra is very different from the role played by VIVIEN LEIGH in the remake. He plays a common American girl with a Brooklyn accent and the "Yeah" answers are a bit strident when a less vulgar character is expected. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (credited in the credits like KENT DOUGLASS) is incredibly unlikely as a soldier who hits her, no matter how many times you abandon her. BETTE DAVIS has no role in anything in one part. <br /> <br /> Their melodramatic clashes in the last twenty minutes of the film are incredible (extravagant fragments of exaggeration) - even if it is a cruel version of the story when the sound was only a few years old and the silent acting was still fashionable. <br /> <br /> Simply awful. And it ends abruptly with the loss of life of Clarke during a bombing on the bridge. The End. <br /> <br /> It has none of the wonderfully shaded performances in the 1940 MGM remake, including a support cast in pounds. Instead, this is mounted with low budget production values ​​(and I mean a shoe string budget) with no subtlety. And in the scene where Myra tells the aristocratic lady why she doesn't have to marry her son, Roy, there's no courage in the preview. It simply says "I got it on Waterloo Bridge". Explanation above. Nothing daring there. <br /> <br /> In summary: for once, the original is not the best version by any means. VIVIEN LEIGH and ROBERT TAYLOR have never been outdated like Myra and Roy in the tender and classic 1940s movie.
