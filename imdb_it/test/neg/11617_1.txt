Wow! I'm really sorry I watched this picture ... Funny, I agreed to see it only for my wife, who endured the torture of seeing him about half an hour before retiring, while I was in front of the TV, but only to give to eat the masochist in me and me because I wanted to know if this film was so bad in its entirety or if there were some redeemable aspects that could alleviate the feeling that I felt like a fool for watching this **** called Two Girls and a boy ... <br /> <br /> Everything in this picture is wrong, totally wrong ... because the initial, absurd, premise of two women stupid enough to be with their common boyfriend, until the 'horrible, but merciful, fine, without forgetting the horrible acting of the three actors ... Do not believe the voices, the acting of the addict is very bad and I do not see how Graham has made a name known within the film industry. .. <br /> <br /> I wonder why, after the producers saved some money with only three actors and one position, they didn't hire a person to write the script instead of putting a monkey to do it with his ass ... <br /> <br /> At least, I felt a little good when I destroyed the DVD and threw it in the trash ... Anyway, I liked somehow (and just a little) the brunette actress, something of Natasha, but it wasn't enough to beat the incredibly stupid and crazy premise of Face-off (changing face), so Two Girls and a Boy basically go ... <br /> <br /> Stay away from this ****!
