I took the DVD yesterday and first of all it started badly, it's a 4: 3 movie, and it keeps getting worse, the acting is so bad and the movie itself is predictable, I was like watching the movie and I told myself : this will happen later and guess what happened? just ... <br /> <br /> if you want to see a good action boxing movie, don't watch this you'll be disappointed in this low budget movie like I did. go see Ali in his own way!
