I saw this film as a preview before the inauguration of Venice at the Telluride Film Festival. Your reaction to it will depend largely on your attitude in respecting Shakespeare's text. Among the positive aspects: Pacino offers really good performances like Shylock; Lynn Collins is a beautiful portia; and the film has a sumptuous appearance. <br /> <br /> The negatives are predictable. "The Merchant of Venice" is probably the most difficult of all Shakespeare's plays to be staged today, largely because we look at it through the distorting lens of 20th century history. The romantic plot with Bassanio and Portia presents no problem. The character of Shylock does it, because we lack the original frame of reference of the Elizabethan public. Shylock is at the same time a human character with qualities and human motivations and an abstraction of the ruthless quality of the Ancient Law. When he says "Doesn't he have the eyes of a Jew?" he is a character; when he proclaims "I will have my bond!" he is an abstraction. The long passage on music and cosmic harmony in the final scene (here shifted and cut into ribbons) is the key to the game, as it restores universal harmony after the disruptive and evil forces (the test scene Shylock) are been expelled. It is possible to give a psychological sense to the character of Shylock by demonstrating that he is gradually becoming crazy and turning into a monomaniacally when the scene of the test moves - the key is that at some point he must stop being understanding. <br /> <br /> Pacino's performance almost does, but not quite. The film fails to make a decision: on the one hand, there is the right movement in the character of Shylock, and on the other there is a large quantity of extraneous films of Jews being abused and Venetian whores with stuffed nipples (Undoubtedly to show the decadence of Antonio et al). Shakespeare was not writing a social drama similar to the Ibsen; he was writing a comedy following the classical model of breaking the social order and the restoration of the social order, symbolized by marriage, with a theme of love against right at the center of Shylock's plot. <br /> <br /> In this, the meaning is that the film is a parody - Radford's surgery on play and direction almost takes us away from what the game really means. (Taking the beginning of the final scene, cutting off most of it and moving it before the process scene is the most extreme example.) There are other significant difficulties. Jeremy Irons, a good actor, plays Antonio as if he were a sedative overdose. Joseph Fiennes is nice but superficial like Bassanio. Most of the actors, with the exception of Collins, Pacino and the actor who plays the Duke in the process scene, mutter their dialogue. <br /> <br /> The final verdict? A nice movie with some decent performances. It's not Shakespeare, it's a bad interpretation. Not really worth your time or money - even if Lynn Collins as Portia almost redeems him.
