Wow, another film by Kevin Costner. Postman, Tin Cup, Waterworld, Bodyguard, Wyatt Earp, Robin Hood, even that baseball movie. It seems that he does specifically film to be the center of attention. The characters are almost always the same ... heroism, defects, greatness, fall, redemption. Yes, within the first 5 minutes of the movie, we should all be in awe of his character, and build more and more from there. <br /> <br /> And this time the story ... story? ... it's just a collage of different films. You don't need a spoiler; you saw this movie several times, even though it had different titles. You will know what will happen before it happens. It's like mixing an officer and a gentleman with Backdraft, but both are easily better films. Watch Backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be made ... and also to see how a good but slightly underrated actor, Russell, plays the hero.
