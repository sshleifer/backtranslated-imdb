Having not read the original book or seen the previous film, and without knowing anything about the plot of any of these or the current film, I came to this film with an open mind. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to know where to start a comment on the movie, because the whole thing seems so confusing. It seems that in the film there is a point or a message or something like that, but what remains is completely obscure. <br /> <br /> The effects were fantastic and very well judged. The idea was created very well with the motivation for clearly defined time travel. Anyway, it was downhill from here. <br /> <br /> All time travel seems to have only the vaguest link to the research that was drawn at the beginning. There are some nice ideas, but they seem to be isolated episodes that really don't flow and make the movie look bumpy and lost. At one point one wonders if the main plot of the film is the fate of the moon. <br /> <br /> When Hartdegen arrives in 802.701 AD, the film becomes very frustrating because he seems unable to discover anything important about Eloi, and while it seems clear that there is something to be discovered, that which is annoyingly elusive. This is a rather strange change compared to the previous instances of time travel and one wonders why all this was suddenly abandoned for what appears to be a completely new story. So many things happen that there should be an explanation, but there's no discovery. I really wanted to know what the film was "doing", what was to be discovered, but without success. After reading a summary of what happens in the book at this point, it seems that there was an unconvinced attempt to make it present in the film, but it was so simplified and "softened" that the meaning and context are completely lost. <br /> <br /> Just as we hope to finally discover where all this is at the top, the film suddenly takes another significant change in direction, and becomes a mindless action movie with no real action. It is as if at this point the director had simply given up, taking care to give meaning to the film. By now countless significant things have happened without any explanation. Hartdegen does not take the opportunity to return to the past on two occasions without cause, and then suddenly loses all interest in time travel for no reason. The film ends abruptly when Hartdegen decides to stay with the Elois. In summary, after a good start the film is very disappointing. Too much time is spent on the adventures of Hartdegen before arriving with Eloi. However, the worst part of the film is what I think is the most important part: setting the situation with Eloi. The whole point is completely missed, and this undermines the rest of the film. After this, the film focuses too much on effects and action and all attempts to return to the meaning and core of the film seem forced and out of place. With so many things happening without explanation, the film just seems to get lost and lose direction. However, the ending in which Hartdegen decides not to be more concerned with time travel is the most inexplicable of all. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the whole movie looked like a collection of unconnected incidents. The meaning and context have been lost, although the open hole where it was should be very obvious. What was so frustrating in all this, though, is that there was clearly so much potential here: it wasn't a bad movie at all, but it could have been so easily better. The start was very promising, the time travel was fantastic and it would have worked if it hadn't gone for the bribes, and Hartdegen's experience with Eloi could easily have worked with some of the right questions, and if there hadn't been a this temptation to "belittle" and simplify. I would just like to have a time machine to travel back in time and advise against mistakes.
