Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear! <br /> <br /> Thinking that movies like this have been made, and probably enjoyed by thousands of drive-ins, actually upsets the mind. How innocent we were in those days. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly, this film sucks. The hero is so wet that you can hear his soft and wet steps in every scene. My Lord, but it is only one of the many horrible and terrible actors that appear in this turkey. No wonder MST3K chose it. The story, as it is, is centered around an escort driver (who is so incompetent, you really believe he is the actor driving the car) who gives up and "enters with the wrong crowd" Oooooh! Scary stuff. However, the wrong crowd turns out to be the motorcycle equivalent of The Three Stooges and their slut "hand-me round" of a motorcycle girl. As an example of how disgusting this whole thing is, writers have evidently destroyed their brains to get a scary name for the biker gang - if four people can be called a gang, that is. The result? The band is called Satan's Angels! I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> Such terrible acting and dialogue, along with ridiculous scenes, create a wonderful film about beer and french fries. But otherwise it's just the worst kind of garbage. <br /> <br /> Like I said. Once, this could have been considered good. But today it only makes you laugh (and shudder) every minute that passes. Avoid it if not for a good laugh. And make sure you're also half-drunk!
