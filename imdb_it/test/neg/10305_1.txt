The first season was great: good mix of work and brother and friends at home. actually it was a pretty funny show. <br /> <br /> Now he shows up again and the brother and the two sexy girls are gone - and the whole thing revolves around the airline. Even the old man who runs the company went downhill - too over the top, where he had been perfect before. <br /> <br /> That and no longer Sarah Mason - one of the most beautiful girls in Hollywood. <Br /> <br /> This is what happens when you let some execs get their hands on a show. You can almost see the meeting "the old man is fun, focuses on him, makes him go over the line and does everything for the airline .. it will be a crazy version of the office!" Anyway, no hot polls, no clock.
