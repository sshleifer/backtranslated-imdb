Oh God! It could be a very interesting film and indeed it is. I'd like to give him a 5, but I give a 2 for my vote. Why? I saw it in a theater! Watch this movie on DVD or on TV! The shooting is really POOR !!!!! Continue to tremble all the time, in a completely insipid frame! <br /> <br /> It is really painful to see this very interesting film in a cinema. You get seasick quickly and you have to make a big effort not to puke on your neighbor's seat! <br /> <br /> It's really a pity, because the story is mounted in a non-linear fashion, which is rather rare (and a great idea!) for a documentary. <br /> <br /> Watch this at home!
