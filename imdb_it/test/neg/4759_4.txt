A ridiculous comedy given by a direction of agitation of the arms. I love one of the comments here: "It couldn't be done today". Well, neither could "The Philadelphia Story" without a car or two. Nevertheless, does it mean that the image is worse for wear to be old fashioned? I don't think "Susan Slept Here" was good for any generation and should spoil peacefully in the memories of Debbie Reynolds fans. There is nothing sparkling in this story of a screenwriter who clings to a much younger girl for the "script". Dick Powell makes his appearance on the farewell screen in what must have been an embarrassment to him. Reynolds is pale. Produced by a Harriet Parsons - who gives her famous mother Louella a number of plug inane. * 1/2 from ****
