I love watching a good bloody yellow. Unfortunately, SOLANGE is definitely not one of them. Its long. Very long. The story is tacky and has very little sense even though it is very obvious. The script spends so much time on murders and girls, but spends almost all the time on the killer. This leaves a big hole in history: we could see a group of young women taking a shower together, but we can't understand why the killer decided to kill those girls. Yes, what happened to Solange is terrible, but we were practically in the dark when, because the [boring] murderer decided that it was worthwhile to challenge those bad girls. It's all so invented that I couldn't figure it out. <br /> <br /> As for the appearance of the film, once again boring. Nothing memorable about it. The actors? Boring. The script? Resolutely boring. The whole "torrid" love story between the teacher, the blonde and the student was really embarrassing. What planet do they live on? The music? Boring. Salta.
