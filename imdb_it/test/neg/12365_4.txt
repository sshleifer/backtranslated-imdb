With David Arquette, in the lead role, you would immediately think this is a stupid movie. Well, it's a stupid movie with a horrible script. But the F / X, that is the eight fanatics of the legs, makes this movie a hoot to watch. A tribute, even if from the silly side, to those great mutant characters of the 50s. Arquette and Sheriff Sam (Kari Wuhrer) have called for help to combat the giant spiders induced by toxic waste that devastated their small town in Arizona. The cast also includes Doug E. Doug, Rick Overton, Leon Rippy and the charming Scarlett Johansson.
