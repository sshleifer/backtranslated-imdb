This movie is not worth the time it takes to insert it into the VCR or DVD player! Michael Dudikoff and Lisa Howard are two bounty hunters in love, yet they are total opposites. It is ambitious and organized, while it is relaxed and totally sorry. <br /> <br /> In this film, the villains are chasing Jersey Bellini (Dudikoff's character). This opens the door to bad impressions of Godfather, ridiculous fighting scenes and Tony Curtis who plays the most effeminate looking mafia boss I've ever seen! The ending must be the most ... incredible scene I've seen in a movie in a while. I think the Terminator, also Matrix, has a better chance of being true of this ending! This film only knows about convenience. The script must have struck someone as totally ridiculous. Still, the green light was given for this piece of dung to be made and left on unsuspecting public. I saw this film with many other people who all agreed that we had been deceived. No one in the group could say anything good about the movie, except that it was over.
