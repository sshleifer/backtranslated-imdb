The first film by Jackie Chan in which we do not see the character of Chan we know. This is Chan in a story of traditional revenge of the kind that has been cloned and re-cloned by countless producers and studios throughout Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China. It's a very serious story that shows none of the humor and warmth that would have catapulted Jackie Chan towards the super star. It is also clear from looking at this that if he had not reinvented himself the odds we would never have known him because his career would have been painfully short. As a film for its merits this is a beautiful but rather insignificant film. I was watching him in the middle of an everyday martial arts movie marathon and he would have mixed in with all the other movies I saw that day if I hadn't noticed Jackie in the movie. Honestly, I don't think the film is really worthy of attention (there are too many other better variations), except if you're interested in seeing where Jackie Chan started.
