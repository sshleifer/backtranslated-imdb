Totally cerebral action made in the Philippines. This belongs to the way of Filipino films that have tried to pass themselves off as American films on the international market. After a rather boring start, the film never leaves and never disappoints. It's actually a rip-off of the worst movies Chuck Norris ever did: an American prisoner in Vietnam is brainwashed by soviets who implant a microchip in his brain so it's programmed to kill the Pope, then the President of the United States. One of his old friends (played by the brave B-movie Max Thayer) is sent to stop him. Absolutely ridiculous action scenes, putrid acting (Nick Nicholson's performance as the evil Soviet commander is a must see!) And an implausible plot compensates for one of the happiest action images ever granted to the general public.
