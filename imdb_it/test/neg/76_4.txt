A dark horror show filmed in the Everglades. Two couples spent the night in a cabin after being a little uncomfortable with the hostility of the locals. Who, or what, are the blood pursuers? After a while they find out. Look at the character of the village idiot who cackles like a chicken, it's certainly strange.
