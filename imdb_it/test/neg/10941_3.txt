Oh my God. I never thought it was possible for me to see a thriller worse than Domestic Disturbance soon, but here it is. Armed with putrid texture, horrible editing, forced acting and indecent 'style' (sorry, I have no other words for this), Sanctimony is the kind of film that almost forces you to re-evaluate an entire genre; that is, this film is so bad that even the thrillers I condemned as complete failures now seem a little better. <br /> <br /> Now, not only is Sanctimony a terrible film in itself, but it also succeeds in the difficult task of tearing better films and doing a pathetic job with it. Since the main titles - nothing but a clear attempt to reproduce those of Se7en - I had the impression that something didn't smell good. As soon as the film started with a series of quick hip cuts full of bloody images and stormy colors, I knew where the smell came from. <br /> <br /> It turns out that two policemen or rather policeman Jim Renart (Michael Par√©) and policewoman Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin) are investigating a murder in Vancouver. A serial killer, known as "Monkey Killer" (which threatens and scary nickname, uh?) For his work methods he killed a lot of people. You see, this dice apparently works following the proverb "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil" and cut the eyes, ears and tongues from its victims. So far, six eyes, six ears and three languages. In a very ingenious way, Renart and Smith discover that the Monkey Killer will probably kill three more people ... well, because he probably would like to complete the number 666. So suddenly the film focuses on Tom Gerrick (Casper Van Dien), a man of young, successful, good-looking business with a terrible character. And this is where the theft of American Psycho kicks off. <br /> <br /> So we follow the lives of the two policemen and the young psychopath, none of which is interesting at least, until they finally meet. Along the way, a nightclub where Renart barely misses Gerrick unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory: Renart goes to the back of the disco, because ... well, just because the script tells us it's a suspicious place; then, with a single punch in the stomach, does Renard get rid of a great guard who blocks the path and the guard is never heard again? Does this scene affect anyone else as completely unrealistic? <br /> <br /> However, after another murder, Gerrick turns as a witness, but Smith and especially Renart immediately suspect that he could be the murderer. In the typical Basic Instinct style, Smith gets some dates with the young businessman, assuming that she can discover her true identity. <br /> <br /> I won't ruin the ending but it's simply an embarrassment; there are contradictions, some holes in the plot, problems that are never solved, and especially there is a last scene in which a brutal mass murder, which should be shocking and sad, comes out so superfluous and senseless that frankly I can't imagine how anyone couldn't laugh at it. <br /> <br /> At 87 minutes, Sanctimony is really pushing it. You never care about a single character, because they are all so flat (not to say boring) that you know exactly who is the first time you meet them. You are never attracted to history, because the scenes are connected by weak plot devices when they are absolutely useless and out of place. The acting ranges from the medium (Van Dien) to the decidedly atrocious (Rubin, and most of the supporting cast); music is an abysmal and generic techno, and photography is one of the worst I've ever seen. Obviously, like any such fiasco, we are given some free nudity. <br /> <br /> 3/10
