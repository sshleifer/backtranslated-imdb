VIVA LA BAM This "Jackass" spin-off focuses on the (obviously scripted) adventures of Bam Margera and his friends (Johnny Knoxville, Brandon Dicamillo, etc.). This show, while having a good deal of coarse comedy and crazy acrobatics, focuses mainly on Bam's torture of his parents. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say, Bam, but ... you're not as nice as you think you are. This ego-engraved show is not only painfully little fun (and yes, I liked Jackass), but also narcissistic beyond imagination. The too stylized intro concludes with Bam who coldly explains that he will do "whatever the frap" he wants. What do you think about doing something that is actually fun? I liked "Jackass" for what it was worth. The work with the camera was horrible - any idiot could have made a better show with a video camera in the parents' garage - but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never seemed boring among crazy, dangerous or just plain disgusting that the pals have performed. <br /> <br /> Not so with "Viva la Bam". We follow our hero while playing pranks on his friends and torturing his relatives, but he never feels like a real hobbled-up comedy. The stunts and jokes are slightly funny, but presented in a tedious and boring way that can barely make you smile. <br /> <br /> "Viva la Bam" is a poor spin-off of what does little but feed Margera's already too big ego. I do not recommend this show lame and without imagination to anyone.
