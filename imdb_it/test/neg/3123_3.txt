I won't lie, I rented this movie because it was an "arty" movie with some possible explicit sex. I had that scene and the breasts of Catherine Deneuve (briefly shown), but the rest of the film is just the usual long pretentious European art film with phrases like "I had a mother or father, I don't know" (paraphrased) . Usually delivered in long soliloquies. <br /> <br /> If you are curious about the "art" transition to porn, it could be an interesting aspect, with the use of the fast forward button (I was still too slow!)
