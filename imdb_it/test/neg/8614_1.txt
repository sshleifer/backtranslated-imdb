The plot is simple: an American couple is on vacation in Thailand. Somehow they are attacked by the "almighty" Chinese vampires and the girl is kidnapped by the great vampire leader. This is OK so far. The girl's partner is left to look for her. And now the horror begins. He comes across a strange group of semi-vampires or something (they just drank animal blood). These vampires have been in conflict with the villain for about ... 800 years. However, with the help of "good vampires", the boy starts looking for his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Now begin the fighting scenes, what karate movie without a fight? Another thing I noticed is that vampires are very bad boys. I mean ... a vampire is an old-fashioned guy (he's alive since ... forever), he has a style. There are also modern vampires, but in this movie vampires are ... strange. How, come on, they ride a bicycle, they are all dressed in leather and they destroy everything in their own way. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that you can clearly see that this film is a low budget movie. The script is boring and the actors are not too talented. The music is pretty good, but the effects are not great. <br /> <br /> To summarize the film is not great, but if you have a free afternoon, look at it and tell me if I'm right or not
