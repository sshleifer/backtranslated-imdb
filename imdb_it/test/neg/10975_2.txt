I bought this video on a launch table at the video store waiting for a good cast in what was advertised as an award-winning British sex comedy. I think I should have read the best print. I rarely write a panoramic review, but here it goes. <br /> <br /> These actors in gay roles really play with your memories of many much more noteworthy movies. This comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors, the audience going to the theater and all the good films that contributed to their reputation. <br /> <br /> I repeat: is the joke about the actors' fucking another respectable character on the screen with this scurrilously trash movie? Can the reference to the classics of Austen "Pride and Prejudice" and "Sense and Sensitivity" be something else? How much of a political statement was to produce this melodrama using these stars? Are we going to simply consider it a miserable lay-down that all actors are gay and then letting their on-screen role-playing affect our lifestyle is also accepting their private homosexual relationships? I'm sorry, but I don't think so. I say NO to this.
