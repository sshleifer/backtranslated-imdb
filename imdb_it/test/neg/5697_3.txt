normally, I'd say I loved this movie. Not for acting, even if it was OK. Not for the script, which was so-so. The reason I normally loved this movie is because of the intense action, which starts from getting going and doesn't end until the credits roll.but, the problem with this movie, and I felt it was a big problem , it was the horrible CGI.it seems that they have run out of money and could not complete the effects shots. many of the effects look like glasses in their hardest form. Obviously they didn't have enough money to finish the film, they shouldn't have released it. I discovered that the effects of insulting.it seem obvious that they don't have. I don't care about creating a decent final product for the consumer. If it were not for this, I would give this film a much higher rating. My vote for Air Panic is a 3/10
