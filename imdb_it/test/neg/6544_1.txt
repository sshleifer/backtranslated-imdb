This low budget independent film redefines the word "blah". It will surprise most of the fact that this word can actually be found in the dictionary, defined as: "nonsense ... not interesting, boring, lifeless". The film redefines the word because I should add to these four words: "PC crap", "pretentious on a pathetic level" and "useless". <br /> <br /> The film is so difficult to be "hip" and "in touch" with the contemporary behavior of beautiful people fighting for je-ne-sais-quoi and "think" (do they think?). There is hardly any plot to talk about, although there is one to sleep for. The most sincere and politically correct things about it are like a white woman is a great friend with a young black stallion, the black street-saxophonist with a penchant for advice and advice wise-wise and black psychic fat. Isn't it nice how races can get along after all? ... Ahhhh ... In the end, the woman reads "poetry", which is nothing but one of her boring "dear diary" annotations. He gets a standing ovation (!!!), even though in real life his listeners would be more likely to fall asleep in deep sleep. But this film has little to do with real life, even if that's where it should happen. In real life, his reading of "poetry" would only get standing ovation if he had the sensation of including juicy sexual details. "And then I rubbed his huge penis against my sweaty, impatient, pink vagina ..." Hello! What's worse, the lead actress has a dozen scenes where she gets wet or fucks with someone, yet they never had the good sense to show her the breast, which was clearly the only thing left to save this mess. <br /> <br /> The black guy and the blonde, who are separated by a meter, get hooked: they look like an economic variant of Rodman and Madonna (as if the last two weren't already a fairly cheap combination). Nicole Eggert, quoted by Howard Stern in her book "Miss America", is the blonde. Stern writes about Eggert that he removed her implants. Yet I believe that when they took his implants, they also accidentally sucked most of the meat from his flesh and his muscles, because she seems hungry here. <br /> <br /> The sax player in a scene develops like an Ali angel; resembles Al Roker who advertises cakes for angel cakes.
