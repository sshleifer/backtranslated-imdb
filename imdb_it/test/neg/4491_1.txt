I suspect that this commission will soon be full of comments from exaggerated people praising "Dear John" as a "pearl" and a "rollercoaster ride" and all the other empty words that the target audience of this film typically uses. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely not the target of this film, but I don't even like romantic dramas, as long as they're well done, so here's my goal in the film. <br /> <br /> It's not so good. <br /> <br /> It's not even a bad movie. But the plot winds, the development stagnates where it should have gone on (right around the center, to be precise), and as for the ending ... it almost seemed like they were running out of ideas so suddenly they said, "Hey, let's film a last scene very quickly, let's put on a sentimental soundtrack and end up like this. " Even the beauty of Amanda Seyfried cannot save him. Channing Tatum also gave a good interpretation, but it can only be done with an imperfect script. <br /> <br /> Speaking of music, it's unbearably predictable and kitsch. From the skeptical folk singer with a smoky, irritatingly acute tone (certainly chosen to attract the majority of college-age girls who will go to see this film) to the combination "sparkling strings and piano", he only annoys those who pay more attention to the film in his together rather than his "feelings". The film has a good start and the main conflict that introduces us in the second act was all very promising. So it was part of the second act itself, as the story unfolded. Then the movie just dropped the ball. Besides that, I should give spoilers. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" is not a bad movie, but it does not work as it should. If you want to see a really touching film about prolonged love waiting to be reunited, go see "Notebook", which was really superb.
