Thursday 9 June, 18:45 Broadway Performance Hall and Saturday 11 June, 13:45 Broadway Performance Hall <br /> <br /> Bless the independent director. Without them we would see nothing but Spielberg, the Farrelly brothers and movies based on old sitcoms. They are risk takers. They gather the fruits of success and suffer failures. Max and Grace is definitely a failure. The merit is deserved by Michael Parness for going to the scene and having made his first feature film which, he said, led him to bankruptcy. It might be better to be on stage if this film is an indication of what to expect in the future. Even though everyone warned me I went to see Max and Grace anyway, hoping to find out something they didn't have. Starts pretty well, a party for Max in his parents' house taken in warm, soft light, the camera floating in interesting corners. As soon as we see that Max hanged himself, an obvious rip-off of Harold and Maude, the whole thing goes straight into the tank. How could he have done so unnoticed in the middle of a birthday party? After all, how could two mentally ill and committed psychiatric patients decide to get married and do it with the blessings of all interested parties? In the Q&A after the film, David Krumholtz suggested that the whole story was the surrealist dream of his character Max. This story is so badly written that the comment seemed more an excuse. The film does not seem to have been made with little money, which is another reason to be so disappointed with the results. What is meant as amusing is not, but instead is offensively bad. Continuity is neglected, lighting is terrible and the effects seem cheap and forced. The BPH had less than three hundred seats and was surprisingly full, but in the first half hour I saw at least thirty or forty terns. At one point Grace, played by Natasha Lyonne, laments her inability to die. I found myself thinking the same thing since I never left the credits before. If Krumholtz really thinks this is "one of the best scripts" I've ever read, he seems to need to recover his readings. A terrible waste of talent and resources, this is the worst independent I've seen from Bubba-Ho-tep.
