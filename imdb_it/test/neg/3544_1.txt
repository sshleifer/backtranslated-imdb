While watching this movie you immediately realize the approximate elements of a standard TV movie ... even if through the image the plot changes (if you are bold enough to say that this film has a plot) are from the book and not original ... and with all the movie KEPT GETTING WORSE! <br /> <br /> Candace Cameron Bure, famous for her role as DJ Tanner in the big TV show Full House, is not very convincing as Possessed twenty something .. trying to avenge Possesers' death. I think she's a good actress ... not just in the thriller series. <br /> <br /> The shooting was petty, and as I said the stale plot ... even though I looked at it I knew I was in cheese, I had no idea how much worse this movie could have ... <br / > <br /> I absolutely don't recommend this movie ... unless you think Filmaking and bad writing are what you are looking for
