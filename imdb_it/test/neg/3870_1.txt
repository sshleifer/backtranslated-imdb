The great Yul Brynner, who won an 'Oscar' and who starred in blockbuster movies like "The Ten Commandments", ended his extraordinary career with cheap backlot films like this, "Sartana" and so on. Regret, indeed. One should have pity to see him do his best to make this thing stupid. Gone are the days when he was surrounded by Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Eli Wallach, on 'The Magnificent Seven' and walked under the famous Elmer Bernstein soundtrack. Sometimes it's hard to make a living by being an actor.
