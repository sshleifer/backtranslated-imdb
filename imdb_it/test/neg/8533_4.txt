This film has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half. Few movies can actually give me a cold chill. This has done. Few horror films give me a sense of terror. This has done. He made me guess. I cared about history. I cared about the characters. The acting was decent. Unfortunately, about halfway through the film, the story does not have many good indications that it can follow. It becomes clear that everything that is beautiful about the plot will self-destruct. It does. What builds in the first part as a great concept of horror moves away from horror and towards the absurd. A plausible fear turns into a series of implausible reactions from the characters. The story ends with disappointment. While this movie looks complete, there is a free end that could be configured for a sequel. The film is not good enough for a sequel. This film deserves to be seen in the theater, but don't expect to be stunned. This is more suitable as a movie to rent. Probably not a movie you would like to own.
