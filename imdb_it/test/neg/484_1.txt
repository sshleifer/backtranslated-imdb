I was subjected to this terrible excuse for a TV movie. I only saw it because I don't have the cable and my only other choices were Golf, College Basketball or local news. The plot is very generic and has no substance I could see, not to mention that it had a big flaw in my eyes. The main character, Dr. Sorensen, is a washed-out astronomer who believes an asteroid called "Nemesis" will hit the Earth, causing all life to cease. He bases his belief on his discovery of cave paintings by an Aboriginal (I'm sure I did the wrong one wrong). The paintings show an apparent timeline, which shows significant events throughout history, such as the construction of the Great Wall of China. All events are shown in perfect chronological order and the last image on the timeline is the destruction of the Earth. Now for me, if the painting showed things that had really happened, why would the great Doctor have believed he could somehow change what was going to happen? Apart from that, the film moved with extreme formidable precision. There was nothing in the film that surprised me completely. The actors weren't very good and on some occasions I felt that they didn't even take the film seriously to make enough effort to try to convince me that the characters deserved attention. The entire film was driven by clich√©s and a real waste of time and money. I would suggest Armageddon on this piece of shit every day. At least Armageddon has some good acting (compared to this), not to mention the eye candy that is Liv Tyler. Now that I think about it, Golf is not so bad .......
