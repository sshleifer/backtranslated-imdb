- could contain spoilers- <br /> <br /> Clearly, anyone who has ever made this film must have had many connections. I can't see it in any other way. What surprises me most is that no one used the name of Allen Smithee, and more surprisingly, all those who participated did not use this name. <br /> <br /> However, where to start. The bad dialogue, the bad customs, the rude film, the involuntary comedy, the extravagant characters and more inconsistencies of George W. Bush's university career. I don't know what was more fun, the boy who loses his arm because of a snowball, or the slow-motion scene where all the little Jack Frost were killed. Furthermore, one of the great lines of all time has been pronounced in this film. "How do we know it's him?" As if there were another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs! A great field film, but overall a bad movie.
