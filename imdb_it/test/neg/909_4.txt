The story begins in the house of a little girl who will have a birthday party and both her mother and her father seemed rather quiet and reserved to each other. They continue to give her daughter her gift, which is both, and made the expression on her parents' faces funny as they gave them this gift, it was almost like, 'I hope she likes it'! There is a murder in the film and Catherine Mary Stewart (Julia Kerbridge), "Reaper", 2000, is involved in the case due to family ties. Julia is working hard to become a doctor and this particular murder upsets her whole life. Rob Lowe, (Kevin Finney), "View From The Top", 03 is a neighbor in Julia's same house and eventually sleeps with her and tries to help her in other ways. This is not a bad movie, but it certainly is nothing to go crazy about, unless you like a film location in Canada and a beautiful Catherine Mary Stewart, originally from Canada.
