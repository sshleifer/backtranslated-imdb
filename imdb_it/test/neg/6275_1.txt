After seeing Steven Spielberg's version of War Of The Worlds in theaters, I became passionate about the subject. I could think back to my favorite parts of the film, people were vaporized, people panicked, fire, explosions, it was all so beautiful ... <br /> <br /> So a few weeks later I go into my video store, and I see David Michael Latt's version of David Of The Worlds on the shelf. "He couldn't have come on DVD, so fast, right?" I said to myself. I read the back of the case and saw C. Thomas Howell instead. "Oh, I remember from The Outsiders!" So I thought, it may have been an attempt. <br /> <br /> I was wrong, I was wrong. As soon as I saw the credits, I saw them take forever, I knew something was wrong. Something would have disappointed me in this movie and so it was. The whole film is like a cheese sauce that has been left in the fridge for 10 years. From acting, the special effects (things that are foolish and stupid when people vaporize turn into orange skeletons) and, above all, have not even come close to being as interesting as the Spielberg version, in fact, the plot was boring , and there were only 3 scenes of destruction! How disgusting? I ended up being so bored, that I had to go fast in the film until I found something that looked even remotely interesting. And nothing really was. <br /> <br /> My advice: don't even touch this film, stay 100 meters from it. Spielberg's version is out at the end of this month, buy it! But please, please, please! Stay away from this asshole before it chokes us all!
