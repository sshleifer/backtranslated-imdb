"R Xmas" scrutinizes the lives of a bourgeois family married to narco-distributors during the holiday season. There is no story here - just a disjointed collection of events. Ferrara seems to start from the juxtaposition of holidays and domestic life with the narcotics they sell in New York, jumping back and forth between them. Players seem to improvise and give off from time to time to create an unconvincing watch. Overall a bad effort is not worth the time. (D)
