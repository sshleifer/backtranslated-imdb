Frankie Muniz plays Jason who is a high school student. His biggest problem is that his life is built on small or big lies that get him into trouble most of the time. However, he cannot escape from his teacher and ends his creative writing tasks shortly before the deadline. While he is cycling fast to deliver the tasks to the professor, he crushes himself in a car. While explaining the situation to the grumpy man (Giamatti) in the car, he gives him a ride to his school. But the problem is that Jason leaves his homework in the car, the other way to say it is that Marty Wolf (Giamatti) steals it. <br /> <br /> After a few months Jason goes to the cinema and sees a trailer that takes him baffled. Because the story of the film is based on its tasks. He tells his parents but obviously they don't believe him. His father especially uses words that insult him. Jason decides to go to Los Angeles and finds Wolf to tell his father that Jason is not a liar. When Wolf refuses him, Jason acts and ruins his life. <br /> <br /> This is the short story of Big Fat Liar. Well, as a children's movie it could be a carefree, but there are some mistakes that might even ask if it's possible. For example, get a small sum of money and go to LA with a friend to solve the problem, having access to the highly protected home and office of this film producer, creating a telecommunications system overnight. Does it seem credible? It is not so. Well, this is a film for children, but children are not so naive. <br /> <br /> Big Fat Liar offers some small pleasure to its target audience. Unfortunately, I'm not a big liar to say this is a good movie. ** outside *****
