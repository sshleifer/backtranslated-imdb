Even a horrible 1 is too much for this movie, every shape from beginning to end has made you shiver. I don't think it would be possible to cram more clich√©s in one piece of immensely inexperienced film waste. <br /> <br /> Block of cells of prisoner H meets Thunderbirds, hell even Virgil's expressions were more like the life of his son. <br /> <br /> I haven't even finished looking at this and I'm here now .... Oh no, the clap of applause of 3 actors and a background made by a child with premiere adobe. This is really the end of my "I started so I finished watching it" phase. Oh, joy, the credits have come to save me. (and relax)
