"Yesterday" is a difficult film to evaluate. The cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9/10. The plot is gritty and real and does not compromise. But the translation of the story on the screen through the actors did not match the work of the camera. <br /> <br /> As a person who was born and raised in central Africa, I appreciated the authenticity of the look of the film and the honest representation of everyday life for the Zulu. But this and the operation of the camera are not enough to advise the average spectator to see this film. It takes an appreciation of real cinema and not just the love of movies to see the purpose and strength of "Yesterday". <br /> <br /> Unlike the 1980 film "The Gods Must be Crazy", which was a comical look at an African culture that met modern technology, "Yesterday" has no intention of appealing to any crossover audience . The film simply is not suited to the common Western mind - and I doubt it was intended for the Western mind. The scenes are long and slow, the editing has no rhythm for a world of instant gratification of over 60 miles per hour. Dialogue is not cleaver or witty, it is real. Movies about health crises don't make the best entertainment and this film is not entertainment, it's education. <br /> <br /> This film is best seen by those who know, appreciate and love the way of life and culture in sub-Sarah Africa. If you lack a broad enough worldview to understand other cultures, particularly African cultures, you should skip this movie. Don't waste time with it. Go see "Talladega Nights" or "Larry the Cable Guy" instead for your vision of crossed cultures. <br /> <br /> I give him a 4 for most of those who would like to see the film but don't have an accurate understanding of African cultures. For viewers who appreciate films about human experience anywhere in the world, I would give a 7.
