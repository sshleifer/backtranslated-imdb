This is a film about a black man who buys an airline and turns the company into an African-centric over the top airliner. They even portray the owner not only by checking the airline, but also by checking part of the airport's air terminal. One day this guy wins $ 100 million dollars the next time you see him, he's walking all over the airport acting like the airport owner. Everyone calls this film a parody, but nothing about this movie screams parody! This film is a flop and will remain forever in Wal-Mart's $ 4.95 folder. <br /> <br /> I can't even understand why MGM wasted $ 16 million on this film. This film does not even guarantee the straight-to-video status. Writers (one black and one white) should be banished from Hollywood forever. Not only do they overlook stereotyped blacks, they portray them as ignorant human beings. I would be ashamed to go to a film that constantly humiliates me. Don't waste time in the video store, in the wal-mart, on pay-per-view or on a Sunday afternoon when the film is shown on TBS.
