For many years Ed Wood's classic "Piano 9" was considered the worst film ever made. Forget it The Roller Blade Seven is infinitely worse. The cast is composed of famous siblings and almost famous or has been actors and actresses. The plot along with the budget and script are non-existent. The execution time is not the classic Ed Wood style of using repertoire material. Instead there is infinite slow movement and repeated action. And as for The Roller Blade Seven there aren't even seven! <br /> <br /> You need to see this movie just to know how bad it can be to make a movie. Give hope to independent directors everywhere.
