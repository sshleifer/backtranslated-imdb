One of the most pleasant surprises of this Technicolor 3-stripe short was that a dancer who appears here was called Maria Gambarelli! I wondered if Blake Edwards named the character played by Elke Sommer in A Shot in the Dark after this forgotten artist (even though the spelling of the Sommer character's surname was actually Gambrelli). I saw this on YouTube mainly to see an appearance of Judy Garland as we look at her in profile with her two older sisters singing "La Cucaracha". This was the highlight for me who showed some dances (like that of Mrs. Gambarelli) that were fun and a lame comedy between Andy Devine as a great fighter (yes, right!) And Buster Keaton as the owner of a bull who provides one who is obviously a man in animal costume. Only a funny part of those two is when they cry - with Buster supplying the handkerchief to the "bull" - during the sad part of "La Cucaracha". Even the lame one saw Ted Healy without his minions who took care of a crasher who continues to trade Healy with other movie stars. (The same Heally didn't know that Zeppo had left the Marx brothers since he put "Quattro" between "The" and "Marx"!) Speaking of a Marx, it was interesting to see Harpo without his wig, even if he wears a hat to hide his bald head. Also interesting to see Ida Lupino among the cowgirls at the beginning, even though I recognized Toby Wing on his side in Homicide at Vanities last year (at least when the presenter Pete Smith identified her). Oh, and Smith himself wasn't funny with his essay narrative. Other famous stars that you could recognize or not could also be in cameos and not all of them are M-G-M contract players! So with all that he said, La fiesta de Santa Barbara is worth a look for anyone curious about Judy Garland's first film appearances or the first use of Technicolor with 3 stripes.
