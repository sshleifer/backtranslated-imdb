This film is a nearly complete waste of time. I'm studying the book for my English A level, and the film only contributes one way, which means the whole scenario is set in a rural idyll. The acting is made of wood, the filmography is laughable, and the so-called dramatic scenes in the film have resonated most of my class (including myself) in their lyrics. The book, although not my favorite literary choice, is better than the film, and the soundtrack is simply irritating. Don't watch this movie unless you're looking for a timeless, quality storyline that's turned into a waste of meaningless media.
