I saw this movie a few years ago, and the man I never want to play golf again. I mean that the ninja apparently have no respect for the game of golf or the way it has evolved. And I'm not talking about "victimless" things like creating a scorecard. No no: based on what I saw here, they shamelessly massacre cops and golfers alike in the sacred grounds of the country club. Judge Smailes would have turned to his grave. And do they repent for these sins? No no, based on what I saw here, the typical response of a killed ninja is to take the body of a shapely phone repairing woman and seek revenge. I find it morally reprehensible, and needless to say that, after seeing this nonsense, I not only stopped playing golf and talking on the phone, but I also decided to stop feeding the homeless.
