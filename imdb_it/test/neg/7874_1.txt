Ugh. Stephen Baldwin. I never noticed it until I found the DVD at home and saw its name in the credits. Double ugh. What's worse, it's the NAME of this low-budget, unreasonable, wandering and aspiring shooter. I mean, where did they find the boy to write this rejection? Driving a caterpillar in the LA City landfill, hoping to get into the game of cinema? The whole plot is a ridiculous situation built up on ridiculous premises. Baldwin is as convincing as a poster boy for American Gothic, without pitchfork. His entire acting repertoire seems to need the potty and then seems to have found it. <br /> <br /> Here, there are people: bad script, bad acting of unnamed actors, low budget setting and a hero who is as convincing as a girl looking for a cookie customer as a hero action. It's too late to get my money back on the DVD, but you can save yourself ... unless you're one of those who likes to watch dogs for a laugh ... frankly, this is too boring to be funny.
