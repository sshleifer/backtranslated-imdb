Someone can give me a reason why only an American dies in this film, and when he does, it should be a very exciting scene, yet when Operation Delta Force team kills hundreds of Russians in slow-motion action scenes, or Thousands of Arabs, even in slow-motion action scenes, should cheer and say "Take this, non-American monsters!" I know I used a lot of "slow-motion action scenes", but that's because every action scene in this movie is, you guess, slow-motion. Each of them ... And this team should be called "Invincible Slow-Motion Bullet-Dodging Force", since they seem to have supernatural powers that help them dodge bullets. And if this supernatural power fails, they have a sort of superpower of regeneration, which is all they need to kill the entire non-American army that stands between them and the victory. At this point, nobody cares because they were put to sleep by another ridiculous slow-motion action scene ... I mean if they're not laughing out loud because of bad acting, good sense of dialogue and incredibly poor story. This is what I did ... The cast is made up of unknown actors, who will probably remain unknown because they don't even play characters. They're just playing guys with guns (and, let's not forget, superpowers) ... The only quality is that the special effects aren't surprisingly so bad (even if they're in slow motion) for a TV movie ... But it does still crap ... and at the same time it's so bad that it's okay ... OK, maybe eventually it gets a bit too repetitive ... <br /> <br /> 25%
