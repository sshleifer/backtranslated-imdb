Okay, so Gus Van Sant wanted to remodel Psycho in color so that he could take it into the modern audience, which would probably go into cardiac arrest if they were ever forced to watch a black and white movie, while forgetting that both "Clerks" and "Schindler's List "were shot in black and white and are great films. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the same narrow-minded people who would not like to see a great film because they are in black and the whites are the same people who would not like "Psycho" anyway, because they don't have a murder of sex every two minutes. And the murders are not the macabre blood / guts / blood / bone that has become accustomed to people since they saw "Halloween", "Friday 13" and "Nightmare on Elm Street". This is why the remake of "Psycho", almost exactly as it was originally intended to not work, because it is really interesting only for people who are fans of the original. Everyone else is watching him to update them until the next sequel to "Scream" is released, and for this reason they will be disappointed. "Psycho" is based on suspense and mystery, not blood and courage. (And just so no one thinks that I should be an elder if I like older movies, let me make it plain by saying I am 21.) <br /> <br /> So if making the color film was all that Van Sant wanted to change, why not just color the film and get it back? I mean, what's the point of making a movie again if you don't change * anything *? The least he could have done was to put his own director on it, rather than simply copy Hitchcock - or better yet, hire a new writer to adapt a new script to the original "Psycho" book. But it seems that Van Sant could not decide whether to redo "Psycho" * exactly * or not. This should have been an all-or-nothing project - or redo the film exactly or do it differently - but as it is, this film is about 95% the same, but with a few touches that don't seem to have any purpose. Like when Norman masturbates while spying on Marion who strips. It doesn't serve the plot at all, and the only reason he put it in was because he * could *. He meant "Hitch couldn't show people that he was masturbating in 1960, so I'm going to do it." Whoopee, big problem, like I'm so shocked to see someone masturbate. And what the hell was the point of showing individual frames of clouds and farm animals tucked into the crime scenes? And then he leaves * an important scene outside *, where Lila and Sam meet the sheriff outside the church. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, using the exact same script, the whole film seems a bit anachronistic. The opening titles say that the year is 1998. So what about a dress looking for 60 years of Marion or the parasol she carries with her? Why do Marion and Sam have to have their meetings in a hotel room, when these days nobody would be shocked by what they are doing? Why are there no air conditioners in Marion's office? Why doesn't the Bates motel have TVs in the rooms and apparently there is no automatic lock on the doors? Why does the sheriff have to ask the operator to connect him to Bates's motel? This is why using the exact same script was a mistake: changing only a few words here and there was not enough to modernize it. He needed a complete reworking. <br /> <br /> While Vince Vaughn did a good performance like Norman, he didn't really seem to fit the part. Part of what made the original "Psycho" so disturbing was that Norman had that innocent boy next door, so nobody could believe he was capable of such horrible crimes. With Vince Vaughn in the role, is anyone really surprised that Norman was a psychopathic killer? <br /> <br /> Having said that, I can understand that Gus Van Sant was obviously a fan of the original film "Psycho", and he wanted this to be a tribute. This is not a bad movie, but the problem is that this could be the only exposure of some people to "Psycho". I really think you should only see this movie if you've seen the original. Since I'm a fan of everything that has to do with "Psycho", I bought a used copy of the remake, which I could watch occasionally. The original film was a filet mignon, while the remake is a hamburger. But even the filet mignon would become boring if you did it every day, so it's nice to have a burger once in a while, for a change.
