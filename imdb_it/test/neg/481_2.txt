It's so fake! The plot looks like a generic adaptation of the average blaxploitation film. The common themes of blaxploitation like racism, oppression and fighting for the integrity of your community are outlined in such a simplistic / superficial way. And the jokes are not even funny! Dolemite does these monologue routines of comedies that are really painful. All the people around him deliver this canned laugh. Even the soundtrack sounds like funk. For a far better comedy in a blaxploitation try "Coffy" and "Friday Foster" with Pam Grier. For a more realistic blax experience, try "Black Heat".
