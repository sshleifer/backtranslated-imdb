It amazes me that someone can find Pauly Shore funny: it's basically a joke that becomes stale * real * fast. He has his own little "California" vocabulary and a series of limping jokes. Above all, it's just hateful. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I saw this film because I was sick and there was literally nothing but infomercials, otherwise I would have turned it off after 30 minutes. However, the film could have been fine if Pauly had just finished his speech and played it as a comedian instead of, well, Pauly. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm sure Pauly fans will like it anyway - but if you're not a Pauly fan, stay away from this pot manure. <br /> <br /> I had to leave this comment after seeing that another user actually gave this movie a 10/10! (Maybe it was Pauly !!) Personally, I gave it a 3/10 because they didn't have any shots in mike-in-frame, I didn't drop the camera, and the support cast was pretty good.
