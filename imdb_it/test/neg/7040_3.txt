Two escaped prisoners come out of the woods and shoot two campers in the head. This is the first scene, and it startled me, fearing what was in store. But at the end of the first half hour I was swept away by the flood of images. Not because I was worried about any of the characters, but because I was upset that the film was execrable and I was curious to see how low it really was that it could sink. <br /> <br /> Frank (Remar) and Rosso (Woolvett) are the former prisoners. After killing the two innocent campers, they cross the woods and make their way to the isolated cabin of Dean Stockwell and his two sons, the lawyer Keith and the homosexual stranger Behr. The fugitives initially pretend that their car has failed and they need to use the phone, but little by little they reveal their identities. <br /> <br /> Well, it seems that the territory is familiar so far. Maybe "Desperate hours" or "Fun games". But - wait - the gay son is in league with the two. It seems that Stockwell, after discovering his son in the act of red-carding with another man named Billy, kicked Billy and threw him out. Billy continued to die and Behr now blames his dad for death. And indeed, Dad is something of a Neanderthal man when it comes to paraphilias, the fact that he was just found cohabitating with a secretary, despite it. <br /> <br /> Behr's sorrowful behem has just searched and searched, looking for someone else who had known Billy, someone with whom he could share his despair. He turned out to be one of the fugitives, and now Behr is determined to see them at their freedom. <br /> <br /> After all this turns. People speak. Speak and speak. They talk all the time. And NOT the two crazy killers who can't wait to put one in their eyes. No, the dialogue says something like: "You were so scared of something inside you that you even took your SON away". That's Behr, the young gay man who talks to Stockwell. It is as if an afternoon domestic drama had its genes mixed with a killer thriller in a sort of transformational device or cocktail shaker. <br /> <br /> The only real performance is given by James Remar as the most talkative and talkative of the two fugitives. And this mainly because of his gruff but fluid baritone, which sounds like Lance Henrickson's, and his wide guppy lips. It's easy on the eyes and ears. <br /> <br /> Dean Stockwell gave decent performances, including his priceless bizarre turn in "Blue Velvet", in which he was my supporter, but here laziness, advancing years, or slow direction has shaped every move and every expression in a stereotype. It is as if he were reading the indications of the stage - "Looks surprised" and "shouts angrily" - and following them to the letter. There is no surprise in a cart. <br /> <br /> If the gay son, Jason Behr, ever blinked, it must have been while I was blinking at the same time because I missed him. He has a long neck and only one expression in his instrument. Woolvett as the secondary villain fades into the paneling with pine panels. The lawyer's son is Robert Glen Keith. I hope he didn't quit his day job. <br /> <br /> The direction is pedestrian, the functional staging without being the least innovative. He is sometimes confused. I lost track of where they all must have been, while the killers go around the porch of the cabin and the family locked themselves in with a rifle. Furthermore, I could not understand how Stockwell could explode through the cabin door, hit Remar and throw him backwards from the porch, and Remar could simply stand up, dust himself off and come up with an irritable answer like "Ok, two can play that game". But why go on? Watch it if you have to.
