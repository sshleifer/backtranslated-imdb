I haven't seen this movie in years, the last time I did it I was really drunk after 5 pints of tenants at my local Witherspoon, but even then it seemed pretty horrible to me. this movie is pretty awful compared to the other critter films, the first two were pretty good, 3 were pretty crap but miles better than this. The story takes place 53 years after the critter's 3, where Charlie, the bounty hunter of previous films, was found floating in a pod in space by a crew of some sort of space miner, em, people and taken aboard. Once aboard the last eggs of the creature left in the galaxy that Charlie brought with him from the Earth open to crack and we have creatures aboard the spaceship, make an obvious "Alien" and lots of terrible FX and you're practically have this movie in a nutshell. the only good thing is when we are reintroduced into UG (or so we believe) that he is now a villain and wants to preserve creatures instead of destroying them
