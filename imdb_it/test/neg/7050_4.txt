I haven't seen him for many years. The acting was as good as I started this time, I thought, "Great! Another movie that I misjudged as a young fool." But then the theme started to be clear and I felt the same way. <br /> <br /> It was Hollywood, the home of glamor; so the concept should not be a surprise. But it's such a condescending concept that I feel like I have to take a shower after seeing it. In short, it tells us that even physically ugly people can look beautiful to each other and also feel attractive. <br /> <br /> Dorothy McGuire is as nice as the home heroine. It looks like it was filmed with minimal makeup. Robert Young is wounded in the war and feels scarred. His parents can't even bear to look at him. He seems to have all his faculties and in part, the notions of disability are out of fashion. <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall is available as a blind pianist. His character speaks is silent tones and is omniscient. <br /> <br /> The best interpretation is given by Mildred Natwick as owner of the residence of the title. It is bitter and severe but not made of ice. His story is much more interesting and credible than that of McGuire and Young.
