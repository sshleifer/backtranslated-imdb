I've seen this movie several times, it's definitely one of the cheapest movies of the eighties. So, I think many viewers would surely change the channel when they run into it. But if you're in a big trash, "Dragon Hunt" is made for you. The main characters (the McNamara Twins) sport big mustaches and look so ridiculous in their camouflage clothes. One of the best scenes is when one of them is hit in the leg and is still kicking his enemies in nirvana. This film is really horrible, but then again, it's a great band for the holidays!
