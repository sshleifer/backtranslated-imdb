There was a time when the Alien series was a success with the third installment, Alien 3, which showed the promise under the guild of a young and fresh David Fincher. The first Predator was a box office success mainly due to its history, the "at the peak" star Arnold Schwarzenegger and director John McTiernan (Die Hard). The films Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator have been very successful and have created massive followers among movie fans and science fiction fans. Probably Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection should have marked the end of both franchises, but the studios were not discouraged and saw the opportunity to indulge the voices among the fans and combine the two. Step in Paul W.S Anderson, Alien Vs Predator, and now the Strauss brothers (graduates in visual effects, not even directors or writers). The problem was that allowing these deep and revolutionary creations of the Sci-Fi genre to fall into the hands of a mediocre director and now the newcomer as a director has brought nothing more than bad words, embodied by incompetence. After witnessing Alien Vs Predator Requiem (AVPR), die-hard fans will feel sick to their stomach that this series could be worse. <br /> <br /> An example of the cinematic deterioration of this franchise is in the opening scene and is likely to cause nausea among the fans. The film begins with an alien making its way onto the Predator ship, spouting out of the predators' chest, growing to become a fully grown Predalien and knocking down the Predator craft (which now seems to have much less Predator on it than it does) were at the end of Alien Vs Predator) and all this happens with the ship still in the Earth's atmosphere. Once the ship has crashed, the AVPR quickly resorts to low-cost plot methods and basic narrative conventions, it doesn't dare to use twists or subversions served in the two original films. The strenuous plot advances with a boring rhythm, punctuated only by the neighboring conflicts of Alien and Predator and when we run the risk of getting bored we are treated either with a seductive blonde in a bikini or quick shot. The AVPR is plagued by an endless series of continuity errors and plot holes with minimal or non-existent narrative explanations, namely members of the public who oppose an elite military unit or Predator that does not adhere to the laws established in the previous editions. This is a film that has a total disregard for its predecessors, breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a sequel and by doing so one has the feeling that it is trying to impose itself as an independent characteristic. Independently the film has no heart, no conviction or soul, and with reference to the other films it lacks even the most elementary continuity. This is exemplified by the excess narrative of the film as it undermines the basic premise of the first Alien. Because if the species had been encountered before, then those of the first Alien movie would have been more skilled and not so badly prepared when they met them. <br /> <br /> In a movie note the film is close to being terrible, I felt pushed in some places to make a flashlight shine on the screen, the lighting was so bad. Through the use of such gloomy and obscure effects could the public feel like they were cheated by some action? which is ironically its purpose and also indicates the film's lack of budget. As in all science fiction films, a scene normally emerges as the most memorable, in this case it is probably the hospital impregnation scene, since it draws lightly from the themes of the original Alien by literalizing it. Direction is poor, weak performances and the screenplay march. AVPR is the product of a conveyor belt system in which ideas and techniques are assembled by ineffective people and therefore the finished product distributed among cinemas. This is personified by the absence of bloody death scenes and drawn blood battles because the certification will not allow it ?? a lower certification that reaches a wider target audience. AVPR was purely a commercial enterprise and nothing else.
