People could say I'm tough but I can't help it. The film is so bad that I was absolutely stunned. The first movie was pretty bad if you ask me. He was very exaggerated and foolish but this, despite the gruesome scenes, has a really stupid story. They actually went to investigate Kayako's past and found that she had a mother (who speaks miraculously English) who was an exorcist and "fed" evil spirits with her daughter. Stupid? Yeap. OK, it started with Kayako who was a normal housewife who was having an affair with a guy and she died. This part is still OK. Because of this moment of anger, he became a vengeful spirit that kills anyone who enters his home. Acceotable. Now, his killings began to lengthen a bit where she actually had the opportunity to travel through Tokyo just to finish her victims. (His victims were traveling, right?) This struck me a lot. Now, if a ghost could really do something like traveling to a country without paying public transport fares, I wouldn't mind being. Ask someone to come and kill me * snorts *. And to top it all off, the ghost that was once depicted as an avenger (In Ju-on: The Grudge, which was much better than this garbage) is now depicted as a specter who really enjoys and feels it is his mission to finish people. Things got worse (for me, the viewer) when the ghost made its way into large locks of hair. I mean, ??? If a ghost had such power, I wouldn't seriously mind being one. I have never liked the films that describe ghosts like MONSTERS because they are not. The overall results are simply ugly. Like The Grudge 2. With a better plot and less exaggeration, this show would have been better
