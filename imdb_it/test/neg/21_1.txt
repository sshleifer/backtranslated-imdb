Bloody Birthday is a totally trash slasher movie from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> I found the acting quite good considering the genre of the film and its obvious low budget. I don't know what was going on in the film industry, but it looked horrible. Too saturated. Maybe this is a bad transfer to DVD or maybe it was always like that, I don't know. <br /> <br /> There really are no saving qualities to talk about. There are some dead but not really bloody. I wouldn't worry about doing it if I were you. The best thing about the DVD was the 15-minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg that was very funny and honest. He had nothing good to say about director Ed Hunt and admits that the film was a failure, but he would like to do it again while he thinks he has a decent plot. However, he died in 2004, so I think it will be up to someone else to face this challenge. With the way things have gone in the last few years, it doesn't surprise me, there is at least one remake a week at the cinema these days. It couldn't be worse than the original one, I suppose, but I couldn't care less if it was redone or not.
