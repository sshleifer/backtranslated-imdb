Yes, it's true. That movie is a horrible piece of ... you know what. Almost all fans of Sapkowski's books in Poland think the same. The truth is that Polish cinematography cannot afford to produce fantasy films. It is a pity when you compare "Wiedzmin" and "Conan the Barbarian" for example. I hope no one outside Poland can ever see this nightmare.
