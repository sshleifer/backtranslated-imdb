This image hit the cinema screens on June 6, 1980, played by Stephen Macht in the role of Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber in the role of Captain Comelius Butt, J.D. Hinton as Buzz and played by Playmate of the Year Dorothy Stratton. The photo begins with the infinity space of the police in search of alleged criminals. The ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown spaceship. Enter Sergeant Thor and his companion Buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. When they can't, they call Captain Comelius who orders his crew to fight back. Join the splendid Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina who is a man-made robot. One hour some thoughts on this image. This film was a stupid plan and it's one of the reasons I'm not involved in science fiction. If you are a science fiction fan, you would have noticed that the laser sound effects were borrowed from a first science fiction movie called Battlestar Galactica, which was broadcast in theaters in 1978. Many of the door sounds you hear in this film come from another science fiction broadcast in 1966 entitled Star Trek. Now, for the reason that I bought this movie, Dorothy Stratton. She is gorgeous in her one-piece dress. I think her talents were wasted on this image and she should never have been involved in that garbage. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents too would have been wasted. In the picture alone I give this movie 1 weasel star and on Dorothy Stratton I give her 10 weasel stars even though she didn't deserve to be put in a trash film like this.
