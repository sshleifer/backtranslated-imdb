The book is fantastic. It's one of my favorite books ever. The film, on the other hand, is incredibly tasteless and bad! When I heard that Damon would play Ripley, I knew this production was doomed. But I didn't expect it to be so bad. Actors go around and behave very inconspicuously. Except for the law (and he too is guilty of showy acting), all the actors here are almost amateurs. Speaking Italian and moving your arms or hair should not be considered as acting. Damon is mixed. He's too rigid for a character who should be a chameleon. Paltrow is forgettable and Hoffman interprets yet another effeminate and slimy character. Talk about typecasting. <br /> <br /> What is really unforgivable in the script (written by the overestimated director) is that it completely renounces all the details of the book and provides many of its own, and none of them works! The addition of jazz music is totally WRONG! I imagine that the idea of ​​Minghella on Italy in the late 1950s and early 1960s is overshadowed by the images of Chet Baker wandering the Italian countryside and spreading love. Yes, Minghella is a true visionary. The film is so bloody. That stupid scene when Ripley crosses the narrow street full of mirrors. Very ridiculous. Yes, we understand !!! Every point or detail reaches a mile away, so that the film could give the public the false impression of having psychic powers. We know, for example, that the character of Blanchett, introduced at the beginning of the film, will later return only to complicated things. And the soundtrack is sometimes totally inappropriate. Capricious when it shouldn't be. The film goes on for too long and in all sorts of useless directions. There are too many boring characters that populate the landscape (many of those who weren't in the book). This movie is bad! Really bad! <br /> <br /> Apparently, Minghella's son told his father that Ripley's novel was his favorite. Mr. Minghella then proceeded to direct him as a favor of sorts to his son. Well, the director has achieved what he has set out to do: Mr. Ripley's talent, with his Hitchcock aspirations, is a film strictly made for 12 years!
