It would be promising if it were a student film. He never seems to know where he will go next, as if they had decided each successive scene while they were shooting the film. As a result, a lot of repetition and a fast pace. There is an absolutely confused procedure with which ghosts influence people in this world: it involves the internet, phone calls, a computer experiment, a suspicious student, retired behavior, red rooms, dark spots and suicides. Good luck understanding the connections, or when a character is still a ghost or just acting strange. The characters are barely sketched, which could be OK, but they are completely uninteresting. It is too long and ends just when it reaches a promising scenario, although the conclusion is meaningless. Weakest moment: when "the boss" sits down to give some inconsistent advice.
