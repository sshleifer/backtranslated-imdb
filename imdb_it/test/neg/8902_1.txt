The endless repetition of the evil World Bank, IMF, Globalization and Americans are blamed for all the problems of Africa and the film is long, about two hours, but it seems longer. The French occupied Mali, the country where the film takes place, for centuries, but they are only peripheral villains. <br /> <br /> One does not learn enough about any of the characters who really care what is happening they are completely marginal to the preaching, which goes on and on and on. There is no plot, character development, no humor (apart from Bush and Wolfowitz, but it's almost a scam, it's so easy) and the production values ​​are mediocre, no redemption there. <br /> <br /> it is surprising that a film can spend two hours preaching on such an important subject and transmitting absolutely null information. The Irish ballad "I was dying, and then the famine came" has more content. <br /> <br /> The film is boring, the subtitles are difficult to read, there is no real content on the subject of the film, and the propaganda is relentless. <br /> <br /> Skip this.
