This could be probably the worst movie ever made, up there in a league with films like "Howard the Duck", "Plan 9 From Outer Space" and "Ishtar". I don't understand why I decided to watch this film, because it was a waste of my life. Also, I don't understand why one would like this movie, regardless of their sense of humor. Acting is among the worst I've ever seen, as is writing. The characters are all stupid and there is no fun scene in the whole movie. Tom Arnold is probably the worst actor ever - this film proves it. There is nothing worthy of this film. Don't rent it, don't look at it, don't even say it sounds interesting. It's bad enough I've seen it.
