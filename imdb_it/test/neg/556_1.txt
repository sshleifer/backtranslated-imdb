Hillary Swank is an unattractive job in this unattractive piece of film work. Pat Morita, desperate for work, any kind of job, agreed to resume her role as a "karate teacher" and once again bring her Karate brand to the big screen except this time, Hillary "skank" Swank is the student. <br /> <br /> I can only see Hollywood writers excited about the idea of ​​having a "tormented, spoiled brat" female take the role from Ralph. The film does not work at any level and is boring at all levels. There is nothing interesting here and not even a lesson for someone to hold onto. The film was made without any thought of making money because it is so ugly. <br /> <br /> We would be delighted to spit out all the actors in this film for being involved and having writers blacklisted for their miserable and offensive efforts.
