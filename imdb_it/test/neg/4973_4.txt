This is 2008, who really has a concern in the world for a guy like DB Sweeney, even if it wasn't a big deal. <br /> <br /> Two Tickets to Paradise is a story that is well and truly described where three friends set off on each of their personal circumstances. Again, a proven plot. The problem with this film, apart from the fact that it is "so terrible is irresistible", is the script. <br /> <br /> Cliche after clich√© three guys do the same things you saw in every other road movie ... and blow up the white house. <br /> <br /> The acting work of John C. McGinley is superb, especially compared to that of DB Sweeney. (His career is dead, from late here, even though I heard that he is moving to TV, good for him). Furthermore, John C probably has the least terrible character in the film. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is so generic that it looks like a 1993 third-category film, or the Jeff Anderson movie Now You Know (it also brought me back a few years, but at least that was more fun. ) I mean, yah, I think I liked a part of it. But the nerdy guy is annoying, DB tries to be a cool guitarist (with some rough influences, like some of the worst of classic rock) who has some strange relationship with a stripper, and John C is a player who is wife and child leaves him after his father's death, as well as a visit from one of his bookie henchmen. <br /> <br /> I keep thinking about improving this movie. But I think burning the script would have been a good start. <br /> <br /> But, as I've mentioned all this time, it's not the worst movie ever. And every time I see McGinley in a starring role, I'll take it. I hope you start making better projects.
