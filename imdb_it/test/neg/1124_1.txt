** WARNING ** MISERABLE FILM ** ATTENTION ** The day before Christmas Eve, some dice cases decided that we would be entertained by sending this movie as "entertainment" on TV. What was God's name thinking of? <br /> <br /> This film is full of horrible humor, despicable acting, nasty jokes and a disaster of a plot. Randy Quaid plays the idiotic role of Cousin Eddie Johnson. Eddie is a brainless person, incapable even of the simplest tasks. He was fired because he was as stupid as a brick, but the company he worked for was sorry and so they sent him and his family on vacation. But being as stupid as he was, he managed to turn the vacation into a disaster. <br /> <br /> Overall it's the worst movie I've ever seen, and I still have nightmares about miserable acting and even more miserable jokes in this movie. It's so sad that you almost have to see it ... But don't do it. The nightmares I have are worse than all the other nightmares you've ever had. Trust me ... I hate this movie so badly because of its acting, humor, "jokes" and history. The only positive thing was the beautiful view. <br /> <br /> Well, that's my opinion, and I certainly hope everyone agrees with me ...
