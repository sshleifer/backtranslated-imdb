I wish I could give this a Zero. Of course, I will admit that I also mistakenly assumed that it was Spielberg's version. An ingenious marketing ploy that released him right now and was prominently displayed in the video store. However, I was willing to give it a try anyway: I wish I didn't have it. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? I read some of the other reviews here and I have to say that I disagree with those who think the acting was good - I'm even sorry Thomas Thomas Howell. None of the performances was good. Not one. <br /> <br /> Even if the acting was decent, the dialogue is terrible! "Ginormus" and "dick skinners" don't really cut it. <br /> <br /> Now as for the story, it was terribly adapted and must have been taken care of by a 5 year old child. The main character is constantly stumbled upon in situations that are very convenient - or at least appear this way due to how the film was assembled together. For example, he is trying to reach a place called New Hope to find his brother. During a short break someone randomly gives him directions to New Hope. What the hell is that? When he arrives in New Hope he happens to run into his dying brother. Then there is the part where he traveled far from his destination for days and it just happens to bump into the car in which his wife and son traveled. Was he going in a different direction than the one where the car ended up where he was? He has a black backpack that appears and disappears randomly throughout the film. There are parts of the film where the characters are just waking up in the morning and then two seconds later it is night - or worse the twilight of the next day. I can't even forget the main character and the preacher who falls through the floor of a house for no reason - we won't find out later that an alien has landed on the house. Which reminds me of the moment they walk and suddenly they find themselves standing under an alien they haven't noticed. What the hell, aliens are like two stories high with huge bodies and multiple legs - how could they not hear it? There is a point where a foreigner kills a citizen at random, presumably spitting a kind of garbage against him - but you never see that the stuff makes him appear on the boys' faces. The special effects in general are terrible. The whole film is like a bad "train accident". When we finally get to the end, after this guy is trying to go to Washington to find his family, they appear. No search without questions anything. Oh, there you are, I'm so happy - in the end. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if my review wanders a little but this movie was so bad that I had a hard task of organizing my contempt. Please save time and don't look at this pile of cinematic stench. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I would have preferred to have a root canal - it would have been less painful.
