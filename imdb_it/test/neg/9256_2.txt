Of all the movies I could have chosen, this had to be it. When I was in New York, I went to a Times Square store and among the hundreds of DVDs I had chosen Joel M. Reeds Bloodsucking Freaks (1976) and this, in a double feature DVD that also included Seeds of Sin (1968) , did I regret it? Read on to find out. The film opens on an island (near Milligan's Staten Island house) where two lovers walk along with a huge parasol apparently made of paper, at some point gives her the top of a weed as a gift. From nothing Colin (Hal Borske) appears as a retarded hunchback that kills both without reason. After the opening credits, to which were added some of the worst headaches that induce the music I have ever heard, at least he got me used to it because it is used constantly throughout the film, three pairs are presented to us. The wives are all sisters, Vicky (Ann Linden) and Ricard (Fib LaBlaque), Veronica (Eileen Hayes) and Bill (Don Williams) plus Elizabeth (Carol Vogel) and Donald (Richard Ramos). Each receives a letter from a lawyer, H. Dobbs (Neil Flanagan) who requests a meeting so that he can read the will of his deceased father. Dobbs informs them that they have to spend three days in their "Crenshaw House" childhood home and fill it with "sexual harmony and conjugal love" that he had never known because of the tense relationship between their father and mother. Informs couples that the will is highly irregular but legal. After three days the inheritance will be resolved. Couples are also told about servants, Martha (Veronica Radburn), Hattie (Maggie Rodgers) and the retarded Colin, who welcomes couples by killing and biting pieces of a rabbit in front of them. Later that night to the left of the dead rabbit is found in one of the couples' beds with a note that says, "Blessed are the myths, for they will inherit." A series of events begins that end in a gruesome murder and reveals dark family secrets. <br /> <br /> Co-written, photographed and directed by the unattractive Andy Milligan. This is an absolutely horrible film in every way possible. We only go through some of its flaws. The music is horrible and the headache it causes. Sound, you can barely hear what the characters are saying and certain scenes have no sound effects and in some places you can hear Milligan yelling orders to his actors, oh and there's also a constant hiss on the soundtrack. Acting, probably among the worst I've ever seen. The very little special effects, Colin pushes someone to look out in the opening sequence, it's the size of a tennis ball, the part where someone is tied up and has a stomach open with a saw looks really terrible like the various hands are and legs that are cut. The photograph, Milligan has absolutely no idea how to stage or film a scene, regularly cuts the top, bottom or side of the heads and faces of the people off the screen and his camera jumps and shakes as if it were managed from someone who stumbles constantly. There is also at least one scene so badly thought out and filmed that you see a crew member. The film is often so dark that you can't see what's going on, too. Modifying, once again the worst I've ever seen, seems to cut out the scenes before they're done, cutting off while the characters are in the middle of a sentence. The script, if there was one, credited to both Milligan and Hal Sherwood (it took two people to write it!?) Is everywhere and is incredibly stupid. There is an incredibly bad sequence in which the killer follows a victim down in the basement, the killer walks behind him, at some point the potential victim turns around. What does the killer do to avoid detection? They splash down from him, the killers close enough to give the boy oral sex, but he doesn't notice, right in front of him. You have to see this sequence to believe it, I still can't believe what I saw. The bizarre sub-plots happen and totally disappear, they control the scene when Richard has to borrow money from his brother Walter (producer and co-writer Hal Sherwood), who turns out to be a gay priest who had an incestuous relationship with his brother before he was married! A strange scene that is there for no reason. Martha the governess's reaction to the first murder, she is more annoyed that her dinner program has been thrown out! There is also a load of crazy dialogues, Patty and Martha discuss Colin, Patty says "if only I hadn't beaten him so strongly" Martha replies sympathetically "you have to Patty, you have to!", Delivered totally direct. And don't start with how ugly the wallpaper is in the whole house! The only good thing I can think of to say is that the costumes seem reasonable, for the period of time it has to be set. I could probably go on all day talking about how amateur I am, but I think you have the idea. One to avoid if you are not a serious masochist! I didn't regret buying it or watching it for a second, though!
