There is a lot of repetitive dialogues in this film about "cold spots" (which signal the presence of a ghost), and characters who pray to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves. To recreate the feel of the film, I will repeatedly refer to the cold spots in this review. I've seen worse movies than the St. Francisville Experiment, but this could be the most * forgettable * one of all ("it's getting cold!") Basically, about 20-somethings spend the night in a haunted house. This is filmed as a seemingly true documentary. Obviously it is not real, but the house contains some cold spots. SPOILERS- (as if he could not foresee most of the plot!). Not much in this film. We have the usual clich√© of the horror of a cat jumping out of hiding near the beginning, like a "practice" scare to warm the public. People walk around with flashlights, occasionally taking a moment to remind the house that they come in peace, that they don't intend to harm the spirits (or cold spots) inside. Every now and then a door opens wide and makes someone jump. Obviously, the Ouija board makes its appearance. They talk to a ghost called "Charles". A girl eats a sandwich with a cockroach. More cold spots Another door goes out and a guy turns off because of the noise of the door. Scuff, scuff, he says. Oh my god, someone says. "Surround yourself with white light." I admit that there is a beautiful scene in the attic (where a chair is overturned by a ghost) that really caught me off guard. But apart from some funny dialogue, the chair scene (the current split second when it is reversed, nothing immediately before or after that moment) is the only good thing in this film. However there are still some cold spots here. In the end, the film ends. No one dies No further details are needed. I wasn't a big fan of the Blair Witch Project, but it looks like a masterpiece next to the St. Francisville Experiment. You might not discuss whether this is a real documentary, but whether or not it was meant to be fun. Still do not know. But whatever was meant to be failed.
