I took it on Cinemax very late at night ... there was nothing else, so I basically had no choice. Bottom line, terrible plot, slow, waste of good film and time of the actors. In short, don't worry about that either. Too bad we can't give zero as an evaluation; this really is not even worth a consideration !!!
