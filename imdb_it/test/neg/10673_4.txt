"Censored" by Frank Tashlin is a short film by Snafi Private that aims to teach the importance of the Censor to prevent military secrets from spreading. Snafu tries to let his girlfriend know that he must be stationed in the South Pacific, but the Censor rejects any attempt to send the letter. These first scenes are the best, with the invisible Censor picking up the letter from the sky with long mechanical arms, nets and even a specially-used eagle! The second half of the cartoon, in which Snafu manages to send the letter with the help of the Technical Fairy, First Class (who is teaching him a lesson), is less fun and culminates with a disappointing ending just a dream. The main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of the extremely succinct girl dressed in Snafu who is also seen bare-chested, albeit with strategically placed limbs at all times! Aimed at the military, the Snafu shorts were often characterized by increased perplexity, but these scenes, as they may be crowbarred, are by far the most erotic I have encountered in one of these short films so far. Despite everything, I prefer Snafu shorts that go a little more to the jugular, usually causing the death of the main character. For great examples of this, look for "The Goldbrick" by Tashlin or "Spies" by Chuck Jones. 'Censored' is quite weak by comparison.
