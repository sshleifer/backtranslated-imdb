Oh Gawd. I want to travel back in time to Monogram Studios and strangle someone in their office in front of two rooms for this sloppy musical. It's a watt above the flat-lining for 60 of its 61 minutes and then actually shows (for the last minute, released in milli-blips every hour) that there is a real life talent that is badly photographed. see the point of going to some trouble to actually make this movie that could easily be energetic and actually fun and allow lethargy to be the main thing on display. The weird plot shows the hardy vaudeville trouper Grace Hayes who blows her up in a college where her son of mice is a rich university clown. He's going to fix his playboy ways, no matter what. His real son of life (strange aspect) Peter Hays plays the son of his screen. The wife of her real life plays her secretary. Talk about nepotism. I suspect that this pack of talents was almost the raison d'être of the Monogram that funded this musical back-lot produced by the extraordinary skeletalist Sam Katzman. As with other Monogram musicals, it seems more like a reason to film new purchases of recent furniture and lighting accessories to show other studios that Monogram Pictures is "gorgeous" in their ways B. Take a horrible look at 1946 SWING PARADE for a genuine proof of this: they just built this gigantic set of nightclubs and then found an excuse to film actors and musicians who crossed it. History? None. In any case, ZIS BOOM BAH is more BAH than BOOM. Where were Gale Storm and Mantan Mooreland when Monogram really needed it? Probably standing at the gate of the PRC Pictures wondering if he seemed sure to get in there. Junior jive hepster Roland Dupree brings life to the rappéna and attracts his teenage legs around two shaky dance numbers, especially in the finale of the "great show" set in the new and extensive malt shoppe / club set. The usual crumpled curtains are loosely hung on the back wall, and the stage of the miserable drapery even has a dark main rag that is pulled back and forth while each amateur sequence trips past the previous one. The chorus girls and their very simple-looking partners in this finale look just like the borrowed Monogram office staff (from typing and carpentry) for the morning of the shoot. They have absolutely no talent in dance and are so normal on the screen ... ALL the girls all look like Joyce. There is also a calamity in costume where they wear fringed hot-pants ... only on one leg. It's all so horrible and poor ... and actually annoying when another tweaking by all concerned would result in ZIS actually FUN. The only thing strangely interesting is the delivery of the dialogue between Grace and her son-in-law: it is so casually delivered that it actually works despite the script and logic. It has a very similar presence to life which is the only thing that allows the ridiculous story to be slightly compelling. The Dupree kid is the real star. He can really do something ... although you look like a Liberace teen dancing tubby ... You read that right.
