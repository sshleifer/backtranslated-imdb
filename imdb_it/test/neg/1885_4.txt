Although inevitably linked to the decade of the 1970s, the concept of "cinematographic exploitation" is actually almost as old as cinema itself. Furthermore, Universal Studios practically invented the term with their racing monsters of Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man and The Mummy. Every original classic generated a couple of sequels, at least, and after a while they even thought of making the real stewed monster! "House of Frankenstein", published a year earlier and directed by Erle C. Kenton, was a great success with interesting ideas and enthusiastic performances, but "House of Dracula" is a bit too crazy for me to recommend it. The plot suffers too much from extremely irritating "accidental" situations, forced twists and dialogues and ?? mostly ?? a too short execution time to process the monsters' personalities as they deserve. Onslow Stevens does not receive top billing, but a doctor who is challenged to treat Count Dracula (Carradine) by his uncontrollable thirst for blood and correct Lawrence Talbot's illness to turn into a werewolf when he moon is full. During a night walk in some caves, they also collect the remains of the Frankenstein monster and the good doctor himself undergoes a metamorphosis of Jekyll / Hyde due to a bad blood transfusion. The last invitation to the messy party is a female hunchback (though not of Notre Dame). Something is wrong when you are watching a movie that is literally full of horror icons, yet the only character in the entire movie who can drive you crazy is a normal villager named Siegfried. The real monsters are boring and their once fabulous backgrounds are completely dried up. Is Count Dracula a whining romanticist, Talbot is an old pitiful and whining martyr and the creation of Frankenstein ?? well, his part in the plot isn't even worth mentioning. There is a serious lack of atmospheric settings and beautiful photographs in this Universal film, especially compared to all their other efforts, and the sudden climax is a disaster.
