Let's take a straight thing; This was BAD! So Putrid who doesn't even qualify to be impressed in anyone's memories. <br /> <br /> The plot that always repeats (those who constantly resort not only to jokes but also to plots and appearances of characters). A typical plot goes as follows; Sue (the mother) opens the episode by quoting how she loves her little son but has a terrible smell (as if THIS did not grow old! Har-de-bloody-har!), Some Australian quasi-nationalist "bogan" - look up-it seems say that he thinks he is fantastic because he is a loser while all / everyone else does not suck before disappearing for the rest of the episode. (a small pity) <br /> <br /> The rest of the plot revolves around the father (Gary) who finds himself in a sort of disagreement with Sue and he who talks with his band members for advice on how to solve it . <br /> <br /> The phrase "words fail me" is old, but this is where the most truthful thing to say is. It's so incredibly BAD! So HORRIBLE, that I wish all traces of its existence were transmitted into the lowest depths of the North Sea and that life could continue. <br /> <br /> It saddens me though, to see someone as beautiful as Sally Bretton (a good actress, I like) to make an idiot out of himself, Ardal O Hanlon (My hero aside) has the ability to be quite funny but not here - and Ben Elton, distinguished by so many good things somehow manages to come up with this ... then the comedy thing is in very serious trouble!
