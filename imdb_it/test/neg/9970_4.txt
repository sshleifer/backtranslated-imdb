It hits me like a routine, as far as TV movies are concerned. I can believe it's based on a true story because the plot seems too clumsy for being written by anyone with narrative skills. <br /> <br /> For example, good old John Ritter (now a rather bulky and bearded villain) poisons his wife enough to make her sick, then accuses her of being psychosomatic and immediately lets herself marry another young woman. Fourteen years pass before the story resumes. Why fourteen years? I imagine that, although fiction does not require it, history does. <br /> <br /> Some particular scenes, however, are so cinematically apt that they were almost certainly imagined by a writer. Trapped in her attic, Ritter's first wife, Helgenberger, stumbles upon an old electrical appliance and has one of those black and white flashbacks with score bites - he suddenly remembers when, fourteen years ago, he discovered shaving selenium filings Ritter from a straightener, picking them up carefully and putting them in the shampoo and lining for eyelashes (or whatever it's called). Later it develops that he was putting it in his coffee. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I don't believe it. I don't even think he had that particular revelation in the attic or that Ritter put selenium chips in his shampoo or eyeliner. Selenium is indicated in the film as a "toxic metal" and I suppose it is, in sufficient quantity, but it is also an antioxidant that is sold over the counter in drug stores and swallowed. Someone will have to prove - like nobody in this film - that it is a topical poison. Many people have tried the nicotine patch and failed. So how come a little selenium in your shampoo gives Marg Helgenberger an immediate and drastic headache? And does her eyes become painful like boils when applying makeup? I think the anthropologist E. B. Tylor called this "nice idea" this simple idea, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Corn je divage. In any case, Ritter evidently experiences the same feat with his second wife fourteen years later, although no evidence of deception is ever produced when he falls ill with the same symptoms. His number two wife is brought to Mexico and apparently recovered, but suddenly he falls dead shortly after his return. Detailed evidence accumulates against Ritter, who plays the villain with all the stops - when his first trial is rejected, SMIRKS to Helgenberger, who pushed the investigation. <br /> <br /> See, Helgenberger was a good friend with Ritter's second wife and was terribly disturbed by his disappearance and his ways. (I bet.) And she wants to prevent the same thing from happening to the rich young woman who seems in line for third place in Ritter's marriage agenda. (Sure.) The best interpretation is given by the guy who plays detective Mauser - Lawrence Dane? All others act based on numbers. They project emotions and thoughts with the subtlety of a warning to a railway crossing. But Dane does little things that are original. "I was told that you want to report a murder. (Long pause while sitting and waiting), then abruptly abruptly to Helgeberger and asks in a reasonable and curious voice:" Who was killed? "the bare bones of historical events, nothing has prevented the characters or their actions from being drawn differently than they were in real life. I mean, what the heck, Ritter is still in jail convicted of murder and the character of Helgenberger is dead, so who should object? I hope the forensic material has been made clearer. Ritter seems to have used so many poisons and toxic metals - let me see, selenium, cyanide, a massive dose of chlorine, and maybe something else - that "I was confused by it. It's not like I was rooting for Ritter. Here is a mathematician with a doctorate who insists that people call him a" doctor. He also corrects people who come to him simply as a "professor". "Most doctors get that narcissistic problem behind them very quickly." Jes' call me Whitey, even though I know how to get a standard deviation and you don't. "Average TV Rate.
