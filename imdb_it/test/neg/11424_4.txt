I, like many this evening, challenged the cold winter and the long lines to see what I had planned to be one of the best films of this year. However, I sadly remained in many ways after the credits were launched. But to be honest, there were redeemable qualities (although very few). Let's start with what worked. First, the Lycan: on a point anyway ?? from their terrifying physicality to their sheer ferocity. The action: sublimely visceral ?? When did it happen. Nighy / Victor and Sheen / Lucian: perfect. Now, what doesn't (and there is plenty). This was less a movie and more a collage of sequences (and don't expect to see supporting characters from other films except Raze and Tannis). It lacked a well written plot and something of real substance to bring these pieces of film together. The story seemed to start right in the middle ?? to the cusp in which Lucian had decided to rebel. Therefore, there was no context; no tension; no sense of betrayal ?? the devices needed to make everything else work. Furthermore, it ended where the climax was to begin (which must have been after the feud had calmed down for a while). Oh and it was too short. The purist will also find an offense in certain freedoms brought to certain facts previously revealed in the first two films, but judge for yourself. In the end, this film lingered long on what should have been brief "background" scenes (for example, various council scenes), and as a result we never had the chance to know or worry about the main actors ... of the film (ahi). -D
