The 1994 film production of Heart of Darkness was in no way able to live the exceptional book. The film contained useless scenes that confused the viewer rather than help him understand what was happening. The director obviously wasn't an expert, and if he is, then he didn't show it. Furthermore, the scenes in the book were left out or modified, scenes that were quite important. The film made me feel rather bored and it was a total waste of my time. The characters acted as if they had no idea what was going on, and the actors didn't represent the emotions that Marlow and the others revealed in the book. Overall, the film was terrible and completely lacked the suspense that was otherwise necessary to make it even remotely interesting.
