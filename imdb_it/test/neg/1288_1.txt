My wife rented this movie so she never got to see it. If I ever want to torture her, I'll let her watch this movie. I have seen many movies with my 4 year old son and I can take almost everything. Barney is refreshing after a shot by Quigley. <br /> <br /> The plot, the dialogue, the cinematography and the acting were a step above (or equal to) a cheap porn movie. I feel cheated by $ 3.69 we paid to rent it and then 90 minutes of my life I will never come back. I will say that my 4 year old loved it, fortunately it was a rental that we had to return immediately. <br /> <br /> I just hope the younger actor's careers aren't spoiled by being in this movie.
