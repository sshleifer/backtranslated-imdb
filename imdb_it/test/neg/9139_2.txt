After enjoying Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi, I couldn't wait to see this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and see which direction it had taken. Rarely has a film managed so spectacularly to survive its predecessors and lost its way. Although it seeks to represent a "civilized war" in the form of sport, science, commerce and other forms of competition, it lacks the global reach and even the coherently developed themes of its predecessors. War is chaos, but wars also have a goal in mind and this film has a small structure and unclear objectives. <br /> <br /> Naqoyqatsi is imperfect because it is a chaotic melange of images that does little to develop his theme. On the plus side, he wisely avoided using some of the iconic images of the wars of the last century. <br /> <br /> Naqoyqatsi is also so insular that several times I had to remind myself that I was not looking at an advertisement that promoted the American way of life. Perhaps this insularity reflects the ongoing "War on Terror". When it represented "sport like war", the logos of leading teams ensured that the United States was represented as the winners. So he missed the opportunity to represent some of the many sports around the world and showing that humanity is united in its use of sport as a form of civil war. <br /> <br /> Apart from the newsreel, the footage seemed to have been shot with a limited budget on the borders of New York and the rest of the world had few awards on "life as war". The gallery of faces (waxworks) has only mentioned the existence of important people outside the United States. The producers have not understood that globalization does not mean Americanization. <br /> <br /> The Philip Glass soundtrack sounded very similar to all the other Philip Glass soundtracks I listened to (with the possible exception of Koyaanisqatsi) and at best can be described as "harmless" nor adding or undervaluing the chaotic imaginary.
