I'm sorry, but I honestly can't understand why anyone would really like it. It's stereotypical and REAL homeschoolers DON'T MAKE ANYTHING as if they were on this show !! Personally, I'm glad it was canceled after the first few episodes. I mean, this kind of show would certainly be fine if everyone knew that homeschoolers weren't really like that, and the whole story was just for the show, but unfortunately not everyone is aware of it. If someone out there who looked at this really believed that this is what happens in the life of a homeschooler, then I honestly feel sorry for them. This reminds me of the kind of portrait they have of homeschooled children in "Mean Girls". It is sad, really, that people think so. This is complete garbage, IMHO.
