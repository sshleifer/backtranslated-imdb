This experimental silent film, made in Switzerland by an independent British film company, is mainly remembered as Paul Robeson's first film. It is very artistic, with shots that often seem meaningless to the story, which is still difficult to understand due to the lack of enough titles. From what I've gathered, Robeson's wife, Adah, is in an inter-racial love affair with a white man named Thorne. It doesn't bother the owner of the bar / hotel where Thorne lives (and she seems to have a lesbian relationship with a maid), but an old lady expresses the viewpoint of the city in a title: "If I had my way, we wouldn't allow blacks here. "Thorne is also called a" nigger lover "by someone in the bar. Adah seeks a reconciliation with Pete (Robeson), but eventually leaves him. Thorne's wife, Astrid, goes deep, wields a knife, cuts Thorne's arm and cheek, and somehow dies. Thorne must have been charged with murder because we learn he was acquitted. As for Pete, he receives a letter from the mayor telling him that it is better for everyone to leave the city. So the movie speaks more of racism than anything else, but in an early note, the owner tells Pete "The sad thing is that they think they are right. That's how we are." The meaning of the title is a mystery. It may refer to Adah who has fair skin (a borderline negro) or to the borderline behavior of the main characters.
