This criticism tells the story of 4 little friends who went to see the Angels and Demons movie the first night it came out, even though it was a school night, because "Angels and demons are worth it". Two of the four had read the book. Of those who didn't, a boy wore a pair of pink skinny jeans. This was the least eventful part of the evening after seeing the aberrant Angels and Demons. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a laboratory where antimatter is created while another process is in progress. And apparently someone knows it or something. Notice how confused I am. I don't understand what happened: they were just doing antimatter. Vittoria finds her father dead ... WHAT? The Illuminati symbol sent to Langdon is a PRINTOUT, not a burn on someone's chest. They take the X-33 scene out. They take out Maxmillian Kohler. They practically eliminate CERN and the symbolism connected to it. They take out the Hassasin and replace it with a religious, a British type. They bring out the Illuminati Diamond. They take out the scene of Vittoria's near-rape. They take out Langond's fight with the Hassasin (now a British guy on crack). They pull out the press guy who follows them around. They take the death of the fourth cardinal. They bring out the fact that the Chamberlain becomes pope. They take out the great Camerlengo plan. They pull out Langdon's helicopter and land on that island towards the end. They take note of the fact that Victoria's father was a scientific priest. They bring out the fun of Langdon and unfortunately unfortunately they show off Victoria's sexual attraction. <br /> <br /> In addition to the film COMPLETELY losing the concentration of detail, the film is recited in HORRIBLE fashion. Admittedly, though, there were some good things. For example, the recreation of the Sistine Chapel must have been extremely difficult and was extremely well done. The scene of the explosion was MIND-BLOWING. In addition to this, CHOOSE THIS FILM TO STOLEN THE BOOK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT READ.
