Well, I thought the movie was blah 1/10. <br /> <br /> however the best part is the first 5 minutes of the movie with the nerd or any other girl, this is the part you watch out for. I had great ringtones, I thought he was really an actor at case? No, she wasn't actually a model by the name of Larissa McComas, but you already knew ... <br /> <br /> So, it made sense, but that was all the rest of the movie (which I saw anyway) not I cared 4, and I didn't bother to look at the rest. This is all I needed to be satisfied so 2 the ones that look good and have fun
