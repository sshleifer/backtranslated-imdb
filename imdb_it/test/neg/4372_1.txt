I really don't know why I accepted to see this movie, but like a complete fool I did and for this I deserved to be shot! I had seen the original Killjoy, well, I said I saw it ... I started looking at it but I found it so bad that I ended up watching it at 4x speed to make it and get rid of the annoying dialogue, but I said I'd watch it and I did it even though it was at 4x speed. <br /> <br /> To make it short Killjoy 2 takes off where Killjoy left off. By this I do not mean the plot, I mean the complete and total bag of dirt known as acting and cheap. I have nothing against cheap films, in fact I enjoy enjoying them, they are something different from the Mega budget blockbusters, but this movie is simply terrible! The acting is diabolical and the script ... well, I think you could give Stevie Wonder a pen and a sheet, and it would have produced something much better! This film is simply annoying, not to mention the annoying laugh that the clown has so obviously nicknamed! I couldn't get past this movie, about three quarters of the time it was time to turn it off and throw it out the window. It could be a rip-off to buy like a DVD but like a Frisbee it was a huge deal! <br /> <br /> Please, for the sake of humanity itself DO NOT look at this slime, it is perhaps the worst thing I have ever seen and considering part of the manure I saw that says a lot! <br /> <br /> My assessment of this film would be .... Head Nailgun / 10
