Hellraiser: Bloodline is the place where the mediocrity of the Hellraiser series fits perfectly. Gone is the imagination and invention of the first two films. Gone is the ethos of Pinhead and his servants. Gone are the sick desires of humans. In fact, everything that once made Hellraiser so original has been swept away by this mess of a photo. <br /> <br /> All that remains is the fundamental premise of Christian mythology according to which there is hell with evil demons. What happened to the evil that men do? This watered-down excuse for a Hellraiser film is filled with the infinite Psycho Babble, so that Pinhead becomes a lousy philosopher and not a precursor of destiny as it should be. <br /> <br /> The film uses the most elementary film formulas with characters that separate and are killed individually. Pinhead is not an Alien. The connection between the box and the "demons" or "hell" has never been established, but only comes to a sacrifice and sits on a sideboard. <br /> <br /> The female protagonist is called "Rimmer" and obviously the producers think it really funny because everyone keeps saying her name. In reality the film should have been titled to give it that character name. <br /> <br /> Too bad for you Kevin Yagher and Alan Smithee.
