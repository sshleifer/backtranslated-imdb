First of all, I really can't understand how some people "appreciated" this movie. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. Even the actors seem bored ... and I think this says it all! <br /> <br /> However, I have to give my applause to the creators of opening titles - that team seems to have a really good future. That's why I recommend to the big studios to watch ONLY the opening titles and one or two sequences of special effects (if you look outside of this film, it looks like a good movie) <br /> <br /> Better luck (or judgment) next time for the producers of this, this ... this "thing!"
