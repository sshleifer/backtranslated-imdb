Even though the film was just so-so subtitles were by far the best I've ever seen! Most often the spelling is terrible and the subtitles are not synchronized. I use subtitles even if I can hear well but I find that many actors mumble. In addition, the soundtrack often takes precedence over dialogue. Thank you!
