This film is without doubt one of the worst I've seen. It was so boring that I simply couldn't wait for it to end. I talked to my girlfriend to watch him after this site had good reviews and even after 30 minutes she looked at me as if to say "your crazy people". The scenery was boring like the movie with nothing but driving in the car watching the wind blew bits of bush around. The acting was not inspiring and the film was simply a waste of what had been a good idea in a waste of dvdr. <br /> <br /> Guy Pierce should have stayed close to his neighbors because he had at least washed his hair. All he did was talk on the phone, but he didn't sell anything as a seller. He would have been fired weeks before. His girlfriend (once in Coyote Ugly) should have stayed dancing at the bar, at least that way it seemed exciting. <br /> <br /> The guy who played Vincent (those who watched him know) was so annoying with his phone calls that any normal person would drive to his house and hit him with a little 4 for 2. <br / > <br /> I don't know what anyone liked. I actually want people to look at this to endure the torture I went through.
