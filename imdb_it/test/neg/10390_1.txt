OK, I don't usually comment on movies, but in the end I saw a movie that was so full of bullsh * t and riddled with incompetence that I just had to warn. The exorcist from the Blackwater Valley speaks vaguely of bitch / pederast / priest and this family of horse fanatics, and in short the younger daughter who was harassed by the priest but in love with the hand of the hillbilly ranch is owned. Together with a heroic god who avoids the Mexican gardener who once participated in an exorcism, the pastry chef / pederast / priest manages to save the day, but not before the possessing demon manages to jump on a prostitute who the city sheriff blew it up. All in all this film is the biggest pile of useless (I could be very descriptive with this part, but why waste my energies in this film) I've ever seen. All the people associated with making this film should be sterilized so that they cannot pollute the earth with their useless eggs.
