An absurd assault on the senses of the spectators. This is a mixture of Hindi and assorted English films, badly made. The name draws inspiration from an award-winning 70s cast, which also boasts the 2002 version. The plot is taken from the 1970s by Sunil Dutt / Reena Roy - "Nagin" and by the visual effects taken (a horrible attempt) by The Matrix, Terminator 2 and Mission Impossible II. <br /> <br /> Set in a college environment (Sunil Shetty, Akshaye Kumar, Manisha - college boys !!! ??? !!), Manisha Koirala is the victim, who commits a fatal attack on her from part of two students as a collective effort by our heroes. Apparently Manisha is a Cobra snake (Nag) reborn as a girl in this life and her partner in the previous life, now a super-powerful-all-and-any-assumption-form (Ichadhari Nag) - Munish Kohli, is out looking for in this life. Manisha turns to him to avenge his violation and murder. <br /> <br /> Thus begins the murderous madness, in which the avenging lover begins to singularly every male of the group, with ever increasing powers and tricks with successive attempts. The effects are extremely cheap, with computer-generated skeletons, morphing bodies and motion stunts that complete the farce. <br /> <br /> Report from Nagin includes Raj Babbar who plays a Catholic priest who provides temporary relief to our boys with a "Religiously correct" multi-religion medallion (the original Nagin had only an "Om"). Sunny Deol interprets the love interest of Manisha in his current life and the last savior against the powerful Munish Kohli. <br /> <br /> Music and songs are below average. <br /> <br /> Avoid if you don't fancy it chills cheaply.
