One day I was watching TV with a friend and we took the last twenty minutes of "Going Bananas". Believe me when I say it was enough to have a good judgment on the film. The first scene I saw was the monkey, the kid, the fat man and the negro who looked like Dave Chappelle, who was flying around in a cavern thousands of feet high. While all the others were solemn about the journey, the monkey seemed to be in a sort of drug binge where he kept shouting something that resembled the English word more quickly. They then landed on a twenty-yard long pier in Africa. After a heart felt goodbye where the monkey cried (Hahahaha), the "villains" of the film appeared. They were doing their complete ass in their vintage Cadillac when the evil monkey took an Air Jordan that jumped from the dock onto the boat that was sailing 40 meters away and had them sink with their beautiful car in the Pacific Ocean. After seeing this film, I have a new purpose in life; to find the dwarf who played the monkey and stab him in the eye with a fountain pen.
