A British film from a Japanese novel about a very troubled boy who comes under the influence of a classmate like Hitler and plots to harm the widow's mother lover. A couple of good scenes (Sarah Miles discovers her son is peeking at her and confronts him with rage, the pale-faced boy trying to trap Kris Kristofferson to his demise being extremely friendly), but what's the point besides causing one shock? Ugly and restless, it shows no one involved in any advantage (especially Kristofferson, whose blank looks and the usual crude phrases are out of place in a psychological jumble like this). Coolly without any sense of its own absurdity, director Lewis John Carlino seems to believe that such a circumstance could actually happen. If he's right, it's much more shocking than anything in "Sailor". * from ****
