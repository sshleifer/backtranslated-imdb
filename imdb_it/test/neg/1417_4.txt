I saw a screening of this film last night. I had high expectations, but I was definitely disappointed. Within 5 minutes of opening, Williams is already campaigning for his presidency. And he becomes president in the first 40 minutes. So there is this whole aspect of the film. The first half hour is hilarious. Don't get me wrong, the film has its moments. But after the first half hour, it takes a turn for the worst. It becomes less of a comedy, and more of a thriller / drama / romance ... which is useless. the film does not go anywhere and remains still for 30 minutes. there are laughter interspersed here and there, but the always funny part is at the beginning and only at the beginning. At one point, the biggest applause I heard in the audience is when a person in the crowd shouted "boooo" during a very confusing scene. Williams offers a great performance, just like his comic style. Walken also offers a strong supporting role as only he can. I think the only character underestimated is Lewis Black. Consistently vulgar and political, it's fun to see him downgrade for a PG-13 rating. Overall, I wouldn't pay to see the movie. After all, I saw it for free and I was disappointed too. The first half hour is solid, and everything is going down from there. Not really suitable for a category, the film realizes halfway that it should have been nothing more than a one-hour special comedy. 4.5 / 10
