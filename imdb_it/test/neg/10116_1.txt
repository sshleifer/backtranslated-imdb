It's hard and I didn't expect it ... But it's really the worst movie, my wife and I have seen. Horrible dialogues that extend incomprehensibly over time without an apparent reason to fill the time. The narration does not follow in an understandable and understandable way ?? it's all a mess The action and dialog boxes appear at jumps. The thing that disappointed me most was to see Dominique Pinon one of my favorite French actors involved in this ?? uh ?? I don't even know how to describe it without being polite ?? The rest of the actors, where the poorest. Susan Paterno interpreted her character terribly, creating a flat and expressionless performance. Poor special effects. I don't think it was a complete film waste but it's close to ?? If I have to say I would advise everyone not to see this movie. I think it would be a complete waste of time. Honestly, I never thought of saying something like that about a movie, but ?? there is always a first time
