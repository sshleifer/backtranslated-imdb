Half Past Dead was different from any Steven Segal film I've ever seen. Very little of Segal, himself in action and I agree with the last review I read, Nia Peeples steals the show. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen anything really new here, just the same old things as other movies changed around a little. The best action scenes were those of Nia while still kicking her ass. It was interesting to see her as the bad one after seeing her for two seasons on Walker, Texas Ranger, still kicking her ass, but for good guys. <br /> <br />
