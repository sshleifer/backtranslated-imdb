Tacky, but sweetly entertaining the first soft core comedies of the 90s Xena (Sarah Bellemo), Luna (Tamara Landry) and Sola (Nicole Posey), as three teenagers from outer space. Xena's parents went on vacation for a couple of days. Following a persistent persuasion from her friends, Xena agrees to take her father's spaceship for a ride. The final result? They run out of gas in space and land on the planet Beta 45, the land of AKA. Meanwhile, teenagers Dave (Michael Todd Davis) and Jerry (Ken Steadman) came to California to spend the summer with Dave's Uncle Bud (Joe Estevez), a tramp who lives right on the beach. All three of them end up meeting our three space girls who got away from the crash without a scratch. Uncle Bud is about to be kicked out of his beach pad soon condemned thanks to Sally (Linnea Quigley), who lives right on the hill and had an affair with Bud. She is also a bikini tycoon and is trying to win a $ 30,000 bikini design contest ... exactly what Bud would need to fix his property, so the girls decide to try to win the prize for him. And that's all, folks. Knowing that their subtle plot was just enough to support a feature film, the filmmakers subject us to a scene after scene of endless beach parties with tons of extras spinning their half-naked bodies under the scorching sun. Oh, and let's not forget sex. There's a lot of it. Before going any further, I need to put this film into context. It was published in 1993, long before the advent of soft labels such as Surrender Cinema and Seduction Cinema. Compared to these more recent, angular and more explicit films, the soft core films of the 90s seem safe. When Beach Babes From Beyond was first released in 1993 by Full Moon Torchlight Entertainment, it was announced as the debut of a label specializing in "mature adult" type films. Needless to say, times have changed. This particular genre of films has gone from a few hot but short sex scenes to fleeting glimpses of full frontal female nudity to extended sex scenes that sometimes threaten to venture into the realm of hardcore. Looking at Beach Babes From Beyond again after seeing it after the 93 'release, it is safe to say that if this same film were to be made today, there would be a huge emphasis on sex scenes and less time spent on plot and dialogue. As for sex scenes, they tend to run hot and cold. Our three space girls don't waste time getting comfortable with the kids that night. So each pair gets a soft core scene, complete with annoying slow-motion camera work and too dark lighting. They are not so horrible, and they are surprisingly graphic in some places, especially the scene between Xena and Jerry that takes place in the back of a trailer. But the only sex scene that REALLY leaves a lasting image, and makes you be surprised in its overall intensity, occurs quite early in the film. Sally will take part in a topless photo taken with three of her models posing next to a swimming pool. All the actresses in this scene are beautiful, but Nikki Fritz stands out from everyone for her enormous presence. Remember that this point in his career has not yet reached the kind of enormous popularity that he would soon follow. His naked pose next to a swimming pool leads to an unforgettable fantasy sequence in which he shows his soaped body in a tub and then again when he leaves his bathroom. Walking towards the bed towards an almost naked expecting boy, we get a complete nude figure full length with the back almost to the heart and the back perfectly shaped. It's nice that Nikki's back is so muscular that she's going to do a good workout. Nikki spends the next few minutes completely naked with a big guy in a variety of positions in a scene that is filmed in a completely different way than the other three love scenes. No dark lights or annoying slow-downs here ... only two actors in a huge bed without sheets and blankets that seem to barely be able to barely act. The ecstatic language of Nikki's body shows that few other actresses seem to like sex scenes as much as she does. It's really the only time Beach Babes From Beyond really offers the goods. But even without this spectacular scene, I strongly recommend this film only because it is quite watchable and never trivial thanks to an incredibly energetic and attractive cast, many of which will feature in various features directly to the video in the rest of the decade.
