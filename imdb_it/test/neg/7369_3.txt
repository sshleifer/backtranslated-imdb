Despite decades of tax incentives, in terms of international visibility the Canadian film industry is still lagging behind most of the Central African and Islamic states (surprisingly few Canadian films are published outside their native shores), and Nouvelle- France aka Battle of the Brave is another example of why. More than any other country, commercial Canadian cinema seems unable to develop its own identity and is stuck in a pale imitation of the failures of other countries. On paper this historical drama might seem vaguely promising. There is certainly a rich vein of untapped material in the history of Canada, while the French and the English spoil and buy and sell the colony, although none of them makes the cut here unless the strange blink scene is contained -and-you-miss-it of characters that say "Wolfe is dead" or "Nouvelle-France is gone" before returning to soap operatic. But even if this is not a history lesson, it is not a drama or the epic adventure that promises the new title: there is no battle in the film if you do not count 10 seconds of bombardment from half a dozen re-enactors and a shed collapsed. The city square, which we only saw in Quebec, is an obvious rather muffled interior study, which offers many scenes an old television miniseries, as well as the director Jean Beaudin's reluctance to offer much in terms of long or even external shots. What you get for your money is a simple harlequin love story but drawn on convicted lovers, constantly separated by events beyond their control, where the biggest surprise is that Fabio does not appear in the cast. It is the type of film in which each time two characters are about to make the beast with two backs, the camera moves to a comfortable fireplace or waterfall. <br /> <br /> An Anglo-Canadian-French co-production that does not do so much to unite nations once in war as throwing any country into a decent landslide in the stew, this huge box office disaster was clearly destined to be the Titanic of Canada - even if someone neglected to tell the producers that they meant the film, not the ship - but it turns out to be more like cheap Revolution without the battle scenes, the crowds or the few moments that threaten to work briefly than faced with stunning probabilities. The Montreal mirror described it as "so bad that you can't even find the strength to mock it". This is rather unfair, because while most of the time it is a movie in the form of a 80's miniseries, the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny, with the characters who accidentally put their bear traps, the cowards husbands who declare "You will never look at your beautiful lover again, the honor of the cuckold! You will pay for this, both! and our heroine accused of murder and - she gasps! - Sorcery in a trial quite amusing to have been in the version by Demi Moore of The Scarlet Letter, throws in dull British rulers, devoted slaves and Celine Dion singing at the end and you have something that sometimes seems like the kind of movie that Timbo Hines was aspiring (and which he managed to lose wildly anyway) with its legendary period inept version of War of the Worlds, although without the disconcerting technical incompetence. <br /> <br /> The versatility of David La Haye for the main character sem limited to the number of other actors that may appear during the film: it begins to look like Andy Garcia, briefly adopts the appearance of Al Pacino Revolution, flirts with the clean-cut Tchéky Karyo style before turning into a young Ted Danson while his character ages. While his opening scene in which he reacts to the news of his father's death with an expression that seems to wait for the director to tell him he can go home now promises a feast of bad acting, in reality he gives the impression of a mediocre support actor who was the victim of a last-minute advantage when anyone originally chosen finally read the script and saved. He shows himself available and tries, but the grace and charisma the part needs is not there. The protagonist of Billie Piper, the protagonist of Noemie Godin-Vigneau, does not focus on the screen although she is at the center of the scene as the peasant prey of the corrupt and pervert Intendant Le Bigot by Vincent Perez (which is actually the name of the character) , the duplicated drunken fugitive bearded Sébastien Huberdeau and, the saddest of all, the revolutionary former revolutionary priest of Gerard Depardieu in a gray-haired wig. It is a truly pitiful sight to see an actor once grandiose in the absolute depth of his game as he moves through the movements with the air of not having lost the will to act but the will to live together with it. Clearly he could not be bothered to stay for dubbing sessions in English (or even a couple of long pitches in which he doubled considerably). No wonder he talked about retiring for the whole period of the short film release. <br /> <br /> Some short comedy remedies are provided by Jason Isaacs in his Basic Patriot modality that exalts the Wolfe of Quebec rather as an asthmatic Alf Garnett / Archie Bunker played by Timothy Dalton quickly while William Pitt of Tim Roth is on the sidelines with the occasional confused smile of one that is housed in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and lots of days off, though like Benjamin Franklin of Colm Meaney they "both in the movie for less than three minutes. (Voltaire and Madame Pompadour shake their heads for a couple of minutes but can't make any impression, comical or not.) Supporting actresses are generally better: Juliette Gosselin and Bianca Gervais as the real, adoptive daughters of the heroine and a beautiful Irene Jacob in search of the whole world as a young Fanny Ardant are all refreshing and deserve much better.
