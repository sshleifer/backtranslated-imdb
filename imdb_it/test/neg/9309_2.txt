This film was a poor film. The plot was poor and the comedy they "tried" to deliver came out badly. Accidents seem forced and predictable. I thought the actors were trying to some degree, but with this film, he was so lame that he could only go so far. One of the worst movies I've seen and I don't recommend it to anyone. The only incident to Mr. Accident was the release.
