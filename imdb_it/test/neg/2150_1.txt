This must be the worst case of acting since the silent era. Not just one or two actors, but practically the whole cast. Lee Majors and Bo Svenson were fine, but the rest seems to be their first acting. <br /> <br /> So the budget was not great. Most of the costumes and set were believable, but there were many things that jumped to the viewer to let us know that they couldn't check back or get all the props to match the period. <br /> <br /> I can't think of an aspect of the film that I liked or didn't shake my head. Your time will be better spent burning filaments collected from your navel.
