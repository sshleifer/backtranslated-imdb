Originally conceived as a sequel to the "The Slumber Party Massacre" series, this film falls on its face with a new title. First of all, if you intend to include the word "massacre" in the title of your film, it is better that you carry it. This certainly not. There is no blood, no murders on the screen and no chainsaw, because the art box makes you believe. Instead, we get an exaggerated and very thin storyline of a group of cheerleaders who are stranded in a hut abandoned on the road for a football game, to be eliminated one by one. Again, this film could have been OK if the gore quotient was raised a little. Because filmmakers, especially those who make video-directed films, are afraid to show ANY gore is beyond me. Now, I'm not a big fan of bloodshed, but come on ... because otherwise someone should rent a movie called "Cheerleader Massacre ??" In addition to this problem, the film suffers from a cheap shot-on-a-home-video camera. It sounds cheap, it looks cheap and the actors aren't that good. Try to throw us off the road to who the killer may be, but that too fails. The ending ends up being a ridiculous mess. People, if you run through this movie, leave and go to find the original "Slumber Party Massacre". 2 out of 10.
