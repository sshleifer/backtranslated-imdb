Naach would have won a Razzie for the worst film in 2004 (it could even be on the whole) if it were global. When it comes to bad acting (ie showing attitudes / yawning / overcoming (not) acting), Halle Berry cannot compete with Antra Malli. While the catwoman had storeline, apparently hot actress in microscopic costume, and some action sequences, Naach had nothing. <br /> <br /> One of those films that makes me wonder why IMDb allows us to evaluate a film as 0/10. Once again, I think the film does not even deserve a 0. It must be something negative or less infinite. <br /> <br /> OK, what about the plot? He is a choreographer who gives himself, arrogant, full of attitude, meets a useless, lacking in skill, nosy that aspires to be an actor's story. The story is so brief that, if only another sentence, IMDb could forbid me from writing a spoiler. About the story? It's like a bunch (sorry for most 2 people) of people moving in super slow motion. Do not try this movie if you have purchased a new DVD player. You would end up believing that both DVDs are in bad condition or that the DVD player is hit. It's not his fault at all. <br /> <br /> At the end of everything, you end up giving credits to the director. At least he realized that both Antra Malli and Abhishek Bachan (at least at that time) fail to speak dialogues convincingly, so there are not too many dialogues in this film. So, you can at least fall asleep through the film, with some annoying noises from those Antra-malli song sequences. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you're new to Bollywood Cinema. Once you have tolerated this movie, you would be able to watch any Bollywood movie and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> There can't be a 3 hour torture worse than this!
