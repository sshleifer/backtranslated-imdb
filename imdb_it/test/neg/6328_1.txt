I took this movie on TV late at night. I honestly saw most of it, and all the while I sat in complete and incredulous. <br /> <br /> Is there any genre that is more useless than soft-core porn? If there is, I don't want to know. Softcore porn combines all the horrors of porn (terrible production values, abominable acting, disgusting screenplays) with the shyness of sex scenes in ordinary films. So the end result is exciting or fun. This film also has the rather strange approach of a sci-fi environment, and it works horribly. All sex is performed in a kind of virtual reality in which the crew of the future learns about physical love. And yes, it's almost as confused and silly as it seems. <br /> <br /> But there must be some positive points, right? Well, there's one ... Krista Allen is incredibly hot. This is the only thing that was less terrible in this movie. I don't know what's on her, but she has incredible sex appeal. But the rest of the cast seems to be the standard cast of porn. Rather unattractive women with fake breasts, and men who spent too much time in the gym giving themselves a grotesque tone. Probably a gym in Germany, judging by haircuts and clothes. <br /> <br /> To summarize things. If you like the presence of Krista Allens on the screen you can watch this in the brief moments when it shows some of its seductive potential (most of the time it tries to articulate lousy lines of dialogue). If you don't like Krista Allen, then you could also stay away. <br /> <br /> Rate this 10/10 for Krista Allens sex appeal, 1/10 for everything else and 2/10 for entertainment value since this is a hybrid of crappy porn / science fiction that doesn't looks like nothing I've ever seen.
