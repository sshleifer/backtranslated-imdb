This seems very pungent and condescending to a large extent. The whole plot is extremely forced, especially the "gallant" effort to save the college from ruin, and the moralistic tone (especially from the protagonist) scratches a little. <br /> <br /> But there are one or two comic book moments that help alleviate boredom, and the dance is fun enough (especially for the alleged amateurs - ha, ha!) <br /> <br /> The Shop owner and the guy who makes spectacular tap dancing were highlights. And I also liked the impressions of Peter Hayes on Charles Laughton and Ronald Coleman.
