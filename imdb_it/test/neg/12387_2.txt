I haven't read the book of this and based on this adaptation, I don't care. I hated all the characters in this show - Miranda was slutty, selfish and muttered miserably through diabolical dialogue, her sister was a real crap, and this was the worst representation of the manic depression I've ever seen. I have a degree in psychology, and this was not accurate. In fact, until it was mentioned, I didn't realize that Troy had to be bipolar - I thought he was a normal, slightly grumpy teenager. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming thing in this stupid show was David Tennant, whose brilliantly psychotic performance was the only thing that showed me the second part. <br /> <br /> Clearly the writers and producers of this show have not done any research - Troy's mental problems are not remotely accurate, nor is the science involved in the final "twist" (and if you haven't noticed that a far, you are a great dummy!) <br /> <br /> total garbage.
