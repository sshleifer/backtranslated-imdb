What is Fox's fascination with dysfunctional families, made up of petty, hateful, spoiled children and parents who are determined to be cool, as opposed to being parents? I'm sorry i do not understand. The episode in which I was barely able to bear to look involved one of the boys asking for a Bar Mitzvah, with the intention of getting thousands of dollars in gifts. Obviously, the idiot mother decides that her precious little junior must have the biggest and bes-test party of all, and has no problem losing $ 20,000 in the big event. The crazy girl, mad about her brain, a crazy teenager bounces back and forth between wanting to be Jewish and then Catholic, when she sees the "cute" religious guardians. <br /> <br /> The only "moving" entire episode, was when a father's putz, who was convinced all the while that the Bar Mitzvah is just a money scheme, sees the son who he studies his Hebrew lessons, and is momentarily dragged to think that perhaps his conniving progeny is to be sincere about the right of passage to adulthood. This warm and confused feeling is immediately torn from his chest when he informs junior that, since he has not yet had a bris, a certain "procedure" must be performed. The Bar Mitzvah is canceled, and the mother is out several thousand dollars when the boy refuses to comply. <br /> <br /> This show is rubbish, and it saddens me that I will never go back to the 23 minutes of my life wasted me looking at this piece of shit, because nothing else was on TV ...
