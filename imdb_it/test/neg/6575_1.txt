This was so bad I can't even review it. So I'll say a few sentences about what I've witnessed, and it's up to you to decide. <br /> <br /> Captain Kirk, with toupee and tubby gut, is climbing the rock of El Capitan by Yosemete. Spock meets him halfway on a floating hovercraft similar to a skateboard. Kirk falls. Spock flies down, takes it a few inches before Kirk hits the ground with his head down. <br /> <br /> Later that night, Spock, Kirk and McCoy are eating beans around a campfire. Spock likes beans. So, Kirk and McCoy sing "Row Row Row Your Boat" and they want Spock to join the three-way harmony. Spock doesn't want to sing. And later that night, he disagrees. "But life is nothing but a dream, Captain." Should I go on? <br /> <br /> Okay ... A renegade Vulcan, who appears to be Spock's half brother, leads a revolt on a sandy planet - taking hostages. The crew of the business land on the planet, and Uhura, pushing fifty-five and weighing two hundred pounds in some way, attracts the natives with his bare legs. But they can't deceive their brother, who claims he can find God. <br /> <br /> He kidnaps the crew and the Enterprise. They go to a planet where a large bearded apparition that claims to be God spits fire at Kirk, Spock and McCoy. Spock's brother, realizing that it is not God - but in reality it is a form of himself - or something like that - he joins the apparition to destroy it and ... the sparks fly. <br /> <br /> Then, after things got too complicated to explain the Klingons that look like Lorenzo Lamas ... <br /> <br /> The three Amigo - Kirk, Spock and McCoy - return to Does Yosemite mention, Kirk was wearing a GO CLIMB A ROCK shirt?). With Spock playing a kind of funky Vulcan guitar, they sing "Row Row Row Your Boat", this time all three harmonized while the closing credits come out.
