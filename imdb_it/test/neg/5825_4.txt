I don't understand the many positive reviews here. I found the photography and the landscape beautiful, and the two main actors are interesting, but here there is little else to recommend this film. The most annoying are the false accents of the South and the poorly written dialogue. These don't look like real people to me. Although it is refreshing to show men the exploration of various forms of sexuality without the usual labels and stereotypical character traits, most of the story is devoid of motivation or logic. The only thing that makes much sense is the responsibility that Griffith feels towards his mentally ill aunt, brutally overwhelmed by Karen Black. Lee is an interesting character who would have been more convincing if the dialogue with which he was created was more natural and his motivations clearer. Yes, I understand that he is a vagabond, but his actions, like the film, refer to a hasty conclusion make no sense. This film deserves a look, especially because it has a nice atmosphere, but it is slow and deeply imperfect. A serious rewrite and a better modification could have saved it, since the premise and the plot are promising.
