I saw this in my local supermarket and knew that Debra was there, so I decided to buy it (out of support for that sexy woman!) The plot and the acting in this movie were terrible (except Debra Wilson, and I don't I'm just saying that because I love her, she was seriously the only actress or actress who had some emotion in acting and in the voice!) What I didn't have at the beginning is the reason why the wife hasn't just returned her machine instead of running randomly that way. It was so stupid. And it's LA (NO ONE saw her being kidnapped in a public, residential street - NONE ... yes, it's realistic!) Even in the park, when Charlie stole the woman's cell phone (for some stupid reason) they were really prone to finding it (and at some point) when they did they took him under the threat of a firearm - on a CELL PHONE! In fact, I doubt the LA police will step aside for a stupid cell phone! The lady may have walked to one of those cell phone booths and replaced it! Even the acting skills of the children sucked (I think they were reading from a stick or someone stopped biting their lines) because they would ask questions and look around and then respond in a questionable voice (eg Mr. Dad? ") Also, how could there be all those snipers in the trees and on the construction of roofs in LA WITHOUT being seen? I see that it's being broadcast at 3 am in the United States. <br /> <br /> Debra fans Wilson will appreciate his parts. He is the only actor with a real acting ability (Debra, darling - stop making these cheap D-grades, video-directed ... maybe it will change with the next film Whitepaddy.) It takes jokes in there (like when one of his superiors approaches and asks her who she's talking to, she shouts at her computer and says "Damnit, Charlie!"). I gave her a 4/10 ... a 4 just for her good skills recitative of Debra.
