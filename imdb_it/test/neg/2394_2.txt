The premise is interesting and the cast does the best it can, but the script and directorial effort are so poor that it's not surprising that this film was buried - which is appropriate for the script. While watching this, I could not decide which was worse, the script or the direction. The actors are over the top, the art direction looks like a Disney movie, the music is artificial, and the feeling is so sweet to give to the hollows of the spectators. It's a bad attempt to imitate "FOUR Weddings And A funeral". If one wants to see the comedy that is flat like a pancake and how bad direction can turn a story into a sweet cavity, this is a good thing to watch.
