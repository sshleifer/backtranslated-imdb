Cruddy, innocent ... not smoking, drinking or cycling, but Jeremy Slate (good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (good actress) make this morally feasible for a bad biker movie, post-biker (exploit). They knew it, we knew it ... Adam Roarke and Slate are wasted ... but they lived. <br /> <br /> A 3 out of 10. Best performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is the ONLY really able to capture the latest biker exploit movie after RUN, ANGEL, RUN (which also has good actors - like Don Stroud, etc.). It was finished. They knew it. They were trying to make a living. But, Jocelyn Lane (from Elvis's two films, TICKLE ME and something bad) in yellow and leather is the modern sexy girl with J. Slate fighting for honor. Worth seeing, but it sucks. But take a look. It's worth the non-bikers, non-smokers, non-alcoholics, "biker" types with hot chicks.
