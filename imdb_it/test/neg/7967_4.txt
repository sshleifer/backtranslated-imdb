This is unique in the Hitchcock movies I saw, in the sense that I didn't like it very much. <br /> <br /> Actually, I found this rather predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine are a newly married couple. He's the kind of "lovable rogue" character you've seen in many movies, never being lovable for me! <br /> <br /> Actually, it was a relationship that was barely credible at best, and sometimes seemed particularly false and implausible. <br /> <br /> Unable to keep a job and try to live an opulent lifestyle, Grant is inclined to borrow money he cannot repay. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is convinced that he is trying to kill her to get the money for which it is insured; and presumably what his late father was worth. <br /> <br /> Medium and rather uninteresting in all respects, but as usual you can see the influence on the films that arrived later.
