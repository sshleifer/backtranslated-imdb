As a true Canadian, I always avoid Canadian films. However, from time to time I am trapped looking at one. This is better than most, ie mediocre. It has many of the usual flaws of Canadian films ... self-conscious acting ... an excess of cinematographic expedients and, above all, the able Canadian habit of using Canadian cities as supporters of American ones. I want to say that using the historic metropolis of Montreal as a court for Harrisburg in Pennsylvania is obscene to say the least. I was in a generous mood. I gave a 4. <br /> <br />
