A friend gave me this movie because she liked it. I decided to finally watch it. It was tremendously long. I kept waiting for the suspense to happen, but it never happened. I kept waiting for something to happen after the opening scenes, and it never happened. I stopped the movie and came back later. In reality I forced myself to look at the rest hoping it would improve. It got worse. I kept asking myself, who are these people? Do they have feelings? are they just robots? I'm glad I didn't pay to see it or pay to rent it. The end would have been better if Dutch had died from the gunshot wound. At least we would have had some excitement from the audience. Or maybe not.
