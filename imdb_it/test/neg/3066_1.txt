I rented this pile of sewage, hoping for some good laughs. With a title like "Zombie Bikers from Detroit" and with Dead Alive productions printed on the cover, you'd think this could be a funny / creepy movie, but no. This is the worst movie I've ever seen (and yes, I've seen all the films from the Police Academy). The story (this is a joke inside) and the dialogue is atrocious. The trick of the so-called zombies seems to have used one of those two dollars "Make yourself look like a zombie kit you buy at K-Mart. <br /> <br /> I'd rather watch Beverly Hills 90210 while listening to the Backstreet Boys and you're whipped by a birthday card model of a novelty of 400 pounds rather than spending another minute of this pathetic excuse for a DVD. Honestly, I could make a better movie with $ 3, some popsicle sticks and a little slinky. if 90 minutes of my life have been torn away from me and taken to the land of Suckdom, I know that tagging on the production of Dead Alive does not guarantee a great movie, but you expect to get your money. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made me happy (saved, returning the hideous mass of elephant feces) was that it was not called "Biker Zombies from Pittsburgh." I feel for the people of Detroit that they wasted their hard earned money on this. Unless you were lobotomized ?? buy, rent if you have to ?? But ?? You will regret it.
