Solange is not a great Italian thriller. Get ready for the spoiler: the main suspect, the professor, didn't do it. But is it really a spoiler? No, because you know he couldn't be the killer from the beginning; he and a student witnessed the first murder. Thus, there is absolutely no doubt that the professor is the killer or not. There is a long and boring reconstruction up to the final explanation of the mystery. The solution is interesting, but it comes out of nowhere. The rest of the film (and it's not a short film) isn't exciting enough to get you interested. Even in the tradition of "accused wrong man" he fails, because the police never seriously accuses the professor, and the murderer never follows him. Boring, boring, boring
