This is an absolutely horrible excuse for a show. Do people say she's witty and smart? I don't see how? Perhaps because the characters use fancy words? Perhaps because they are haughty, they use dry humor and have two-dimensional personalities. I went to an Ivy League school and no one acted anywhere as obnoxious as these characters. In fact, if I had met someone like them, I probably would have strangled them! Men act like small emotional pre-adolescent girls and all minority characters are based on stereotypes ... The characters are NOT ALL AUTHENTIC. In a nutshell they sound like a caravan family trying to be rich and sophisticated. This show is just another biscuit shot that brain-stormed spectators eat regularly in the early evening.
