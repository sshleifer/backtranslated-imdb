Two years after leaving the small town of Grover's Bend to meet the Krites, Brad Brown returns to spend time with his grandmother in time for Easter. Meanwhile, Krite's eggs begin to hatch. While causing problems in the city, Brown and the inhabitants of the city, as well as the alien bounty hunters who have returned to finish the creatures must fight bloodthirsty fireballs before they sweep the city away. <br /> <br /> The original Critters was a small attempt to wrest the family horror film "Gremlins". It has become a favorite cult on video shelves and has had enough success to justify a sequel. This sequel minimizes horror and instead makes its entire comedy focus. Unfortunately the comedy part is extremely clumsy, as well as childish. The acting is on par with the rest of the film. It's just that the film suffers from a weak script. The visual effects are quite well made. <br /> <br /> Rating: D + Review by M. K. Geist.
