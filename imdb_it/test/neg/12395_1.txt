University students (who are actually around the end of the 1920s) on the Boston campus (which seems strangely like Isle of Man) are threatened by a fierce monster (assembled during an episode of Blue Peter). The new teacher has to save the day (Even if it's really ... Oh, who cares?) <br /> <br /> I'll start with the positives ... there's a nice shot by Eastenders new gal Samantha La can of Janus in the mandatory scene of the campus with her best friend Katy Lawrence. A little curiosity: Katy was hired when she came to auditions with her sister, just as moral support to her brother, but ended up landing a part. Oh, joy. Chosen by darkness to ... ignite his buttocks pert in a meaningless scene added to the titillation, then he is killed for 30 minutes for his problems. His latest (and only other credited role) is as Probationary Nurse # 5 in Atonement. I wonder if he took a look at Keira Knightly (if the extras and stars are allowed to mix) and wondered: where did everything go wrong ?! <br /> <br /> I will give some suggestions Katy: If all the other members of the British cast are asked to speak with American accents in a failed attempt at mass marketing, and the only person who manages it is the US veteran B-movie Todd Jensen, you know you're in trouble. If you look at your paycheck and cover only your lunch and your bus trip, you won't be acting in a movie with a budget of a trillion dollars. If the premiere is attended by a lot of family members of the fourth assistant director and causes laughter when the Stickyback tape monster goes wild in the sewers, you should understand that it's not exactly Alien. Or even a Critters IV, come to think of it. So, Katy, in your next life (I'm a Buddhist, see) maybe you'll be a little more selective in your debut choice than to jump impulsively to the first bunch of crap that goes towards you. The skin that flashes in your first film does not guarantee lasting success. Unless you're Sylvester Stallone. And he had Rocky's script to support it. <br /> <br /> To all intents and purposes this is a 0/10 film like I've never seen. However, by pure involuntary laughter and pure field value, he gets a 1. Well done;)
