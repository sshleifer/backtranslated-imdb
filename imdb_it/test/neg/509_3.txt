I saw the 219 minute version and I must say that dollar for dollar is probably one of the worst films ever. Now I'm NOT saying it's the worst movie ever - but if you look at a cost ratio compared to how much an average person can enjoy it, this is a very, very bad film. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that the only major factor that makes this film negative is the writer / director, Michael Cimino. Rarely can so much blame be attributed to a single person. If it weren't so self-indulgent, an equally bad film could easily have been made in about 90 minutes - saving millions of studio copies! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a completely useless prologue that should be set at Harvard. The scene is HUGE but completely without context. You have no idea what's going on and you don't know why the students (in particular, John Hurt) behave so rudely. I find it very difficult to imagine a beginning like this in 1870 - and it seems much more similar to 1970. This is a half hour in which you have no idea what is happening, who are the characters or their motivations. <br /> <br /> The next scene is 20 years later. Inexplicably, the two Harvard graduates (Hurt and Kris Kristofferson) are in Wyoming. So, they went to the best American school and now one is just a law man in the middle of a no and the other is .... well, what is John Hurt in the movie?!?! It appears here and there and seems to be either an idiot (the prologue) or a pathetic and senseless drunk who hangs out with the killers - even if it is apparently against them !? His whole character made no sense. They never explained why he was a living Englishman in the middle of nowhere (it was impossible to hide his accent), because he took the trouble to come with the hired army IF he was so against their evil plan or why he would risk his life for a cause in which he did not believe at all. As for Kristofferson, his excellent acting and well-defined character made his character more believable, even if he moved him to Wyoming and risk his life for a prostitute made no sense. <br /> <br /> This makes the appearance of HEAVEN'S GATE look worse. While the scenes are too long and need cuts, the worst part of the movie is that the characters were like cardboard. John Hurt (a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the film), Jeff Bridges and many other big names are there but you have no idea why. In fact, in addition to Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert (as a prostitute with a heart of gold - rather the clich√©) and perhaps Christopher Walken, EVERYONE is completely one-dimensional. It is hard to imagine an THIS movie in which you do not know or understand the characters. <br /> <br /> Much of the film seems anachronistic. Who would have thought of building a giant ice rink in the middle of nowhere in the 1890s? I am sure that getting the basic supplies to this region in the West would have been very, very difficult - and yet trains are expected to be filled with roller skates and timber instead of FOOD. Perhaps if they hadn't spent billions of dollars to build and attend the skating rink, farmers could afford to BUY food and avoid this war for stolen cattle !!! And what does the boy with the roller skates have to do with the violin? What does this have to do with a land war? <br /> <br /> The most obvious problem that remains is that it is a film in which very, very little actually happens until the great battle is late in the film. There are many scenes of dirt and nothing plan. Nothing at all when the battle occurs, many members of the public would have remained or are now so hostile to the film that it is inevitable that nothing can save the film. <br /> <br /> As for the final battle, it was done quite well but had problems. First, this little skirmish on the prairie lasted longer than the D-Day invasion !! Second, while the details of the actual events of the so-called "Johnson County War" are a bit rough, we know that the characters played by Huppert and Kristofferson were never there, since both were hung up BEFORE the battle. Third, I can't believe that Cimino actually killed animals during the film, especially during the final battle. While I am far from a bleeding heart for animal rights, his need to use animal guts and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in film history. Watching and knowing that some of the horses died to get the "vision" of Cimino for the film is very sad. <br /> <br /> Finally, after the great battle, we have an epilogue. Although it is fortunately short, it also seemed completely useless and vague. We see Kristofferson on a luxury yacht, so we can assume he is finally sorting out some of Harvard's teachings. We also see a woman who appears to be one that Kris has watched a couple of times during the prologue. Above all, nothing is said and you have no idea what the end result is. I read about it alone and discovered that the film often failed the facts. <br /> <br /> Overall, to say that the film is long and needed many more changes was like saying that World War II was a "little tiff". Well, I've definitely seen a lot worse, but if you consider the cost of production, I really think it could be one of the worst films in history. <br /> <br /> Finally, when a movie has this very explicit nudity I warn parents. However, since no child could sit in this film (even with a promise of sex), the warning is not necessary.
