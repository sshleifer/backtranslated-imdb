I rented this movie from the local video store one day, you know, the kind of box art movie that comes up and tells you to "rent me". Well, if you see this boring movie in your video store, walk ahead. Fight the impulse, rent a porn, because this film is BOOOoooorrrring. Despite the interesting opening, the film ends in repetitive murders and a hardboiled policeman stumbles, facing the usual problems (wife, bastard of a leader, etc.). Wondering if the fast forward feature on your VCR works? Rent this movie and test your concerns.
