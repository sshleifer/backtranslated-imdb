This is Daniel Day Lewis' worst work ever ... I can't believe that in the same year he made this horrible movie and my left foot ..... Please, stay away from this movie .... this is a film only for Argentines as a curiosity ... The plot is impossible to understand ...... The writer thinks that in Argentina all people speak in English ... Obviously Patagonia brings a very good framework for the photo shoot of the film, but it is not a sufficient reason to see this film .... I repeat, only if you are a very fan of Daniel Day Lewis, or if you want to see southern Argentina, part of Patagonia, and you don't enough money to travel alone .......
