Obviously, this does not point to the brain: the so-called "humor" is based on fart and every clich√© on any ethnic genre imaginable, including homosexuals, of course, provided they are not WASP. Is this a Latin cowrota? Furthermore, John Leguizamo has talent and charisma, but in such a self-indulgent film it is a definite waste. What's the point of trying to get out, Jim Carrey Jim Carrey himself? "The Pest" of the title could therefore be this film, almost as funny as Bergman's best. Prepare to be annoyed, not amused
