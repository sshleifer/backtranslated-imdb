ATTENTION SPOILER: at the end of the film it is announced that the bridge collapsed a few days after it was captured. The impression is that the attack was useless. In fact, taking the bridge at Remagen was the last major victory for the Western allies. It was the crossing of the Rhine that the Allies had tried to reach for six months. As the Remagen bridge was taken, the war ended in a few weeks. <br /> <br /> The bridge must last only one day after being captured. This was enough time for the Americans to send combat engineers and a great protective force to the other side, and they could then start building a series of boat decks. The taking of the bridge was a complete success and meant that the end of the war was near and would not last during the summer. Contrary to the cynical nature of the film, the victory was announced with enthusiasm by the troops that made it. They knew how vital the battle was. <br /> <br /> This film has little to do with real history. It was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time in which it was produced.
