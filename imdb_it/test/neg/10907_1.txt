Nothing about this film is good. It is a formidable and predictable "romantic comedy" aimed at making women force their significant others to look. In other words, it is a predictable chic film that is neither comic nor romantic and is extraordinarily daunting. If you like to watch the same thing over and over again, this movie will fit perfectly. I was also forced to watch this with my g / f at that time and it is not surprising that we are no longer together. I like great movies that are wonderful to watch, while she just wants to see the same thing over and over again only with different actors. Nothing good to say about this movie. The title says it all. 1/10 (one b / c I can't give it a zero.
