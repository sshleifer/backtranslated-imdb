This should be based on Wilkie Collins' The_Woman_In_White_, but the only similarity with this story was the names of the characters, the time period and the settings. If they were going to change the story so thoroughly, I don't understand why they had to keep pretending it came from Wilkie Collins. Go read the book. It is much better.
