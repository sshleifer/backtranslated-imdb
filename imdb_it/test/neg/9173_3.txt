What can I say ... not much to this. Quite boring and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> The actors' performances are OK. The only one that shines in any way is Simmons, but it has only, maybe 3 scenes. I understand that, keeping his screen to a minimum, he keeps the mysterious psychic aura he has, but I can't help feeling his talent wasted. No one else has risen above the mediocre. <br /> <br /> The story itself seems to be intriguing at first, but then it's not going anywhere. There wasn't a single scene in the film that hit me or made me feel like I had just seen something special. The cinematography was rather insignificant ... I mean the desert in a kind of faded cuttlefish ... not very stimulating. <br /> <br /> The story of his childhood friend back outside the prison seemed only partially designed and didn't really add anything to the story, besides creating a "Twilight Zone" script in a full length feature . <br /> <br /> Drab.
