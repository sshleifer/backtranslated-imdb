Having grown up in the West and considering the current lack of westerns on TV and in the theater, I was looking forward to Commanche moon. <br /> <br /> After seeing two nights, and not another, it seems to have been filmed on a limited budget. The level stars Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones are visibly absent. There's Val Kilmer, but what the hell is going on with him? Four or five buildings on either side of the street plus Scull's villa make up the entire city of Austin. The capitol is never seen, only the interior of the governor's office. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is often times hokey, meaningless wandering. The plot is separate. Overall, completely forgettable.
