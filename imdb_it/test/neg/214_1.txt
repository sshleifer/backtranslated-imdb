this film is terribly bad which forced me to create an account with IMDb just to warn others. <br /> <br /> I have used IMDb for a long time, and many films have come close to me to register to praise or hit, however no one has ever been so worthy. Until now! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Matt Dillon. all I could ask myself in this film is "how did Dillon choose this script"? really. I mean, there are bigger holes than Vredefort. <br /> <br /> I mean it's a modern robbery film, not a set in the seventies. To shout loudly, even a child knows that armored trucks have GPS tracking and the type. makes you wonder what it takes to get a script produced in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I could go on for centuries, but I won't. believe me when I say this save yourself and let it go. <br /> <br /> Sorry Matt, I'm still a fan, but this movie sucked.
