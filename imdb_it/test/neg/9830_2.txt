If you've ever wanted to know more about taxi drivers, then this is an excellent movie to watch, for informational purposes only. Now I can only hear it, "Wait, wait a second! Because we don't follow a taxi driver all day! Taxi drivers are fun, as are the people they meet, and only talk to each other for a couple of minutes, so the other actors they should be cheap! Harry, you take care of the production, Joan, you have material, Brian, you do a tour of actors and we'll all meet again tomorrow to start shooting! "<br /> <br /> The first 90% of the film could not have been worse if this had happened. At least without any planning, there is always the element of surprise to be found. Some of Jim Carrey's films have added stuff as they go along and always do well at the box office. The problem here is that the first 90% is well planned, and sucks. Paul Dillon plays the all-day Chicago taxi driver. We see practically what he sees. People enter and leave his car and drive around the city. Talk to those people for a few seconds and then we have other people. <br /> <br /> I have to admit there were a couple of fun pieces here and there. A religious family tries to convince the taxi driver to go to church with them, takes a pregnant lady and her husband to the hospital, raises a rich businessman from his girlfriend, a poor girl of her boyfriend and brings home a victim of rape. I imagine the moral of the film is that a Cab Driver is more than a Cab Driver and has a wider sphere of influence on the lives of its passengers than you might think originally. For some people, it's just a way to get from here to there, but for others, his very common words help change the direction of their lives. <br /> <br /> The last passenger of the day is used to trying to make sense of the rest of the film, and to a small extent he is successful. He had a bit of that feeling of repentance of the point of death where most of the movie sucks and then, in the end, tries to improve everything in one or two changes. I wasn't too impressed with the film as a whole, but there were some pieces that were worth looking at again. As for the actors, Paul Dillon is like that. John Cusack, Gillian Anderson and Julianne Moore are all in this, for about 30 seconds each, but don't watch it for any of them or you'll surely be disappointed. I will give the other people the credit for saying that it is not your ordinary movie that they produced here, but it wasn't even that great. There wasn't enough material to keep you going for an hour and a half. It was a decent effort, but it didn't fail the same.
