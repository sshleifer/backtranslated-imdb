Incident inside and outside a mountain road is the entrance of Don Coscarelli in the Masters of Horror series by Mick Garris. Coscarelli is famous for being the man behind cult gems like the Phantasm series and the irresistibly bizarre Bubba Ho-Tep; but it does not bring any of the qualities that made those great films to this television episode. The plot is a run of the mill that follows the routine idea of ​​an innocent being chased by a madman. This time, it is a young woman who walks along a mountain road. After falling on his head, he finds himself being haunted by a white maniac. The whole sequence of the chase is really ridiculous, with the young woman stopping every now and then to trap traps; only that the maniac will appear a few seconds later, and this is cut with scenes that show her with her husband - who by chance has a great deal of information on how to escape the mad murderers; with lines like "expect the unexpected". The only real highlight for me was the presence of Phantasm's Tall Man, Angus Scrimm. Coscarelli does his best to implement as many horror images as possible; with things like a decomposed dead child's corpse - but because it's all so silly on the whole, it's hard to take this piece seriously. This is the first episode of the series, and the first I saw; I really hope they get better.
