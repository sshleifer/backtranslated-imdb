This movie was so stupid that I couldn't believe what I was seeing as I watched it, it was like a huge train crash - I couldn't look away because it was just terribly terrible! I can honestly say that I've never seen anything so ugly in my whole life. It was so trivial and the acting was so deplorable that I kept thinking "this must be just some kind of joke, right?" No one would actually make such a lousy movie on purpose, right? "I really hope this is all just a bad joke and these people don't really expect people to look at this directly, and I really hope that the people who participated in this movie were doing a terrible acting on purpose and actually not Do they believe that they are good actors? The drag queens are rather fun to watch, though, and also the special cheese effects of a 1980s science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> Look only if you've already seen them all the other films in the first existence and there is nothing left to watch! I would give this a "0" if it were possible.
