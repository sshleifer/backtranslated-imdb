I have rarely seen a film that deviates so much from the original premise and remains (more or less) acceptable? Bloodline is a rather short escapade (which is a good thing in this case) that focuses on the mysterious Hellraiser box. Who wanted it to be done and how to cast a spell over the entire bloodline of the man who eventually created it. There are presented 3 generations of the Merchant family (all played by Bruce Ramsey); an eighteenth-century Paris, one nowadays and the last in a distant future galaxy, far away ?? Opinions on this plot may differ greatly or are thought to be very idiotic and far-fetched or original and daring. The initial atmosphere and the setting of Clive Barker have completely vanished, yet the morbid environment remains and several sequences are still very disturbing and disturbing. Hellraiser: Bloodline contains quite a bit of exquisite slaughter and the charismatic presence of Pinhead (Doug Bradley) is still an extra horror value. Pinhead ?? accompanied by an animal cub this time ?? he still knows how to kill too badly he talks too much and his bad talk tends to get boring quickly. The best aspects of this production are the "cenobites" recently introduced and the occult Parisian portrait. The gigantic turn-offs are the weak script, the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to Barker's initial masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Even though it is not very memorable, Bloodline is the latest Hellraiser film that can be watched. After this sequel, the series went completely downhill. So far two more sequels have come out (2 more are still in the works) and none of them is worth seeing. Hellraiser: Bloodline suffered from many production difficulties and the director eventually preferred to be credited as Alan Smithee ?? It means he doesn't want to be remembered as the director of it. Who could blame him?
