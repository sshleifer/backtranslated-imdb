A beautiful, stereotyped, good-looking cast, the story flows in a wide and confused arc, which takes you along a series of garden paths (without affluent tributaries) before falling towards an end that lets you go - empty. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a film that has reached its peak or ends with a satisfying thud, this will be a disappointment. Despite the main character's sexually obvious sexuality, I felt that he was androgynous, lacking a clear male character, rather than his lack of a clear French character. Although at the end of the film he is naked (or rather naked) at the end of the film, the viewer is as unaware as the character is about the motivations: that little thing called plot. Probably a stereotypical point of view of English, at least if you take the side of the film.
