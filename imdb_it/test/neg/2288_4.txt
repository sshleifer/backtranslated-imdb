Sad in every respect, this excuse for a career boost for Connery was neither that nor the hit that Warner wanted it to be. In 20 minutes and embarrassing moments for all concerned, this film and "Robocop 2" are proof that Irvin Kershner had no real control over "The Empire Strikes Back". Connery hadn't been a hit since he'd fired from Bond in 1971, but that didn't bring him back at all. "Octopussy" was released several months before this film, and easily surpassed it. Imagine that - a Roger Moore Bond is not only better than a simultaneous version of Connery, but is interesting (and compared to "Mai ...", "Octopussy" is on a par with "2001". <br /> <br / > the worst Bond theme song, even worse than "The Man with the Golden Gun", useless scenes that drag uselessly (with the worst example of that ridiculous video game sequence - MY GOD - WHO CARES?!), and the most atrocious collection of non-talented with regards to the fabulous "Bond Girls". Does anyone think SERIOUSLY that Kim Basinger is attractive in this film? this - Simply stupid - but the way Kershner directed her to bounce around all the time didn't help her: it's the seedling that will become the impressive "Onatop", which was the best feature of "GoldenEye, "but this means nothing, while you struggle hard in the film. <br /> <br /> Ca sting Leit Er as a black agent was a great idea, but the interaction between friends and connections that Connery and he should have is terribly bad. Two actors have never looked so clumsily tied up - they testify to the scene in which, to escape the local authorities, they strip off boxers and pretend to be out and exercise - I can't imagine another scene in a film that has tried so much so unsuccessful as to have a laugh.
