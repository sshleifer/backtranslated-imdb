I have to start by saying that the actresses and the actor did a great job for what they worked for. The problem in Dark Reality is that you had a poor director who tried so hard to be innovative and evocative that he ended up ruining the film. From the beginning to the end you can say that the quality of the film is low, but the poor lighting and the flickering camera do nothing but further blur what is happening. The sound is muffled and often not understood. I am sure that Huston (the director) would have argued that this would have led to a state of panic among the public, but had more than ample material in which to do so. Having to determine the camera and illuminate the way it was done was a sign of the upper syndrome. <br /> <br /> The story is good. A simple sadistic story of female abduction that avoids the clich√© keeping the girl in a state of despair all the time for a good reason. Billy Bob of Silence of the Lambs treated his victims better than Netwon. The biggest problem in the story is that the dead constantly harass the protagonist in his mind, and the second time they showed up I made a rapid advance because it was trying to destroy the only decent part of the film. <br /> <Finally, the way the director put together blurry random things and constantly barely visible scenes (not because of the horror, because of the lighting, the corners and the camera) at the end he destroyed this movie. Obviously Huston was trying too hard and if anything he looked like a bad school project. If you want to see a decent story, then that's fine, but keep in mind that the quality of the movie is enough to turn it off.
