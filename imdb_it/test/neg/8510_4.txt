Without a doubt, Rampling is gorgeous - a classic beauty, very young here. He manages to appear simultaneously sophisticated and moving. Even his two male laminae work well. But seen in 2003, the flic is all <br /> <br /> American-looking-to-be-artsy-and-not-be-Hollywood-while-shooting-beautiful-shots-of-the-French- Riviera -and-three-pretty-young-people-in-their-cute-old-ca r. I liked the view (both actors and nature), but the film is boring and pretentious as it tries to be the opposite.
