Avoid this movie. If you expect "The Poseidon Adventure" (1972), you may notice nothing more than a "curve" case. This film offers nothing but two hours of complete and extremely long boredom. <br /> <br /> The cast members behave as if they were irritated by the irritation of a bathtub that overflows from a bed of an insignificant petunia. The script is totally unrealistic and the film does not even feel like a catastrophic film. Actually, everything about this movie is ugly, with the exception of Tom Courtenay. It is a pity that such a good actor has been swept away by a flood of false declarations, to appear in such a flood. When this film was made, Poseidon must have fallen into a sea of ​​shame in his aquatic tomb. And, Shelley Winters will rise again, from death (directed by Poseidon), to persecute anyone who dares to see this pathetic movie. I consider this film a 1 in 10, but it really deserves a zero. This film will make you want to avoid, or run completely against, water. And it will leave a bitter taste in your mouth. It might even make you want to see "Jaws" (1975) and make friends with a great white man.
