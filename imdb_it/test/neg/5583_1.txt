This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The highlight of the film is a comparison between the smell of natural gas and a dirty vagina. <br /> <br /> Acting is pathetic. I know that acting is hard work and stuff like that, but that's why it should be left to real actors. Watching these people act is like watching Michael J. Fox perform a brain operation. It's flaky at best. <br /> <br /> One of the other comments would have you believe that the film was saved by Dan Gordon's acting talents as Chris. Only Dan himself or maybe his mother could believe it was a good acting. <br /> <br /> The special effects in this film were terrible. The worst special effects were the explosion of gas in the lighthouse. It seemed that someone was shining an orange light from the bottom of a model built from a refrigerator. Surely there was a bit of superimposed computer animation, but it didn't help. I suspect that the special effects on this film were created and rendered using a single Amiga computer from the late 1980s.
