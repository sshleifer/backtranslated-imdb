Nickelodeon went down to the bathroom. They have children who say things like "Oh my God!" e "We're screwed" <br /> <br /> This show promotes hatred for people who are not good-looking or who are not part of the crowd. He says that sexual promiscuity is fine, making girls drool over shirtless boys. Not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt. The main characters basically avoid anyone from being out of the ordinary. Sam, Carly's friend, who could be a lesbian, beats the brat of anyone who crosses his path, which says it's okay to be a b ** ch. This show has so much negativity in it that no one should watch it! I give him a 0 out of 10 !!!
