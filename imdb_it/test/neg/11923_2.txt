I got to know ÆON again in the early 90s via television and I loved it ... <br /> <br /> What did you like about it? Irritable design style? Impeccable artistic action has resulted? The absurd and impassive communication between the characters? The whole layout of the surrounding future world? No matter what you like about it ... <br /> <br /> The Aeon Flux movie from the end of 2005 has none of this. <br /> <br /> Karyn Kusama, the so-called "director" of the film, was hopelessly forced to carry the original content in a new movie. If you don't know the original series, you won't understand anything during the first 60 minutes of the movie. The story is inscrutable and the non-living characters develop during the film. <br /> <br /> Kusama's attempting to improve the plot by implementing some rather weak explanatory conversations among the main characters is not just a lame attempt to hide its flaws as a narrator, it is simply unworthy of ÆON's original concept. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron could be an attractive woman, but she can't impersonate the ÆON character. Although attached to strings that made action scenes, her lack of talent for physical movement simply ruins the action sequences of the film. The result is an enormous amount of frantic photo cuts to cover the pure limp of his body. <br /> <br /> Forget everything else, it's not worth talking about ... <br /> <br /> I give a point to Mrs. Theron showing her tits and 1 point for the beautiful architectural photography of the film. That's all.
