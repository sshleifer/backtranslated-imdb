Honestly I'm not at all impressed, it's not a bad movie, but it's not even nice. There is a story to tell, but it is told in a very inconsistent way what kind of makes its full meaning and ability to intrigue dissolved. This film may have been made in another way with an exceptional result, the story is so interesting and yet somehow I am not fascinated when I look at it. <br /> <br /> It is definitely not an amateur film, quite the opposite and some scenes are really exciting. The actors and the actresses do a good job and also the director, but there is something unfinished for the whole film that I can't understand. Perhaps if I had the chance to get to know the characters better, the whole "confusion" of the film could have been better clarified and put more "action" in all its cause, because it was so, it became a bit slow from time to time .
