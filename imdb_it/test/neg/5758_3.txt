This was pretty bad. I really hope there is no following. Perhaps this is giving away part of the plot to let you know that it is open to possibility, but no, in reality it is not. <br /> <br /> There's really nothing special about this movie. Well, the special effect was pretty good, but nothing exceptional. <br /> <br /> There were some sexy girls in her, especially Elina Madison and Alexandra Ford, but nothing to see. PG-13, definitely not an R. This also tells you that the aspects of the slasher were less than spectacular. The shovel on his head was the only unusual thing. <br /> <br /> Tame the fare.
