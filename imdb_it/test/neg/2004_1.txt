I will not repeat what so many others have said about this film; I will try to add some new points. Coolio-as-vampire's piece is a nod to fans who are familiar with his turn in the song "No Exit" Blondie in which he takes on the role of a rap vampire (actually it works like a musical concept and is indeed a great song). Casper Van Dien is no worse than Brad Pitt and is actually nicer. And really what goes to someone for a Brad Pitt movie if not for sweet eyes? The same here, although this is poorly filmed (see "Starship Troopers" instead). And of course Udo Kier, after playing Dracula in the movie Morrissey / Warhol, has little more than a cameo. Have fun if you can.
