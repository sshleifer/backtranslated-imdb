After seeing this film, I have nothing but contempt for any of those involved in the making of this abysmal movie. For one, as a general comment, the plot was literally incredible and full of incredible clich√©s all around. The same obviously applies to the dialogue that streamlines to the lowest common denominator and manages to offer absolutely zero unpredictable original lines. The acting was also terrible with Kane who showed, throughout the film, the three most distinct and distinct emotions. Even the use of modern special effects failed, as each object was easily distinguishable from its real counterpart. Overall, I would not advise anyone to think of visualizing this feature, as it will definitely waste 83 (not even 90!) Minutes of your life.
