For a horror movie, this is criminally boring. Some memorable and creepy bits can't compensate for a really bad script. Very little coherence is achieved and the film inexorably rips its only basic idea (a killer cat), until it becomes repetitive - and things are made even worse by the constant use of shots from the point of view of the cat.
