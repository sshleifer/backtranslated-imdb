Despite not being a fan of "Star Trek" movies or the universe of shows and books and the like, I still find some fun in some films with the old cast and in the case of "First Contact" even the new cast a little' . But this one was a little sad to look at ... it seemed like it wanted to be so much, but it didn't fit on so many levels to be one of the worst Star Trek movies. The plot is very far-fetched, it seems to want to combine three or four stories in a final Trek adventure, but ends up becoming a little bit funny when it tries to be, it's not tense when it wants to be and it's not full of action as if trying to make a mess of inconsistencies. The whole film to take a sentence from Spock is illogical. The effects are nothing special since I've seen episodes of Next Generation just as good, which means it's good for a TV show, but not for an important film. The plot is ridiculous, as the band first tries to stop Spock's brother, so he joins him in his search for God, yes, you read that right. The Klingons stick to appearances, which in reality will create the film much better than Undiscovered Country. All in all, you know it's bad when the best part of the movie is Kirk, Bones and Spock singing your boat out loud, well, Spock wasn't really singing, but rather questioning the lyrics.
