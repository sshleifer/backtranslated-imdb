According to the article on http://blog.ifeng.com/article/2737487.html, one of the film's actors, Carina Lau, was forced to appear in this film for free. She was the victim of a notorious kidnapping shortly before the film was made, and later her troubled photos were published in a magazine, which has since been forced to close and her publisher was sent to prison. The actress denies that she was attacked, but a film was released online that would prove to have been raped in a group. (The Hong Kong press, out of respect for her, has mostly refused to report on the incident, but some articles about it will be published on Google.)
