It may seem strange, but I only saw the first film (The Emperor's New Groove, yaddayadda) a week ago and just because of an episode of the TV show. I just love Kuzco's character, but Kronk is not so bad. Anyway, in the end I decided to watch the second movie, just so I would have seen it. I was hoping he was as good as the first, but ... I'm sorry to say, but the more American humor became, the more I yawned. I agree with Kuzco when he started crying seeing all the cheese shots. <br /> <br /> Again, younger children and probably even veterans will love this movie in pieces (if they like the old school that moralizes Disney), but I only had expectations that they were a bit too big and damn taller than they should have been. Kronk is a lovely character, kindhearted and stupid all at once, but it's Pacha and Kuzco in drag who woke me up at the end of the film. (I will ignore Rudy ... as much as possible). <br /> <br /> However, great film, not just my style and as they say, you always have to be true to your groove.
