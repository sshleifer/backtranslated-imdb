"Red Sonja" is imperfect, weak and missing. Even the camp is not good. <br /> <br /> There are only two positive things about "Red Sonja"; The costumes (even if the costume of Red Sonja is ridiculous, it is ironic that a girl who is even afraid of being touched by men, because she was raped, still chooses to wear so few clothes, even when it rains.) And the music of Ennio Morricone. The film is still watchable but certainly not recommendable. <br /> <br /> The story is extremely simple and they didn't even bother to make it interesting. The story could have been forgotten if there had been some good action sequences and some humor, both are present but are seriously imperfect in many ways. The film takes itself too seriously and tries to impress but fails completely. <br /> <br /> Brigitte Nielsen is a horrible protagonist. I don't know who the worst accent is; His or Arnie's and beyond that; You cannot act. Furthermore, there is absolutely no connection between the two characters that makes the romance absolutely incredible. Even worse was Sandahl Bergman as the main villain acting more than a paper bag. Ronald Lacey was a little good in his role, but my God looks horrible, he changed a lot from his (only known) role in "Raiders of the Lost Ark". Perhaps it had something to do with his illness that claimed his life in 1991? And by the way, what was it with all those "Raiders of the Lost Ark" actors in this movie? Alongside Ronald Lacey, Pat Roach, Terry Richards and All Lemkow appeared in a role, it seemed like a sort of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" reunion. <br /> <br /> The only times the movie gets a little interesting is during the fighting (sword) even if some of them are useless and weak. <br /> <br /> Only really watchable for fans of the fantasy genre. <br /> <br /> 4/10
