As a longtime fan of Japanese cinema, I expected more. I can't really worry about writing a lot, since this movie is so poor. The story could be the nicest and most romantic little thing ever, too bad I couldn't stand the terrible acting, the disorder they called the rhythm and the classic Japanese "bizarre" story. If you've noticed how many Japanese movies use characters, story lines and twists that seem too "different", that's why, then avoid this movie. Seriously, a 12-year-old could have told you how this movie was going, and it's not a good thing in my book. <br /> <br /> "Beat" fan Takeshi: his part in this film is not much more than a cameo and, unless you're a huge fan, you don't have to suffer from this waste of movies. <br /> <br /> 2/10
