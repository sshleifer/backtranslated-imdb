What do you get when you put Lou Diamond Philips, Todd Bridges, Barry Corbin with an ugly hairpiece and a stranger on a train? You get a very bad movie called "Alien Express" or "Dead Rail" which would be more fun in the old Comedy Central series "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Call it, this terrible film has suffered in areas of acting, plot, plot and special effects. In fact, the blows of the outer passenger train seemed to be that the production staff used a common HO scale model in front of a painted background! The rest of the special effects go downhill from there. <br /> <br /> The plot is very predictable and is similar to two films from the 70s called "Horror Express" and a catastrophic film entitled "The Cassandra Crossing". At least "The Cassandra Crossing" had a better cast, a compelling storyline and real train scenes. <br /> <br /> If you want a good laugh and a movie to make fun of a "B movie" party then watch this; otherwise, "Alien Express" derailed long before leaving the station!
