If you have fun sitting in the dark, both literally and figuratively, for ninety minutes this is the movie for you. A waste of actors, resources and audience time. Ultimately a waste of space. Don't be tempted by the curriculum. There is nothing further substance beyond it. The film lacks all the bases you could expect from the genre; plot, character, development, epilogue. The cast could perhaps take courage from the knowledge that in this case their efforts will be completely forgettable and, given the time, perhaps their career could improve. <br /> <br /> Absolute tripe.
