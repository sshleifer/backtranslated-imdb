I don't know how people can look at this: the only people who love to watch this are those who have no feelings and emotions and enjoy watching people die, burned houses, car accidents, children die and cast members are killed every week. It's the most absurd thing on television and I still don't know how they fit on the charts. It's so depressing. I can imagine the writers sitting down and saying, "then, who will we kill next week?" Or "which house should we twist in a month?" <br /> <br /> It's the most depressing, absurd and most stupid thing on TV at the moment, and I can't understand people's motives for watching this depressing shit pile anymore
