The plot of this film is similar to the original. Someone is kidnapped, the prince is incest in saving her, Odet turns into a swan, the turtle / frog / swelling before the "bad" magician as best he can, and in the end .... However, there is not much new . With the exception of a lack of well-known vocal talent. Sorry, no Palance or Cleese and therefore Jean-Bob was a disappointment.
