The first half of this film has kept some promises as it seemed that the film would be a low-profile psychodrama like THE MINUS MAN, but then the whole thing collapses into clich√©s and the viewer slowly loses all interest. There's a decent cast here, but the film is lifeless and the talent is completely wasted.
