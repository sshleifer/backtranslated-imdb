As Ben Elton once remarked, nothing is faster than style compared to comedy. The latest offer from Steve Martin - "The Pink Panther 2" - has recently opened negative reviews and box office receipts, while "My Love Guru" by Mike Myers seems to have conquered few admirers. <br /> <br /> In 1970, it was Jerry Lewis 'turn to experience the pain of rejection (ironically, his character in this film experiences a funny twist whenever someone uses that word in his presence) when' Which Way To The Front? effectively pushed him off the big screen for almost a decade. <br /> <br /> In this Second World War comedy, he plays Brendan Byers 111, the richest man in the world, who wants to join the army to do his patriotic duty (and also because he is bored with success) , but is rejected because it is not suitable from the medical point of view. He decides to found his own privately funded army, recruiting 4-F others. <br /> <br /> Made with ridiculous uniforms that resemble those worn by 'International Rescue' in 'Thunderbirds', they go into training. Some good visual gags here. When they launch rocket launchers, they look happy with themselves, until they learn that they just destroyed a Texaco oil station! Eager to learn German, Brendan plays a long album called "Songs To Mein Kampf By". When this army sits down to eat, instead of being in a mess room full of garbage, it is in an opulent room with a chandelier. <br /> <br /> John Wood is very funny as "Finkel", Byers always -so English butler His best scene is when he blackmails a mafia gangster to teach Byers brigade to kill. <br /> <br /> The screenplay was not by Jerry, but by Gerald Gardiner and Dee Caruso, author of a series of episodes of 'The Monkees'. "Front" often has the appearance of a television sitcom, in fact it is sometimes almost expected to hear a laugh. <br /> <br /> Where it goes bad is in the last thirty minutes when Byers replaces a leading Nazi commander and, after ordering the Germans to withdraw from the front, he gets involved in the plot to kill Hitler (and Tom Cruise is not seen nowhere!). As commander, Jerry offers an exhibition of ineptitude so shocking that it defies description. He gives Brian Blessed a run for his money in the strongest man's live bets. It is a real relief when the credits appear. <br /> <br /> Maybe timing was simply wrong: pulling out a war comedy when the Vietnam conflict was raging was not a good idea. Or the public had had enough of Jerry (probably the beard didn't help!). What he needed was a good producer, someone to pick it up and say, "That vomit stinks, throw it out!" 'Do not Raise The Bridge, Lower The River' is a masterpiece compared to this image. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s, the new icons of the comedy will be Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Monty Python - fresher, more pungent and in the case of Allen, more human comedy styles have replaced the brand of Jerry's slapstick. It would not have been until 1982 that he would do something like a comeback - like the alleged "Jerry Langford" talk show in Martin Scorsese's brilliant "The King Of Comedy".
