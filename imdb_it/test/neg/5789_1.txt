Oh man, I hated this movie. Of course, the site's locations were fantastic, but it's the only positive thing I can say about it. Now, I will declare from the outset that I am VERY critical of how weapons, particularly firearms, are portrayed and managed in movies. Being a war movie, the portrait was fine, but the handling of the weapons in the film would never have been tolerated by a real SEAL Team. The acting was more wooden than my first sailboat, the equipment carried (or lack of it) was ridiculous, and the dialogue was, let's say, without ANY THING interesting. Well, with the exception of the journalist, who was actually prescient. Watching this movie was comparable to watching "Palmetto" with Woody Harrelson, where every scene was so bad that it couldn't be turned off, because you had to see if they could get worse with the next scene. Like Palmetto, they certainly did. The scene in the water, where, after shooting the first enemy, BLOW THE DAMN BOAT UP, having to face the possible drowning, made me laugh so hard that for a thousandth of a second I almost thought it was worth waiting for a movie for . Then Charlie Sheen decided to drag the surviving enemy to the depths of the ocean (the way it was filmed, with the numerous cuts of the camera, it seemed they had dropped about 80 feet .. Beautiful continuity there ...) first to cut his throat was so damn stupid, I was stunned. Then again, this was the whole damn movie. I like action movies, but not this one. NOTE: the version I watched was a TV version, pan and scan. I can't imagine it made a difference, except to make the whole thing luckily shorter!
