I saw it in the cinema during its first release and I can only ask "Has the world gone crazy?" The seemingly overwhelming positive response is shocking for this sticky trap, written in an embarrassing and predictable way. <br /> <br /> Stephan Elliot is not a brilliant filmmaker as the consistent bombs he has produced since (see 'Welcome to Woop Woop', 'Eye of the Beholder') <br /> <br /> <br /> just assume that making a film about gay / transsexual culture has people who believe that detesting the film is an offense to this sector of the population. Aren't we smarter than that? What about an interesting script and good performance? Ok, so the 3 leaders are fine considering what they have to work with, but this film includes the worst performance of a child actor I've ever seen, not helped by upsetting dialogues and a really lame resolution that you can see a mile away. <br /> <br /> This is a disappointing film and one that does not deserve the exaggerated reputation that it has garnered.
