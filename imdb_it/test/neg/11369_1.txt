If you thought 10.5 of NBC was stupid, you'll be glad to hear that the FX reached the bowels of hell made for TV and crushed her fingers in this pseudo post-9/11 poop. Not only was the plot stupid, it was a complete hangover and a bad business. The style of the shoot was the now abused "docu-action" look, complete with cuts to the "rawcore" movie of grainy B&W. I'm not quite sure what that means, but it certainly looks like something the DP told the director before shooting. I don't know what they were going here, but it reminded me of the guy in the office who thinks that Powerpoint presentations with "fly-in" and "animations" are "cool". <br /> <br /> The story is that 6 "terrorists" take over a nuclear power plant in southern California. That's right, nuclear power plants, where hundreds of people work, where there are safety precautions on ying-yang. For reasons of reality, they have put 2 CHiPpies out of service into the mix. Because, they would be able to stop 6 people, right? Six. I mean, Bruce Willis also had to deal with other terrorists in that stupid Nakatomi building. <br /> <br /> Leslie Hope (TV Teri Bauer) plays a CHP officer who has trouble talking on the phone after shooting her bulletproof vest. His voice sounds like a TV commercial by Sally Struther, plaintive and monotonous. His character is just a plot weave, and after performing his little duty, he is promptly eliminated. Yes, Teri Bauer is dead! <br /> <br /> Bruce Greenwood plays FBI S.A.C. Tom Shea, who continues to emphasize how he punches foreign diplomats in the face. His boss is out, so no one at Dept. of Homeland Security believes his prognosis of the situation. It is the sense of a group of paranoid public officials who are afraid to take it out on any kind of catastrophe. He is calm, he is strong, he is STILL. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing that can redeem or entertain on Meltdown - OK, well, maybe Teri Bauer died in an unnecessary and fun way - apart from that, nothing saving.
