Oh man, this was a piece of dog. I read some reviews here after seeing the case in the local video store, and I thought to myself ........ Ah, this looks like a half decent movie. Vampires.Swords. Thailand. How can you go wrong? Right? No, no, absolutely wrong. Jesus, if I could only get my eyes off and not remember this movie, I would be happy. The main actor had the most humid and sweetest voice ever. Man! It was really bad .... "Amandaaaaaaaa ....", "I have to save my girlfriend ...." F * ck off! My friend and I actually changed the audio track on the DVD to Portuguese, so we didn't have to hear the boy's voice. Subtitles and everything ... and this has improved the film. I'm serious, if you like something about me and wondered how this movie was ... STOP WONDERING. I have the answer WORST FILM OF THE VAMPIRO EVER! No good deed, no good blood and only the smallest smattering of nudity. Only pure sh * t for 90 minutes. Don't rent it, buy it, think about it or watch it at 3:00. It just doesn't cut the cake ...... at all .... in any way. F * ck this movie and watch All Anal 7: Real Deep Cover. You'd have a better time I'm sure.
