This is one of those wonderful martial arts movies that start with two possessions of hard band members facing in a park; and when the agreement goes wrong and the battle begins, it turns out that everyone knows karate and kung fu! The always wooden Cynthia Rothrock plays (as usual) a cynical, impassive, good cop, this time in Los Angeles. She and her police mates are trying to break a counterfeit ring, and when that storyline is exhausted, the story simply passes on to something else, and Cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a rich, great-looking magnate. Within the obviously paltry budget of the film, there is some helicopter action, some motorboat action, some car chases, a brawl in which Cynthia beats everyone in a country-western bar, some pool scenes with bimbos in bikinis thong and surprisingly good chase on horseback. About a dozen and a half policemen are killed. A lot of twists happen that make no sense; don't worry about them (And currency counterfeiting is a federal crime, so where the hell is the FBI? I guess they were too busy.) Combat choreography was done by Cynthia Rothrock's frequent co-star, Richard Taylor, the whose class presence and witty in front of the camera frankly would have made this film a better film. Furthermore, she tended to make Cynthia a better actress when they appeared together, and frankly she could use it; she seems tired and bored, and does her best to act in ANGEL OF THE GUARD when she is playing in front of a domestic dog to which she delivers bitter drunken monologues. The dog almost out shakes! He also wears some of the most terrible clothes that any protagonist has ever worn in a movie: the wide and wide jeans with areas washed with clear acid on each buttock were the most shocking. The other actors are everywhere on the map. You can imagine many of the minor characters being interpreted this way: "Hey, me and some other guys I know will be in a movie." Do you want to be in this too? No, man, I'm serious! "Then there are the sloppy professionals: the most amusing is Lydie Denier, the splendid French and veteran model of" Red Shoe Diaries "," Baywatch "," Melrose Place ", and to interpret many, many other variations on the sexy French bomb; here he plays a psychopathic killer as if he were in BAISEZ-MOI or in an episode of "Alias" and not in a direct junk like this. There is also the tall, dark and handsome Daniel McVicar, now a regular in " The Bold and the Beautiful, "John O'Leary, who played a dignified old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes and does it again here, and Aharon Ipale, the veteran actor of Arab characters perhaps better known as" Pharaoh Seti "by THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS. For these professionals, the ANGEL OF THE GUARD must be the most laughable voice on their resumes. I gave this film a better rating than it probably deserves because my daughters, who are enthusiastic students of martial arts, they love ved you were a woman kicking ass and having great action scenes to change. They are still a little too young to care about what is really a low-quality portrait, and they just enjoyed cheering for Cynthia while doing her revolving leg, the high kick, the stick fight. If you like this kind of film, you could probably enjoy it at that level.
