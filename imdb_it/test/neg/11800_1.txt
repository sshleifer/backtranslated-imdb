I rented this by accident. I took the video and looked at the back and thought "shameless Blair Witch". Then, in a moment of carelessness, I grabbed "The Francisville Experiment" thinking it was something else. My horror of coming home and realizing my mistake was far more terrifying than anything this movie had to offer. Boring characters, bad acting and the feeling of "having seen the Blair Witch Project and being able to do the same" permeate the action to the point where looking forward fast will get you straight to the end credits. I'm not the type to criticize the directors for being lazy or desperate, but after this yawn I felt the need to warn everyone: don't waste time, you have a life.
