Put simply, this mini series was terrible. Let me count the ways. 1. Absurd goal. 2. Over-acting. 3. Scattershot approach to characters. 4. Annoying narration. 5. Inability to create interest for viewers. <br /> <br /> This film cannot even pass the "Soap Opera for Dummies" test. I'm sorry I didn't read this award-winning novel, so I only judge it as a movie, but it really stinks. Imagine going to a party where dozens of appetizers show you. You look at the wide variety and want to taste them, but suddenly they are withdrawn and you wonder where they went. It's like this movie, with too many characters introduced and never designed. There are enough stories and characters in this film to create a series of 20 episodes, yet we are given less than four hours to digest everything. <br /> <br /> There are more facial expressions and reaction shots of Ed Harris than we will find 10,000 monkeys. The pace is extraordinarily slow. <br /> <br /> Dennis Farina and Helen Hunt are so over the top that their characters are not credible. Joanne Woodward's character is one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The persistent river metaphor becomes trivial. <br /> <br /> And probably the most absurd part of the film - the cat. This wicked and vindictive cat who follows the hero to scratch him and his covers - well, let's go now --- Stephen King isn't even nice! <br /> <br /> Probably the most interesting character in the film, and one that isn't designed well, is John Voss, the troubled boy whose final act of despair is the only plot device that works in this film. <br /> <br /> Almost everyone in this film is incredible. <br /> <br /> To sum up, there is little to inspire. The drama is poor melodrama. It's just a terrible effort.
