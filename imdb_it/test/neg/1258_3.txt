For the most part, "Michael" is a disaster ?? ten minutes of charm and ninety missteps. <br /> <br /> Travolta and MacDowell do their best, often rising above Nora Ephron's trivial screenplay. But the film moves like a snail. And even within its fantasy context, the characters behave implausibly on a regular basis. (Reporters who routinely leave the story of a life - an apparent angel living on Earth outside their sight?) <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell the master of romantic comedy Ephron that William Hurt, so brilliant many other films, it's not Tom Hanks. The "climax" of the film redefines the invented word. Ephron could shoot for Paradise here, but unfortunately "Michael" is a long, long run through the cinema.
