This HBO original is rather simple and rather stupid. Armand Assante, once again making a bad imitation of Stallone, is Ray Wellman an ex-offender just released on probation. All he wants is his old girlfriend Lacy, played by a young Marcia Gay Harden, back. Unfortunately for Ray, Lacy hooked the brave Elliot, played by Sam Neill. Further complications are that Ray's old cellmates want favors and kidnap Lacy to make sure they happen. Ray and Elliot collaborate, despite mutual dislike. <br /> <br /> The following is violent and slow, but Marcia Gay Harden shows us why he would win Oscars in the future, not so clear here, but his pure emotion, sincerity and some pretty explicit nude scenes they do almost all of this. Almost. <br /> <br /> Rent "Fever" (not the right title for the film) if you are a fan, otherwise skip and be thankful that the stars have continued to improve. <br /> <br /> Note: this is a tough "R" film for language, violence and nudity.
