Perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of Jane Austen's works has been portrayed. Maybe I'm too strict for this adaptation, but I'm afraid I'm biased for the A & E version. I'm having trouble imagining that Mr. Darcy is played by someone other than Colin Firth. <br /> <br /> The characters seemed superficial, and often forced dialogue. Lizzy seemed to lack the real feeling that is so evident in the book. His fantasy for Wickham was exaggerated, and then his sudden as for Darcy was not credible. <br /> <br /> Darcy was played quite well, I'll give it to you. He managed to keep the necessary discretion, but I felt that he didn't project the inner feeling and struggle that make his character so delightful, especially in the scene of the proposal. <br /> <br /> and Mrs. Bennet also played well, but seemed to be missing in many ways. Mrs. Bennet's petty temperament was not completely captured in her performance. <br /> <br /> Collins was a good portrait. Very much in line with the book. <br /> <br /> I will refrain from commenting on Lady Catherine except to say that it is perhaps the worst representation of the entire film. <br /> <br /> Other problems I saw the few freedoms they took with the order of events like Darcy who was present at the first meeting with Lady C., and also that Miss Lucas and Sir William did not join Lizzy for his visit to the Collins ". <br /> <br /> The choreography was terrible during the dance scenes. The scene in which the dance of Lizzy and Darcy loses much of its intensity because you can't overcome the feeling of look awkward on the floor of the ballroom At least this version of the BBC has left out the dialogue between Lizzy, Darcy and Sir William when it congratulates the two on their dance, because they behaved very badly. <br /> <br /> There have been occasional moments that have kept me interested, but overall I find this version a disappointment. I would not recommend this movie unless you are like me, and you are too deviated from such follies. <br /> < br />
