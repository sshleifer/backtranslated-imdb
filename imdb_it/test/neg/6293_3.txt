1st guarded 1/1/2003 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Henri Verneuil): Drama drama on a wealthy doctor who gets into trouble by pursuing a relationship with a younger woman, whom his family leads to live with them, besides being married to another in the same family. His pursuit of happiness is not clear, but rather highlights the reason for his unhappiness by showing the overbearing trait of the females in his wife's line. A well played but predictable drama.
