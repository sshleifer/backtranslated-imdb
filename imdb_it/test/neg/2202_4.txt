Okay ... she's on the boat with this guy, she realizes she's out to kill her, knocks him out, and then discovers that the reason she's giving vent is the record that killed her colleague. So what would a rational person do? Maybe conk again on the head to make sure he's really out of it? Tie it? Listen, Sandra, darling, you have the chance to escape while the boy has only been out for so long. Until you know how long it will take to get you to escape, make sure he can't come after you. I hate these stupid female victim roles. The rest of the film was just a series of twists that were completely twisted and too unbelievable to stay interesting.
