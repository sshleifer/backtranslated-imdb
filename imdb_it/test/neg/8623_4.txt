George Sluizer's remake of his film - superior - is a complete waste of time. Why was he even tried? Kiefer Sutherland plays Jeff Harriman, whose girlfriend (Sandra Bullock, who has only a small amount of screen) is kidnapped at a service station by Barney Cousins ​​(Jeff Bridges). Now, Barney is portrayed as the kind of guy that nobody would trust in a month of Sundays - he feeds like Frankenstein's monster but without sympathy, and Bridges' acting is absolutely horrible. Sutherland comes across a little better when his character becomes a detective with the help of the new love interest Rita Baker (Nancy Travis). <br /> <br /> A big problem with this version of "The Vanishing" is its obvious need to provide for the Hollywood public by avoiding the bleak end of the original film. Here the ending is happy that it seems forced and unbelievable, and completely destroys the story. However at this point the damage was done while Jeff Bridges turns the villain into a big laugh.
