After 30 minutes ... for maximum forwarding speed, I deleted it from my recorder. Critters' first film was self-consciously funny, the "conversation" between the creatures just before the grandmother took them off the porch, for example. This film moves slowly, waiting for someone to take it back and put it out of your misery. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine anyone working on this turkey being proud of it. <br /> <br /> One was fun, only four was horrible. Don't bother, even if the alternative is to watch the reruns of a fundraiser of the 700 Club of TBS, you'll throw at least some good laughs (and the "alien" trick is more credible..grin).
