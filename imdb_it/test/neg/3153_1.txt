Barney is just awful. Like many of the other reviews on this show they say. I am not one who does not agree with them (I will not). Because I hate this show as much as they do. They use children who seem to be in sixth grade, cheese plots, horrible dialogues and really nasty special effects. Not to mention that big purple dinosaur in person. Makes every other kid look like award winners (Sesame Street has won awards, which I know). <br /> <br /> Please just look at Sesame Street, Thomas the Tank Engine or even the Teletubbies. Avoid both, this and his film (which I also reviewed). They are both extremely disgusting and inappropriate for anyone (even for small children).
