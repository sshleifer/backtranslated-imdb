Anyone who considers this film over a 3 has a distorted view of the movies, anyone who has evaluated this piece of sh! T 7 or higher, I have absolutely no respect for their taste in movies, and I doubt they ever saw a good one. I am always willing to give a film to everything and I did with this, I tried to pay attention, I tried not to let my money go 2 wastes, but 15 minutes in my friends were laughing at me because I was listening to my 2 iPod, 25 minutes later I could not even watch the exaggeration that was happening in the movie, so I left, I was never ever out of a movie, until this junk, Anyone who said he liked is a liar , or should be banned from this site. I get so upset when I see a person judging this as an 8 when the general Godfathers rating is a 9.1 it's like saying that that movie was close that it wasn't.
