This is a joke, isn't it? Can't this be a real movie? Isn't it even a real video? Give a little girl from Harvey Milk High School a video camera and they could make a better film than this. The director can't be serious ... right? Is this satire? Comedy? Has the drama gone terribly wrong? The script is as monotonous and boring as is conceivable. Ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could come up with a better script. Dialogue is not a cliché. The dialogue of Clichéd could elevate this holiday mess to something like the fun of the camp - but it is not and it is not. Worse than the worst - a landlady wanders into a dramatic scene in a private apartment dressed in a bathrobe that carries a pan like something from a "Honeymoon" episode. Whaaa ??? I saw better acting from the middle school acting clubs. One of the leads is an attractive lunk, the other is not. Both can't even manage a convincing kiss. So much for romance. Support players are incredibly exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Everything is underlined by a nauseating soundtrack and the sound seems to have been recorded in a bathroom at the back. Most dialogues are (thankfully) unintelligible. <br /> <br /> This refined cinematic fruit cake is not even worthy of being the next ROCKY HORROR or a gay episode of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000. It's simply ugly. In any case. SUGARPLUM VISIONS will not dance in your head: they will trample your every expectation. Have a zabaglione and fix the lights of your neighbor's holiday without thinking about it: it will be the best time spent.
