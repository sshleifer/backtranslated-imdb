Terrible action movie in which Franco Nero swaps his cowboy hat, the pistol belt and the coffin he dragged into DJANGO (1966) for an all-white Ninja suit with all the eye-catching gear that accompanies it! Despite a virtually non-stop action, the film is completely trivial and unintentionally funny - with a bad encampment, to boot, in Christopher George. Susan George (no relationship) is the attractive woman with a washed husband, Nero's war partner, who the wicked are trying to repulse his oil-rich land - but the latter have not counted on Nero's martial arts (and stunts ) -heavy) gymnastics. The solution to their problems is to hire a Ninja who is just as good for themselves as, as it happens, turns out to be Nero's mortal enemy (played by Sho Kosugi, who appeared in two other sequels and is currently engaged in another!). The climax takes place inside an arena where a Black man's army "eliminates" George and what's left of his gang from previous clashes; the subtle way in which his nemesis disperses, however, is actually done.
