Deepa Mehta, Arundhati Roy and a host of other so-called intellectuals get the title of intellectuals because they like to portray India and Hinduism in a bad light ... and Deepa Mehta still earns her money. In any case, Hindus are too kind or scared to protest against the way Muslims protest, so anyone can take any liberty with Hinduism. And it is a fact that during the 1930s the women of the west were also mistreated when they were widows ... only that nobody likes to report anything negative about the West or anything other than India and the Hindus. He paints an incorrect portrait of India and the situation of widows there. Nowhere is it said that child marriage is illegal. He concluded the film by saying that there are 34 million widows in India. Obviously among a billion people, there will be many widows. But how many live the life he depicted in the film ?? Deepa Mehta is finally selling India and poverty to earn dollars. How pathetic ....
