I would have given this less than one vote if it were possible. The entire film should have been left on the cutting room floor. What a pathetic waste of time, money and effort! Let's see ... assemble the most beautiful cast you can find (which of course is directly proportional to the amount of talent that is missing) ... throw together the thinnest plot you can dig ... and purple! An abominable piece of junk that the director and / or producer should be ashamed to put their name on. How long can WORSE reach the horror genre? And don't use "low budget" as an excuse ... I've seen many low budget movies ... in fact some of the best horror classics of all time were low budget. If you don't have the talent and ingenuity to make a GOOD horror movie, then for God's sake you don't make one at all !!!
