It is a pity that they do not trust the original enough to rely on it. <br /> <br /> But "RoboCop 2" takes the great ideas, imagination and characters of the original and replaces them with all the stereotypes that sequels have to offer. <br /> <br /> The initial spot was nice and so was the scene that follows (which recalls the beginning in "Guys and Dolls"!) but apart from a flash of thought here and there, this is a movie which is a slow and dirty slog in the middle of nowhere. br /> <br /> Ideas have been introduced, the interesting characters of the original have virtually no time on the screen, most of the new characters (Cain, Juliette Faxx) are so boring that they wouldn't hold up regardless of the movie, and then there's the tone. <br /> <br /> In the Blessed Original, Paul Verhoeven knew how to direct with the kind of attitude in which, if the attitude and sensitivity of a good comic were increased, even the most repulsive violence would be fun. Kershner (although he directed a sequel to "Star Wars") does not. And scene by scene or makes you shiver, look away or just tune it completely. <br /> <br /> And what's with RoboCop ?? HE should be the main thing here, right? But there are whole scenes in which you don't show up, and in which scenes it is so thoughtful and trembling that you don't know or it doesn't matter if it's partly human or partly cyborg - since it's very boring. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a rapid fall from grace. Why does Hollywood make such bad sequels? Purposely? Why; did the directors bet? <br /> <br /> Only one star for "RoboCop 2"; FX are good but history doesn't even try to match them.
