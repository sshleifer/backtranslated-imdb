There is nothing particularly unique or interesting about this low-budget sci-fi movie series. Regardless of its pedigree origin (the film is freely based on a novel by Leo Tolstoy), the plot and general themes of this film are in no way noticeable or original, science is weak at most, and unfortunately, the film does succeeds even involving compelling action sequences. <br /> <br /> The plot begins with a manned space flight on Mars, and although the main plot does not really move until the ship lands, most of the most interesting scenes occur along the way. Unfortunately, as soon as our interplanetary travelers land, their previous interpersonal relationships, the speculation about cosmology and the meaning of life, and all that is interesting about the film give way to a distantly coherent plot about Martian revolutionaries, environmental and not very convincing networks of deception. <br /> <br /> Nothing is really remarkable for the quality of the film's production. It is passable. And most of the acting is, even if slow, OK. Cameron Mitchell is actually pretty good and plays a nice character. I imagine that the best quality of this film, from my point of view, is its sense of fashion. The Martians have very nice clothes! If this film had a point, it could have been much more interesting. Oh good.
