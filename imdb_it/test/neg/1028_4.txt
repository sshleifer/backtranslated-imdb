I imagine that only a select number of members of the public really had an interest in seeing how a male hustler works in New York, but I would be willing to bet that even these brave souls were turned off by the irritating patchwork technique and the deliberately muffled recording of sound on display here; the fact that these intrinsic "defects" were a direct result of the film's low budget / underground / experimental nature is, I would say, beyond the point. However, for those who are so inclined, the film presents a vast male nudity and Joe Dallesandro, understandably, has become an underground ?? he's gay ?? icon! <br /> <br /> The episodic structure that shows the daily routine of the protagonist braggart offers a couple of slightly interesting scenes: his meeting with (and finally posing for) an eccentric elderly artist; the one in which Dallesandro expresses his opinions on his unusual line of work and outlines his particular modus operandi to a couple of potential 'colleagues' including perhaps the most unlikely of traffickers? a bespectacled nerd! Perhaps luckily, the film only lasted 89 minutes against IMDb's claim that its full length is 105 (but the latter could very well be a mistake)! <br /> <br /> I have seen some other Warhol "movies" and this is definitely not as satisfying as the most tolerable example I've ever met, BAD (1977), and only slightly better than I like MY HUSTLER (1965 ), which were mostly a struggle to sit on. The fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy was not a good omen but, as they say, you have to do what you have to do and the other two "chapters" have had to follow in rapid succession ... <br /> <br /> Despite my generally negative reaction, FLESH is still valid as a time capsule of the 1960s and as a prototype of the underground scene of that era, both from a cinematographic point of view and in real life. For the record, Dallesandro's image of this film adorns the cover of Smiths first 1984 self-titled album and transsexual Candy Darling (who appears rather insignificant) was immortalized in "The Candy Says", The Velvet opening track Underground's eponymous 1969 album. Although the latter is my all-time favorite, and one of the reasons for this is that, through their absolutely unique and innovative music, they described a lifestyle completely different from mine, this it's really a case where I rather prefer to experience something auditory instead of visually!
