Well, I have to admit that this movie brought me occasional laughs in my face. OK, but it's not a good movie. Most of the characters are terrible stereotypes and really unconvincing. Not everyone gives great recitations, but some try, but fail because their characters are poorly written. The perfect example is Julia Koschitz: she changes her eating habits from one conversation to another, in a conversation she doesn't drink alcohol in the next she's allergic to champagne, she feels too good for most people (in fact she is) but ends up with the "perfect" fit with regards to looks, and refuses to give the more "realistic" guys a chance, and so on ... The end is very rough, even if I like one of the final scenes, when finally everyone stops talking and the director gives us the chance to catch our breath. Shoppen is basically a movie that offers cheap laughs (especially because it's about sex and relationships, I assume) and maybe some brief entertainment. However, the whole image is a great stereotype and nothing is really special about it.
