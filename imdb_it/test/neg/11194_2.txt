(This review will have some very obvious spoilers, so be careful.) A friend completed this problem and we passed the 45 minutes of the movie before we decided that 8x fast advance was the only way this movie should be watched. There were points where we were watching the movie at normal speed where I was going, preparing part of the lunch and returning, to discover that literally nothing had happened. 2 lines of meaningless dialogue were exchanged. Nothing happened in the background, no important facial gestures were made, nothing but an embarrassing embarrassing silence. <br /> <br /> It is NOT the way to make a thoughtful film, especially when the film's plot follows all the same Hollywood tropi base movies. If I told you that Disney was making a film about 4 girls who started a band, and that the singer was a French exchange student, what would you expect to be the "conflicts" that will arise? <br /> <br /> Does the singer have to overcome the fear of the stage? Does anyone have an untold crush? Is the band late for their performances, and does a secondary character have to buy her the time? <br /> <br /> * NOTICE SPOILER * <br /> <br /> All these things happen in this movie. <Br /> <br /> At no point in this film do you have the slightest concern that these girls will not be able to reach their goal. <br /> <br /> * THIS ENDS THE SPOILERS SECTION * <br /> <br /> I like Japanese movies. I spent a lot of time in Japan. I work for a Japanese company. Heck, I even know all the reference bands in the record and MD collections they are going through, and I sang along with the title track with karaoke friends. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst movie from Japan I've ever seen. Don't be confused. Although the characters will have points in the movie where they do typical Japanese high school stuff, this is not a "typical day of life" movie. This is "a day in the life of 4 extremely casual, heavily conflicted and uncomfortable Japanese students." <br /> <br /> There are also significant problems with the DVD. Viz decided that a great extra would be a producer who read the Blue Hearts Wikipedia entry aloud. What a value! Also, they care so little about the subtitles that the band's name in the subtitles, "Paran Maum" is different from the one in the chapter selection menu, "Paran Marum". In the auditorium's final scene, there is a VERY visible reflection / ghosting effect on everything, but this seems to be the fault of the original film. <br /> <br /> 2/10, DO NOT see if you don't absolutely love embarrassing silences.
