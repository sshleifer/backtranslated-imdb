I'm a bit between the brazen review and the hate review. I have been a fan of Lovecraft (and a 'purist' of Lovecraft) for a long time, and while this little amateur film was of very poor quality, it had a number of redeeming qualities. I went to observation expecting the worst thing I'd ever seen, and wondering if Lovecraft would turn into his grave, but I was shocked to find that I actually liked it. <br /> <br /> I don want to catalog the flaws in the film, so I will only mention a few that prevent this film from being a "star performer". <br /> <br /> The budget is very low and is shot on a video camera, so it looks like some soap operas, but once you get used to the idea, it ceases to be a big problem. The direction is rather amateur and the framing and the use of distance in the shots are rather clumsy. STILL, this film was actually a little creepy and remained more faithful to the Lovecraftian intent of almost all the disguises of Stuart Gordan and Brian Yuzna (my main exception to those films that are Re-Animator and Dagon) put together. The idea of ​​being imbued with some of the old memories of Dunwich Horror and Shadow over Innsmouth (which does not mean that this film is as good as those stories !!), so the general plot is quite faithful to Lovecraft's ideas. One thing that bothered me was that the words outside the Bible seemed to make a zombie prisoner upset and scared. I'm not sure if this meant indicating that the words of "God" upset the Ancients or just this particular zombie. There was no real answer to this. The rest of the Christian symbolism in it recalls the capture of August Derleth on the mythos. So in a sense this was a Derleth style on mitos. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film only as a curiosity. Show how a pretty suggestive film can be made with a near-zero budget. I liked the setting of the cellars. The external shots were sad, though. Using the same stretch of beach and trees (and almost the same damn shot) to convey the long journey of 3 characters was really sad. The director needs a header for that. The acting was standard for an amateur film, with the blonde zombie girl receiving a personal award as "Best impersonation of Gollum by an Italian actress". Actually, I think this film was made before the Lord of the Rings films. Maybe Andy Sedaris has watched her and thought "Dang, she would make a great Gollum!" <br /> <br /> A little kudo to the director, though. The zombie trick was like the bad goth guys. I was shocked to see this and almost stopped watching. I was like "Oh, that's how we know it's evil and possessed", but later in the movie you see a girl who paints a trick of that kind on the face of an old woman (both living). So it wasn't an attempt to say "goth makeup = zombie", but rather "goth makeup was left after zombification". However, possessed / zombies equate to "blue contact lenses" ... eh. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have always liked this film better than the Yuzna and Gordan films (except for the exceptions mentioned above). Yuzna and Gordan had much better budgets, but this film did a better job of filming a story similar to Lovecraft's, and on a limited budget. <br /> <br /> A brief word to the make-up artist: I know you wanted "claws" or something on Zariah's fingers, but her long black print nails seemed really silly. <br /> <br /> A brief word to the screenwriter of the score: I know you could not resist, and apparently not even the director was able to accept it, but when the two characters confront each other with guns for a "duel", playing that little whistle of "The good, the bad and the ugly" have killed any mood that the scene had accumulated. It was cute, but nice was not appropriate. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers of this film read Lovecraft and had great respect for him. I liked the little hints here and there: the Carter character with bad dreams, and the Pickman character who becomes a macabre zombie.
