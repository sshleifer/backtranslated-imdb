With some films it is really hard to tell who they were created for. Huevos de oro seems to aim at the well-educated Spanish middle class. There must be many lines within this film that you will not understand if you are a stranger. This can be quite annoying. <br /> <br /> Symbols and references to art and popular culture abound, the film alludes to the work of Salvador Dalí, Luis Buñuel and the Surrealists in general, a certain infatuation with the bidet bathrooms seems to indicate Ready made by Duchamp. Furthermore, the main character also has a talent for karaoke tapes with Julio Iglesias songs. But because all this is mixed together in a rather nice but also free way, it simply escapes me. I can only assume that all this serves to highlight the vital, impetuous, crude vulgarity of the main character that the director seems to admire and despise at the same time. As all really nice women chase him (the main character, I mean) is slightly disconcerting. <br /> <br /> The film has three parts. He begins in the Spanish enclave of Melilla in Africa, where Benito, the main character, carries out his military service, apparently in the body of engineers. Then he moved to the tourist resort of Benidorm in Spanin, where Benito just wanted to build the tallest skyscraper in the place and become a vulgarized Howard Roark. For the last part a defeated Benito moves to Miami, Florida, presumably to start a new life. "But the change of places is not satisfactorily explained, but it is also irritating that there is no development of the character and that the film descends in a soap opera way without being convincingly ironic: it must be said that Javier Bardem is very well behaved by playing with the young stallion that grows inert and deflated. <br /> <br /> I bought this film because I am interested in urban landscapes and Benidorm is kind of a special place, in the city, in this aspect Huevos de oro satisfied me only partially, in Jess Franco's She Killed In Ecstasy (1970) this specific position was used in a more gratifying way.
