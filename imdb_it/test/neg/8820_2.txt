It is always interesting to watch a horror film after hearing so many praises from other fans. Experience has taught me that you should never generalize the taste of fans within a genre. My expectations on this film were much higher than I had seen. <br /> <br /> Children should not play with Dead Things is a film with a well-intentioned plot that affects too many times to complete it. The idea of ​​a band of actors organizing a reanimation of dead bodies had intrigued me. However, everything has degenerated into a cinematic chaos. The actors, who for the most part were competent and surprisingly expressive, offered roles that did not maintain a coherent characterization. Some of these characters pass from the ambivalence on the whole act of profaning a cemetery, to blunt criticism, to ambivalence. It is a thing for the characters to have a change of heart during the film; it is another to produce a circular, excessively dynamic attitude that circulates every ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Another inconsistent element of this film is the premise. Does the main protagonist intend the ceremony to be a theatrical joke or do you actually conspire with dark spiritual forces to resurrect the dead? Even with the aforementioned flaws, I would recommend this movie to other horror fans, since I believe that only true horror fans will appreciate the dark components of the atmosphere and will be able to ignore the inconsistency of the plot. The scene where the dead come out of the grave is made extremely disturbing (even for an enthusiastic zombie veteran) by the excellent combined use of landscapes and sounds, and the great choice of skilled actors chosen to interpret the reanimated dead. Current filmmakers should learn from CSPWDT about the use of correct video and audio techniques in mood development. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are a zombie filmmaker like me, you should find the time to locate and view this movie. It's a fun watch
