Avoid this movie if you're looking for entertainment. <br /> <br /> It is full of aspirants who try to be something they are not and Emraan is simply wasted as a tour guide who falls in love with a newcomer who needs to go to drama school. Seriously, where do they get these people from? Just because you're cute doesn't mean you can act or be an actress. <br /> <br /> Asmit Patel needs to send an apology letter to everyone who looks at him accidentally teasing himself in this poor excuse for a movie. He plays an insipid gangster who drugs girls and forces them to fall in love with him and sells them to the highest bidder.
