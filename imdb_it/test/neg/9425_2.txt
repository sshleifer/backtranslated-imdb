First, let me make it clear that I love planes, and usually every movie with them is worth watching - and I've listened to some of those shocking ones. However, the same is not true of this film. James Stewart is an excellent actor, but he is wasted in this promotional film by Strategic Air Command. The acting is mediocre and the direction is weak. I had to stop watching this horrible trash halfway. This despite some really beautiful aerial photographs, perhaps even the best. The trouble is that, even for a fool of aviation like me, doing something out of the shocking plane in evidence (B-36 and B-47) scratches too much nerves. It is a pity that the film was not made when the B-52 appeared, so the superlatives used for the plane in this film would have been valid. Then I might have been able to sit down. Perhaps I miss the point of the film, which could be the anguish suffered by my loved ones while their loved ones are on active duty. In any case, it could have been done much better. Recommendation? It is worth missing.
