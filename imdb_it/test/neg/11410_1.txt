I've seen this movie about 6 or 7 times, and it gets more and more fun every time. Perhaps what I like best is the paradigm of the tired character that the film offers us: the dark male protagonist, all-American, his blonde girlfriend, the theater nerd with glasses, a dark girl, the antagonist athlete and the girl bruna # 2. However, there are then presented two martial arts experts with mullets who drive a convertible. If anyone can explain it, please contact me. Among other highlights are the portrait of Jobby by Bobby Johnston, Dell, and his line of brands, "That's why I keep it around". In observing Johnston's performance, it is not surprising that his career has quickly entered the realm of soft-core porn. (SPOILER) Also, after many visualizations, I have absolutely no idea what that great demon at the end says at any time; they are just electronically muffled noises. Oh well, it's probably better. And finally, why are all the demons so slippery? Is wet skin scarier? It certainly didn't help in this movie.
