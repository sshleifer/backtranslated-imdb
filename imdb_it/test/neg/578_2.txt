Divorced single mom in the picturesque seaside town finds an anonymous love letter and allows her to spur her sleeping love life. The Pet project for actress / co-producer Kate Capshaw, who offers a warm and well-modulated lead performance, yet this story is so streamlined and the direction and editing so erratic that it insinuates a weak dissatisfaction. Initially, Helen of Capshaw imagines that many of her friends who read her love letter (an interesting visual joke) but the first person with whom they do this trick is Ellen DeGeneres, who doesn't play a lesbian, but who comes out because of this found. Different ideas are skinned in the hope that they will stick together and the continuity is extremely discontinuous. The supporting cast (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott, who mostly plays with the shirt off) is very good, but they can't save the final act, which is disappointing. Low-key, in a bizarre, pleasant way, but is mildly of good character, nothing more. ** 1/2 from ****
