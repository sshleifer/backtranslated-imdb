Like the previous poster, I come from northern Vermont, and I liked this movie. However, not since "Red Zone Cuba" I saw such a confusing plot. The things that people do at bootleg don't make sense. Two of the paddle gangs across the border send a second team into the car. Um, why? Then they meet two others, and drive up to the villain's hideout in a luxury Packard until nightfall. - Shouldn't it make more sense just two people on a flatbed truck? Then, parked outside the garage holding the dog, the four fall asleep! When they wake up in the morning and start taking out the whiskey, they are obviously spotted and shot, losing some of their precious cargo in the process. Then two of the traffickers put the whiskey in a boat and float it over the border. Again, why? I was told by someone whose uncle smuggled in the area, all that was needed was to drive a vehicle that could overtake the Canadian border patrol of the United States, which at the time had a small part of the resources it now has . <br /> <br /> And don't let me start in the last half hour, which made no sense. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about the film is that Kris Kristopherson has actually developed a certain charisma over the years.
