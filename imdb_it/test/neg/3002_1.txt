The spurious narrative like this always uses the same technique: 1) Launch opaque and unstructured threads to perplex the audience. 2) It only deals with "big" subjects such as life, death and God. 3) Make it seem profound with scenes of life, death, heaven, etc. 4) You depend an intellectually weak public to give you the benefit of the doubt. 5) And finally, laugh until the critical applause. <br /> <br /> This film is pretentious pretense-intellectualism at its highest level. Not only do these directors not answer any questions, they are afraid to ask the questions to begin with. The film is held together by tufts. Directions are raised and dropped awkwardly. Pop cultural references are shocking and arbitrary. There is so little to point out that there will be critical hits. <br /> <br /> Critics who have found an intellectual basis for this film are afraid to admit the truth: they have no idea what this film is. Good news: not even the directors. The satisfying attempts to answer deep questions about human existence require intelligence, intelligence, poetry and genius. Unfortunately, this film shows none of these traits.
