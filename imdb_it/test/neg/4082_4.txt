Evan Almighty's creative team should have been able to make a better film. Played by one of America's favorite characters and directed by Ace Ventura director Pet Detective Tom Shadyac, a number of laughs are expected to be higher than the image offers. Even hell Steve Oedekerk, who wrote and directed atrocious Barnyard last year, and earned a written credit here did a better job. The fact is that Evan Almighty is not the worst image of the summer season, but it could also be the most disappointing. The title and the creative team behind the image suggest this is a follow-up to Bruce Almighty in 2003. That picture had Jim Carrey in the lead, and while both Steve Carell and Carrey are both funny types, it's the latter that fits best to this type of material. I've heard that Carrey was offered this sequel before anyone else, but the actor refused to see any other places where his character could venture. So Shadyac moved to Carell, who since the fun part of the piece in the original 2003 was projected towards success. After the sleep hit The 40 Year Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine, the man became a big deal, and so it is he instead of the rubber in front of Jim who leads this production in theaters. The story sees Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) being elected as a member of Congress and then he and his troop move home and state so that Evan can succeed with his work. His wife (Lauren Graham) and three children have doubts but overall they show a supportive side towards Evan, who looks to the future with optimistic eyes. However things start to hurt quite quickly, God (Morgan Freeman) appears to Evan stating that a flood is coming and that the politician must build an Ark. Initially ignoring the meeting, Evan quickly receives some clothes that refuse to be shaved and the animals are beginning to appear two by two. Evan then begins to put the boat under construction but the neighborhood is not happy and neither is a politician (John Goodman). Anyone expecting the extravagant laughter of some of Tom Shadyac's other films will probably be left completely cold by this movie. Ace Ventura, Liar Liar and hell even Bruce Almighty where the pictures are mostly very funny, but all of these, the projects have one thing in common and this is the presence of Jim Carrey. Shadyac didn't make a remarkable film without Carrey at the helm, he worked with Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy and now with Steve Carell, but still only Carrey seems to successfully merge with Shadyac. Carell after the disappointing Box-Office and the critical mauling will never want to go back to working with the director, and now that Carrey is doing more serious projects, Shadyac should find a new fast comic muse. Carell himself is rather boring here, anyone who thought that his part in the first film (despite being quite funny) deserved a feature film to be shot and shot. I expect that after the box office design by Bruce Almighty it was the same Universal studios, but you know when a quality comedian can't do anything with a character, then the scren character is a real disaster, and that's exactly the case of Evan Almighty. Lauren Graham is not a big shake like Evan's wife, nor are any of the children the right note. Freeman leaves everything as loose as God in another fun and chilled performance, but it seems that he sporadically brings the piece. In fact the most consistent source of laughter is Evan's secretary (Wanda Sykes) and the creeping collaborator (Jonah Hill), both of whom made me laugh twice as much as any other character in the project. Oedekerk's screenplay was worse (Barnyard) but also better (Ace Ventura When Nature Calls) than his work on this production. His script has really fun moments but it is also full of sickly family moments and humor is never strange or even quite offensive. The film takes gentle blows to religion when it should unravel the concept, indeed the sequence of the opening church in The Simpsons Movie shakes religion more than Evan Almighty's 95 minutes. With a little more audacity and heart, this may have been a much better picture. I don't doubt that the main family audience will be moderately amused by this film, but if they are satisfied it's a completely different question. There is a line that separates the lookable and the pain, a line that Evan Almighty is always on the wrong side. Maybe when you feel bored and the movies on cable you can afford to watch, but I can think of many better ways to spend my time and, more importantly, my money than tune into this mediocre comedy.
