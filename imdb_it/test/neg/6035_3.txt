Reeves plays Haji Murad, a hero of 1850 Russia. <br /> <br /> This is a badly voiced film, with June Foray making some of the voices. Unfortunately those who never should have synchronized the voices with their lips were blind because the words never matched the edges of the lips. Anyone who claims that Japanese films are bad have never watched this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is immediately forgettable and so I forgot it in the time when the film is finished and for me. Write this. Perhaps it has more to do with the fact that the film is one of many that Reeves has done in the hope of moving from action to more plot-inspired films. It may have been a good thing for Reeves, but it's deadly for the public to sneak around like this, where all his court intrigue with very little action. <br /> <br /> In the defense of Reeves, he was a good actor, he didn't have the luck to choose films that went well. They all looked fantastic, but few of them put those who watched them for the movie's running time into a coma. <br /> <br /> This movie will get you into a coma. Look at it only if you need to sleep and all other more delicate means have failed.
