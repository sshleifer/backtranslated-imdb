An incomprehensibly terrible mess of the probably most famous of all the Roman emperors who went mad, leaving infamous party orgies and ruthless killings in his path ... I know there are several versions of this, and this is based on the 102 'one that I watched - but I can't understand how this could possibly make a difference to lift the rest of this film from manure! <br /> <br /> I have heard at length about the supposed "shocking" content of sex / nudity (which honestly there is not much here at all - and boring when there is) and blood, but be careful - it's the amateur technical production that shakes well and really here: everything seems simple and simply like a young student of film school project! The work with the camera is hopelessly inept, full of strange zooms, failed shots and confused pans (from and for what seems for the most part a huge theatrical stage!) Complete with a grainy and inexpensive photographic quality. Lighting and color combinations are terrible and uneven - is it day or night? Am I in or out? Have they changed the scenes? Who is he, or is he destined to be in the shooting? Editing is the final sin here, creating confusion of everything with occasionally random cracks, defects of continuity and random transitions that destroy any possibility of impetus, progression of history and involvement. There is a potentially interesting dialogue and an equally interesting historical history ... but these flaws distract so much that it is tragic. <br /> <br /> A story with LOTS of chances to be great is just a gigantic, burnt (and Fellini -like) turkey that is only good for a few laughs and Peter O'Toole, who makes a memorable Tiberius. Oh yes, that brings us to famous actors. I'd like to put them all one at a time and ask: who had free access to the bonk in orgies to be part of it? Here, I've wasted enough jokes on one of the worst movies of all time! <br /> <br /> 1 in 10 of Ozjeppe
