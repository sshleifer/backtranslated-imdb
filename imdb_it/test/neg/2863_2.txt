I bought this film hoping it would be another great killer toy movie. I'm a big fan of the Child's Play series and I was hoping to see the same here. Boy, I was wrong. Most of the film was not the least bit scary, plus the only time we see Pinocchio "alive" are the last scenes in the film. The little girl in the film, her acting is so ugly that it's almost ridiculous. Furthermore, the ending never showed what happened to the puppet or what prompted them to put the baby in an asylum or wherever it was at the end of the film. So, in my opinion, this film is the worst of the "toy killer" genre. If you want a good set of killer toys, continue with the Child's Play franchise. Pinocchio's revenge is a waste of money and time.
