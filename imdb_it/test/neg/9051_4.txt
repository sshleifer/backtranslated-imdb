I love the detective films of Umberto Lenzi - ROME ARMED TO THE TEETH is my favorite - and his DESERT COMMANDOS have practically legitimized the Italian phenomenon of the Euro War, managing to become a really good film. From weapons, cars, some guys to run and talk hard and it's hard for him to lose. <br /> <br /> What a pity to meet up with your EATEN ALIVE and CANNIBAL FEROX. They could be from anyone, really, and one observes them with the feeling of being under contract, of knowing what kind of film to make, that was assigned to a cast and crew and gave a budget, a deadline and a script. Lenzi came out and did his films the same way a guy from McDonald's fixes a batch of fries. Of the two, EATEN ALIVE is the most original - which is a bit astonishing considering that it includes extensive movies taken from three other cannibal films - and easier to enjoy than CANNIBAL FEROX, though not much. <br /> <br /> I will make others outline the plot: what fascinated me about the film is how it all seems to be staged, and yet what a rather infamous reputation this film has as a kind of total assault to good taste. It is not, even if the film is an exercise in bad taste, complete with a scene of the title in which two of the beautiful support women are literally cut and eaten alive by the cannibals which is the highest point of the film. The problem is that Lenzi allows us to have a good and long vision of the cannibal festival scene and has the convincing ring of an episode of STAR TREK of the 3rd season with a lot of fake jungle for really bloody close-ups. And I don't know of anyone else, but if someone was cutting pieces of my person and I was eating them, I wouldn't just lie there and look at them in difficulty. <br /> <br /> My problem with the film could be that I have a lot of respect for Lenzi as a director, and that too could have been directed by anyone. All your conventions on cannibal films are touched, but it never seems to be filmed with a real conviction, other than trying to smash Ruggero Deodato out of the sandbox. The two directors certainly met and had a sort of youth rivalry or a real dislike for each other's work and a conscious need to undermine them. Lenzi invented the cannibal genre with MAN FROM DEEP RIVER, Deodato wiped it out with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST, Lenzi shot with EATEN ALIVE, Deodato blew it up (and all the others) away with the superior CANNIBIC OLFACTOR, and Lenzi fired a last launch with CANNIBAL FEROX, which is as realistic as the Krazy Glu spot where the guy takes his helmet off a beam and hangs in mid-air. <br /> <br /> This film is less desperate and a little more hesitant to push the spectators into the abyss with all that is holy than FEROX, which remains as a sort of misleading attempt to undermine the CANNIBLE HOLOCAUST. This is more than a mixture, with an interesting adventure in the jungle crossed with a suicidal cult similar to Jim Jones - the cannibals seem to have been added as an afterthought rather than the reason for making the film. I think fans of the genre will have a better impression of the film than fans of Lenzi films looking for something new from the formidable director. It is not as fun as the SLAVE OF THE CANNIBAL GOD, as adventurous as his DEEP RIVER MAN and certainly the wallop of HOLOCAUST CANNIBAL is missing. Combine these considerations with the recycled film, the animal violence scenes, the misogynistic scenes of sexual violence and the wooden methodology of cinema and what ends up being an OK jungle thriller with two or three clandestine scenes, and Umberto Lenzi he was capable of much more. <br /> <br /> 4/10; Gore fanatics will go crazy anyway.
