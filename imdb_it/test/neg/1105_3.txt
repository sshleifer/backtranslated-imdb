I really wanted this movie so much. A movie with zombie children coming out of a mine to kill people at night really seemed like a great idea for a horror movie. Unfortunately, the film was at the bottom of 3 of the horror fest movies. <br /> <br /> A mother and her two daughters try to move on after her husband / father died of an illness that cost their family a lot of money. They have to adapt to their new environment. They end up struggling because of everything that surrounds them for several reasons. (The crazy Zombies go into this category) The film never gives any sentimental attachment to those who live or die, the film is not scary or skips worthy moments, the film barely shows children do what they should do ... Kill! With a bigger budget and a better cast this film could have hope. Until then, pass over it. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10 actually.
