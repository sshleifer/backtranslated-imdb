The Salena incident is by far the best film of Dustin Rikert, which does not say much. In his previous films (and I use the term "film" freely), the director takes ideas from Hollywood blockbusters and severely marginalizes them. The Salena incident is no different. The film is basically With Air meets Aliens made with the semblance of the average production of a film school. The film is full of shots out of focus and plagued by special effects that would have difficulty competing with most computer-based high school animation classes. For example, almost all the explosions on the screen are the same effect as on-screen fire. <br /> <br /> The weak effects and the value of the production are compromised only by an imperfect plot and a rocky dialogue. In one sentence, the story tightens like an exhibition of abused Hollywood clich√©s. The film begins with the worst CGI alien ship ever created that crashed into the worst CGI land ever built and a squad of soldiers about to investigate. Subsequently, a prison transport bus, carrying the worst of the worst from the entire state, is overthrown by prisoners with the help of their blonde girlfriends armed with silicone implants. The prisoners escape and run to the city of Salena where they meet the aliens who ... SHOCK ... have escaped from an alien prison transport carrying the worst of the worst from across the galaxy. The prisoners and their captive police armed only with guns and sad word games must fight the aliens and flee the city before the International Space Alliance * casts its eyes * bombards the city into oblivion. <br /> <br /> The only real pleasant parts of the film are when the actors (who are clearly undermined by the script) have the freedom to improvise and even when they fight alien creatures in a whirlwind of fire. In addition to this, the film is not really worth anyone's time, let alone the plastic of which the DVD is made. How terrible was it? Let's just say that the Secretary of Defense is around 90 years old, working in a room that is the 1950 high-tech real estate office and wearing a Looney Tunes tie. Yes, if it was not clear enough before, THE MAN DUE TO THE PENTAGON IS WEARING A TIE WITH BUGS BUNNY AND THE ROUND RUNNER ON IT. The film basically culminates (HAHAHahhaaa I said it culminates ...) with the last remaining soldier who comes across the group of prisoners and guards and the new formed team that is fighting away from the vicious aliens - which for some strange reason leads them directly to the alien ship? yes ... <br /> <br /> The film has a heart but is full of horrible directions and even worse than the camera. Someone seriously needed to slap the DP and tell him that there is more to cinematography than to repetitive, stagnant and chest shots. This film is not worth renting (if it ever does that far) since it is not as horribly bad as the last films made by the director that reduces the ability to laugh, but it is not even remotely close to watchable cinema.
