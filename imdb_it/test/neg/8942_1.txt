It seemed that a group of third grade students stole a video camera, borrowed some old editing software from 1995 and played a joke on each other.

This was a group of friends who enjoy and register each other. The plot was very difficult to follow. The tempted corners of artistic recovery have diminished the story and have made for all the time a dizzying experience. The acting even though comic was very amateur. The concept is OK, I guess. Perhaps next time, producers should raise capital and hire current professionals and try again. I must say that I am tired and tired of thinking so much that making a good film is easy. It's not easy ... This fact seems to be lost or ignored by many who believe that without any training / experience and talent they can make a good product. I believe that in the end they will learn how hard it is that I am so disgusted. I HAVE NOT COMMENT Chrisite wrote to August 5, 2006 (station number 762):
