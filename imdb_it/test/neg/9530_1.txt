Variety reviewer said this was "overwritten and prolonged", and I agree with it. It has some events that seem forced and unlikely, like when Cal (Crudup again as the 'lost, vacant, and kind of boring' male) and Julianne Moore find a map of the United States in some sort of incredible place. The story is one of those stories from the 70s that must find meaning in his life, and I found myself imagining Jack Nicholson in his main role playing Cal. The theme "hitting the road to find meaning in life" is still quite interesting. Does this really lead to the family? I wasn't so sure. The acting is ok, I particularly liked Karen Allen and James LeGross, who unfortunately only have secondary roles. I would give a "five".
