OK, before entering this, let's go ahead and remove the warning: this film is the quintessential "cinematic" definition of SLEAZE! There are films out there that can definitely upset or disgust this film that has an artistic validity more than you can say for this movie. So what makes it so squalid ?? Let's take a closer look at "Wet Wilderness" for a moment ...... <br /> <br /> Made in 1974 for practically nothing, this "rough" doesn't have a real "plot" for talk about other portraying what would happen if a FAMILY went to the desert to relax and spend a day while being approached by a fat guy in a ski mask wielding a machete in search of kicks ..... the type that ends with everyone those who are forced to have sex between them while being systematically murdered by the masked creep. So those who are sensitive to the topics that deal with incest are encouraged to look elsewhere. So to really add a level of surrealism or simply show a total incapacity for the art of making films, the "daughter" of the group escapes after being forced to have sex with her brother and finds a random black guy (!) tied to a tree branch ("... that fat bitch left me here for 3 days ...") with practically no explanation !! Is he saved ..... or is he? Obviously not!! They are captured before they can escape, where our killer forces them to have sex while forcing their mother to unite, ending up with a dead black guy (courtesy of a hatchet on his chest) when all has been said and done. Then our killer forces his daughter and mother to give him oral sex when one of the women takes the machete ........ and the movie ends abruptly !!! That's right! No warning, no slack tied ... it's just over. Now there may be an appropriate ending for this film (I honestly don't know), but I've only seen the extremely raw Alpha Blue Archives version. Their version seems to have the ending either completely cut out or this is how it ends. If this were intentional, then in Film making 101, I'm sure there's some sort of rule of thumb about HOW to finish a movie, but it shouldn't be done like THIS! Fans of the movie "Psycho" should rejoice by listening to the soundtrack, because it's all through the movie! I would bet that no right was authorized or otherwise. Also, although this is a "violent" film, there is not a lot of it, so the gorehounds will not find anything really useful here. No violence is shown graphically ..... only the results (one of the victims is stabbed with a machete just above the vagina area). Moreover, sex is part of the UGLIEST sex I've ever seen! The interesting thing about this movie is that it is too bad a movie to function as an effective erotic porn or turn anyone on, except those with a tendency to like squalid, unpleasant and ugly things, but not violent enough to be known by anyone look for something really brutal like "Cannibal Holocaust" or other such gestures. The only "notorious" thing about this steaming pile is that violence has been added to an adult movie, a fairly new concept at the time, especially considering that chic porn was all the rage and the millstones that filled the 42nd Street played things like that to a more exhausted group of porn experts. This was not mainstream porn. <br /> <br /> If you were in a film school and there was a "don't do" movie list, this movie would be a brilliant example of that lesson! This cinematic barrage demonstrates what happens when brain-challenged directors have a "budget" (in this case, probably about $ 142 ..... because they look at it!) And ignore all the "don't" and turn them into "do" "..... yes, this film is so ugly !! Another thing: those who are offended by racial epithets are also encouraged to look at something else. The black man in the film is constantly victim of verbal abuse on his color and the killer is obviously racist, but there was NO political correctness in the early 1970s. I'm not sure if a film like this could be made today. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this is not "it will shock anyone or anyone except those who go down because of ugliness. In fact, I got bored. Sex is so ugly and trivial, it's hard to look at with a sense of eroticism, so if you get the chance, you'll thank God for the fast forward button! The "acting", if you want to call it that, it's at the best amateur (I mean, it's also bad for PORNO!) with no reason to worry about someone or something in this !! If you absolutely need to see it anyway, download it, since it will really look like a heel if you would buy it. Some things are simply useless ..... and "Wet Wildernes" is. The only thing more unpleasant than watching this film is watching this movie sitting in a theater and watching the others present watching it and suddenly feel insecure. Probably not the largest collection of thinkers and intellectuals in society. But if you fancy a stupid, but stupid porn trash, give it a dusting. It's 54 minutes and again, it's MUCH longer !! Crackheads would love this! Then again, maybe there's something wrong with me for looking for it first ... LOL! Caveat emptor, sleaze-lovers !!
