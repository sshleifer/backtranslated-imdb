I saw this movie recently mainly because I'm a big fan of Jodie Foster. I saw this film and it was made just among his 2 Oscars, so my expectations were quite high. Unfortunately, I thought the film was terrible and I still have to wonder why it was persuaded to make this film. The script is really weak. The story itself may have been quite credible if someone like Mel Gibson had played the role of the assassin. The idea of ​​Jodie running with Dennis Hopper and his annoying accent was impossible for me. I thought Jodie was fantastic for the whole movie, which was probably the only reason I looked at the whole thing. Perhaps it was the only reason the film was made to show Jodie around with as few clothes as possible. I saw a television biography of Jodie in which virtually all of his films were commented in chronological order, and this film was the only one that was never mentioned. After seeing it, I can now see why.
