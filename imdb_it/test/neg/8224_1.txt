OK, so I have to start this review by saying that I really expected to see this movie for months, I look at its trailer and I think it was really cool .... I didn't know that the only interesting thing about this cliché the turd driven was precisely his trailer. <br /> <br /> At the movies, I watched the first 3 frames of this movie and even if for me "no, this movie is so bad, don't be an idiot, give it a chance! you only saw 3 minutes" while I I rolled my eyes in shame. All those frames showed .... take this .... a guy with a poker face (because he doesn't feel anything .... it's deep) looking straight at the camera in the middle of the frame. In the second or third, he stays awake in his perfectly made bed (because he sleeps like a dead man ... because he doesn't hear anything), and his father calls, and says "John Garden State, it's me, your father" .... Oh come on! I've seen a little more than a couple of gestures to hate clichés like "it's me, your (insert parent)", how the hell should I react ??? "Oh, he has a tough relationship with him" .... uh .... yes, that's exactly how I should react .... <br /> <br /> Man, this is a lousy movie ... < br /> <br /> Anyone, as the film flows, we learn things about his friends, of which everyone is an EMO WALKING INDIE MOVIE ALTERNATIVE CLICHÉ. For example, one of his acquaintances is a guy who works in a medieval themed restaurant that speaks Klingon (bizarre characters + pop culture = your standard American indie film). Then we get to know the character of Natalie Portman, who is a copy of Alissa Jones (from a movie that hits GS's ass, Chasing Amy), Amelie and that girl from Eternal Sunshine ... you know, clever, original (not really), educated, beautiful and ... in touch with her sexuality (!). Listen to a band from the 70s called The Shins and give ... what? are they from this damn decade? So why do they sound like this ?? Oh, they have no personality, OK ..... so pass your CD player to John Garden State and he looks at her with a stupid face (you know, love). While the song was playing, I heard his lyrics say "you will love this soundtrack, it is so alternative and interesting, you will love this movie, you will define yourself and your generation even if it is an ideological photocopy of The Breakfast Club, Ghost World and every other movie of intelligent teenagers of the last 20 years, drink coffee and read books you don't understand "... <br /> <br /> Now, very little original begins to happen. ... he doesn't care if he dies in a plane crash (because he's already dead ... and doesn't hear anything) and lets us know in a scene an idea taken directly from an unknown film called FIGHT CLUB! !!, it's a fantastic scene but, oh, did I mention that it appeared in the trailer? ....... then in some party, and just when you think that this guy is really deep and asexual, he does it with a child .... so oh, it's not such an emotional zombie after all ... development of the smart character or just a sh movie? tty? ... well, let's analyze that scene, see a cou ch sitting motionless with all the others moving in really fast speed ...... idea of ​​scene taken directly from an unknown film called REQUIEM DA A DREAM! ...... so just a sh movie! tty, sh! tty ... <br /> <br /> Then they meet more eccentric characters (clichés, actually) and, finally, one who lives next to a big hole in the ground. John Garden State says some crap like "good luck exploring your infinite abyss" and the boy says ... and now I really wanted to suffocate myself, "You too" ............. and then we are kindly told that Neo is Jesus .... oh no, wait, this is another piece of stupid shit, obvious, repetitive, overrated and cliché. <br /> <br /> Finally (Finally !!!!), another crap happens and he enters the big warehouse showdown to defuse the bombs: he has to talk to his father he hasn't seen in the last seven million years because he (FINALLY COOL SPOILERS) killed his mother .. .. (see, he killed his mother, so he is also dead ....... and feels nothing ..... it's deep). Now I was only expecting a brilliant and intelligent dialogue between a father and a child ...... but this is Garden State, so this is more or less the same: - John Garden State: Father, I forgive you, you have not I know what you were doing when you drugged me for a billion years, but I know you love me - Head of the lousy director: No !!! No!!!! I'll say simple things because I'm not really that deep of a character, like this whole movie really, so no !!!! -John Garden State: No dad, we have to get along because we are equal individuals ..... I mean different people -Small director's dad: No !!!!! No !!!! ............ OK, you convinced me. <br /> <br /> And he gets the girl (because he is no longer dead, you know) and the movie ends and I go to eat a piece of chicken that makes my day .... <br /> <br / > This movie created for the trailer sucks
