The best part of this film is the first, located in Sicily, I suppose. Crialese shows a good talent for photography and the beginning of the film is delightfully surprising. The rest of the story is pretty boring. Crialese uselessly insists on stereotypical situations and characters, trying to merge neorealistic suggestions and video-music technique, Fellini surrealistic memories and a very annoying soundtrack and completely off-topic, leading everything towards an end that gives you the feeling of exaggeration long history abruptly interrupted. Frankly, this is a true overrated movie and Crialese is a true overestimated director.
