This review contains a SPOILER --- <br /> <br /> The film is an American ninja mysteriously trained in martial arts. He falls in love with the colonel's daughter and turns from the most hateful grunt on the post to the people's hero at the end of the film. This film is extremely poor and very poorly researched. It's good for people who don't care about plot development or reality. Good for children under 14 years. The military errors in this film are comical. I remember that during my three years in the military, we private individuals were not required to greet or call the "Lord" of the NCO, the film does it at various points. The colonel's hair is too long for the ears. Master Sergent's mustache was against the lengthy military protocol. On the spot, the Colonel was the only officer in circulation. No other officers walking around the pole were shown. You had idiotic ninjas with swords against the troops with the m-16, rather badly made. <br /> <br /> This movie stank. Michael Dudikoff is not so bad about an actor who only has lousy scripts. The ninjas were more hilarious than dangerous. Avoid this movie
