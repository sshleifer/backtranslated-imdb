For a good interpretation of the Roman Empire look at the miniseries produced by the BBC "I, Claudius". This has just sucked. The acting was pathetic and you could almost see the actors watching the camera. Hans Matheson was irritating. The cheese factor was so high that it promotes constipation with repeated visualizations. Caligula was also gentle. I think this film was silently supported by "religious" groups that will remain unnamed;). The explicit tones of Christian favoritism and persecution were blatant if it suggested. Stay away from what you do - the running time is so long that I could read the first Harry Potter book faster than the time it took to see this tripe. <br /> <br /> Italy has done better - don't let Hans make you tease. He is not a great actor ... he is a great nuisance.
