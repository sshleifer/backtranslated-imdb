So you have the spoiler warning --- but I'd say you can't spoil what's already rotten. I assume they changed the name to "The Cavern" if the reputation of "WIthIn" had preceded it. <br /> <br /> After paying the cable rental for this film, I thought I'd save my garbage for a month and send it to the writer / director. He had his trash delivered to my house, so I thought it was right that I return the favor. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a suggestion that the scene is in the Kazakh desert. I'm not sure why they chose Kazakhstan; maybe the writer is a fan of Ali G Show. But they should have started just inside the cave, because the outside obviously wasn't Kazakhstan. It was the first clue I was going to hate the movie. <br /> <br /> The film has no redeeming qualities, except one: it is consistent. Everything is terrible. Writing, directing, acting, cinematography --- every aspect of this film is just bad. And I like bad movies, stupid movies, B-horror movies. . . but this was simply ugly. And stupid. And mince. And predictable. That's boring. <br /> <br /> To get an idea of ​​the film, enter your laundry room with 5 of your friends and turn off the lights. Put a torch (lit) in the dryer and start tumbling. Now you all start screaming and shouting at the top of your lungs. Done. <br /> <br /> For a complete re-enactment, 5 of the 6 people in the laundry play on the floor. Toss Karo syrup on them. Turn the lights back on (stops the dryer). Now a boy in gorilla costume enters the room and rapes the last person standing. <br /> <br /> FIN <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: Reading the other comments, many find this film remarkable on a low budget. It is not remarkable. Making a shitty movie on a HUGE budget is remarkable (Waterworld). Making a good movie on a low budget is remarkable (like Blair Witch, who I really enjoyed). Making a shitty movie on a low budget isn't a bit surprising, and you can expect more if these people are still making movies, because I can't imagine anyone delivering a pile of money after seeing this. <br /> <br /> Is the low budget an excuse for a terrible movie? No, and certainly there is no reason to look at it. Would you like to eat a sandwich with dog droppings just because it was cheap to do so? <br /> <br /> The evaluation of IMDb for this film over time will be interesting to watch. It should go lower down, but only if the number of unsuspecting innocent spectators can exceed the producers' ability to beg their personal friends to give them 10 stars.
