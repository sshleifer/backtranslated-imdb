I will only praise him for one aspect ... he was innovative. Innovative doesn't mean it's a good movie, it means it can give you an idea of ​​what you can take and implement in your films. <br /> <br /> The simple plot is .. well .. simple. I got to the point where I didn't care if they destroyed the building or not. If I were to hear that girl's annoying chuckle again, I swear I would have thrown the DVD out the window. And there is also the protagonist. They try to make it lovable, but it's a pervert! Sniffing the girls' bra, stealthily looking at them when she is naked, she puts her bra over her eyes when she sleeps, putting her bra on an inflatable doll (which she removes her panties while she falls asleep and slides them onto her doll .. umm) /> <br /> What irritates me even more is that disgusting color. In the DVD photogallery, you can see what the film looked like before they standardized it and put a color tint (even digitally) .. The film seemed MUCH better without the effect .. so they sacrificed the fact that it was a good movie only to be artistic ... bah. I could understand using such tricks if the quality of the movie was disgusting .. <br /> <br /> I think most of the people who liked this movie liked it because the girl was naked for 5-10 minutes . This is not comparable to Delicatessen (as many are tryn to do). Delicatessen has characters you can enter and how ... these people here just grunt and laugh. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would also like to point out that this was also an attempt to be like a German Impressionist film. old silences One of the problems with most foreign films, especially artistic ones, is to focus on an artistic composition and forget the 'space' of the scene. The public does not really understand what is happening because it does not understand the space of the surroundings. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's rubbish. The short film on the DVD, Surprise, was a much better heckuva.
