The first time I saw this show was OK. There were some funny moments and I laughed a couple of times but this show is getting worse and worse. Carly and Sam's web show is NOT funny at all. They play a stupid video from the internet, they shout at the camera and make very bad jokes. And then the laughter goes out? One of the problems with the show is that none of the main characters is fun. Carly isn't funny. The acting of Miranda Cosgrove is rather weak. His acting in this show is not like his acting as Drake And Josh. His friend Sam is very rough and rough and the show is written in a way that makes it look like a kind of hillbilly. I mean they make jokes about his mother driving an old rusty truck, his mother splitting an old TV with a bat, and then there are jokes about Sam not going to school, taking detention and escaping from the policemen. None of this is fun. Then there is Freddy who is a computer fanatic. It's not too funny unless his mother treats him as a child. The only full-time funny character on the show is Carly's brother, Spencer. He makes funny jokes and does pretty funny things like pretending to drive a spaceship while making spaceship noises, knocking over a girl's biscuit table to get revenge while they did the same thing. His material is the only thing worth laughing. Apart from the characters, other things also make the show ugly. Like the fact that a couple of guys who do a local web show from a Seattle apartment are a worldwide success and made them take a free trip to Tokyo? Another thing is that as a 26-year-old single boy without a real job he can pay for a 2-story apartment in downtown Seattle and raise his 13-year-old sister and pay for a room full of camera and audio equipment including a projector remote control and a green screen and an HD video camera? It appears to have been written by a 10-year-old child. The worst thing is that the show contains some rather questionable content. There are a couple of times that Carly (remembers a 13-year-old girl) appears on her web show in a bikini. WTF? Then I saw an episode in which Freddy tells Carly and Sam that he "slept in the stockings ONLY the night before." I mean WTF? Then there is an episode in which Carly's rival, Nevel, blackmails her by taking her rights on the website and agrees to return the site in exchange for a kiss. Horrifying! And I just saw an episode where Carly meets a guy who just moved into their apartment building and has a kind of back injury and takes off his shirt and Carly is drooling over him. I can't believe that Nick allowed him to show that kind of unpleasant stuff and I can't believe it was created by the same guy responsible for Drake and Josh. This show is not appropriate for children under the age of 12 and this is also questionable. iCarly is just another addition to Nick's long list of bad programming.
