It's terrible! It is as if someone had given a child a defective video camera and $ 30 and told him to make a movie. Even then you would get a better and more professional movie than this. The story is so stupid that you can say there isn't one. I don't think the guy who did this knew what to do - watching foreign art movies all day is not enough to make someone an instant director. The acting is bad, actually the nursery school and the script is just awful. The only scene I didn't hate was the one with the caravan incident, but that just means it was slightly less horrible than the rest of the movie. How do people get funding for this stuff? I don't deal with alternative films, but shouldn't they at least not be a big pile of steaming cow dung? I would call Dilettante "Price of Milk" if it were not an insult to the amateurs. This wouldn't even be a good movie if I was drunk or drugged!
