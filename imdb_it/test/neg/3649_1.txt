Subject matter: Worthting Acting: Fair (some of them) Plot: Ridiculous <br /> <br /> Details: The sound changes from acute to almost incomprehensible; the music is not entirely terrible (but above all it is); dialogue and characterization are ridiculous; the process of discovering the main character is clearly obvious to everyone except for himself (and the writer, apparently); animal scenes are simply stupid (singing "Moon River" in an off-key text, forgotten, silly duet to a "pack" of wild boar for hours, as an example). Finally, the "wet t-shirt" contest is so foolish that it cannot be believed. (Hint: the "girl" who wins is not ... well, I'm not giving it away.)
