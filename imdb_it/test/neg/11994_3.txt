Glenn Ford, a guy from New York who kept his money, his thumbs and hobos on his way to the Arizona ranch he bought, where he hopes to find THE PARADISE WITH A BARBED WIRE FENCING. <br /> <br /> A film with a screenplay and a story by Dalton Trumbo, directed by the extraordinary boss Ricardo Cortez, and interpreted by the often affectionate, affectionate Glenn Ford and the restless Richard Conte, should not be so damned beautiful. Even if the system - mostly seen as policemen, railway bulls and real estate scammers - is as horrible as one might expect from the sinister Mr. Trumbo, every single proletarian is so sweet and kind and the salt of the earth that one feels nausea. It doesn't help that the heroine - a sweet blonde thing who is an illegal alien refugee who flees Franco's Spain - is bothersome for reasons of both script and acting. <br /> <br /> So why look? Richard Conte, in his first role, already has his character and a pretty good part. And there are some moments in the left-wing camp of the 1930s that are quite surprising. (Dalton absolutely had to set an important part of the film in the mission of the Russian Worker? There was only a portrait of a radiant Joe Stalin!) Furthermore, this is the first substantial role of Glenn Ford (although his performance is not good). <br /> <br /> Why not look? In essence, the film offers an unconvincing view, is married to a political point of view that is laughable, and the two protagonists have made much better films. Furthermore, Dalton Trumbo's strengths as a screenwriter are not at all obvious. Instead, we get a movie that the Coen Brothers Barton Fink could have written in a flash (avoiding that hellish hell with the writer's block).
