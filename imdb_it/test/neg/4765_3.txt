"The Hep Cat" by Bob Clampett is a decidedly medium-sized cardboard only in reality remarkable for the fact that it was the first Looney Tune color (previously the Looney Tunes were all in black and white while the Merrie Melodies were in color). The story of an attempt to sing, the cat dancing to court a cat and a dog's attempt to catch the cat, "The Hep Cat" lacks the strength and the hallmark of most of the Clampett shorts. To be honest, Clampett doesn't have much to work with. Warren Foster's screenplay is somewhat embarrassing and, while he spun the straw in gold with other cartoons, Clampett can't handle it with "The Hep Cat". It is often said of Clampett that you can't exchange his cartoons for someone else's and it's generally true, but "The Hep Cat" is an exception. There are flashes of Clampett's genius, like the chase scene in which the cat stops to ask the dog "Hey, you're following me". When the dog confirms it is, the cat simply says "Oh" and the pursuit immediately resumes. Unfortunately, there is very little of this brilliance here. Knowing who directed it, "The Hep Cat" is a bitter disappointment. We all have days off and this was clearly one of Clampett's!
