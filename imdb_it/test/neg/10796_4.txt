First of all, since I'm one of the people who has never seen the MST3K cropped version of this film, I can't comment on this. <br /> <br /> However, I saw the original version of this film on the Sci-Fi channel and thought it was as good as anything else on that channel. In fact, I thought it was one of their best offers. <br /> <br /> I have noticed in carefully reading the comments that people who write in detail about SOULTAKER with a minimum of intelligence, attention and maturity tend to like at least some things about this film and rightly so. In its original cut, most reasonable people think they would probably rate it at least 4 or 5 stars out of 10. Five is average for me and I think this film is average for a Sci Fi photo. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the above, I have also noticed that reviewers who seem immature, obtuse and upside down and consequently come out as boneheads from where they are, are the same ones who can't find anything good in this film and basically he transgresses it without cause relying MORE to see it chopped up and fracassed on MST3K. Or if they saw both cuts, they seem to have been strongly affected by the display of MST3K.
