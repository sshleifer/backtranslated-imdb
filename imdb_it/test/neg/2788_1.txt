We begin by recognizing that there are probably three types of horror films: good, bad and absolutely embarrassing rollers that make the whole genre suffer in every way. Dark Harvest promises great results with the cover of the Artisan DVD, but we assure you that this is where the show stops. After an exhausting opening montage, we soon discover that the film consists of a poorly written script, extremely unqualified (even for a film for beginners) acting, disastrous lighting and even worse special effects. Seriously, no one could afford anything more than a mask for the villain, or did he think it was good enough for Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, so it's good enough for us? Well, it didn't work at all to create a scary villain. In any case, this is one of the movies that lets you check your watch, sigh and curse your gullibility. The timing in each scene is painful, and the entire production has a middle school feeling (come to think of it, I've seen better theatrical productions of middle school, up to the special effects). I'm trying to think of a way to end this review on a positive note, so let me suggest that all copies of this destroyed train be donated as coasters, frisbees, wind chimes ....... I would say "go see yourself ", but it would only be cruel. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the rest of the reviews of this production company and you'll find the same for each of their films. They claim to honor the contract between the film and the public (for example, the fans), but all they did was chuckle and dump a load on our heads for the money (of which I'm sure they saw very little for this) . <br /> <br /> We are sorry, the high ratings and favorable reviews are obviously published by those who are directly or indirectly related to this disguise. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10 because it is the lowest rating possible. Giving him even one makes me angry.
