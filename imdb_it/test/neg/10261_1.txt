Everything about this movie was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was ugly. And it was all the blood and blood that was in "Demons", which is a good movie and it wasn't scary at all. My brother said this movie was bad, but I had to give it a chance since the first movie was very good. When the movie is over, I understand why my brother thought this movie was bad. The only advantage in this film was the music of "The Smiths" and "The Cult", but this is a film and the soundtrack of music is not the most important thing. And I saw that four sequels have been released after this movie, I haven't seen any of them but they can be as terrible as this, I'm not going to see them but maybe I'll see them for a while.
