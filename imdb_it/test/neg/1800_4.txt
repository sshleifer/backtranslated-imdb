Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is rather dark, deep and very deep. I must say that reading the novel is much better than the film. The character of Mr. Kurtz, played by John Malcovik, was totally the wrong actor to play the part. It suited the character in "Of Mice and Men". The film has left out the key parts of the man that I consider important for getting the true message of history. <br /> <br /> The film is badly edited. Show many unimportant and annoying flashes. In the novel it has a very suspicious atmosphere, but in the film it lacks that kind of feeling. There is so much in the book that it was left to the reader's imagination. For example, when Marlow spent hours and days without time waiting for rivets and that whole scene was left out of the film. In the novel Marlow waited a long time before the rivets came to repair his boat. This was a great source of uselessness in the novel. The film added other parts that were useless and that made no sense. For example, when Kurtz was talking to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz broke the monkey's neck and killed him. That kind of thing ruined everything, it didn't make sense to me what it was. So my suggestion is not to see the movie, just read the book. You will understand more and you will have a better interpretation of the story. <br /> <br /> ~ Chris C.
