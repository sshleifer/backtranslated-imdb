I saw Gomeda at the cinema in my city. My friend took me away and I was really curious to know what it would be like. Well, I must say that this film was not a horror, perhaps we can say that it is the "Fantsastic experimentation" ... OK, here I go anyway ... But there were many problems of shooting, acting, drama, drama and narration I can understand why the director is very young and Gomeda is his first feature film.OK The direction of this film was not bad, I see. Unfortunately, due to the restrictions imposed on the extremely low budget film, the images are often as obscure as the plot. And there are no powerful Gothic scenes. Like a horror movie, it really fails, has no fear and is rather confusing and boring. Some say that "Gomeda" is an art film, but I could not see a film of art that was ridiculous, terrible and out of fashion. So how can we say that it is an art film!
