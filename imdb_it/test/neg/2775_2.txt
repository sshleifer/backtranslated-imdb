This is an economic film by Al Adamson - a man perhaps the worst producer of films ever - perhaps even worse than Ed Wood, Jr. Adamson specialized in horror films and skins with a very low budget in the 60s, 70s and years '80 and with titles like FIVE FORMS OF BLOODY, BLOODY DEVILS, SATAN'S SADISTS and LASH OF LUST it is obvious that he was not doing Shakespeare !! His films all had production values, sensations, gore and amateur acting. <br /> <br /> Here in BRAIN OF BLOOD, several Adamson serial actors (like his wife, Regina Carrol, Zandor Vorkov and Angelo Rossitto agree the ride and had appeared in Adamson's previous film, Dracula VERSUS FRANKENSTEIN : it is fortunate because the previous film was so terrible and poorly executed at every level that BLOOD BRAIN can not help but look beautiful! Of course, the trick is ridiculous, the plot stupid (involves the ubiquitous brain transplant scheme) and the acting is level Z, but it is STILL better than their last movie! <br /> <br /> The only good things about this film are the aging of the secondary actor, the midget Angelo Rossitto actually had a better part than usual - with more dialogue and a more important role in the plot - and there is actually a certain sense of danger and tension at times .. As for Mrs. Carrol, she STILL looks like a stripper and the rest of the cast limps through qu esto stupid film. However, it is bad enough to make it look good for bad movie viewers: you just have to see the trick on the guy with acid burns and the ray gun that seems to have been made from an old back light!
