Ahem .. I think I'll be the only one saying this but yes, I was a little bored during the movie. Not to say that this is a bad movie, actually it's a great attempt to portray the most intimate emotions - dilemma, sadness, love ..., especially it's the director's debut (read somewhere, is it true?). I felt that something is not right, maybe it's just me, I'm not attracted to the characters enough to immerse myself in their world. This is a simple story about ordinary people, about ordinary lives. Through simple and brief dialogues, the director tries to relate the life of a simple boy, and how to cope with the news of his illness by laughing away every time. Oh yes, his laughter was a little pretty at first, but little by little it comes to me, such a deep and cordial roar for a kind man! I must say that I did not feel the impact that most readers felt, rather I was more attracted to trivial scenarios like spitting watermelon seeds with his sister who clearly shows that they feel comfortable with each other, the grandmother who came again for another shot - this is a bit melancholy, the thoughtful gesture of writing the procedures for her father - hmm but this is predictable .. I have not misunderstood that I am a lover of action, the Independent movies are my cup of tea! Maybe I only have a very high expectation after watching many deep movies that have stronger images. Some Asian films worthy of attention: <br /> <br /> Tony Takitani (describes the loneliness) Wayward Cloud (only 1 dialogue) My Sassy Girl (I like it!) 4.30 (even the loneliness) 15 (the gangsters live in a local environment) Before dawn and Before sunset (I just have to mention them even if they are not Asian films. Fans will understand!)
