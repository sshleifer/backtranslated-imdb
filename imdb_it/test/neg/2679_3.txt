Friend, the 90s really was a horrible decade for movies. Films lack style and narration is often lacking. <br /> <br /> This sixth entry into the long Halloween series is certainly a bad one. You never get into history because it is not a very well built and constructed film. <br /> <br /> It is simply a poorly made film, which also suffers from its writing without compelling images and characters that are in it. Dr. Loomis seems to be there just for the sake of being there. It is a real pity that this should be Donald Pleasence's last film role. It's nice and also the fact that his last role is in a Halloween movie, but he certainly deserved to be in a better one. <br /> <br /> There is never a real sense of danger in the film and in the character of Michael Myers it never presents itself as threatening or scary. Maybe it's because he appeared too prominent throughout the film, soon enough. He does his usual things again, but without too much class or originality. Even attempts to discover Myer's past do not work, for the main reason that it simply is not explained very well. It is obvious that the script was subjected to various re-scripts before and most probably during the shooting. Several scenes were taken or added after the first cut turned out to be anything but pleasant. <br /> <br /> The film looks more and more like a TV product. This is also due to the lack of some good blood. As a horror movie, it really lacks just about everything to make it look good or even original. <br /> <br /> So far the worst in the series! <br /> <br /> 3/10
