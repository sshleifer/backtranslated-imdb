I didn't buy it, I didn't rent it, it was in PPV and someone burned a copy and lent it to me, so at least I didn't waste money. For someone who has done Darkness, the Nameless, Devil's Backbone, this is a rather lame film. It seems to have something to do with a group of girls who were in a convent in the past and are now all grown up and chased and killed one by one by a nun who comes out of the kitchen sink, the bathroom, and even manages to negotiate the revolving doors in a hotel. And what makes this nun so bad and mean (and wet?) I don't know, this was so boring that at some point halfway I just stopped him, put him away and looked at something else. I wasn't even interested in finding out, really. Oh sure, there are some lovely ladies to look at but hey, are they two lesbians? I imagine, is there a picture on the bedside table of a young woman's bedroom and which self-respecting horror movie wouldn't be complete these days without a lesbian couple? Yeah whatever. 2 out of 10, if you want to see a horror movie worthy of trying "Desecration", "Dead Waters", or "The Convent" (and that's the one with Adrienne Barbeau, by the way, not the one with John Malkovich).
