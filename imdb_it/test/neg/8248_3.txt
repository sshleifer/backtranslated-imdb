When Hollywood tries to understand what an "intelligent person" is, it fails so miserably, finding it hard to put words in the mouth of the alleged "genius". <br /> <br /> Right, any genius goes around trying to rub in its superiority to every instance. Sure, they stop in bars and take fights ?? it's not like they are (wildly generalizing) autistic nerds who never have a tan. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, if you are a genius you know everything about math and history and politics and of course you are constantly up to date with current events and a thorough analysis of them. Coz these things, like, they all go together, you know? <br /> <br /> Also, go around with a grin all the time. You're just a smug son of a you-know-what, that's how it is, you all. <br /> <br /> And of course, you smoke, like someone who has never smoked before, but you smoke because it's like something fresh, you know. And you're different. It is understood. <br /> <br /> And of course you can fight? you're a bully. A bully who finds time to study 10,000 books every time he doesn't lift weights. And every time he doesn't smoke or drink beer because he follows a strict health regime. <br /> <br /> And did you go out with a 30-year-old college student? Minnie Driver. Well, I don't even want to comment on Matt Damon. Team America has already hit the head. <br /> <br /> This film is a daydream of a Beavis & Butthead student (in other words 95% of them): "Yes, that's what I'd like to be if I were a genius." But stupid people and stupid authors in this case cannot imagine the life of the genes.
