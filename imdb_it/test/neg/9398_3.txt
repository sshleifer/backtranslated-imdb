Diane Lane is beautiful and sexy, and Tuscany is wonderful but this film is not better than the mediocre one and this is generous. The plot is grafted onto a travel diary and remains completely at odds. <br /> <br /> Set in a suburb of Newark, we say that the plot would be considered ridiculous. All that saves the film are the Tuscan countryside and the occasional scenes set in Florence and Positano, and a film about the sun-of-the-sun-slowly-in-west variety would have served better to show what surely the best clubs in all the world.
