Los Angeles doctor Tom Reed (Vincent Ventresca) survives a tragic car accident, but ends up in the California desert jail. When his time is up, he lands in a small windswept town called Purgatory Flats. His first stop is a bar, where he quickly slams a beer and is hired as a bartender. So much for ex-acquaintances who have difficulty finding work. This is the first in a long series of absurdities that constitute the plot of the stupid attempt by writer / director Harris Done of modern noir film, set in the desert. <br /> <br /> His first night at work Tom meets a sexy femme fatale named Sunny (Alexandra Holden), who hangs out with a family of bad boys: the Mecklins, composed by Uncle Dean (Gregg Henry) and by his two grandchildren, drug addict Owen (Kevin Alejandro), who is Sunny's husband, and soldier AWOL Randy ("Brian Austin Greer" of 90210). After his shift is over, there is a shooting, and Dr. Tom is nearby. He agrees to treat one of the injured and, above all, not to tell the police. I'm not sure it's a good move for a boy who just came out of the pen, but this script (written by Diane Fine) has very little to do with logic. <br /> <br /> Tom makes a series of bad decisions that lead him to get involved further with Mecklin's criminal boys, including stealing medical supplies and jumping with Sunny. Everyone in the theater is shouting "Don't do it, walk away", but Tom does it anyway. <br /> <br /> In a classic noir film like "Body Heat" or "Double Indemnity" we root for and empathize with William Hurt and Fred McMurray as they are sucked into the web of brilliant, sexy, devious fatal women like Kathleen Turner and Barbara Stanwyck. It's not their fault. We would probably be tempted by all that money or that particular lady. But Dr. Tom's weakness seems to stem from stupidity rather than from circumstances. Sunny is sexy but she is not a very compelling character and there is no money to tempt him. Are you wondering if you attended the same medical school as Dr. Nick Riveria of "The Simpsons". <br /> <br /> The stupid script makes you believe that a redneck's rural home has almost everything you need for a gunshot to the stomach, and the one so injured could easily jump to attention and actually participate in a fight . It gives us an implausible car chase with one of those "The Club" things stuck at the wheel. Oh, that tanker that just exploded - nobody noticed. <br /> <br /> I wonder why such a ridiculous script was lit by greens? Maybe Brian Austin Greer has more juice than I gave him credit for. It is obvious that he played the relatively small role of Randy - a hot-headed murder - to show producers that he had a greater range of acting than that shown in "90210". <br /> <br /> It is also a little sad to see Nicholas Turturro played a stereotypical Hispanic drug dealer. He deserves better. <br /> <br /> If you have an IQ above 50, "Purgatory Flats" will shake your head in disbelief. I'll give him 3 stars for the involuntary laughs and the scenes with the sexy Miss Holden wandering in her red panties.
