Under no circumstances should you watch this movie. It's terrible for a number of reasons: <br /> <br /> No plot No structure No direction No acting to talk No visual style No tension <br /> <br /> In a word - no. <Br /> <br /> The best thing is the box and the fact that it eventually ends. Who would have thought that 85 minutes could seem so long. <br /> <br /> Once again: never watch this movie. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> No plot No structure No direction No acting to talk about No visual style No tension <br /> <br /> In a word - no. <br /> <br /> The best thing is the box and the fact that it eventually ends. Who would have thought that 85 minutes could feel so long.
