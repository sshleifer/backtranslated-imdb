Because they all look there MST3K with their artificial friends who are (above all) not funny and obvious comments about movies. And this is the only way these people look at them and then comment and vote down on the IMDb based on this, they don't even try to watch the movie by themselves. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie it's all for me, I haven't read the reviews before, I didn't have some people saying what to laugh, I just got the DVD (bought for the other side of Morons From Outer Space , an old favorite) and I watched <br /> <br /> Because I knew what kind of thing interested me when it comes to a Golan Globus, Albert Pyun's movie, but they can usually be quite funny. <br /> <br /> The film is not too stressful on the brain Alice in the Rabbit story made many times, and a little similar in basic structure (but completely different in content) to Warlords of Atlantis, another fun B-Movie. <br /> <br /> The voice was annoying, but then this is the idea, which they also hit with a few lines in the film. <br /> <br /> The hero's character had one of the worst exaggerated voices / accents in English. It is history, but you accept to accept it and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, but it's not a really bad film, it's just a B-Movie DTV medium, nothing too new, nothing too great, and probably would be appreciated more by a band of younger age (say 7-14 years) than I. It is a bit of carefree fantasy. <br /> <br /> I'll see him again, probably not maybe about 10 years ago I would have. <br /> <br /> Don't be so hard on a movie because a couple of puppets have told you, this movie isn't taking itself seriously and it's certainly no Troll 2 or Space Mutiny.
