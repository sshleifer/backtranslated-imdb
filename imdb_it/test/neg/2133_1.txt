This stupid, anti-environment wannabe "Jaws" is sad, pathetic, boring, ill-voiced and stupid. There is nothing redeeming about it. <br /> <br /> Plots some shark / octopus creature-thing that appears off the coast of Florida and kills some people (including a boring and stupid couple with a whining wife and a silent husband who stabs himself with a fork for some reason ). His ascent to the surface is always represented by a vague scenario of something irregular again and again. It doesn't make sense, it's horribly boring, and the conspiracy plot sucks. <br /> <br /> There are field moments that cannot be ignored: the same stroke of the boat of the couple of the opening sequence THREE TIMES; the doctor slams twenty times in the chest of a dying patient with a defibulator without stopping, even if he is clearly dead; the porno-esque soundtrack; the shot of the couple making love on the beach, with three different ones ("That is getting over it!") doing this; the ancient computer that sounds like Kermit the Frog; a scientist full of beer shouting "I know!" to Dr. Smith; the list could go on forever. <br /> <br /> Oh, and everyone drinks at least thirty bears throughout the film (very much noticed by Mike and the "Bot"). . . <br /> <br /> The MST3K version is their best episode, but it's definitely better than the movie itself. "That's how I like to go fishing, guys ... with a flashlight and a flamethrower ..." - Crow <br /> <br /> A star for "Devil Fish"; seven for the MST3K version <br /> <br />
