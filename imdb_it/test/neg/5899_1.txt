I was so disappointed with this movie. The tag line was something like "The story of a sexual awakening for girls". You can only imagine how disappointed I was. At the time I was seventeen and I took my girlfriend to see him. I thought we were going to see a sexy movie that would leave my girlfriend puking for this. Unfortunately it was not so. I guess we weren't ready for a deep and meaningful film that required an element of sophistication that we didn't have at the time. I'm not so sure of owning it now, and I've long since left the company with that particular girl (really a pity ... my first love). We left the cinema in the middle of the film, my friend, who should have known, remained for the whole film. I still got the required result with my girlfriend, the film didn't help me much. It would be interesting to see him again so that I can make a more informed criticism, even if I believe that the experience has left me mark for life.
