This film was incredibly bad ... It's bloody, but the violence is too strong to the point that it seems extremely fake and predictable. Since everything is shown to you, there is nothing left to the imagination. And the plot ... what plot? There really isn't! The pace is incredibly slow (despite random acts of violence) and the script must have been written by a deranged 12-year-old boy who kills kittens for fun. So this film was banned in 31 countries? I could understand why ... not because of the cold blood (boring and trivial) but because it was a terrible film. It should have been BANNED from existence. Avoid this like the plague. 1 in 10
