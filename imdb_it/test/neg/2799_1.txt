I think there's a reason why this movie never came close to the theaters. It was probably my neighbors on the street shooting this film with their mother's camera. The acting is very amateur. This film is definitely not something you would like to see unless you are extremely bored. Actors even seem to double as directors and crew members, without any "professionalism". If the directors and / or actors decided to continue with their effort to make films, I would certainly recommend them to brush up on their skills and maybe take some (ok, many) directing and acting lessons.
