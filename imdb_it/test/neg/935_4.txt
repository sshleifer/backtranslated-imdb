I saw this film considering this as a normal Hollywood movie but then came to know that it is a film made for a television channel. On my DVD cover of 2 critics, one of the moviline critics saw it as a film Year .. <br /> <br /> All the characters were simple and dignified performances except for the Brain character who did not never has a scope that the director wanted to keep the mystery until the end .. there was suspense until the end but when you see the end that lady The police officer and the main culprit had a lesbian relationship seems to be a totally stupid. God knows what happens to DAVE the male protagonist .. <br /> <br /> The other critic of Mr. Brown's Movies said that it is shocking and effective but it is not up to the whole advertising campaign ... which I saw after watching the movie. For which I was partially engaged ... I should have read it before taking the film ..
