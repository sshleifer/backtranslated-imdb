"The Vindicator" is a strange little Canadian B-Movie. At first glance it would seem to be just another economic (extremely cheap!) "Terminator" knockoff, but strangely it also shares some qualities with the original "RoboCop", which had not yet been released when "Vindicator" (1986) appeared. Coincidence? Who knows? Anyway, the story is like this: scientist Carl Lehman seems to be a good guy working for a high-tech research laboratory with a secret superduper government, headed by a squalid boss named Whyte, who takes charge of the financing of the project at the beginning of the film. Carl has a loving wife at home and a baby on the way, which makes it even more tragic when he is suddenly killed in a "laboratory accident". But wait! After all, Carl isn't really dead! Whyte extracted Carl's brain and inserted it into his home project, a sort of experimental biomechanical space suit. When Carl awakens in his new body, he becomes understandably a bit crazy, destroys the lab and runs away. This is a problem because Whyte (for reasons known only to himself) has programmed the mechanical suit with a program "Rage Reaction", which will cause Carl to kill anyone who touches him for any reason. In hindsight, that little addition to Carl's psyche was probably not the best idea. <br /> <br /> So Robo-Carl wanders the movie for a while for a while, killing a couple of random muggers and other assorted background characters, until he returns to his house and contacts his wife (this scene it should be moving, I think, but it turns out to be comic because Carl's robotic voice is so strongly synthesized that you can barely understand a word he says). Obviously he tells her to leave the city and never come back because he is in danger, but wants to stay and help him, yadda yadda yadda. Eventually Whyte hires a band of commando thugs led by "Hunter", an apparent ninja assassin played by Pam Grier (!) To hunt down and destroy his fleeing creation, using Carl's wife as a bait, and predictable ( but ridiculously cheap) the ensuing chaos. <br /> <br /> I'm a B-Movie guy, but "The Vindicator" was so perplexed that it turned into a very fast comedy. I imagine a good chunk of the budget went to Stan Winston's robo-Carl design, because it actually looks pretty good, but the rest of the film suffers from an economic aspect, made especially for TV. The script could have employed a lot of extra work, but perhaps the directors had the "RoboCop" hit in production and hastened to release "Avenger" so that they could not be accused of having ripped them off. However, judging by the other comments here on IMDb, I'm not the only one to notice the parallels between "Vindicator" and "RoboCop", and of course "Robo" is the top movie, so there's no need to waste time sit through this piece of nonsense unless you want to see a movie that can best be described, at best, as a "RoboCop" draft if it was done by an 8th grade.
