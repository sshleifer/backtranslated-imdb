Perhaps being a government bureaucrat is not the most fascinating way to make a living, but it is still a way to make a living. However, after seeing this film, one can come away believing that every government bureaucrat is a lazy, bloated, conceited pusher, who lives exclusively to take part in his next lunch break. It is not exactly a beautiful image, but this is the image that the public has to endure by looking at what is nothing but another boring, noisy and overcrowded action movie. Just what the doctor ordered ... right? How many more of these films did Hollywood make? One thousand? Two thousand? The formula for making these films is so beaten in the dust that it should now be completely unrecognizable. The local settings change but the plots remain the same, and with the same superficial development of the character and the same superficial action of trained actors, they are asked to transform themselves into pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly. It seemed that the film was continuously flowing. "When will this film end?" I thought of myself repeatedly. Leonardo DiCaprio was absolutely incredible as a CIA agent, but what must be one of the great gaffs of miscasting, an overweight Russell Crowe plays a CIA bureaucrat. Please note that in this film the on-site operator is "skinny and mean" while his desk jockey supervisor is fat. This is called a stereotype. What was the casting director thinking? Why not play Jack Nicholson an overweight salesman? Or does Nicole Kidman interpret a cheeky department store job? And the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could afford it. An obviously non-Arab American (Mr. DiCaprio) who tries to pass himself off as an Arab ... fluently speaking Arabic ... inventing all kinds of brain patterns that are destined for failure ... trying to think and get out of Arabs are completely liberated from his ridiculous Arab masquerade ... trying to romanticize a Palestinian woman while conducting an extremely delicate and complex espionage mission ... etc. By now you understand the point. Next time try throwing a real Arab into the role. Not even the most naive movie-goer can believe this. There should be a rough balance between the protagonist and the antagonist. In this film the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent as to leave the story in pieces. Next stop for this movie - DVD land and obivion. It's another thing. Do not let this film discourage you from working for the government. The salary may not be excellent, but the marginal benefits are excellent, a critical fact that this film conveniently omits.
