I'm not going to waste any more time describing how bad this movie is. Conclusion: it was horribly played, it had huge holes in the plot and it went absolutely NOW. The only positive thing was the description that my digital cable provided for the film: "A married man with a troubled business has an adventure with his secretary". Eh ?? Apparently the wrong movie, although it may have made things slightly more interesting if one of the descriptions were true. <br /> <br /> --Shelly
