Why can virtual games "x-rated video games" speak through the mouth but the virtual champion of fighting games Dante must use a combination of telepathy and dramatic facial expressions? I feel that they either needed to launch someone who looked worse (Michael Bermardo's big doe eyes don't exactly strike fear into everyone's hearts ... except for casting directors who constantly chose him as bad or heroic 'bad boy'.) Or they needed to simply let him use his real voice (and move his mouth), and maybe give him a costume that wouldn't make him stick out like a sore thumb when he walked down the street. (but of course this is the future and we must assume that the bad taste of fashion is considered the norm).
