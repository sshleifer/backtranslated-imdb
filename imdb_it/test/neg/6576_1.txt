I find it almost touching the way Star Trek fans are desperately trying to appreciate this movie despite its incredible number of flaws. <br /> <br /> To begin with, none of the familiar characters is really in the character so to speak. Scotty is depicted as a walkable owner instead of the competent engineer who was in the original series. Uhura ... Gods, I can't even think about what they did to his character. All his dialogue was painful to hear. McCoy looked like a neurotic stepfather to Kirk instead of his trusted friend. Spock ... well, let's say Leonard Nimoy was terribly wasted. He was given a bad dialogue ("I don't think you caught the gravity of your Captain situation." Gravity, you see? Take it?) And almost made a fool. Kirk ... oh man, don't get me started. At the beginning, William Shatner is an amateur actor, so allowing him to really direct is to invite the disaster that is what we got. <br /> <br /> The plot is beyond all limits. Giving Spock a brother is a rather desperate plot and unnecessarily soap opera. But hey, let's go with it. The search for God. Again, a weak plot base. Don't you think so? OK, let's go with that too. So, assuming the two elements of the plot above are solid, what's wrong with the script? Well, first of all, recycle too much. The Enterprise, for example, is once again, not working properly. Should we assume that Starfleet would send a severely malfunctioning ship with a team of skeletons in a potentially dangerous situation just because they want James Kirk to handle the situation? If so, then why not put it on a better ship as an adviser? In addition to that ... the crew is grossly incompetent. Scotty tears the ship to pieces (and apparently it is glaring enough to knock the head into unconsciousness WHILE there are enemies on board!), Nobody seems to notice that the Klingon ship comes off at a crucial moment (despite the fact that the sensors are clearly showing the ship in the range of weapons) and all the crews seem too familiar with each other. In other words, there is no sense of discipline. If this is the Starfleet flagship, then it is surprising that the Klingons have not already toppled the Federation. <br /> <br /> With regard to personal struggles with pain, it was crap. Lawrence Luckenbill is a competent actor, but even he can't save this turkey. In short, nobody could. Of all the people involved, I imagine that Leonard Nimoy is the most embarrassed. I hope it is, anyway. <br /> <br /> Thank god the original cast did not bend to this highlight brochure.
