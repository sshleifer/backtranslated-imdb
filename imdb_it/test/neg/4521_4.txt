There's the thrill of the low-budget noir movie. And there is the frustration of sinuous, uninteresting films made cheap. This falls into the second category. <br /> <br /> The Spot is the name of a disco. The film is about a policeman whose father was killed by a gangster. He heads to track them down. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the wrong press. Maybe it's me. But I felt I had seen it a hundred times, most of those times better than it is here. <br /> <br /> It also has some promise: The policeman is fascinated by a woman playing records who introduces juke boxes. Then they meet. Now, although it was done long before I was born, I saw that kind of juke box. And it's incredibly fascinating: when I was a teenager, I wandered into a bar that still had a device like that. I've always liked juke boxes, in bars or restaurants. But this was different. You spoke and a sensual female voice spoke to you! This is addressed here, but dropped into the general stew, uninteresting. <br /> <br /> The film has something going on: in a small role, it presents the very young Anne Jeffreys. What a beauty it was, and it still is!
