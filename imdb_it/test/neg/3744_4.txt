There is potential in there with "Tell No-one". A curious and intriguing storyline and a French version of a very American story. But for me, the opportunities were not exercised here. <br /> <br /> Although I liked the aspects of this film, there were three major weaknesses that brought it up to four out of ten. <br /> <br /> First, it is a mystery of silly, trivial murder. A particularly forced murder or Bergerac. Being French doesn't eliminate this problem - it's just silly and in French at the same time. It is full of implausible coincidences. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the transition from the United States to France seems to have chronically failed. This French doctor is walking around the "streets" of a French city with his new "homies" and their SUV blingin ... and then there are car chases ... <br /> <br /> But in third and above all, it's too damn long. For me, a film needs a good reason to be significantly more than 90 minutes, and in two hours it takes a serious justification. He didn't have it this time
