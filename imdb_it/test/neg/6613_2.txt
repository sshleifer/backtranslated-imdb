This film probably seemed like a great idea in the pre-production phase. "Let's make a film about one of the biggest and most controversial athletic coaches of the modern era! And let's launch Brian Dennehey as Coach Bobby Knight!" That's where this movie went terribly wrong. Why throw an actor who doesn't look like the man he plays? And then, why let this actor turn his character into not Coach Knight, but Brian Dennehey in a red sweater? While I sat watching this movie on ESPN, I didn't find myself believing that the man was actually Coach Knight. He didn't look like him, he talked like him, he behaved like him or even walked like him. I could not overcome this fact and, therefore, I could not enjoy the film. When Paul Newman and Robert Redford were cast as outlaws Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid, we don't care if they were accurate historical models of their real characters because most of us had never even heard of these men until they we saw the movie. But with someone as visible in today's media as Coach Knight, you have to do better. When Anthony Hopkins was chosen as Nixon, it was the same situation. But Anthony Hopkins made us believe that it was actually Nixon. Dennehey didn't even try. What could have been a great movie was made harsh by this. Besides the fact that this film tried to do for the four-letter words what it did for "Saving Private Ryan" for dismemberment, it was a blow. Too little of the real Coach Knight and too much bad word for the shock value has turned this film into a "season to shut down in the middle of the transmission". The only positive thing is that it was a TV movie. I didn't have to waste my hard-earned money on this piece of junk.
