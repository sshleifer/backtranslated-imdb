This revival of the movie marches into a bad film industry and in Saudi Arabia, I want to know how the director was able to stand in front of people in the industry after making this film, the work was so bad, we don't know how the Compagnie cinema Saudis like Rutana and others do not support yang Filmmakers in KSA like the United Arab Emirates We hope that in the future the film industry will prosper in Saudi Arabia But without such an intervention Deceivers and idiots make us bad films do not benefit the reputation of cinema in Saudi Arabia is as the Roman and Iranian cinema At the same time, please creators simple experimental cinema in Saudi Arabia as Abdullah alayaf And others to realize the dream of a good film industry to participate in world festivals away from big companies stupid interventions
