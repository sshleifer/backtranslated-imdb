The acting was terrible, the cheap, fake, cheap green screen effects were ridiculous and the creatures were absolutely retarded. The only positive thing about this film was the concept, and the laughter I had watching such a bad movie - then I got pretty angry because I knew I had wasted 4 dollars to rent it. Why would a film like this ever be in theaters? I know that this film came out almost 5 years ago, but nobody ever made a film? I'm just writing random stuff to fill the space, because I need ten lines of text to post this review. This next line should almost do it. Annnndddddd there!
