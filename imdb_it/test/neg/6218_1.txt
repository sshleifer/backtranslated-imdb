Having avoided seeing the film at the cinema, but buying the DVD for my wife for Christmas, I had to watch it. I didn't expect much, which usually means I got more than I expected. But "Mamma Mia" - absolutely, absolutely cr **. I like ABBA, I like songs, I have old LPs. But this film is simply terrible. The theatrical show seems a bit of a musical, but this runs along with quickly following songs, no characterization, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the DVD extras) are simply thrown away with only half the bodies still on the screen, the Northern European dance choir appears on a small Greek island at will, while the set and number setting would have disgraced Cliff Richard's musicals in the 1960s! Meryl (look at me recite) Streep can't even make his usual assault effective in an exaggerated musical! His big piece - "The Winner Takes It All" - is Meryl at the Met! Note to the director: it should have been filmed in silence with the camera that gradually showed the distance between Streep and Brosnan! Some of the songs are horrible karaoke in the amateur night. The camera can't stop moving like a bad MTV. You can never be satisfied and simply enjoy the music, the enthusiasm and the characters. But what is even worse is how this mess of excre **** has become the highest-grossing film in the UK and the best-selling DVD to boot? Blair, Campbell and New Labor have really reduced the UK to zombies - anyone's critical faculty ???
