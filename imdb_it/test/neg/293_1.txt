Like a terrible cancer that was raining from the sky, I wandered in this shard on some movie channel the other night. Being a fan of bad movies, and actively engaged in buying and watching that bad movie, I was fascinated by the idea of ​​a really terrible-looking action movie from modern times. After it ran out, I discovered that my hands were turning inexplicably against me, grabbing anything in range and stabbing me around the head and neck. There was something sinister in that tape ... err ... where I was ... anyway this is one of the most embarrassing and bad movie pieces I've ever met. William Forsythe cannot play more than one character, and that character is always a walking joke. Even when it is set in a comic background and has given things to do and say they should be funny (wing Deuce Bigalo) it is ridiculous in the wrong way. Erika Eleniak is more or less the same, having acted in her right amount of terrible films and done a terrible job in all of them, she does not fail to help fuck this. The bad classic of the b-movie type Andrew Divoff does a respectable job, but barely has a chewing scenario. Even the reliable standby for the b-movie action Daniel Bernhardt fails to deliver anything to the limit of entertainment. As for the merits of the film, the plot is lame, the script, just like the action and the movement of the plot, is both boring and ... well, stupid, for lack of a better adjective (the gentleman knows that he does not have put any effort into it, why should I?). <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen enough movies has seen bad ones, and anyone who has seen enough villains can learn to appreciate them, but here there is simply nothing to be enjoyed unless you are among the nastiest tolerant to the cinema and you simply feel so inclined to test your courage. But before doing it, take it from me, this isn't even terrible enough to be enjoyed (unlike some ... of the most ridiculous Italian zombie movies). A fan of b-movie actions would be much better if he checked out most of Bernhardt's other films, or pretty much anything else that was ever filmed for that matter. America is simply not the place to go for the action it seems, especially not now. If you have a craving, take a look at everything about the seas, movies like Heroic Duo or the slightly less normal Hakaider (along with anything else in the fantastic Keita Amemiya cannon) will provide much more fun and better action than your talent to find elsewhere, especially here.
