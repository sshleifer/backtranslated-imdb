I bought a DVD collection (9 films for 10 euros) in which this was included. It turned out to be the "full version" whatever it means. In addition to low medium quality and short scenes there was one thing that was really weird, the soft sex scene. It started with a close-up of 2 larger breasts. After about 2 minutes I had an expression on my face that corresponded to the term "boooooooooooooring!" quite perfectly. 7.5 minutes of not even bouncing cement like boobs (at this point the term sine is a bad choice) is far beyond entertainment. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film was more like "people are not / stupid, right? <br /> <br /> Lucky me, the DVD was scratched and I recovered my money.
