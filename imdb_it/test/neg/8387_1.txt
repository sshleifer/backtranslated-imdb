I had the misfortune of seeing this movie recently and having to sit down. A friend bought it for 1 pound and insisted we look at it as it looked good from the back story. <br /> <br /> 10 minutes from the movie it was evident that the actors were amateurs and this was extremely low budget effort. <br /> <br /> The scenes were misinterpreted, the script was stupid and the story contained many scenes that seemed unnecessarily long, only that the film would be a reasonable length. <br /> <For example, when the main character rents a warehouse, the film spends a ridiculous amount of time on this scene, with a meaningless dialogue that serves no real purpose or need. <br /> <br /> The main actor presumably is taking revenge on a woman who sleeps with the boys to give them HIV, he never once thought of being tested. Instead she turns into a mad killer who decides to torture her before killing her and cutting her into pieces. <br /> <br /> If this sounds good and you think this will have a lot of blood, think again. This film has no really gory sequences and is quite docile for this type of film. <br /> <br /> It doesn't scare you, it doesn't make you think, it doesn't offer fast fun. He can still put you to sleep, it is certain that you are bored to tears, so please save yourself from despair and follow my direction. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS FILM 1/2 out of 10 (this doesn't even deserve 1) <br /> <br /> The film was 78 minutes, but it looked like it was 2 1/2 hours.
