Charlie (George "Norm" Wendt) and Rhonda ("Just Say" Julie Brown) are a couple of cheerful and murderous aliens who run aground on Earth and stumble into a small western town. They become deputy sheriffs and dispense a deadly form of justice to speeders, assassins and others as they go to the side of the criminals (led by Wayne Grace). Meanwhile, their sexy alien daughter (Anastasia Sakelaris) arrives in a succinct / shiny dress with her black human husband (Christopher M. Brown) to find them and television journalists and government agents show up to fill the time. <br /> <br /> From what I can tell, this is a deliberate attempt to cover every possible genre (comedy, science fiction, horror, western ...) in a movie, and what a stupid, little fun mess it is, despite the energetic acting of the two stars. The script is definitely atrocious.
