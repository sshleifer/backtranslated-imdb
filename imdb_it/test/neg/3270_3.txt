Every time I watch this movie, blood flows from my eyes. Yes, you read that right: I looked at this unhappy and disgusting thing more than once. <br /> <br /> Caddyshack 2 went wrong for so many reasons: Harold Ramis composing a script and abandoning his duties of direction, Rodney Dangerfield (wisely) moves away from the project because they don't allow him to tinker with the script, Bill Murray shows an excellent judgment and is not part of it, and a puppet is pushed forward as an actor in a cast that deserved much better. <br /> <br /> I can't help but think of Dyan Cannon in this and wonder why she is laughing and smiling all the time. The only conclusion I can draw is that it really is the face of pure evil. Stay with me for a moment. He had to watch as the film joined and amused himself in the agonizing agony that would have inflicted on countless soon to be extremely sorry cinema viewers who would produce this film about them. She may even have been extremely drunk. This is what I need to be right now to wash the disgusting taste of this complete and total failure out of my mind. If I'm lucky, it will be faded forever. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie several times. I blame many of them in childhood and being a very dull and dull boy who apparently had no aesthetic sensibility. Maybe puppets are more fun when you're a child. No, the Muppet show is now more fun ... I think it was boring. Caddyshack 2 is that kind of rare film that is so extraordinarily disappointing on so many levels that you convince yourself after the credits that it couldn't have been as bad as this. Was. IS. With time it will only get worse. <br /> <br /> My reasons for returning to this movie, thankfully, are becoming less and less. Randy Quaid is limited in his role as a lawyer for Jackie Mason. His opening scene is not bad and brought out my only laugh. We see it some other time but it gets tired like the rest of the film and descends with an unfortunate quickness from incidentally fun to a desolate land. Randy Quaid recovers well, and this film owes him a lot of time because if there was a reason to watch this film as something other than a torture tactic, it was him. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is the trick of the movie. He has enough eye-catching qualities that people look at him, I am horrified by what they did to themselves, but later, because the collections were so subtle, they can only remember what actually amused them. Years later they look at him unconsciously again and the cycle repeats itself. <br /> <br /> Jackie Mason takes most of the blame for this movie but, in all honesty, I'm not sure if you deserve it. He's really trying out there but it's impossible not to notice that he spends the whole movie making a performance of Rodney Dangerfield. That's who the film was written for, but I'm not sure he could have saved it either. In the end this fails miserably through a terrible direction, a bad assembly (should we count continuity errors?) And a re-channeling of the same story with none of the humor or heart that made the first film captivating. <br /> <br /> and shouting up to three out of ten instead of two with the determination of Randy Quaid's bulldog. It's not even bad enough to laugh. I've definitely seen worse, but trust in your memory: this is a dog. If you've never seen it, you've made excellent life choices and greet your excellent judgment.
