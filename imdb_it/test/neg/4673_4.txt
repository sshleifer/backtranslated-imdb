Half of the movie is flashing lights and flickering camera. The rest is made up of predictable characters (think of science or government, know-how with respect to authority, etc.) <br /> <br /> What is the worst aspect of this film? They are the machines that are launched in the first 5 minutes, it is the horrible 'Russian' accent of the 'cosmonaut', they are the uninspired characters, the 40 titles of the Top 40 poorly integrated, or the "glass of the United States will save the world" ? No. It is the fact that regardless of the "sad" ending - there is little suspense in this film - we basically know what will happen. <br /> <br /> The only positive part of this film: "American Components, Russian Components: all produced in Taiwan!"
