A friend of mine who has a mysterious ability to find and - horrors! - I like that bad movies recommend watching "The Pest". At the time unaware of how pathetic his taste in movies really was, I decided to try it. <br /> <br /> Bad error. <br /> <br /> The story, though clearly torn from any sixth grade English textbook regarding the "manhunter" theme, would be fun in the right conditions - good actors, writer, director, wardrobe, and so on away and so on until almost the end. Clearly these factors are absent. <br /> <br /> 'The Pest' should be fun, I think. I say "think" because I left nothing but a slight smile for the whole film. Not a laugh, not a laugh, not a laugh, not even a smile. A smile, at best. And this happened so rarely when watching this film, I even remember how often I smiled - maybe 3 or 4 times at most. <br /> <br /> So do yourself a huge favor. Never watch this movie. Avoid at all costs.
