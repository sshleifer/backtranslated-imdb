When Family Guy was first introduced, I was not in a discriminatory mood. With the 1990s containing a series of intelligent and surreal cartoons, why should I be? Nickelodeon has produced Doug; Ren and Stimpy and Rockos Modern Life among other beautiful cartoons (Yes, this includes Spongebob). They had an eccentric and dreamlike animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialogues. The Simpsons have become a real phenomenon, perhaps not as brilliant as its greatest defenders claim, but a great investment of your time and certainly rejects the false axiom that all TV is rubbish. South Park began as a brutal but hilarious attack on everything, with a unique and intelligent satire below. It has evolved to become a Monty Python-esquire show with outrageous concepts and brutal and sharp criticism of society (such as the defense of noble women gnomes) and in the end it was decided to be entirely self-referential and "meta" like the Simpsons, and has unfortunately the shark jumped. Family Guy is superficially like The Simpsons and South Park. Pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts. However, what he has in talkability lacks true spirit. <br /> <br /> The show is famous for its use of gimmicks, especially for flashbacks. Many are references to bad television sitcoms or advertisements. Some are fun (especially from the first two seasons), most are not. Are the references intrinsically fun? I'm not sure, but above all they are what the show is based on, considering that his characters are painfully uninteresting. Where Homer and Bart have fascination, and Cartman has an articulation of self-awareness and pure outrage to support his terrible behavior, Peter Griffin has no excuse. He's just a noisy and hateful pig. Whatever fun comes from his character is just because the writers forget how to be not funny that day. Lois is also very superficial and boring; Meg is a prop, to be abused; Chris is borderline retarded and only occasionally funny, and the two main stars of the show (Stewie and Brian) are so inconsistent in their characterizations that everything is really useless. <br /> <br /> Other tricks I can't do when a character points to something obviously and dwells on it for an unpleasantly long time. It happens a lot lately, and I can't take it anymore. Not only the often mentioned chicken who loves to beat Peter, I'm talking about the painful moments in which they talk about pop culture and break it as if they were alien spectators. It is not ironic or ironic, it is absolutely boring and lifeless. <br /> <br /> It's not like the show can't be fun, in fact some of the previous episodes had turned me around. Highlights include the pilot episode, in which Peter loses touch with reality after losing his precious television; when Pietro zelota's religious father shows up and causes chaos; When Peter becomes a narcotic at Megs school, and the "pancake" episode. I suspect these are the episodes that have accidentally incorporated real human traits in his characters, or simply were times when writers had effective comic inspiration. <br /> <br /> One last thing, the show is not offensive. It's just offensive to those who wouldn't watch the show in the first place, so it's almost like a circular jerk to the hipster choir.
