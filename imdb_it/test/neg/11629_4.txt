Let's go straight. I was raised as a Catholic and in a very religious family and spent a lot of time in church and talking to priests at home. It was useful for two things: to make me a convinced atheist and give me a deep and in-depth knowledge of the Church and its dogmas. And I say: if a Catholic priest witnesses a murder and clearly sees the face of the murderer, he can report it to the police, even if the killer confessed to him later. He cannot reveal what he is told in confession, but he can talk about anything he sees outside of it, and confession is useless for keeping his mouth shut. So, here we have a film entirely supported by a lie. And another lie is that there is no acquittal for murder. According to the Catholic Church, there is an absolution for every sin as long as there is sincere repentance. So far, the biggest plot of this weak thriller. <br /> <br /> As is often said, this film would have improved if Bob Hoskins and Alan Bates had changed roles. Hoskins is naturally suited to playing gangsters (I will never enough to regret losing Al Capone in favor of one of De Niro's weaker performances in "The Untouchables") and Bates's features would have been perfect as the priest with a gray past . But above all, I think the film would have been much better if Liam Neeson (originally unknown to the general public) of the Dutchman made the part of Mickey Rourke. Not only is his face perfect for playing haunted characters, but he would make us believe that the character is real, something that Rourke simply can't. In the 1980s, Rourke was not a bad actor (he later seemed to lose his talent along with his appearance), but he was one of those artists, like Brad Dourif, who is as good as the director he works with. And as a former IRA terrorist, Rourke's acting is more like a pimp. Sad to think, this film was produced only between three and six years later (when Neeson gained moderate celebrity status in 1990 with Sam Raimi's hilarious "Darkman", and the 1993 superstar with "Schindler's List", while Rourke became rather a forgotten-state), Liam and Mickey could have changed the parts with greater benefit (Rourke would have been effective in supporting Docherty, but he cannot bring this film as the protagonist). Yet another missed opportunity, and yet another film with the potential to be a classic, which became instantly forgettable. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the often criticized soundtrack (from the underrated composer Bill Conti) worked for me. I didn't find it too melodramatic, but adequately gritty and beautiful. It reminded me of the Howard Shore soundtrack for "The Silence of the Innocents". Here is the talent of Mike Hodges, who made "Get Carter", yes, but don't forget that it is the mind behind "Flash Gordon" ... <br /> <br /> It seems that the film was massacred in the room cutting (shows how some parts are really discontinuous and confusing, and others simply don't stick) and a Director's Cut is waiting to see the light. OK, but I seriously doubt it will be a fantastic movie, since we will still have the wrong cast and the wrong premises. 4/10.
