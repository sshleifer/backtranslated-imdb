Thanks to the silly horror films like "Troll" and the indescribably atrocious cult-cult "Troll 2", it has become virtually impossible to shoot films with kobolds, gnomes and various other types of small green hobgoblin seriously these days. Only recently did I see the TV movie of the 70s "Do not Be Afraid of the Dark", which is basically a pretty terrifying and serious movie about small domestic goblin monsters, yet I still couldn't help thinking of new on the cretinate potatoes that brought the critters dressed in garbage bags that were unleashed in "Troll 2". The same thing happened to me now. As much as I tried to enter "Inhabited" with a clear mentality, unconsciously I continued to compare the allegedly gruesome and threatening fairies of the garden with the badly sculpted goblins of Nilbog! Yet, even without all the prejudices, "Inhabited" is a straight-forward, fun and submissive horror film. It is a pastiche of cheese, soft and politically correct of the family drama and mythology of Northern Europe. The annoying little killer creatures in this movie are not the ordinary mediocre goblins; I'm "The Huldre": evil Norwegian demons living underground and trying to drive happy families out of their homes by influencing younger children. This surpasses the Russell family as they move into their rundown dream home in a small remote town. MILF's blonde and cherubic daughter Megan Gallagher starts acting weird every time she stops in the pretty playhouse in the back of the garden. He claims his friends are fairies, and even though the sinister handyman warns of strange episodes in the past, Gina's parents simply think she has trouble adjusting to her new neighborhood. When he continues to shake the fairies, he makes an appointment with the acclaimed psychologist Dr. Werner while "The Huldre" is slowly coming out of their botanical shelter. Not very special to mention here. The pace is acceptable and attempts to accumulate suspense are pretty nice. You understand that this is a horror film suitable for families, so no sequence of murders is shown graphically here. Hell, even the corpse of the family's domestic cat is kept off the screen. This is yet another senseless horror film in which Malcolm McDowell appears, which practically always represents an unreliable, greedy and self-centered authority figure.
