Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King! And this is a good film about everything. The rabid Cujo is very scary and the film is full of suspense. But after the first few minutes that poor Donna and her little son Tad were held captive in their Pinto by the rabid Saint Bernard, I began to wonder why she didn't do something to help herself. <br /> <br /> He could have pushed his foot out of the door and pushed the car backwards (I mean, it was a Pinto for Pete and they were on a descent) and rolled to safety, but then it would have been a short film . When he started the car, did he fire it backwards and hoped he could at least partially get off the driveway? No, she tries to make a three-point turn in a car with a bad alternator. She managed to get out of the car and look for about 45 seconds at some point to try to reach a baseball bat lying on the ground nearby - what a waste of time! I mean, if you're going to run for the bat, do it and at least you'll have something to hit the dog with. But forget the bat. Weren't there tools in the car, like an iron or something? I didn't see her look at the spare tire of the car. Really, why wait until you are bitten and weak from dehydration and your child is having seizures before taking a stand against the animal? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film she was battered and torn, but God was still wearing high heels!
