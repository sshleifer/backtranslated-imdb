Defining a boring movie is not something I usually consider a valid criticism. However, when a film is crassly made up of spare parts from other films that were not so good to begin with, and is as slow as treacle without a real reward, I think it's fair to call things by their name. And The Ghost is a very boring film. <br /> <br /> A film that is as original as its name, The Ghost tells the story of a young girl with an amnesia haunted by a ghost who holds the secret of her past. Only, it's much more complicated and less interesting than you might think. <br /> <br /> The plot is almost incomprehensible for most of the photos and the hook, the element of amnesia, only makes things worse. It seems that no one, including the writer and director, has the slightest idea what the hell is going on at any given time. Instead they chose to do what roughly equates to the film equivalent of a sitcom show. There are scenes taken directly from Ringu, Dark Water, Shutter, The Grudge series and a smattering of Pulse for good measure. To make matters worse, half a dozen women bring everyone to dress and read their lines in the same way, making them impossible to distinguish. <br /> <br /> There's really nothing to hold onto with this movie. The story is not so well thought out. The device of amnesia is lazy. The mysterious element is not engaging and managed with little grace. The characters never deduce anything, all the information is just distributed through the protagonist, remembering his past whenever it's convenient for the plot. <br /> <br /> Cinematography, full of reflections and shots of water, at least attempts to add to the subtext, a thematic connection with amnesia and the final twist (which I will not reveal) is beautiful, but often exaggerated. Even the score seems to be borrowed and clich√©. <br /> <br /> Worse still, the curse action is not very interesting and the final turn is predictable and lame. "Wait, do you mean a character that has 15 minutes of screen time but doesn't seem to have anything to do with the plot back at the end? No!" The public is too experienced for this type of tripe. Anyone who has seen one of the films this rips will find little to keep them awake with this feature. I used to think that Shimizu was the bottom of the barrel for this kind of shit (redoing his grudge movie no less than 5 times), but also his second job as Reincarnation, a movie I couldn't even complete, is miles ahead to this. <br /> <br /> For more reviews visit www.collider.com
