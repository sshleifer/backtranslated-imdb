Another son of Sam is definitely not an Oscar. Technically, it's horrible. The acting is not too good either. But there is something that makes you want to look more (a kind of wreck of a car). The ridiculous close-ups of the assassins' eyes are more fun than anything else. If you're looking for a scare ... this is not the movie for you. It's very dark and almost impossible to find. I'm sure there's a reason for this. For a while, it was called HOSTAGE. No matter how you call it, it's still a poor choice for entertainment. It could be good for an MST3000 party or something. Can you believe they will use a title like ANOTHER SON OF SAM? If this has no written exploitation everywhere, I will eat my hat. I remember when it was filmed in Belmont, North Carolina. Many local personalities have been used as talent.
