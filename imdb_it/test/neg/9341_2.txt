I grew up in the 90s; therefore, you have to understand that I saw first the first of the biggest DCOMs. I was there when Brink! appeared, Zenon, Halloweentown, Johnny Tsunami, etc. These films are my childhood. When these films arrived, not only myself, but whoever I was watching them would have been completely intimidated for an hour and a half, we'll talk about it for the week to come and resume next weekend. I don't think words can express the amount of excitement that Zoog Disney has brought. <br /> <br /> Even when I look at them now, the dialogue doesn't seem so bad (so effective in fact, that I actually remember parts of conversations literally word for word, from movies I've seen over ten years ago). The characters are believable, amusing, granted a little stereotyped but this is what makes the charm of Disney ... <br /> <br /> I sat my little brother in front of the Disney channel to try to transmit and make him understand my feelings for DCOM. Log in stuck in the suburbs ... my brother looked at me a little perplexed, wondering if I was always gay. I feel more disappointed and betrayed now than, what could I compare this to, when Han Solo discovered that Lando was selling it to Vader ... <br /> <br /> Half the film, and I am not exaggerating, is a flashback. There is no talent in these young actors (some of whom are older than me). The plot is ridiculous; it seems that a group of decaying old people at Disney sat around a table and asked "How can we look fashionable for these young people?" OK, maybe all the DCOMs were like that, but at least they made a little effort not to let us know that they think we're complete idiots. <br /> <br /> And apparently this type of film works ... Stuck in the Suburbs is valued almost like Zenon or Airborne. How is it possible? Have DCOMs even improved and people prefer them now? (although apparently the lack of swear words is enough to give him 10/10 for some people) Christ, it's a completely different generation.
