I work in the office during the weekend and there is a TV that receives only ONE channel. So, I have no chance to turn to something better. I keep it on, though, because it provides a little background noise. Sometimes, I get a decent movie / show. Not today. Today I received "Breaker Breaker". The city looks like a third set of tariffs (which, of course, is). All the actors and villains seem to have just graduated from stunt school. I saw better dramatic enactments at a carnival. The special effects (the flames at the end of the film are more false than Michael Jackson's masculinity). Even the horse at the end of the film was a terrible actor ... A film poorly interpreted, badly shot, badly written.
