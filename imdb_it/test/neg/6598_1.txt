The writers and creators of this film should be sued ... To pollute the world with this shit! "Man In The Mirror" is actually beyond horrible! Away, far, far beyond! <br /> <br /> ... and the people, I'm not just saying this because I'm a fan of Michael Jackson! Or the fact that this is truly one of the most retarded depictions of his life I've ever met! <br /> <br /> I say this because it's a waste of time, money and celluloid! I'm ashamed of having just seen it all! This is 1 hour and 26 minutes of my life, I will never come back! I'm telling you; watching the grass grow is literally more fun than this movie! <br /> <br /> Consider yourself warned!
