An annoying and talented American documentary filmmaker discovers a legendary South African monster, Half-Caste. Tradition says that it is a creature half human and half leopard with the parallel closest to that of the werewolf of the European tradition. Rather than focusing on the creature, the film follows the intricacies of the film crew. There is little action or suspense in the film until late. This problem is exacerbated by numerous irritating characters who generate an incessant amount of even more irritating speeches. The basic premise is wasted as it is set aside by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the director was influenced by the approach of The Blair Witch Project (1999) or The Last Broadcast (1998). Regardless, the film fails at most levels. Avoid at all costs.
