This movie goes beyond Horrible AVOID ALL COSTS !! I want my hour and 20 minutes back !!! <br /> <br /> EVERYONE is not funny, you can watch this movie without laughing or even smiling once. Swears comes out of the speakers like a waterfall, each one becomes more annoying as the last one, and does not contribute to the comedy O plot (general comedy - not this film in general!). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a lame ish movie - a $ 5, watered-down-type - "Out Cold" - but terribly terrible. The film focuses around two groups of a city: Poems and Richies (how is that so obviously?), Where the two opposites face snowboarding battles with one another. (the story is very similar to the story of a 4-year-old child's bed without all the swearing and stupid jokes) <br /> <br /> MOVIE - 1/10 - because you can't give lower scores
