Great concept, perfect characterizations and voices, but a complete waste of time. A pity given that he had aimed higher, probably it would not have been the bomb he was (he is); too dependent on the scatological mood, for beginners. I am amazed by the comments of the "educated" reviewers referring to the "good science" behind this piece of childish trash. Unlike "In Search of Nemo", where (with a little suspension of disbelief) attention to detail was staggering and science was as good as the context would have allowed, "Osmosis Jones" was an absolute nonsense ; don't fool yourself with science. Humor was aimed at eight-year-olds, but the themes were better suited to some unsophisticated teenagers.
