They do it ... Every sequel is the worst. You, who think that Ghoulies 2 or 3 need a 1, please look at this sequel ... You must be wondering with the first three parts. Then you will give a 10 to the first, 8 to the second and 5 or 6 to the other. This is because Ghoulies 4 really gets the big 1 (from me it does).
