The film contains a very short scene of Deneuve in a bathtub. It looks absolutely stunning for a 56-year-old woman, but that's the only thing that saves the film. Otherwise, he has a senseless and unmotivated script and the lead actress does not have the charm of Deneuve. The director has apparently seen too many films by Peter Greenaway and Pola X runs into the imitation of a student Greenaway style, without any inspiration.
