Unbelievable. Great cast, honest acting, interesting plot. <br /> <br /> But this film has graphic cruelties that are not tense or provocative, just pure disturbing unruhe. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Everyone could see anomalous returns coming to their habits. And that Robert Englund was acting (was he?) Like an idiot; forbid your daughter to sleep with a football player, but he is trying to kill an idiot and like kiddypr0n okay ?! <br /> <br /> The policeman that his daughter was kidnapped - did anyone consider himself a policeman and not an actor? Not me. This film goes on and on with an ending that we see in other horror films: if the returns were good, a second part could be made. Ugly, really bad stuff. It might give some inspiration ...
