When I attended college in the early 1970s, it was a simpler time. Except for a brief event in 1994, I have since been totally free from the influence of illegal substances and have never regretted it until now. DB: TBTE must be, hands free, the best film to watch when stoned. The strange dreamlike state that it creates is very strange when you don't smoke anything, but I'm sure it would seem completely normal after a big doobie. (Not that I'm recommending this, you understand.) The reassuring narrative provided, as it usually is in quality cinema, by a TB victim trapped in a painting, would be ideal to help the stoned spectator to follow while things they get complicated. Moreover, everything in the film is quite organic ... from the old natural breasts to the fried chicken bucket. <br /> <br /> Now, there is no doubt even that the young man with the hand (ahem) "problem" is absolutely surfing the movie. At some point, you only know that he is going to say "Hey! When I move my hand, leave some tracks !!" Trust me ... you'll know when you get to that point. <br /> <br /> The only other thing we have to face is this: how good can a film be when at least half of the budget has been spent moving a huge bed frame for indoor and outdoor shots? <br /> <br /> Definitely a must-see for horror fans, but suitable for the general public in the right conditions (if you know what I mean, and I think you do). Earn only four stars because I can't say that it took talent.
