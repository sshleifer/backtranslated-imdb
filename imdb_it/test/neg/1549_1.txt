For a while it seemed that this show was 24/7. Apparently, there has been a second season or some other kind of continuation of this horrible show about the two most cowardly and presumptuous ones ever filmed. All the other comments have perfectly captured the essence of these two selfish, haggish, airheads. Not much can be said about them other than what everyone else has said. <br /> <br /> I doubt that these two women have a soul, and more than likely have made a kind of Faustian agreement to get their shining face a television series. May the destinies protect the human race from any other exposure to the Ghastly Girls!
