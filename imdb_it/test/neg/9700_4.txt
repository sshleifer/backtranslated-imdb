While the new movie Pride & Prejudice is gorgeous to watch and the soundtrack is adorable, we do not see Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The film is for some reason set in the early 1790s, rather than in the Regency period in which the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. Bennets' Longbourn estate is chained and resembles Cold Comfort Farm. Yet the Bennets in the novel are of noble class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor the manure hay and the chicken droppings next to the house. The scenes are reset by the novel and, not to forget, Jane Austen has included scenes in some locations for a reason. For example, the film puts the scene of Darcy's great proposal outside in a storm in front of a neoclassical temple, unlike the canonical of Collins: why did Jane Austen put it in the rectory? Because while Lizzy and Darcy speak with total, if brutal mutual honesty in this scene, the Collins have never shared an honest word. Why rain and the external proposal? It seems that Jane Eyre meets Rochester! And when Elizabeth crosses a windy field to climb a cliff and see the view, she is expected to cry "Heathcliffe" at any time! Austen was Bronteized! Judy Dench is a GREAT actress, but Lady Catherine should be tall and surprising. Little Tom Hollander is a brilliant actor: but Mr. Collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy-looking, which suggests that his terrible dance with poor Lizzy is elephantine. Matthew MacFayden is another of my favorites of MI-5 on A & E; in P & P, however, it is more the young Heathcliffe, he never smiles - although Austen observes in the novel that Darcy smiles at Lizzy quite a bit, and realizes it when he sees his wonderful smiling portrait at Pemberley in this film it is for some reason replaced by a sculpted marble bust. And much of Austen's dialogue has changed into modern discourse. Mr. Bingley has become such a clown that one wonders why Darcy wanted him as a friend and why Jane Bennet loved him. The bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and listen to, it deviates from the novel by Jane Austen so much that every student who looked at it, thinking they could replace the vision for reading, would fail!
