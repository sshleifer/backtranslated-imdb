I have read many hopes of readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of the story of Nora Roberts. Not having read the book, I don't know if this adaptation was faithful, but I know it wasn't good. In fact, the script was the best part of the film, so congratulations to Nora Roberts. <br /> <br /> I planned ahead and looked at Carolina Moon because of Claire Forlani. I've never been sure if she's a good actress. She has been decent in some movies, average in others and really bad at that. But Forlani was not alone. The performances were everywhere. Oliver Hudson was wooden and boring. Josie Davis was an Amazon. Then, in the midst of all this B-rate play, there's Jacqueline Bisset! He didn't have much else to do but portray bitterness, but even through sleep, he was miles ahead of the others. <br /> <br /> Again, Forlani remains one of the most beautiful women in cinema and I was not disappointed in that ability here. I believe that Forlani can be more than a pleasure for the eyes but, until it turns into a good performance in a good film, it continues to excel in this. And I will continue to look faithfully at everything in which he participates. Fandom is fun that way. <br /> <br /> However, this movie, Carolina Moon, was pretty bad. In addition to bad acting (false accents of the South are really distracting) the direction was pedestrian. It wasn't horrible. It was the boring caliber made for the TV you're used to seeing on Lifetime. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of one of the stars you can probably have fun with Carolina Moon for this reason, I did it. If you are a fan of the book, you may enjoy viewing the story on the screen, albeit in a lackluster form. Otherwise, this film is irrelevant.
