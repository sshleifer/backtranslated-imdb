** It could be considered a slight spoiler, but not more than in someone else's review of this film. ** <br /> <br /> I knew that nothing could have conceived to the absolute splendor of the original "Carrie", which was more a film about social criticism than about the gym fire. Carrie White was an incarnate "victim", and her story conveyed the powerlessness that must be perceived by the real exploited. <br /> <br /> Whoever conceived the character of "Rachel" for "The Rage" must have completely lost the subtleties of "Carrie" ". In order for the public to sincerely share the anger of the victim, he must be a sympathetic character - a real outcast who is more a victim of circumstances than his own vices. Rachel is completely too unpleasant to convey any kind of emotional depth and connection to "Carrie" by Sissy Spacek. And look and act like she should be right next to the "brigade attractive and popular "that ends up burning. She, like everyone else, has an equally corrupt soul, while Carrie was completely innocent. <br /> <br /> It just doesn't work. There's no satisfaction in seeing the beautiful ones children - not even the boy "Home Improvement" - to be seen in the culminating scene of this film. And it is so unnecessarily bloody! There was no real bloodshed seen in the burning gym! <br /> <br /> And c ' one person in particular that this film should NOT having the audacity to kill ... but I will not say who it is. If you've seen the original "Carrie", it's the kind of character who dies unjustly. <br /> <br /> At least they created the connection to Carrie appropriately; it is explained how it should have been. But that, and the arm tattoo, which was done quite well, is just the one thing this movie has in store for him. <br /> <br /> Yet another heinous "Scream" knock-off, and tinges the reputation of one of the most compelling films ever made. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10. I didn't expect much, but I was still horribly disappointed. An indifferent character, a series of irritating references to pop culture thrown in for no good reason, and a final scene that pales in comparison to Carrie's "tombstone".
