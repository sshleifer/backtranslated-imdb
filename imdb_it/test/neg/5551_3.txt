I've discussed enough about what rating to give this because it's my favorite Herschell film Gordon Lewis so far different from The Gruesome Twosome, but he has the best acting I've seen in a Lewis movie. However, we all know that he is not saying much. Once the film was finished, I was happy because I felt like I was sitting in a 4-hour movie, even though it was only 82 minutes long. I'm trying to see all the HGL movies and that's probably the only reason to see this. <br /> <br /> Blood is good as usual, the only thing that Herschell seemed to be right. The acting is ugly as usual with one exception. This exception is Frank Kress. Now, should I say he's a good actor? In no way, but it is good compared to all the others. The story is boring and flat and does not go where and in the end, I don't care what happened just as long as it is finished. I know this is a cult classic, but I didn't like it very much. I hope you will.
