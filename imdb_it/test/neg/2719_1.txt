radio is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen, while at the same time it's one of the worst. It made me laugh in the places where you had to cry, and it made me shiver when you had to laugh. it lacked any kind of character development that is usually crucial for a sentimental film that is this. some questions, because the character of Harris took the radio under his wing, this was not explained correctly, and I am sure that their relationship (which is the main aspect of the film) is the most useless if ever seen. <br /> <br /> who continues to employ Cuba Gooding, is a lousy actor and should be heavily taunted until he takes another line of work. <br /> <br /> as true stories go, this is not so interesting. the reason why I said it's one of the best movies I've ever seen, is because, despite being complete, I still liked it. laughing at the script and most of the monologues that are really the work of both are idiot or someone very intelligent who tries to show how easy it is to release a lousy movie about a retard that becomes everyone's favorite joke. the fact is that the character of Cuba is a comedy meat for people who watch football matches.
