This, in my opinion, is a very poor film that advertises Arnold Schwarzenegger as the protagonist (despite being the co-star) just to sell more copies. Obviously, taking inspiration from the Conan films with a similar theme, this film fails to prove pleasant and in the end fails to entertain at all. <br /> <br /> Bridgette Neilsen plays Sonja, a beautiful woman who was given incredible strength by a ghostly figure after her village was sacked, her family killed and she herself raped by Queen Gedran's soldiers (Sandahl Bergman). Gedran is a tyrant queen who wants control of the barbarian world and seeks a talisman protected by Sonja's sister to do so. After discovering what happened, Sonja prepares for revenge and at the same time must save the world from the wrath of Gedran. Kalidor (Schwarzenegger), the master of the talisman, proposes to protect her whether she wants it or not. <br /> <br /> The first big problem with this film is the beginning. The events that led to the point where Sonja receives her powers could easily have taken ten to fifteen minutes of funny movie. However, the beginnings are rushed into what seems like a quick one minute "Previously in ??." segment from a television show. If they had actually turned these events into a part of the story and then partially filled up, they could have started to redeem this film, but unfortunately they didn't (I wonder why director Richard Fleischer only directed two Red Sonja films). <br /> <br /> This movie also features some of the most annoying characters in history like Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) who is a stupid character and simply adds an excessive amount of field to the film, which sometimes works but in this case fails miserably. It was clearly written in the film for some comic relief, but with the general absurdity of the film, however, this was another expensive mistake for "Red Sonja". <br /> <br /> For all the flaws there were some good fighting scenes involving both Neilsen and Arnie which is worth noting, but these are nowhere enough to save this turkey. The acting is almost as good as that of the films of this quality and even Arnie didn't seem too worried about his performance. I absolutely don't recommend this movie; for me it's a waste of an hour and a half. My vote for ?? Red Sonja '?? 3/10
