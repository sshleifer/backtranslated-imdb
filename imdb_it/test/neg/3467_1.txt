Many negative reviews here focus on the historical accuracy of this film. OK, you've had so much to do with the current NFL as your average war movie has to do with a real war, or a Western has to do with the real "old west". So, I think we should give them a pass for the artistic license on that. <br /> <br /> The problem here is that the director (Clooney) apparently thinks that making a dejected comedy means a) doing stupid things, b) a camera cup, and c) taking stupid scenes full of aggression and stretch them too long. Screwball's comedies need a fast pace, not necessarily a hectic one, but they move quickly at all times. Here, things drag, drag and drag. After watching this movie, he will show you how brilliant Mack Sennett was when he was practically the pioneer of the genre with his Keystone Cops. After 90 years, you would think that the directors would have studied the old masters and learned a thing or two, maybe even improved things a little. But no, it is as if someone had seen an automobile pioneer build a Duesenberg, and almost a century later, he paid tribute and "improved" the concept by putting together a wagon for children with square wheels. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed many of Clooney's films, I consider him a talented actor. But very few actors can orient themselves competently; In particular, Clint Eastwood took a while to figure out how it works. Clooney is clearly at the bottom of a very steep slope. The film becomes more watchable during the few times it is out of frame, but when it is in the picture, it puts itself at the center of attention. In the fight scenes, his robbery is so hateful that you want someone to really hit him. <br /> <br /> If you are doing a debauched comedy and want some romance, you need to develop some chemistry between the male and female lead. Clooney and Zellweger have all the chemistry of the dumpster pair sitting in a parking lot. No spark, no sizzle, not even a post-mortem spasm. Zellweger, who also made some good films, must have mistaken his botox injections for oak tannins, giving an extraordinarily wooden performance. He could only have done a "hard in a world of men" act if only once, while trying to test the boys, he had looked into the camera with a half smile and shone in his eyes. But no, he kept his jockstrap tight until the end. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest sin here is that the film simply isn't fun. Doing stupid things is not the same thing as slapstick. Doing stupid things in a very inventive way, like the Stooges, or very athletically, like Buster Keaton, can be fun. But otherwise it's boring and, well, stupid. I think I got a good laugh from the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this. I saw it for free via cable, and I still wanted my money back.
