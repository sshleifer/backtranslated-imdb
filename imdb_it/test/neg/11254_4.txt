Conquerer of Shamballa shows what happens when the creators of an Anime can't figure out what their fans want. As a fan, I didn't want a 1920 Nazi movie. What I would have liked to see is a real final showdown between Ed and Dante, because we don't REALLY know what happened to her. I also wanted to bring Ed back to his world much earlier and let him stay there, to finally have the chance to be normal. You know, raising a family with a certain blond mechanic, that kind of thing. No, instead, I had a twisted plot composed of Nazi mystics, Fritz Lang and about ten minutes from Al, a joke of a Cameo by Roy Mustang and a single joke by Armstrong, a short joke and no Winry that hit Ed with wrench. Above all, I didn't feel like Fullmetal Alchemist for me.
