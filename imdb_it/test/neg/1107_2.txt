One of the few reasons for making these top films is to give an actor the chance to act in better films if the acting is good. The only positive thing in this film is acting, the three female protagonists are better than most horror movies like this. There are 2 scenes that can cause an unexpected jump. <br /> <br /> Young children usually crawl through holes and lay down dynamite to explode mines. When one collapses causing a cave in all the children die, becoming zombies. The adults in the mine remain dead, there are no reasons why children become meat eaters. When they were still alive, they seemed terrified in front of the cave, innocent, so they must get angry with any adult who exploits them in the mines (just a reason that comes to mind). <br /> <br /> A mother and her two daughters move into a house near the mine, along with a land devol who wants to build a resort and another of those creepy people who seem to know exactly what's going on, but no one believes it. <br /> <br /> Nothing new here, you are usually clich√©, predictably, many negative aspects for this film, very few positive aspects.
