The Brave One is about a New York radio host named Erica Bain (Jodie Foster). His life is a dream that lives in the city where he grew up and loves. He has his great boyfriend David (Naveen Andrews), who is planning to marry. But one night, while Erica and David are out walking with their dog, they are attacked and robbed by a group of degenerates, leaving David dead. Erica recovers, but her heart is broken and traumatized later, and she can barely cope with real life. Buy a gun for a guy on the streets to protect himself. But one day he goes shopping in a shop, and a man comes in and shoots the dead salesman. That's when Erica shoots and kills this man, and becomes a vigilante. Kill anyone trying to threaten or harm you or others. At the same time Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard) is tracking down this elusive unknown killer, and in the process becomes Erica's friend. Erica starts to regain her sanity while killing these violent people, but she is not sure what she is doing is right or not. And as she and Mercer approach, he doesn't even realize that the unknown killer assailant is right next to him. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster offers a very good performance in The Brave One. It brilliantly portrays this kind of violent and morally corrupt character. Terrence Howard is also exceptional in this film. Both have excellent chemistry together and strengthen the film to a certain level. The Brave One is visually original and conveys a brilliant photographic work, but not everything works beautifully. The scenes in which Erica is absolutely traumatized and fearful of coming out of her door to face the world. The camera swung back and forth on the sides in an almost dreamlike way, and really captured the moment with essence. While almost every time Erica killed someone, everything just had to go in slow motion and show her facial expressions with precise details. The slo-mo was used correctly when Erica committed her first murder. But why keep doing this almost every time he commits a murder? The camera work creates a fantastic atmosphere in most of the film, but some scenes here are simply exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The Brave One focuses on how these murders affect Erica emotionally. Her boyfriend is killed by a group of thugs, and suddenly his love for New York is turned upside down. He realizes that there is a dark side to his beloved city, and he says it on his radio program. I don't completely understand this though. Erica behaves as if she had never realized that violence can happen at night in the city, and this is rather stupid. If she lived there all her life, she had to be blind or very unaware. Even Erica seems to be a glutton for inhuman and murderous people. He doesn't even have to go looking for them, they just have to come to her as if they were asking to be killed for their wrong behavior. The Brave One deals with morality and the correct use of violence in the beginning, and then suddenly glorifies it. The ending is very negative and completely immoral and inhuman. He also denies the purpose of the character of Terrence Howard, that the film spends so much time trying to develop evenly, and suddenly his morality turns around. The moral in The Brave One was very fractured and in the end it was simply shattered everywhere. So is violence okay? Is it a good thing to commit murder as long as it's for revenge? I almost refuse to believe it. Do you know why? Because I have a conscience, which surely this film lacks. It is not right to take the life of another person, no matter how bad they are, or how much you hate them. Erica Bain intends to stop these wicked, but in the end is no better than the horrible people she kills. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard provide a lot of strength for this film. The Brave One contains a strong message, but that message is both immoral and wrong. This film may seem cute, well acted and intelligently strong. But it gets quite rotten at the end. I give The Brave One to 1.5 out of 4. The message is very out of line and morally incorrect, and in reality it cannot be saved by good acting.
