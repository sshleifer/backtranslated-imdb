This film is pleasantly fun if you neglect to recognize its many plot inconsistencies and its absolute lack of credibility. Bruce Willis in the role of "The Jackal" never seems to live up to his reputation as the brilliant mind of the underworld. Instead, he mumbles in broad daylight, parading a jumble of shoddy disguises. Because this man has never been captured before (or even identified) is beyond me. Not once is the public impressed by his intelligence or audacity; considering the price it requires for its services (an exorbitant $ 70 million), its methods are decidedly low budget and stupid. <br /> <br /> As for those who are looking for him, they are at least as ridiculous in their behavior. They show no sense of experience, instead they rely on semi-cooked conjectures that send them around the country at their leisure. Incredibly, these unlikely assumptions (perhaps he bought a boat, perhaps he is in Chicago, etc. etc.) inevitably bring them directly to the Jackal, who once again escapes their clumsy grasp. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere, whose Irish accent fades in and out of a distant radio station, plays the inexplicable role of a prisoner who is released from prison to work alongside the FBI. In reality he is a compatible partner, if only because his means are amateur and inept like his professional friends. At some point, he actually faces the infamous Jackal, but unfortunately the FBI, even if he trusts him enough to leave him out of their sight, fails to equip him with a weapon or any means of communication. What kind of operation are they running here? <br /> <br /> The film seems too dependent on the gruesome violence, which is completely superfluous and does not provide any suspense whatsoever. The apparently furtive jackal behaves more like a demented and senseless serial killer, eliminating people for sport and writing on the cheek of the victim with blood. <br /> <br /> The action scenes of the film are both predictable and unrealistic and many moments are ruined by melodrama. This film is poorly executed on many levels, the only bright spot is the always consistent Sidney Poitier. Avoid this movie if you want to think while watching it. <br /> <br />
