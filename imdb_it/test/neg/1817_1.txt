I heard that last night's episode was slow and a little boring at times. I honestly don't think he has to do anything with writing. Because I know the story was well organized and tried to keep things right. I thought it wasn't so bad, but overall I didn't like it. Most of the blame has to do with the director of that episode, Stephen Williams. I always hated Stephen Williams directing. If Jack Bender continued with this episode of the premiere of the season, he would keep it at a good pace and keep things moving to keep things interesting. I'm glad that Jack Bender is directing next week's episode and it will be much better and I'm glad he had the first episode of Syaid to direct and I'm curious what he'll do this time since Stephen Williams directed too many Syaid episodes before. <br /> <br /> I still think that Stephen Williams needs to be thrown out of the show. It doesn't do anything interesting on the show. <br /> <br /> Why does the opening have to be done with a lens while in the helicopter? It was so BORING! Even the bad perspective of the camera works!
