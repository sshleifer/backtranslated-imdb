If you live in the suburbs, you're relatively well-off financially and don't have much contact with city life in England, then this is the comedy for you. It is not something that a mass audience could want, but if you are like these characters they show you that you will like them very much. Altogether this is a comedy that BBC snobs will sit laughing for their pleasure and only for a select few. Comparing it with the BBC Comedys such as Only Fools and Horses, Fawlty Towers, Black Adder and other classics, this series tends to move away from the normal BBC product for the public and deliver to a rather popular culture.
