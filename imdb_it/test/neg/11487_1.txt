It will be difficult to make this fill 10 lines ... But don't try it (just to prevent others from making the same mistake I did - watch this movie (horrible and boring). <br /> <br /> I like it Patrick swayze - did an excellent performance in films like Ghost - Dirty Dancing - Point Break - North & South (TV series), but in this film ..... ARGH .... This film is so booooooring, the acting is horrible - the script sucks - well ... I can't even find an excellent thing, nothing, absolutely NOTHING I was watching it with two other friends and we all agree that this was one of the most boring movies that we've ever seen, and the fact that it lasts more than 3 hours (which we didn't know) - when part 1 was over and we said "to continue", we almost cried "nooooooooooooo, we have to watch 90 more minutes of this movie !!!! ". <br /> <br /> It is painful to see this film: at no time do you get the impression that he is Actors are Russian, action scenes are extremely negative. when TH The truck explodes at the beginning of the movie! The rest is CRAP! GO to clean the toilet, instead of watching this movie (and don't run, crying if you see this movie - you were pre-warned!) I would personally recommend to Patrick Swayze to call his agent and have them remember this movie - so bad.
