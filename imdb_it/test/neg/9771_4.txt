What a pain! Pain in the form he had promised in his central idea, but he never fully recognized it and continues to blow a sack of sand in his face. I wouldn't say that this South African / Canadian / British horror film is really horrible, but it's too trivial, predictable and there's only a small, memorable memory. It is a guarantee that you will forget it, not too much after having seen it. I tried to watch it last night, but I had to finish it in the morning because I couldn't keep my eyes open. Even then I couldn't remember where I approached, which left me looking at it from the beginning again. The only thing that reached an agreement was Andreas Poulsson's clear cinematography of the vast, rugged and mysterious places of the desert. A beautifully polished chic creates a surprising visual sense, which cannot save the film from that empty general feeling. Everything else is below par and almost comes off. Like the grating revelation of the beast. Huh. The special effects generated by the computer of the threatening monster are tolerable and there are some horrible flashes of stripped flesh and bones. But there is too little, as it does not hide the fact that the clich√©d script wants to reflect on the generic conflict of the characters to create tension and uncertainty. It would be nice if the withered script was something more than a simple, superficial down, because it never generated any strong and lasting suspense, but makes it uninteresting. The main characters are superficial and the symbolic support falls in the dispensable basket. It's your stereotypical deck. The performances of Scott Bairstow and Warrick Grier are colorless and the beautiful Rachel Shelley tries but looks rather tired.
