The back of my DVD describes the plot of "El Chucabra": after his capture in the desert, the legendary blood-thirsty creature Chupacabra flees to the city creating confusion and panic. While chasing the deadly beast, an animal control officer and scientist Dr Starlina Davide realizes that a vigilante with his suspicious plan is also tracing the elusive killer for a mysterious research facility run by the diabolical Dr. Goodspeed. This putrid horror film is a bit funny if you look at it under the influence of alcohol. The script is completely silly, the acting is wooden beyond imagination and the direction is amateur. Two Chupacabra rubber suits are easily the best thing about this movie.3 out of 10 and this is extremely nice.
