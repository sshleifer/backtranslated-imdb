I'm really at a loss about how someone can give this movie a 10 (or even more than 2!). It is full of bad lines, bad acting, bad slap, etc. I never thought of seeing a worse acting than the scenes intentionally performed at the beginning of UHF, but it was so. And just when you think it can't get worse, it does! Again and again! Could you have seen it in a theater? It was not worth watching on TV! Someone loved my 4 and 1 year old, but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was almost never turned on.
