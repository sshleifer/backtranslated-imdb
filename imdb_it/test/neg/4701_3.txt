this western / musical / comedy is not one of the best of the genre I've seen. I found it too slow. I just trudged to the end inevitable. I also found it disjointed. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Randolph Scott is the headliner here, and Lloyd Bridges is also the protagonist. , as it does in this photo I also liked Ann Dvorak in the role of Rita. besides, I can't think much about recommending this film. The film is based on a novel by Ernest Haycock, who also wrote the novel Stagecoach, which became crazy in a film of the same name in 1939, and remade in 1966 and again in 1986. The 1939 version of Stagecoach, is in my mind, one of the best films ever made. However, as for the city of Abilene, my vote is a 3/10.
