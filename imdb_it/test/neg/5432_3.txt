This was a highly publicized film before its release, but it turned out to be a real disaster. I've never talked to a person who has ever liked this movie. I agree: I didn't like it either. Perhaps one of the main reasons why it was not a box office success was the fact that he had nothing but unattractive characters in history. <br /> <br /> For a little while - I don't know if this is still true - I didn't have it. <br /> <br /> And this, and a stupid story, make this movie a big disappointment, especially considering that big accumulation. Did the filmmakers, with such a stupid dialogue, really think this would be a success?
