So ... this is what passes as high art for the likes of SXSW Film Festival and Sundance, eh? Well, I suppose I could relate as long as history, script, dialogue, acting (except for Mrs. Aselton), filmmaking and editing are completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I remember telling other movie friends a few years ago that the biggest problem with digital videos was that we would have to go through a future shitty sea to get to everything that was worth see now that anyone and his brother (or brothers in the Duplass case) could finish and make a movie. "The chair swells". Do I have to say anything else? <br /> <br /> This feature film video is another chapter in the eerie and ever-expanding world of "dudeology" films; young guns armed with DVX100A, a few thousand dollars, a hastily written, superficial script, and some friends who call actors who decide one afternoon to make a film and voila!, producers of instant videos. Don't get me wrong - I'm all about independent cinema (for example, Hollywierd sucks). But having said that, one cannot argue with some of the realities of that system. <br /> <br /> If Duplass Brothers had to go out and have a real budget and bring real producers, it is clear that a script like this would never have been illuminated by greenery! And here is the problem. There is no longer a control procedure for obtaining films (sorry ... videos) ready for production. Just take a DV / P2 video camera and go! And what makes it worse is that high-profile festivals like the one already mentioned actually embrace and encourage this kind of nonsense. And why? Just because it's without a budget. <br /> <br /> I think it is important, especially in today's climate of indie films, to stop allowing video producers to label themselves, "directors". There is a big difference in my book. When you have to go out and put your script into practice, ask friends, relatives or businessmen for real money to make a "movie" movie, knowing the potential losses in the game, then you'll know what being a "director" means. But leaving a few hundred at Sam's Club for some DV tapes, a little soda and chips don't cut it. <br /> <br /> Oh ... and by the way ... I have to mention how absolutely annoying it is to listen to a woman who is considered "friend" in the whole movie. Even Mark Borchardt reserves this intensely overworked moniker for his male friends only where he is at least captivating where his friend Mike is interested! <br /> <br /> I think the moment the independent film community started calling these shoddy, budget-free videos for what they are, and at the same time reproaching prestigious festivals to make such an effort, praise. Or this or ask these festivals to at least have the courtesy to add a new category to their festival lineups ... "Dude Films"
