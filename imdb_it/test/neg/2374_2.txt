I have always said that there is nothing to beat the original form: the comics. I proved myself right again. This, like all the other films that took part in the Asterix series, failed to amaze. The creators of this film do not understand that what makes all the other films of this genre (x-men, superman et al.) Successful is that they all depart from the original comic versions and adapt it to make it more watchable. Okay, this movie has deviated, in the sense that this film was a cross of two Asterix books, namely. Asterix and Great Crossing & Asterix and Normans. Furthermore, not characteristic of the Asterix series (except Asterix and the secret weapon), a love interest was introduced for one of the main characters. All this ended up creating a childish and immature plot. The fun parts were very few and far between. All in all, a total waste of time and money watching this, not to mention theaters, even at home.
