Shot in Arizona by a mostly foreign troupe, "Nightkill" is one of the most blatant crime episodes I've ever seen. Robert Mitchum (with a cowboy hat) skis around Jaclyn Smith, a widow recently, hopes to find out if she had a hand in her husband's death. Jaclyn's wardrobe is of the Dale Evans variety and his dog is called "Cowboy" ... it seems as if someone had surely acquired the American myth that all Westerners speak and dress as descendants of John Wayne! The screenplay by Joan Andre and John Case may have worked better if it was addressed as a parody; this thriller thriller sounds great, with director Ted Post asleep at the controls. Don't get caught up in the art of Jaclyn's video box screaming as you shower. He really takes a shower in this film, but he is not revealing (nor is the obscure plot of a comma). NO STARS from ****
