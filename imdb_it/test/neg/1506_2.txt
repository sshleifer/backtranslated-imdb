This movie is so terrible that it's fun, not really for Troll 2's levels of hilarity, but still fun. The acting is horrible, the music is atrocious and the story has no blind meaning. The story revolves around a man dressed in a horrible granny costume who kills a group of people at a party. The death scenes are so bad that they are hilarious. A girl is repeatedly stabbed in the chest, but does not scream, tries to defend herself, nor herself nor run away. He also manages to remain standing despite being repeatedly stabbed. Another scene of death involving a rope is also extremely fun. No thought seems to have been included in the plot. The grandmother seems to move magically from one area to another (for example, hiding under the leaves in a wood where the victim is, she appears in front of someone, even if she was behind them ten seconds before), people kiss extremely moments inappropriate (you would stop and kiss someone if you were chased by a homicidal maniac) and the double turn at the end is completely ridiculous, it seems they have just launched it just to confuse people. I would advise people to watch this movie if they love horrible horror movies like Troll 2, The Dreaded or Blood Gnome, but don't watch it if you're expecting a scary horror movie, you'll be disappointed
