After watching this movie, I didn't want to get my money back. I wanted to get my time back. I wanted that hour and a half back in my life - it was the most incredible and horrible torture to know that I wasted precious minutes of my life on this dreck. I'm marked for life, and since this "movie" came into my life I had trouble sleeping. I'm trying to suppress the memories, I really am. . . but they make me want to burn things. <br /> <br />
