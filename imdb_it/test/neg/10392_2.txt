This film was probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. A friend of mine grabbed it from the shelf of the video rental shop, and almost forced me to look at it, an action that we both deeply regret. Ehh ... where to start? Writing, acting, quality? All of this sucked. <br /> <br /> Probably some of the worst writings ever shown in a movie. The dialogue was worse than I thought it could ever be in the movies. Brash dialogue, like "how are you?" ... "not so great, doc" (directly after an exorcism attempt by a man's daughter and then his wife's attempted suicide.) Of course it's not that great. points, kind of funny. If not written horribly, planned and obvious. The general plot of the film, the writing and the way it worked, HORRIBLE. It was as if the writers couldn't find anything better to do, so they wrote a lot of lousy dialogues and threw as many sex and nudity scenes as they could randomly. The only near-perfect sex scene (between the preacher and the tattooed and Peirced girl) was shot with such poor quality that it looked more like cheap porn than a feature film. Oh yes, and they never actually did the deed. <br /> <br /> Acting? Horrible. x100. I think the only good actor was the Spanish short who played Miguel, Del Zamora. And his part was written horribly. The worst acting? Probably Paul Kappellas, whose comedy combined with shitty music, a gun and a half-bluish white girl running through the woods, made the film almost unbearable. He even ruined his death scene, one that should have been easy to nail. Even if everyone else's acting was horrible. <br /> <br /> The lack of characters has also contributed to the overall success level of the film. There were only a sufficient number of characters so that almost half of the characters died, the same amount of people became possessed at one point, and therefore the remaining characters could not be counted on one side. Like ... 50 inches down. <br /> <br /> P.S. What is the culmination of the exorcism films that happen in a stable, anyway?
