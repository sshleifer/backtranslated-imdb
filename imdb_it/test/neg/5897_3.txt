I tried. Lord help me, as I have tried. But there are only a few people almost unable to create quality. Brett Ratner, Uwe Boll, Britney Spears and Asylum. To their credit "The 9/11 Commission Report" seems an honest attempt by the company to move towards a more sophisticated state of storytelling and film production. But for all intents and purposes, it turns out like another movie really in their gallery. Upon opening, the disclaimer notifies the public that all the names have been changed, but the names of the terrorists remain relatively the same. A man named Mussaui tries to learn how to fly a plane. With an icy grimace that would immediately make everyone uncomfortable, this "undercover" agent is able to learn to fly on a small computer. And you have to ask, not how he was able to get into this program so easily, but how these people didn't even ask questions; because this scene is so far-fetched in his presentation, and the actor who plays this man is extremely exaggerated. And it can be seen that director Scott attempts to imitate Paul Greengrass with a brilliant grainy photograph followed by a tremendously dizzying and irritating hand direction that, throughout the film, attempts to take off from Greengrass guerrilla production techniques. . <br /> <br /> You can hear Scott emulating the Greengrass technique for realism, but it gets rather lame halfway. In the meantime the film fails with a "Traffic" taking off, plus a take-off on "Law & Order" where we will have the disclaimer informing us that the names have been changed, the logo almost resembles the "Law & Order" logo , and then ninety minutes of actors pumping their chest and discussing politics. <br /> <br /> None of which is ever as convincing as it tries to be. And then, when the film looks like it's trying to be an adult drama, Scott relies on his old confidence, the sex scene. Scott's new movie really does seem to be thought of as a low budget "budget", but it is not, and it manages to be overwhelming on every possible occasion. "The 9/11 Commission Report" is flat, and it is because it is limited in its attempts to imitate other films. <br /> <br /> While appreciating the ambition behind the camera, this new perspective of the events leading up to September 11th is flat and boring. Although it may seem like a low-budget "Monaco", it's really fun like a regular Dolph Lundgren movie you find on Cinemax.
