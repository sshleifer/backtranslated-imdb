A ruthless murderer was hired to eliminate someone at the top of the US government. Constantly changing his identity and his position, he is known only as the Jackal. Everything about this hit man is a secret. Aware of the presence of the Jackal but uncertain about his purpose, the FBI Deputy Director faces the biggest challenge of his career. In order to track down this cold-blooded murderer, he and a Russian intelligence officer of the book require the help of an imprisoned Irish terrorist. These unlikely allies enter a global race against time to stop the mysterious mercenary before he can complete his assignment. If you're looking for a non-stop action movie like Die Hard, then The Jackal isn't your movie. It is a slow espionage thriller with many fantastic gadgets and weapons. Richard Gere does a good job interpreting a passionate terrorist who is helping the FBI for a deeper cause than just freedom. And Willis makes a great effort like the Jackal. OK film but nothing more.
