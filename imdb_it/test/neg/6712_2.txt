Why on earth does five US keep repeating this? the title actually says it all: the plot is as clear as a book read in a language you have never heard of and that looks like nothing. <br /> <br /> You will see ninety minutes of changing places, many of them will be blown up later in the movie. At the beginning we see a beautiful typical Berry farm, which is found in the film moved near Paris, but then does not survive very well to the "transport" to the island of France: it explodes 1 minute later. there are also two gangsters who do not have the language, as if it made sense in the world of SMS and the internet, not to mention paper and pencil. <br /> <br /> This goes on, nothing makes sense in this story. my only credit goes to the cameraman, the camera is excellent.
