Without a doubt this is the WORSE comic film made every. PERIOD!! Yes, it's worse than Dolph Lundgren (1989) Punisher. That's right ... worse than the Capitan America movies of 1979 and 1991. Oh yes, it's also WORSE so Christopher Reed wrote the Superman IV movie: Quest for Peace. Sheeshh .. that movie was so bad that the guy who played Nuclear Man only starred in another movie and was only on T.V. = oP <br /> <br /> This film is of quality "D". I had the chance to see it on the SciFi channel in 1997. I had heard it was pretty bad, but I had nothing else to do that night, so I thought I'd check it out. What a waste of an hour and a half. I would have been better looking at Different Strokes reruns. In addition to having the smallest special effects and the worst acting I've ever seen, the whole script was simply horrible and not at all well directed. Fortunately, a NEW Fantastic Four movie was made and I hope this version will do justice to the heroes. I was hoping for a new SPAWN movie in the future, but it has yet to materialize. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this movie. If you happen to see it being broadcast by cable, take a look. Be careful, however, you will love to turn the channel after the first 15 minutes.
