Lazy movie made by a lazy director. The characters are grotesque. Despite the tragedy of this war, there is no emotion in the film. The symbolism is artificial and inefficient (and the old Bosnian woman who takes a picture of her son in Arbor "will concretize" her will, will awaken the super-mother who sleeps inside her, a corpse eaten by worms to show the horror of genocide ... sometimes he is worse than not enough). <br /> <br /> This film is just an advertisement, an empty elegy for a woman who is not a hero. He worked for the United Nations. Remember that the United Nations failed to protect civilians in Srebrenica. Who are the real heroes of this war? A Canadian judge who conducted a post-mortem trial for atrocities committed mainly because his organization failed to prevent them? Where is the criticism in this film?
