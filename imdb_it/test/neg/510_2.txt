It is shocking to see so many people give incredibly high ratings for this film. Some of the praises use such reasoning (and transparent orders that betray a simple love for everything that is in some way critical of the United States) that comes close to hysteria. <br /> <br /> Heaven's Gate is a bad movie, it's fundamentally terrible. Endless scenes that use elaborate shots that are useless, muddy dialogues, narative murders, no sense of any theme other than excess ... < br /> <br /> The high score of this disaster is a product of revisionist history and temporary shifts in perception. <br /> <br /> For some perspective, look at Lawrence of Arabia before looking at Heaven's Gate. You'll see how aimless and lost this movie is. The "problems" he may have tried to address are lost in a miasma. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with films that are critical to the United States per se, but when a terrible movie gets such undeserved praises purely because of that element ... it's worth challenging. <br /> <br /> The film deserves to be seen for two reasons; curiosity and as a warning to young filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I saw him at home for free, imagine the torture of being in a theater and sitting through ... for 4 hours winding!
