The director / presenter Larry Bishop tried the way, too difficult with Hell Ride. The film wants to be angular, witty, provocative, extravagant, biting all this, apparently in a style by Quentin Tarantino / Rob Zombie. But it's not angular. The references seem forced. Dialogue tries to be intelligent and fails. Humor is never fun. Nice attempt to give a gritty tone, but we should worry about the characters or the story to be able to do it at a distance. <br /> <br /> What you have left is the cool Harleys and pretty girls surrounding a group of tired, old and out of shape "bad guys" in what looks like an attempt to make a modernized western by Sergio Leone. If this film can make the new generations interested in films from the 60s and 70s, congratulations for this. But alone, it's rather boring and irrelevant. I believe there is a place for style over substance. But this film is not true.
