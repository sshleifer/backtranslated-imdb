... when you dubbed into another language Let's face it: Neither Nielsen nor Schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialogue. And given the campy lines that should be pronounced this is a loose situation. Any kind of voiceover is definitely an improvement (and in reality it is - at least in the German version). <br /> <br /> But this is only a minor point. Acting is bad The fastest combat sequences are pathetic. Nielsen couldn't use his sword to get out of a wet paper bag. This becomes painfully obvious when compared to the fluidity of movement exhibited by the child (who has had some martial arts training, no doubt) and the athletics shown by Sandahl Bergman. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger does his Conan thing - nothing new here. <br /> <br /> Some images are beautiful, I'll have to give it. The dragon skeleton looks cool. But most of the time the plaster is too obvious. <br /> <br /> Overall the film is not worth seeing. 'Conan the Destroyer' is also better than this (although only marginally). I'd rather have seen Bergman as Red Sonja as it originally was, but I doubt this could have saved this movie - oh well. <br /> <br /> 3/10
