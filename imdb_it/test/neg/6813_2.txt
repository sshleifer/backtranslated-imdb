After reading the reviews I decided to rent the DVD version. <br /> <br /> I like classical music and wanted to learn more about Bach. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. I guess I don't know enough about Bach's music and the comments are not enough for me to understand the importance or what music was being played. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it would be appropriate with the guidance of a Bach music expert to explain the film. <br /> <br /> I really tried and saw the whole movie jumping that I could enjoy at least a little, but I didn't. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk.
