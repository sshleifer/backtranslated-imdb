I know that Terry Gilliam is considered a good director, but to say that this film is good is simply crazy. What was the movie about? What is a parody? Fantasy? Comedy? Satire? No answer from Gilliam's script. Totally confused and uselessly darting from one historical era to another. I find it funny that some people actually call this magical movie. Is it because they have to praise every film that is vague and undecided about what it is? 3 stars for special effects considering it's 1981. Roger Ebert is right in his review. The film is ambiguous and resembles Gilliam's fun with money just to make a vague move for children disguised as a historical magazine. The film also tries to confuse the aspiring viewer by giving John Cleese and Sean Connery the maximum of billing.
