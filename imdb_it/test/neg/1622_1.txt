There is simply no redeeming quality on this film. Ok, some of the costumes are OK, but they are nothing you can't see, for example, in the Conan movies. And what happens with Ator's hair? I can't believe it's part of a series! I will say one thing about this movie: it was judged bad enough by a flash of the first MST3K cast and I suggest to anyone that is curious enough to see how bad this movie is to watch the film version for moral support if nothing else.
