There is a difference between a "film" and a "film". A film, regardless of quality, is ready for public consumption. A film is what a group of friends gets together to do over a weekend with a video camera. In my time as a spectator, I saw some examples of both. <br /> <br /> On September 19, I participated in a screening of writer / director Jon Satejowski "Donnybrook". Now, after reading the script and seeing two different cuts (a rough cut and the "finished" product) of this piece, I can safely say that it is a film. And a film for students, to this. It is, for lack of a better, competent word, that is to say, the director knew how to push the recording onto a camera and capture moving images. The images are, for the most part, static and not impressive, and the dialogue scenes are reduced to mainly long shots, with close-up shots or almost to allow the public to establish a relationship with the characters. I understand that this is a modestly budgeted film, but a certain visual talent would have been appreciated, and it would have been very important to keep the public interested. <br /> <br /> Of course, there have been independent photos that have shown that the limited camera work can be finished with a well-written, compelling story and a close dialogue. Steven Soderbergh's "sex, lies and videotape" immediately comes to mind. This film, however, has neither. The main plot is weak and fuzzy. If the main plot is Davie trying to fix his relationship with his father, then I feel that this film does not get the point. What I got is that Davie's main aspiration is "to change the face of rock 'n' roll". However, we see very few activities on his part to prove it. While at the beginning there is a sequence of dreams, and in the end an impromptu performance of his, all we seem to get are scenes of Davie listening to music or playing a guitar by chance. We are simply told that Davie has played a lot of gigs, but we never see him in full rock out mode. Next time, SHOW doesn't SAY to the public. Anyone who has attended a creative writing course knows this. Also, Davie doesn't look like a person who would have been great in the glam rock era of the 70s; he seems to be more comfortable in the early years of rock 'n' roll, posing as James Dean's less talented brother. Meanwhile, the rest of the film events seem to happen randomly to somewhat clich√© characters, and the threads of history, which have little or nothing to do with the subtle main storyline, are recalled and abandoned with alarming frequency (ie the subplot involves Terry's father). If I want to see a movie with this kind of random construction, I will consider the vision of "Napolean Dynamite", a film I will barely be able to overcome for the first time. <br /> <br /> As for the dialog box mentioned above scenes, I imagine I should say that they are few and extremely far apart. Is it too much to ask characters who speak? I don't think it is. When the characters speak, they are short and discontinuous sentences; collections of such insightful questions, of irritated grunts or overly wild explosions. These characters simply do not behave like normal and rational people. Working with material like this, it's easy to see why there's only a good performance in the film, Al Hudson, and that's just because he's doing a bad imitation of Sam Elliott for his time on screen. A good director, or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a feature film, would have been able to identify these problems and make the writer and the camera staff correct them. However, with Satejowski who is so close to the material, he simply does not see them, or if he does, he is not willing to take the necessary steps to solve them because it will damage his creative vision. Being unable or unwilling to face criticism constructively is the mark of a self-indulgent and misguided madman. Just ask Rob Schneider. <br /> <br /> In the end, we find ourselves with a poor set of Zach Braff's high school in the extraordinary "Garden State" combined with the equally surprising "Velvet Goldmine", two films much more worthy of your time. <br /> <br /> Now, before any of the cast or crew come out of the word job to complete me for this review, let me offer it. The best I can do is to congratulate Mr. Satejowski for having the ambition to make a movie of his own and put it out there for an audience to see. However, the hopes that this film will be collected and distributed are simply illusions of grandeur. This is a film for students, nothing more, nothing less. If the film has any promise (and let's face it, at this point, it won't come from acting, writing or directing), it's this: If, SE, the people associated with this film are available, so please learn from this film, save it and use the lessons learned in your next attempt; don't attack your critics, or have friends or family do it for you. If you are able to do so, perhaps the next one will be worthy of distribution, worthy of being called a "film". <br /> <br /> I'm your audience, and I'm willing to watch.
