This is a poor, poor film. Full of clich√©s, unrealistic moments: punching the air in a party after turning off a fire, it doesn't matter if someone has lost their home and property !!, announcing a pregnancy in a bar together with all your friends before say it privately first, walking the roof of a burning building for no apparent reason, the stereotypical funerals and tense relationships, the very dubious and poor music at the end, the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was saved from her apartment, the explosion very unrealistic of that same apartment! ! They had a couple of oxygen bottles in the attic or something like that !!? Anyone with a bit of spirit can see that this movie was a joke. It is a pity, because firefighters do a fantastic job and deserve to make a good film about what they do, but not at the expense of common sense.
