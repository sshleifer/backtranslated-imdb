Bela Lugosi like God? Transvestites discussed in a film set in the 1950s? Fortunately, this must be an Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I felt a combination of guilt, pleasure and nausea at the same time. The story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself) and his alter ego cross-dressing Glenda. Somehow, if this movie were made now, I could see Kevin Kline play Glen / Glenda. Notice how all the alter-egos of cross-dressers are versions of their male name (Glen / Glenda, Robert / Roberta, etc.). Try to describe it as comprehensively as the mental disorder it is, rather than as a graphic perversion. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Wood manages to sneak into the bondage sequences and S & M in his early story of Glen / Glenda. Along with these racy scenes, Satan himself appears, obviously with a bad day. Dialogue and rhythm are non-existent, but the film is fun in its context - the strange world of Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Sterno says to wear your favorite lace panties for this.
