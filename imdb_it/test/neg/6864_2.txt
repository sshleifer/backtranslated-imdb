This film was a waste of celluloid on which it was printed. It's a disastrous scene, much like a particularly creepy train. <br /> <br /> Looking at this is like trying to explain the meaning of life. The main point of the plot is that the character played by Steve Guttenberg is a party animal that should not gamble, because that would violate his conditional freedom. The guys who make friends refuse to play with him as a coach for a while because he is gambling. BUT ... a few minutes later, after winning the championship, a large sum of money saves their refuge. And where did they get the money? GAMBLE!!! Add this to the gruesome scenes at the funeral parlor (why exactly are there BEDROOMS in a funeral home?) And the useless peripheral character
