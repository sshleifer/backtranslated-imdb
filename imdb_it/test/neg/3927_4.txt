I state that I am a big fan of JJL and NOT Patrick. So I saw this to see his performance and, of course, it was excellent. I don't think the director was adequate for the film as many wrong choices were made: camera angles, blocks, etc. If the director was trying to give him a "realistic" touch, they failed and lost some good performances because of it. I almost always felt that the camera was too static, too far from intense facial reactions - and so many times when the action depended on the intimacy of the main characters, the dialogue was slow and tiring. This could easily be solved by splits or camera angle changes. But I had the impression that the budget was too small and that only one camera was used! I also got the impression that maybe the scenes were shot multiple times and that the energy from the actors was ... exhausted.
