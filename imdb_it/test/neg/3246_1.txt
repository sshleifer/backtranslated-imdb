hi, this is the worst movie i've ever seen in my life. The day I saw this movie, I had a high fever. But anyway I watched the film very patiently. And after watching the movie, I felt sorry. Because, I lost 3 hours for this stupid movie. I could have rested rather than watching this movie. And I was really surprised that actors like Sunny Deol, Akshay Kumar Aftab etc starred in this film. <br /> <br /> I don't understand if the directors don't find a good story to make a movie, so why do they remain as directors? Why can't they sit at home and spend their time at home? <br /> <br /> I ask all the directors that it will be good for them if they ask the public, by post or by media, newspaper, radio, etc., to send them a good story if they do not find a good story to make a movie. I ask all the directors again, please don't make movies like that.
