Secret service agent Jay Killion (Charles Bronson) was tasked with protecting the wife of the elected president, the new First Lady (Jill Ireland). She is a very difficult woman and Killion has her hands full. He is the victim of numerous assassination attempts, all directed by the President's Chief of Staff, who wants the death of the First Lady. This film insults your intelligence not only with the plot, but also with the lack of realistic positions. For example, in the scene depicting the inaugural parade, the First Lady is in a Rolls Royce convertible with agent Killion and without the president. Furthermore, we know that Washington, DC, is like the weather in January, and not only are everyone "top coat less", you can even see some palm trees in the 70th and sunny weather! (Obviously shot in Hollywood, not in Washington, DC). This film is a joke. It's not worth your time.
