I have to raise my hand and say that I was one of the first (and probably the last !!!) to watch this movie. Where I start from, it's a complete mess. The main attraction, of course, was the soundtrack. Which is obvious is brilliant: that's what Himesh does best. But as they say, don't give up your day job - human resources definitely shouldn't. <br /> <br /> Acting HR is simple and simply horrible. Even if the film has a plot, the thing that baffles you the most is why this man is on the screen and what the hell he's doing there. Two words of advice to human resources: giving up acting and, secondly, using the chapstick. <br /> <br /> Human resources have no screen presence, no acting ability and the female protagonist seems a little too young for him. As for Malika Sherawat - just the same old Bollywood crap. <br /> <br /> You can package the product as much as you want, but if there is no substance it will not be. Don't waste your money ...
