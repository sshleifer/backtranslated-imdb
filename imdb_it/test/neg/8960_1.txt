This movie is terrible, I'm SORRY. I bought it to get Star Worms, and actually I expected it to be better after I was disappointed with Star Worms. Oh, I'm kidding, it turns out this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Acting is rubbish, not that there really is, and the main character is a big stupid box that is attacked by things like that, stuff or something. I can't really say that. The special effects are so bad that you can't even see the dinosaurs in war, which by the way do not make war, but are simply standing and moving their mouth, or whatever they are. The film is a headache. It is obvious that the director is trying to create a universe. Hahahahahahahaha ... Really, this film is simply abominable, even by Troma standards. The only good thing I can say about it is that it has an intro of Lloyd Kaufman, while it takes us again prey to something that is not good for consumption.
