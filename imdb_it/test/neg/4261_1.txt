And the worst part is that it could have been good. But something terribly wrong. First of all, they shouldn't have engaged Amitabh Bachchan in this film. It is too much an icon to tackle such a delicate and controversial subject, much less the role itself. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Ram Gopal Varma should be ashamed of himself for taking the classic Lolita story and turning it into a pathetic predatory bitch. His Lolita is called Jia (played by the newcomer Jiah Khan) and when we meet her, she lacks any sign of stolen innocence or that delicate naivety that would normally be associated with the complicated history of the original Lolita that gradually becomes nymphet in the original story . Varma's Jia is already a whore with her eye on the prize even before the camera meets her. And he does not exercise chastity in the way his films are his main nymphet. From the constant panning shot of his horse to the fixations on his vulgar gestures and mannerisms, Mr. Varma assures himself that he has not left a single person in the public less than uncomfortable with his voyeuristic camera angles. <br /> <br /> Oh and let's not talk about the non-existent chemistry between Jia and her so-called friend Ritu (the daughter of the character of Bachchan). These girls should be best friends, but they look like worst enemies even before something goes wrong between them. Nothing they do together is credible until they become enemies. Perhaps Mr. Varma would have to work on that aspect of his script rather than focus on destroying any credibility that Amitabh Bachchan could have left as an actor. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the film is perhaps the submissive portrait of the character of the wife of the character of Bachchan. Her role was so under-written and ridiculously wooden that it is impossible to really feel pity or concern for her. Actually, I felt like reaching the screen and slapping her so I wouldn't react like a normal woman would. Instead she remained standing there, looking irritated and helpless, since I imagine that most of the spectators of this film might feel after seeing this shipwreck. Look at your own risk.
