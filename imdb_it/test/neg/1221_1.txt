Parrots? PARROTS? I've been in this old land longer than most and I've seen almost all the westerns they produced. The history of the old West is my passion. Comanche Moon is one of the most misunderstood, direct and dramatized stories I've ever seen. There was very little historical accuracy, but then it is obvious that you were operating on a low budget that <br /> <br /> played a distinctive role in this insult to intelligence. I'm happy to have TIVO'd this show. It was bad enough to have to sit and watch the movie and endure the inane commercials. Once again, there was no actor who came almost to convince. I kept hoping that it would improve as the three days progressed. MISTAKEN! I am ashamed to say that I have wasted 4 and a half hours of that precious time I have left.
