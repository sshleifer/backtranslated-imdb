The brands of this film, like Suit Supply, take away the story, because it should be set in the eighties. It is not a very exciting film. Furthermore, Intwine's single on the soundtrack is very bad, it has a chorus that is repeated numerous times, like "I'm a cruel man, I take everything, I'm a cruel man I'm here to stay .." Jeeez couldn't have those twists have they come up with something better than that? I guess they wrote it in a couple of minutes .. <br /> <br /> It's really annoying, just like the product placement in this movie, which collects the controversy and publicity around a criminal who shouldn't be a celebrities like now are meant to be, but should be forgotten how mice should be.
