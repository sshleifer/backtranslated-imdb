Welcome to the world of Vikram Bhatt, the man who once succeeded and achieved several successes with small actors like KASOOR, RAAZ and even the multi-star AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA and his only film with Aamir GHULAM <br /> on This movie has all the Hollywood remakes and some of the decent ones like the one that worked. <br /> <br /> SPEED is a remake of CELLULAR and also the terrible <br /> <br /> A look at the stars, we have a salable time but now without work Urmila and Sanjay Suri, then we have the Aftab flop, Ashish Chaudhary, Zayed Khan and others <br /> <br /> The film could be a decent thriller but many problems are there. Storytelling has several noteworthy scenes like Zayed that hijacks a Mobile Company and many others and even stunts are ridiculous while the twists in the end are too ridiculous. The film also took a long time to reach theaters that lose its spark <br /> <br /> The direction is horrible The music is obsolete <br /> <br /> Zayed Khan screams, makes faces.e tc that what Urmila always does is good on her part, Sanjay Suri is not so convincing Ashish Chaudhary tries hard in a negative role and is fine Aftab is horrible and makes you laugh in a negative role Surprisingly the director himself gave him his only hit hit KASOOR Sophie is horrible Tanushree is not an actress
