The spoof genre, which has been lacking in creativity and humor for some time, is again spat out as a hack without talent. No point, no fun, no originality; only a few cheap dollars for the directors. <br /> <br /> It takes much more than simply referencing some recent films and giving characters double-meaning names like satire; make people laugh Any sod can take a cam-corder and have some bad friends in cheap costumes imitate someone. Since the genre that was targeted this time is inspired by sports films, there are some unclear references projected on films of that type: the lines are so weak that the characters must actually underline the references in various ways, to make you laugh hysterically. Does not work. <br /> <br /> It is not a comedy. However, the same "old jokes" of the worn-out second year torn away from a middle school bathroom (even milder than usual) are all here. If that's not enough, there's a "gag" running on a bus that spins someone. So funny, isn't it? Furthermore, a pathetically poor scene does more product placement than Michael Bay; again with the same unpleasant results. A little music gets confused miserably. Pity Carl Weathers, once Apollo Creed in the Rocky series, now has thrilling roles like this. <br /> <br /> Ugly beyond words. Watching a snail run marathon would be less boring than watching this movie. Probably a lot more fun.
