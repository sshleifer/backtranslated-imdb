This film has a strange mix of genres - toilet humor and action in one. It doesn't really stand out, it should be stuck on a genre. The best thing I can say about the movie is that the dog inside is cute. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing sequence is in the middle of the film when Moses (Sandler) and Carter (Wayans) decide to stop outside in a hunting lodge / motel. I'm not quite sure what the point of this sequence is - it seems simply free in the extreme. The owner of the hunting lodge ("Charlie") is a very nerdy guy. For some reason, Moses starts a conversation with Charlie about porn, jerking off, homosexual sex, sex in a threesome ... Charlie's photo of his "wife" seems to be Charlie wearing resistance. There is no reason for this dialogue and really youthful scene. However, the whole scene seems to be directed at the moment when a naked Moses ends up with Carter's gun on his ass and Charlie sees them through the window. It's all smells of boyish humor about homosexuality - horrified and titillated at the same time - which I don't find funny at all. <br /> <br /> I have a friend who is always enthusiastic about Adam Sandler's films. This is the first one I've seen - after this, I'm not sure I want to see more. <br /> <br /> BTW, this is my husband's account - he saw Happy Gilmore, and he tells me it's pretty good - maybe I should give Sandler just one more chance. <br /> <br /> Countess Skogg
