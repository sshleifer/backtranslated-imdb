Despite being one of the first films of John Cusack and Demi Moore, he is one of the most avid fans he can miss, unless they absolutely have to complete the collection. I have rare moments where I can handle Off Dead better, but this movie is definitely worse. I'm not a fan of Savage Steve Holland, and he made both films. So, if you don't like casual and fun comedies and amateur animation, avoid this. FYI also for Demi Moore fans: she can't sing and the synthesizers of the 80s didn't save her. There are too many predictable twists and jokes too easy. I suppose if you want a thoughtless entertainment or something you can leave aside and ignore while doing something productive, then go get it. Otherwise, don't watch this movie. If John Cusack (or Demi Moore) can't save him, you know he must be bad. I'm the only reason I didn't give this movie at 1.
