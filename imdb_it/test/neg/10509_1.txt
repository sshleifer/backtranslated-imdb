In fact, this film almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> To begin with, false teeth. Then you find a nice set of plastic or drawn. To make even more boring all the action is followed by a bright flash. Then talk: sound levels are so different, sometimes too difficult, then too soft, never exactly as good as in good movies. Also, it echoes so much that I think they have a microphone on the whole set. And to make things worse, NEVER heard of stereo? If the camera changes, the sound is always centered. The actors talk as if they were reading from a blackboard staged behind the camera. And the zoom in another scene, how terrible childish. <br /> <br /> Music is so badly chosen that it never adds anything. It destroys any excitement created accidentally. <br /> <br /> Finally, the fighting scenes ... my 3-year-old niece would do a better fighting scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even good for a laugh, it's just so bad ...
