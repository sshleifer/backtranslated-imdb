I can barely find the words to describe how much this piece of rubbish has offended me. Why do American filmmakers always come out of there to portray Jamaicans as a pack of backward puppies and, worse yet, throwing people to play Jamaicans who look absolutely ridiculous when they try to imitate the accent? We are not all extremely dark, we don't all go around carrying machetes for work OR PROTECTION, we don't walk naked in our homes and we don't practice VOODOO !! We are doctors, lawyers, architects, business men and women, musicians, actors and FILMAKERS REALIZERS. I'm sick of looking at all these portraits of Jamaicans like a bunch of dreadlocks wearing Rastafarians who do nothing but sit all day smoking grass on a beach or shooting in the air (when we don't live in our tree houses). YES, we wear clothes. YES, we have electricity. No, the grass is not legal on the island AND THE CHANCES SPEAK BETTER ENGLISH! The worst part is that it's not just me being angry and bitter, these are the real answers to the questions that most Jamaicans who have traveled abroad have been asked at some point. Read a book before you think it is like in another country and, worse yet, decide to make a film about it. <br /> <br /> WELCOME TO JAMAICA! The land where all we do is kill the whites and beat our bongos drums ... Tales from the Crypt officially disgusted me, along with the entire crew of people who worked on this garbage, particularly the writer .
