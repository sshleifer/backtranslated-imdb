Someone told me that Pink Flamingos were, in a word, "crazy". Now I doubt this guy ever saw it, because it's not the way I'd sum it up in one word. Disgusting, absurd, um, more disgusting ... he would do it. Every time you think it can't get dirty, it does. One of my "favorites" in particular was when the Divine celebrated her birthday and when the cops came to pick him up, they were slaughtered and eaten by guests. I admit it's one of those movies where it's so grotesque that you simply can't look away, but it's not a creative work of art at all. It is pure shock value. <br /> <br /> On the upside, it makes the boys of the Jackass a bit like a bunch of pussies.
