My question is what was the worst element of this movie? Was it acting? direct? film script ?. Maybe it was the waste of Alan Ladd and Jack LaRue. LaRue and, above all, Ladd are able to bring an extreme left to a role. In this film, it was difficult to say who was the villain. Of course, Ladd was playing a good undercover guy, but even in his good boy roles, he could be very chilling. Thus, the net result was a potentially good film devoid of any feeling of conflict.
