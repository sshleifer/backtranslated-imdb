But I've always liked looking at it, so I gave it a 3 instead of a 1. Its expressions are priceless. Even some of the other cast members (eg Michael McKean) are really soft. The cat itself is quite funny. Apart from that, the film is all a clich√©, culminating in too long a car chase. (It is also at this point that the film becomes uselessly raw, having been very "familiar" until then.)
