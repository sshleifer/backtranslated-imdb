Sad ... really sad. This film has nothing (hmmm, well maybe Sybil Danning) to make you look. It also hurts my eyes to see Linda Blair in this exploitation movie. Definitely deserves better. <br /> <br /> So what's the story? Let's see ... Guardian John Vernon records the inmates in rather challenging positions, while the Sybil prisoner actually runs the prison and little Linda has to fight to survive ... It looks like a B series movie, eh? IS.
