I was not impressed by the Graffiti artist, despite his artistic appeal (or low-cost improvisation). There is little dialogue and at least for me, I was disappointed that he did not give more credit or promoted the work of guerrilla artists like these. Instead, it was a story that covers a family territory. Two guys who basically do little more than tag buildings become friends, tag partners and eventually experience a relationship. They seem to be opposite, rather uncomfortable together. Little is explained about their background and the things between the two young people happen at high speed (although, this I can understand because they are only about 70 minutes). There have been countless numbers of plots and similar productions in recent years to the point that the sphere of independent film is starting to become just as saturated with this particular narrative just as the mainstream has become saturated with this and more. <br /> <br /> Much of the film can bore the viewer who needs immediate dialogue and purpose. The main figure of this story (at least extensively), performs his routines almost without dialogue, without intuitions and nothing else to bring the viewer. And, for a short film, I wanted them to get to the point much faster. This, apart from the typical plot, annoyed me. Still, there was something about a momentary glance in the daily habits of at least two graffiti artists, even though most of them were rather short of time. <br /> <br /> Recommended if you are tired of traditional shit and don't wear It doesn't matter an independent film and you're interested in this underground urban art form. But you really have to look at it yourself, because this seems to be one with a more acquired taste. For the most recent independent films focusing on graffiti artists, take a look at Transit.
