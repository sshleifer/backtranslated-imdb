I couldn't stand the woman who played the mother. I wanted her to shut up. She had a bizarre way of talking and the lines she had been given had not improved. I had no idea why the men of the city were so taken with her that caused all these problems, except that in a city populated by men, she seemed to be the only woman over ten and under sixty. Even after a terrible tragedy his voice was devoid of human emotions, he seemed to have no ability to grasp the events of his life. He gave his lines with the same emotion whether he said "I love you", "I hate you", "the bank is closing", "my dress is on fire". Was this actually filmed in Ireland? The sun exploded throughout the film and the characters seemed surprised by a rain during the harvest. I lived in Ireland during the summer of 2002, the wettest summer of a century. Almost everything was still gathered. If farmers in Ireland could only harvest during long periods of drought, the country would be starved hundreds of years ago. It seems that there was not much money to make the film. The black and white flashbacks seemed to have been shot with the security cameras that can be found at Sam's Club.
