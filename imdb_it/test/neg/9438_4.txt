I know this movie was shown on local TV when I was a child, but I can't remember if I watched it or not; seeing him now, considering how completely forgettable, I don't know yet? so I counted it as a first sight! There have been several films with the title character, a creation of the visionary French author Jules Verne; these include: 20,000 LEAGUE UNDER THE SEA (1954, with James Mason in the role), MASTER OF THE WORLD (1961; Vincent Price), ISTERIOSA MYSTERIOUS (1961; Herbert Lom), CAPTAIN NEMO AND THE UNDERWATER CITY (1969; Robert Ryan) and THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND OF CAPTAIN NEMO (1973; Omar Sharif). <br /> <br /> This version is interpreted by Oscar-winning winner Jose 'Ferrer. However, even if the premise itself is not half bad? awakened by an animation suspended in his submarine, "The Nautilus", and being in modern times, does Nemo adopt all his ingenuity to help the US navy defeat the megalomaniac scientist Burgess Meredith ?? even his most childish adventure emerges easily! For example: five seconds in the film, Meredith's assistant ?? wear a steel mask ?? he says "The world will be ours!"); equally zealous are the zealous gesticulations of the similarly downed dwarf, whose job is to shoot the Professor's very important "Beam Delta" - and what do you think of those android-type servants aboard Meredith's ship that never seems to do much? nothing? ! <br /> <br /> Ferrer manages to maintain his dignity everywhere, but Meredith is an embarrassment (in what is virtually a reconstruction of his Penguin characterization of the TV series and films of the '60s BATMAN) where the budget was so strict ?? mostly invested in a bland production design and in vain special effects, no doubt, and both evidently influenced by STAR WARS (1977) ?? which, apparently, could not even afford a decent costume (he looks decidedly idiotic wearing a tie in a subtitle)! The supporting cast includes Mel Ferrer (who plays a saboteur in the vein of Joan Fontaine from another Irwin Allen production, VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA [1961], and who engages in a swagger with his namesake at the inside the "Il Nautilus" engine room), Lynda Day George (of course, she is the only female character in circulation) and Horst Buchholz (like the King of Atlantis for whatever reason, Nemo is obsessed with the idea of to locate the famous Lost Continent). <br /> <br /> By the way, having been reduced by a three-part miniseries for the theater show, does the film feel obviously moved? although one is still able to discern where one episode ends and another begins.
