This is one of those movies where I was rooting for anyone who could finish the film in the fastest way. I wanted to see the police kill Keaton and Garcia just to get it over with. Basically, that's the deal - Two cops have to die and a third has to get horrible burns on his face for Garcia's son to get a bone marrow transplant from the doomed killer Keaton. Is it worth it? No!
