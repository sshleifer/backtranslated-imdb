This is the most boring, pretentious and stupid film I've seen in a long time. I saw him at the Beverly Hills Academy, and there were some people in the lobby who had left the screening and were seeking refuge there. Everyone was solemnly shaking his head and seemed to have been at a funeral. What a waste of time and money. Even worse are the critics who have given good reviews to this pretentious airship. What's up with them? Are they just afraid of not being considered "fashionable"? Have they been corrected? This film is incredibly ugly. Don't make an appointment expecting to have a thorough chat at the Cheesecake Factory later. If going to see this movie was your idea, it will scare you and keep you for the rest of your life.
