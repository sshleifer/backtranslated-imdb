After some failures, we are still waiting for the French horror film that the critics will certainly denigrate, but will launch a new trend. Not this time. Doug Headline cannot be accused of not being well informed in the genre (he is editor of a high-class fantasy print, he worked for the legendary Starfix magazine), but because a scenario that uses EVERY cliche in the book (except perhaps the Odorous comedian relief)? Why make it so predictable? Even the hints towards Silver fail. It's not even a euro-teen movie like the German "Anatomy", much better, just a compilation of scenes that barely seems to have a relationship with the other and presents a lot of holes in the plot. The entire "Celtic" aspect has barely touched. And, after a painfully predictable "revenation", the script offers us a boring and endless pursuit in an underground necropolis that seems larger than the Parisian catacombs. I really wanted to love this movie. Really. But even a mother wouldn't do it. Oh, and the writer Valerio Evangelisti had to have a cameo, but I was looking for him in vain.
