The plot involves a new hipper barber franchise that is moving across the street from Calvin's barber. So, he feels like he should change and improve his shop by getting more new things and so on. Sounds really exciting eh. As for the rest of the film, a lot is about the same material as the first film. People who work at Calvin are standing, talking loudly and talking to each other and to clients. Once again, Cedric the Entertainer was slightly fun, but it's more like doing a cabaret routine rather than anything to do with the movie. And Calvin is faced with another moral issue that involves taking a large sum of money. He has already shown that in the end he will do the right thing. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Nothing new. I don't recommend it unless you think the first Barbershop was the best thing after sliced ​​bread.
