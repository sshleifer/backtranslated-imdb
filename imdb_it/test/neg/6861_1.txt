He was unlucky enough to see him as he traveled by bus across Africa. It was by far the worst movie I've ever seen. Deserves to be the worst number one of all time ;-) No acting, no plot, very little talking. A lot of monkey-like grunts, in this hopelessly unlikely movie. An unconscious self-satire - or you'll laugh at it or cry.
