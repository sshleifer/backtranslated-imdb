Spheeris used this documentary to push a stereotype of punk. This documentary is partial and guided, not objective. The cutting techniques that pass from the interview to the interview can be used to remove the spoken word from the interviewees from the context. When you watch the movie, the idea that comes from punk interviews is that they are pretty stupid. The band members and other punks seem to be of low intelligence and unable to explain their motivations or give detailed or coherent answers or even answers. I strongly doubt that if any of those interviewed knew what Spheeris was creating or saw that the final product would be included in the project. This film puts punks in a bad light making them look unintelligent and simple. Spheeris's film should not be taken as a representation of the punk scene of L.A. If you want to see a good punk documentary look at "Another State of Mind" with the Youth Brigade and Social Distortion.
