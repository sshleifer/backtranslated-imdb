Five Fingers relies on Hollywood tactics of barbarous value and shock to seemingly elicit a positive response to the film. This is where this film fails, especially because it's too graphic to be taken seriously. I was disgusted and disgusted that Five Fingers had been created, and basically I had to force myself to keep watching it. The torture itself is creepy. Even the sounds coming from a room where someone is tortured are macabre. But obviously the creators of this stinker of a movie felt that it wasn't enough. It had to go far beyond what was necessary, and simply and effectively ruined every chance this film had of making some sort of valid point. For this reason, this film was nothing but self-gratifying. Even Five Fingers relegates itself practically to a B-movie status solely because of its indulgence in the manipulation of time. In other words we are shown the present and therefore the past is revealed in fragments. This is a little touch of Hollywood's normal time manipulation. While the viewer is normally shown on page 95 in a 100-page script as the beginning of the film, and the rest of the movie is essentially explaining the ending, Five Fingers is dedicated to flashback, which becomes quite tiring at the end of the film. Overall, Five Fingers made me feel stupid for watching the entire movie, because torture is obviously obscene, and it certainly wasn't necessary to resort to graphic mutilation to clarify this point. I'm surprised Dick Cheney didn't make a guest cameo at the end as a kind of torture superhero. This film is a perfect example of what happens when an important topic falls into the hands of greedy and unreasonable pain.
