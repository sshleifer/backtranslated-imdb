If you like really shocking movies, this is for you. The acting is the worst I've ever seen and the plot doesn't go where. If you come across this movie in your video store, don't consider borrowing it. The chick on the cover isn't even that of the movie. I gave this 1/10 movie just because I couldn't vote 0. I avoid it at all costs.
