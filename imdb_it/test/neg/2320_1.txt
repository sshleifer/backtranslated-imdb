For some reason my father-in-law gave me a copy of this tape. I think my great uncle, Buddy Baer, ​​was the giant of this movie and my father-in-law thought I would like to see it. I had, years before as a child, and I didn't like that either. <br /> <br /> My son, then two, looked at him and was hooked. Every waking moment in front of the TV, this horrible video played. I went to work with inane songs stuck in my head. The two "leads" were worse than a junior high level review. The dancers looked like scraps from a horror film by Ed Wood and Abbot and Costello phoned their parties. Fortunately, I was able to distract my son long enough to lose this videotape. Frankly, I think it was the "The Ring" tape. <br /> <br /> To correct another reviewer, Buddy Baer is Jethro's UNCLE (Max Baer, ​​Jr), not his father. 0 out of 10.
