This may not have been as horribly bad as it was if it hadn't been for the absolutely horrible acting work done by Raymond Wallace! This guy is so mean that it wasn't even funny! His character was necessary in the film, but because they chose this guy it's beyond me. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for quality Chinese films ..... I might suggest "Raise the Red Lantern" .... "The Story of Qui Ju" ... "Red Sorghum" ... .... <br /> <br /> Everything but this! I was surprised by how many people actually rated this highly! Really ... the acting of this loser of Wallace is so serious that it obscures the other good parts of this film. This was agreed by all 6 of us to watch this movie last night! <br /> <br /> Stay away from this piece of trash ........
