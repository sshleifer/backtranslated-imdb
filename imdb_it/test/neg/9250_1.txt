So bad as well - not only is the script obvious, but acting is not only poor, but pathetic. The worst thing is the definition of the characters: unrealistic naivety, influenced reactions, forcing the camera to observe superficial aspects, which are introduced as keys of the plot. <br /> <br /> I can't help laughing when, in the end, the main character says he is seconding something like "your daughter doesn't play soccer and can't cook". This offense against female intelligence defines the level of this film. <br /> <br /> Does the film talk about the psychological behavior of the second character, its impact on the main character, or just a sequence of events set in to warm up for the obvious final? <br /> <br /> Pls, you do more - I had a good time guessing what would go wrong after ...
