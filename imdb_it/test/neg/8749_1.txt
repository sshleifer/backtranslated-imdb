Yes, this movie features a girl named Jessica who says that everything is evil and makes trees land on people too (well, it drops a tree only once, but she says everything is evil). This film is about a farm that apparently rents rooms for people, but offers little else in terms of entertainment. Jessica can find things with a stick and find the head of an evil man. Obviously they don't know it until the owner of the farm helpers opens the box containing the head. The head proceeds to hypnotize everyone they can, so it can get to Jessica and use her powers to find things to help her search for her body. This film has a pretty interesting story, but here it goes very badly. Everyone in this movie will get on your nerves at least once.
