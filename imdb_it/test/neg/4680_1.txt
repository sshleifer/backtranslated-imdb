I recently became a big fan of Patton Oswalt. I think it's the most deliciously original comedian to come for centuries. It's refreshing and fearless in his routine, which covers the range of topics from how Bush sucks to the terrible exploits of the 1970s producer Robert Evans. I'm a longtime fan of Maria Bamford and her innocent / schizophrenic wide-eyed routine. Whenever he naturally passes his high-pitched voice naturally to one that is truncated and guttural, I can't help but giggle. I liked Brian Posehn a lot before I knew he was in "Just Shoot Me", and there's something so innately funny about his aging nerd character. All three of these talented unique comedians are titled "The Comedians of Comedy", a Netflix documentary on their US tour. They really deserve to be stars, and this tour gave them the recognition they deserve. I thought, no, I knew I would like this movie ... <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. Instead of the three comics that each have their own routine segments, "The Comedians of Comedy" is mired in sinuous and boring documentary scenes that contain no humor, no intuition, nothing of real interest. I think there are a total of 30 minutes of intermittent stand-up routines in the 109-minute movie. What a rip-off! Come on, is anyone really interested in seeing our star lines in their camper? Where is the humor in seeing Posehn in a gallery and in a comic book store? Does anyone find particularly amusing random diner scenes? If this movie could not show our comics browsing their stuff, at least make it on life on the road. It's not even about this. Worse yet, comics never seem to have fun. Oswalt admits how tired he is of doing a radio interview, Posehn harshly admits how much he sucks when he visits his home, and Bamford suddenly improvises whenever the camera is pointed at her, and his humor is only sporadic. /> <br /> Sheesh, these guys deserve the chance to show the world their unconventional, incredibly crafted humor, which is a refreshing change of pace from the mindless entertainment of traditional comics like Dane Cook. Instead, we have to sit down for their mundane daily routines on the road in a poor movie bore whose quality could easily be overcome by any student film. If you can locate any of Oswalt's, Posehn's or Bamford's performances on DVD, do it absolutely. Their talent should be a joy to watch, not a task like it is here.
