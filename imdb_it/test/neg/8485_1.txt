I can not believe! I thought this is a good sequel when Jim starred in the movie has a baby but instead it's a movie with lousy actors, stupid plot and silly scenes. This should be in the "sh * t shitty movies on earth". Thank God the director himself did not do this because this is so stupid with some cartoon parts like the fart was not funny, not the pee and not the dance! I laughed at this because of how stupid the person did this as a little Simpson man making a donut movie! I wish someone had a remake of the mask son with a story like this! The mask boy (Jim carry) and his wife have a son who is a normal child. When the child finds another mask he also becomes the mask and the mask boy tries to get his mask back! This is very disgusting so I'll give him a 1 out of 10. Fu * king sh * t!
