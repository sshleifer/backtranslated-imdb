A huge alien beast crashes into the earth and soon destroys the population first by using its laser gun to dissolve into dust almost every human it captures (ie when its aim is not terribly extinguished) and later its naked claws with which like to tear and eat the human spleen! <br /> <br /> All in all, it's pretty stupid stuff. I have to give him points to be a little funny at times. In the beginning I really enjoyed the brainless brainless battle and some of the effects of gore at the top. However it doesn't help when the monster provides the really fun moments of the movie and is not on screen for much of the movie's running time. The acting is simply horrible and amateurish and our main hero, Sheriff Cinder, is too unattractive to pack the hottest girl in the film. I also have to take off points to blatantly copy THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD (1951) on several occasions. When the monster is not in a rage, NIGHTBEAST is too boring and eventually its attacks become so repetitive and predictable even if they become less fun. Watch this again with the 1951 COSA and look at the difference in characterization, the attention to the plot and the details and the creation of suspense to a monster in the loose film.
