The largely forgettable 50s monster movie has really terrible special effects: the claw in question is a giant puppet that would make Jim Henson want to kill himself. I just saw the movie last Thursday and I can't even tell you who was in it. It's a bad sign. I was told that when the film was previewed, the audience laughed at it from the screen ... and that was in the 1950s when the special effects standards were much lower. Basically I should have left the theater as soon as the words "produced by Sam Katzman" appeared on the screen if I knew what was good for me, but then I sat in "Harum Scarum", so I think I deserve it.
