Rented (free rental thanks to God) this as presumably shot in CT where I live ... it could have been shot in a tunnel for everything that matters! Dark ninety percent of time, and just a terrible attempt at a low budget movie, which can be good if done right. In a nutshell, a group of young adults who watch a meteor fall, and then fall prey to aliens on a lighthouse island, assisted by caretaker and wife. Analysis: <br /> <br /> - acting = very bad <br /> <br /> - writing = uninspired <br /> <br /> - story = done a million times before with different settings <br /> <br /> - production values ​​= ok (lighting) for budget <br /> <br /> - effects (creature, digital, other) HORRIBLE, VERY ECONOMIC SEARCH FOR <br /> <br /> So, get l essence of it. To add insult to injury, the credits have been packed with footage - really now ...... who cares! Distributed under a Universal company, shocked that they would do so even after seeing. <br /> <br /> Finally, as an alternative, try "CREEP". Low budget, but well written, well acted and pretty, well, creepy!
