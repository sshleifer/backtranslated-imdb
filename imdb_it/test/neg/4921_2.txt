There is not enough space to explain the many ways in which this film is a disappointing mess. Stupid special effects and an incomprehensible plot are the last of the problems in this movie. The film appears to have been conceived in the mid-1980s and stewed until it was finally made in the early 1990s. The mullet-headed hero (complete with the fashionable three-day beard of Miami Vice), the cops stuck to Ronald Reagan, would be fun if he didn't take himself so seriously. As it is, the film is just pathetic. Actually I'm sorry for the poor actresses who have wasted their beautiful nude scenes in this terrible movie.
