The worst movie I've ever seen and seen. Acting is horrible, the plot is horrible, the idea is terrible, and no research has been done as ever! Ok, I admit, "Air Bud" was a good movie, but not "Soccer Dog". This "dog" is smaller than my cat! How can he play soccer? Even for 10-year-olds it will not be a problem to kick the ball hard enough to stop the stupid dog in half! It's horrible, don't watch this movie.
