This film was given to me and I have to admit that I'm glad I didn't pay for it. <br /> <br /> The back of the box makes it look like a sexual triangle, with 2 women trying to seduce her. But the reality in this film is far from that. <br /> <br /> Actually, the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the other two characters. There was absolutely nothing in this that I found interesting. <br /> <br /> Even films like Silence Of The Lambs and Wild Things (which the box tries to compare this film with) were compelling, due to unexpected turns and suspense. <br /> <br /> But Jaded has none of this. He focuses on the rapeist and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them. And the search for a videocassette that can prove the victims' story is true. <br /> <br /> While it shows that rape of the same sex is possible, it is not a film worth looking at. <br /> <br /> If possible, pass this film at all costs.
