What a horrible movie. This film was so out of order and so difficult to follow. It was so hard to follow and he was just confused. All the time I was watching, I was wishing it would be over !! I felt like I had wasted 2 hours of my life that I will never return. Save your money and don't rent this movie. Now I understand why Sarah Michelle Gellar was barely in the movie. The first film was great, but it was simply sucked. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Save your money and watch the trailer because it's the only thing worth seeing with this movie. Even this film had no real story. I'm still wondering what I've seen.
