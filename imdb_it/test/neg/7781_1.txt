If you want a complete waste of time, because tearing the fluff from your navel or cleaning the wax from your ears or grouting the tile is your idea of ​​a thrilling ride, so you won't want to miss this. <br /> <br /> First, forget the VHS cover. NO body in this film looks so attractive (ie, the Indian girl). Someone else commented that anyone who posed for the cover is not the same girl and I agree. The cover is the most exciting thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> To put this into perspective, I bought this VHS for 99 cents at K-Mart and three minutes, no, 40 seconds in the movie, I knew I was robbed. <br /> <br /> I finished watching him because 1) I paid 99 cents after all and, 2) maybe there was, presumably, a hair of luck that some scene in this turkey was worth more than a crushed loaf. <br /> <br /> It wasn't there. <br /> <br /> Nice pain, Fonda. I know you were tough for the roles when you did this, but this is below you.
