Film title - Tart <br /> <br /> Review date - 05/26/02 <br /> <br /> Year of the film - 2001 <br /> <br /> Stars - Dominique Swain, Brad Renfro, Bijou Phillips (barely), Melanie Griffith (barely) <br /> <br /> Evaluation of NeCRo - 4 skulls on 10 <br /> <br /> May contain spoilers <br /> <br /> Plot < br /> <br /> An "outcast" Dominique Swain wants to be with the "in" group and so abandons his true friends and unites them ....... many very annoying chatter occurs. Acting <br /> <br /> ugh, I think I got what I wanted in that Dominique was ok, but the man, the rest of the cast besides Brad Renfro maybe they were bad or at least not interesting or nice. I know some might say that the others were good because they made me hate them .... trust me ... I like the improbable inept but this group is unlikely because they can't be convincingly bad people. <br /> <Br /> He understands that the only other people for whom I had this were barely in it namely Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips, but the little time they had was ok. Melanie was talking maybe 2 lines, but at least Bijou had a good character although small. <br /> <br /> Violence and Gore <br /> <br /> My mind was constantly under attack from horrible dialogues and very annoying characters, this is enough violence !! ok there was a club with a rock that was ok. <br /> <br /> T & A Nudity Factor <br /> <br /> hahaha, they couldn't even add nudity to make this movie more spicy, probably because no one would want to bring their body for this shit. If they are going to expose themselves, they should do it in a movie where they will be remembered as their character and not for "oh hey, I heard you undress in this." <br /> <br /> General view of the film (review) <br /> <br /> ok ok I know that I am proud of being the person who can appreciate most if not almost all the movies or at least find something good in it. Well, this film is one of the few where I really struggled to find something worth joining. The problem with this movie is that it's damn annoying. I already have a deep hatred for the snobbish attitudes of the rich and this did not help either. This whole movie really is, it's just a bunch of rich people sitting around depressed and stupid. I can't stress the nuisance factor enough. This film tries to rework the plot of "In a group", which has been tried and true, which can usually be done well with little difficulty. <br /> <br /> Why don't I have a photo of the film or the cover? Well, I heard that this movie didn't deserve that glory, so I decided to put a picture of why I rented it, and this reason is none other than Dominique Swain. Yes, I too have been courted by her in Lolita and I thought it was so good that I decided thereafter to check her in all the movies she plays. At least I keep my promises and yes, I've seen most of his films, minus some hard to find. She is a great actress herself and I will actively defend her, but she chooses some of the most difficult films to interpret. This film and smokers are both in the same boat of crap, but at least smokers had a nice idea for a story and even some really nice scenes. <br /> <br /> Even the DVD box tries to convince you that this film also contains stars by putting the names of Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips in the front of the box. If there is one thing that P **** S me off is a film that glues the names of stars on a box to make you think "wow ha ____ I wonder how good ___ is in this that I saw ___ in that movie and I thought she was fantastic! "just to have the big names in the movie for a total of maybe 10 minutes between the 2. Bijou actually had a part that meant something in the semifinals. Melanie, on the other hand, has only 2 lines on .... Of course, I don't like Melanie very much, but it's about ethics and not star stars. <br /> <br /> Outside of all this mess, however, props must go to Brad Renfro to do an ok performance with Dominique. Brad could be a very messy child in real life, but at least he can act. So the only reason this film has skulls is because I got what I basically wanted, namely Dominique Swain and Brad Renfro. I also had the pleasure of seeing the underrated actress Bijou Phillips make me like her even more. So, even though I was annoyed, I came up with some positive aspects, although this time it was quite difficult. <br /> <br /> I advise you to see ONLY this if you have seen Lolita and you know how good Dominique is or if you are an unusual fan of Brad or Bijou. Uber Melanie fans will be extremely depressed. Also, if you are a fan of bad movies like me, please don't assume that this is a guilty pleasure because you will feel guilty, for the money spent on buying or renting. <br /> <br /> Some movies are "so bad that they are good" as the saying goes. What they forgot to add was "so bad that they are good (to be burgled)". <br /> <br /> NeCRo
