This version of Mansfield Park, while extremely accurate for the novel, lacked the compassion I felt for Fanny, which is crucial and central to this Jane Austen story. This is due to the actress's total lack of acting ability, Sylvestra Le Touzel. It had no charm and sometimes seemed to be lost in space or out of its depth. The scene he has with his uncle in which hysterics breaks is hysterical. He seriously exaggerated that crucial scene and in fact I was sorry that Henry Crawford ever interested him. <br /> <br /> The opposite is the portrait of Mary Crawford by Jackie Smith-Wood. What a wonderful actress, in a very difficult part to make that character witty and self-centered, selfish and vulnerable to love. <br /> <br /> I've always loved Fanny. It is mild, but with a relentless sense of what is right, and whoever thinks it is worthy of respect and admiration. Fanny in this adaptation is too gentle and submissive, almost without a thought of her until the end of the series. As much as I wanted to please this Fanny ... I couldn't. <br /> <br /> I suggest skipping this version of Mansfield Park for the real thing ... the novel. Fanny will not disappoint ... you will love her!
