It is too kind to call it a "fictionalized" account of Barker's band. They have the right names, but that's all. <br /> <br /> Russell is still warm, I guarantee you, but this is not the real Ma Barker, who basically took care of the kids cooking and assisting when they move around the country, not planning or participating in crimes. I think it would have been much more interesting to present the true story of a middle-aged woman involved in the criminal activities of her children and friends. <br /> <br /> I also have to agree with those reviewers that I found the scenes to shoot absolutely incredible. The victims of Barker / Karpis were a combination of innocents and police officers who persecuted them, but they certainly did not mow half a dozen FBI agents each time they were cornered. (On the other hand, as many recent books have related, the FBI of that time emphasized the idea that agents only came from legal or accounting contexts to the extent that many agents had very few law enforcement experiences or of firearms. - trained agents that we imagine today. <br /> <br /> But the worst sin is that the film is basically boring. Nobody changes, nobody grows. We know that the end of the road is ahead, we just don't know what the shots will be. <br /> <br /> Only for Russell fans.
