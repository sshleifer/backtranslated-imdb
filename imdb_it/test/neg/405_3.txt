36/100. This should not be confused with decent arachnophobia, this film is a very low budget and an economic scam of that movie. This is so ugly, it actually has some entertainment value at that level. There are numerous (unintentionally) unintended laughter out loud. I didn't expect much from the movie, and it was actually worse than I imagined. <br /> <br /> It is a clich√© driven and predictable directly from the video chaos. Fortunately, he doesn't take himself too seriously. Acting, as expected, is not quite an Oscar caliber. The special effects are poor, worse than I thought they would be. Badly modified and the score is intrusive.
