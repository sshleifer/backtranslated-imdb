By strange coincidence I started following this move right after Brice de Nice and the beauty is that not many films could be worse than Brice de Nice, so I couldn't wait to do something better that would make me forget this horrible flop. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the OSS-117 has left me disappointed again - I don't know, maybe it's just a problem with the translations, but since "Diner de Cons" I've never seen any French comedy I'd call really good. Even if I look at the reviews on IMDb, only the people from France are giving the high notes OSS-117 ... <br /> <br /> For me this movie didn't really work - in some parts it's as fun as a real Bond movie , in others the jokes were a little too predictable or too trivial.
