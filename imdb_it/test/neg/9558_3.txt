My girlfriend wanted to see this (lol this is the case a lot) ... so I rented it. Then I saw how this award was acclaimed for 10 Academy Awards. GREAT! this should be a good drama. This film had a lot of potential ... the direction and the way everything was rhythmic was very good. But once the film was finished, I couldn't help wondering if it was really worth making a movie for this story. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was EXTREMELY irritating, I absolutely could not tolerate her character. Warren Beatty was excellent in acting in the film, but again I found it difficult to have sympathy for his character ... he simply came out as an idiot, a gangster's hot hot head ... who had no place in the life in the first place. How did he get in with Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano anyway ??? This film left me with just a bland but uncomfortable feeling ... what was the big deal with this movie? I didn't feel a completeness with Bugsy. Beatty's antics, though played well enough, seemed too casual and illogical. I guess this is how Siegel really was ... but it was too much. There doesn't seem to be much of a true story here. My basic assessment would be <br /> <br /> "a hot-headed gangster, a playboy, a little likeable falls in love with a woman's loser, has the idea of ​​'Las Vegas' .... but his unsuccessful attempt at the casino building, along with having no regard for his crowd bosses' money, makes him kill. "<br /> <br /> What else is there besides this? I didn't see the big deal with this, and it was a big disappointment. There were not many films to be released in 1991, as was nominated for 10 Oscars is beyond me (although the two won is justifiable). 1.5 / 4 stars.
