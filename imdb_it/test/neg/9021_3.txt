What distinguishes some of the "Lone Star" films (and many others in the western and adventure films of the early 1930s) was the lack of what we recognize as an ant-tale. To make sure they had the good against evil (the basic element of every Westerner), the boy meets the girl and some reserve characters, like the old breeder and his beautiful daughter or granddaughter, and sometimes the evil banker or other businessman, but the action was often different from movie to film. <br /> <br /> 'The Lawless Frontier' presents Earl Dwire in his big star turn (non) as (for some inexplicable reason) Pandro Zanti, an Apache medium, half American posing like a Mexican who speaks fluent language . "His biggest Mexican pose seemed to be his outrageous mariachi clothes. The only plot seems to be that he wants to steal Ruby," Old Dusty's niece "(Gabby Hayes). When he meets her for the first time, Dwire the he takes a long look that makes him enter the big leagues with sexual predators.You might think that because the opening scene shows that Zanti kills John (Wayne), Tobin's father out of the camera would have played a bigger role important in the film. Not so, too much back and forth between heroes and villains. <br /> <br /> We get a lot of good stunts, though, from Yakima Canutt, including pulling Ruby on his horse when he rides, jumping on "renegades" and knocking them out of their horses, a horse leaps from a cliff into a lake, and even it slides down the closed sequence of "The Lucky Texan" (1934), although this time the Mighty Yak uses a body log instead of riding a tree branch, and its inclu sion is just as illogical this time as well, given that they are in a desert. <br /> <br /> The highest point is clearly the well-photographed and methodical walk of John Wayne through the desert after his escape and stumbling Zanti with those fantastic basalt cliffs of Red Rock Canyon (seen in countless serials, westerns and science fiction movie "moon" framed behind him. No duel at the last shot at fifty paces with the heroine escaping from the wooden steps of the bar to hug and kiss the conquering hero in this movie! When John Wayne finally reaches him, Zanti drinks water poisoned by a pool of water and dies. <br /> <br /> After a couple of too many chase sequences, Zantai's band is finally captured in Dusty's cabin, emerging one after the other from behind a revolving locker that apparently leads to a canyon, now blocked from being dynamized. No sunset ride or mandatory kissing the girl: The last blow is Ruby, now Mrs. John Tobin, on the phone with Sheriff John Tobin, "What would Sheriff Tobin want for dinner?" The film also has poor lighting and editing at the beginning, the pace is slow, some parts with the sheriff cause the drag and the pursuits of the horses fill the film. So, despite the different and unusual elements, it looks like one of the weakest Lone Stars.
