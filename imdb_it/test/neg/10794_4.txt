The Camals Are Coming is a rather disappointing 1934 English comedy. I bought it because I like adventures in the desert and I declare it to be a drama. It certainly isn't. <br /> <br /> It is a couple that goes to Egypt to capture some desert drug traffickers. <br /> <br /> It would have been much better if it had been made as a drama instead of a comedy, which leaves it much. It is rather silly in some parts. Deposit this, there are some action and setting scenes. <br /> <br /> The cast is led by Jack Hulbert and Anna Lee as the love interest. <br /> <br /> A vision is sufficient for this film. Overall, a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5 stars.
