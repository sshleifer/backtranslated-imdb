The casting (and direction) in Undercurrent is more bland than inspired in this noir horn that fails to take off from the start. Robert Taylor's wooden style almost immediately sets a checkpoint for Kate Hepburn, who is very struck, and is a bad chemistry from the start. <br /> <br /> Naive and innocent Ann Hamilton (Hepburn) falls in love with airplane manufacturer Alan Garroway (Taylor) and rushes to the altar with him. He soon finds out that there is a lot he doesn't know about him. While Alan becomes more remote, he further delves into the dark past and Ann finds herself living a nightmare instead of the American dream. <br /> <br /> Undercurrent resembles a few Hitchcock plots but Vincent Minnelli quickly establishes that he is not the master of suspense. Hepburn is not a purple that is shrinking and she is a tough sell for a character more suited to the reticent styles of Teresa Wright or Joan Fontaine. Minnelli never manages to convince Kate to postpone Taylor's limited ability as an actor in a desperate manner. His attempts are revealed as silent Gish while Taylor's broad descent into madness takes control of Bela Lugosi. Robert Mitchum completes the miscasting as the sensitive brother. Talk about accumulation. <br /> <br /> Filmmaker Karl Freund offers some highly stylized noir interiors, but Minnelli and the cast meekly use the rooms and the tension remains warm. With Minnelli far from his forte (musical) and the victim role of Hepburn who is dressing her like a bad dress, Undercurrent drowns all those involved.
