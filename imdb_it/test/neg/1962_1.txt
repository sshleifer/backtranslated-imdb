In all, it took me three attempts to get past this film. Although it is not total rubbish, I have found a number of things that are more useful for dedicating my time, such as removing my fingernails with sandpaper. <br /> <br /> The actors involved must feel more or less like the people who act in herpes drug commercials do; people will not pay to see, the reputation you gain will not be the best for you personally, but at least the ads will have time to send. <br /> <br /> The first one was negative, but this gave the bad word is a completely new definition, but it has a good feature: if your children annoy you by letting them watch R-rated movies before you want, legal and blow up this little gem. Watch the whining stop and the tears begin. ;)
