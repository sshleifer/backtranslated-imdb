I enjoyed watching Lost from the beginning and endured some bad actors in badly written episodes because when Lost is good, it's really good! But this episode that sees the disappearance of Echos has had so many scenes with persistent close-ups of bad acting that I found myself beating the fast forward button. This episode has distinguished itself as the worst so far. In fact, the variation in the quality of Lost has been so inconsistent, I often find myself wondering how many writers they are using. <br /> <br /> I will continue to watch but I hope things improve and I hope to stop wishing secretly for the sub-par actors of the series to die.
