This documentary was very amateur. It may have been made by university students. Assuming it was, my assessment is as follows. Contents: C, Audio quality: F, Photography: F, Acting: D, Soundtrack: F, Casting: C, Boobshot: A ...... Overall grade: D <br /> <br /> I found myself Sea sickness as we walked the streets with the characters, hopping up and down with every move of the cameraman's pace. My mother-in-law even changed the batteries in her miraculous ear and could not hear the muffled dialogue. The extensive post production and CGI modification would not help this bomb. These students would barely "pass" my course. My advice ... don't waste your time or money on "A".
