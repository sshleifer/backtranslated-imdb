Actually I saw this movie in the cinema. At the time I worked in shifts and went there during a matinee on a hot summer day when I couldn't sleep. The cinema was air-conditioned. <br /> <br /> It was one of the first multi-screen systems and somehow I found myself in the wrong place. I was going to doze through something else. But while things were happening, there would be no sleep. Shortly after the wrong film started, I was also baffled by a group of cleaners who came in and used it as their social club. I was the only other person there, and it is a measure of the appeal of the film that they usually expected the place to be empty and asked me if I was worried about their presence. I did not. <br /> <br /> In about half an hour, the conversation of the cleaners proved more interesting than the entertainment I had paid for. <br /> <br /> This movie came out off screen with the cheesiness of very stale mayonnaise. The type that has small dark, hairy tufts that grow on the surface. I remember in particular that my senses were attacked by strident musical strings that spread with very little warning and even less meaning. The cleaners provided an anticipatory inspiration by putting their fingers in their ears. <br /> <br /> It was a bird of the city that was going to live among the sticks among a load of ordinary people, putting them straight but at the same time teaching a moral lesson or two itself. Like you do. A sort of "journey of discovery". There was a sententious satisfaction for the entire production. In particular, the leading actress had the irritating habit of staring at every boy with a kind of intense, blessed compassion, as if she herself were the patron saint of thickened. <br /> <br /> And I think at some stage she wrote a book. <br /> <br /> Long before the end, I was fascinated by one of the silent and respiratory tails of sexual misconduct. <br /> <br /> It is suspected that there are some to whom sitting quietly for a couple of hours and not having to think, constitutes a meditation. The best I can say is that I would not share their salad. <br /> <br /> I've never seen this film advertised as shown on television, which surprises me. It's just the kind of dad who is projected in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having a job. <br /> <br /> If you ever work shifts, make sure you enter the right theater. Or hope for some cleaning lady.
