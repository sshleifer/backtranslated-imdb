Sideshow is a good example of a fundamentally interesting idea that went very, very badly. As for horror movies, and especially with the influx of teen movies right now, a movie based on a group of teenagers taking part in a mysterious show is something you could have a lot of fun with. <br /> <br /> However, the writer has decided to make a very straight, very boring, very clear story about five teenagers who become part of the show when Abbot Graves marooned turns them into monsters using a pathetic machine that turns them into beasts. <br /> <br /> The five teenagers are extracted one by one until the last one is left, his "punishment" is that he is unable to join his friends and therefore "be alone". What a load of garbage! <br /> <br /> The "actors" are really poor, this film has no comedy (and it would have been so funny!), no gore (and could have been so bloody!), no action and no horror (and would have could have so much of both!) <br /> <br /> The director has failed in his duty to even try to make this a bit interesting to watch. His experience in the soft-core has obviously disabled any creativity he has ever had, as all the shots are the same, with very few changes and few movements. Overall quality is poor. <br /> <br /> I am usually not influenced by nudity in movies, but believe me the only strength in this film was a pair of breasts.
