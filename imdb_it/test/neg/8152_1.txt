Being (a little) an independent director myself, I really understand what these guys were trying to do and it seems like a good idea. On paper. On the 16mm film, however, it's horrible. I didn't realize that it had been done in the mid-1990s because the film was so gritty and bad that I could have sworn this was one of those 30-year-old movies where a porn producer was trying to become mainstream. And the sound! Uh, I don't know what kind of mic they were using to record, but it seems like someone is walking on dead leaves for the whole thing. I guess I shouldn't judge too harshly, after all, how many movies did my company put out? Nobody, but I'd like to think that we would have at least a good image and sound quality to go with our poor acting, writing and directing. A + for idea, F-- for execution.
