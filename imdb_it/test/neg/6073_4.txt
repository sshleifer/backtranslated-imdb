Yes, I realize that half a dozen other reviewers have called this film "Copying Amadeus", but not enough. The scenes seemed to have been raised directly from Milos Forman's script with only superficial changes. You can expect to see: <br /> <br /> - The master's arrogant scene ("I am the voice of God. Everything else makes no sense!") <br /> <br /> - The master takes in around the work of mediocre composer (complete with raspberries and simulated flatulence, just like in Amadeus) <br /> <br /> - Dialogue of the mediocre composer with god ("Why you instill me with music but denies me the ability to compose ? ") <br /> <br /> - The musical dictation from the death bed scene (" Common time Start with the violins ... cough ") <br /> <br /> - and the list goes on. .. <br /> <br /> The problem is even worse. Not only were these scenes copied without shame, they weren't even done very well. Jeepers, if you're going to rip an original, at least you should try to improve it in your creative way. <br /> <br /> Don't wait, there's something even worse. It is the fact that the director tried to beat the Mozart story in Beethoven's story. Folks, Beethoven was not as vulgar or vulgar as this film portrays him. Furthermore, Beethoven was not a stuttering idiot who takes directions from his copyist, a 23-year-old music student. Unfortunately, films like this are responsible for the history of the slaughterhouse. <br /> <br /> And another thing, Beethoven (in real life) has never called it the "Moonlight Sonata" as it does in the film. That name was given by a confused critic a few years AFTER BEETHOVEN DEAD, and unfortunately he remained stuck. But Beethoven's original title was "Almost a Fantasia". <br /> <br /> AND ANOTHER THING, when Beethoven (in the film) shouts "B-flat! B-flat! B-flat!" and hits the note on the piano, pressing a white key! <br /> <br /> AND ANOTHER PENDANT !!! Beethoven (in real life) was completely deaf for several years before the composition of his 9th Symphony. This film shows that he barely has a small disability (saying "what?" Any other line, just enough to be boring). <br /> <br /> AAAND !! ANNNOTHER !!! THINGGGG ... !! American accents ...! Oh it doesn't matter. Do not worry. I've already lost enough time on this. Go see "Amadeus" again. So, if you want to see an interesting biographical film about Beethoven's life, see "Immortal Beloved" which takes poetic liberties, but at least they are interesting ideas. Finally, if you want to see something on the lighter side, take a look at "Impromptu", a film about Chopin. But apart from these three, I've never seen a good tribute to a classical composer.
