There are some horror filmmakers for whom I have accumulated so much respect and admiration over the years that I can't let myself know what trash I decide to put on film. Lucio Fulci is certainly one of them, but damned, he's trying to disappoint me with his latest efforts! You can easily afford to skip most of the movies that Fulci directed or produced during the late 1980s and instead simply look at "Cat in the Brain", because that one picks up and repeats the best movie of no less than SEVEN other Fulci-flicks, including the most serious murder sequences featured in "When Alice Broke the Mirror". Overall, this film is definitely one of our director's weakest and most useless results. The script is inconsistent, the basic premise is totally unlikely and a bit silly and there is absolutely no suspense to be enjoyed. I love the title, but in reality it has no meaning. There is a character named Alice in the story, but it is only a supporting role and certainly does not break any mirror. I suppose he could break things up just by using his voice, since he's an opera singer, but he doesn't. The plot revolves around a middle-aged playboy and gambling enthusiast who spends his days seducing the rich widows and killing them for their money. Lester Parson slaughters women (as well as unwelcome witnesses) in gruesome ways, creates steaks with the juiciest parts of the body and feeds the remains of her cat. There is also a stupid secondary psychological plot in which he thinks his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him. The difference between "When Alice Broke the Mirror" and some of Fulci's greatest horror films ("The Beyond", "The city of the living dead", ?? ") lies in the fact that he doesn't bother to create a horrible I characters, including Lester, are colorless and boring and the murders are normally depicted, as if it were the most common thing in the world to put a woman's head in a microwave oven or run back and forth over a human body repeatedly with a car. The lighting is poor, the super-ugly cinematography, the clumsy and amateur editing and the performances are decidedly miserable.If you didn't know, I would think that Lucio deliberately made a bad film to protest against all the harsh critics who don't like his repertoire, no matter how much spirit and effort has put us in. The obvious element to appreciate here is simply the outrageous blood and bloodshed, because even the attempt to camouflage oneself in a black comedy does not works properly. swings around his chainsaw and cuts women's feet, "When Alice Broke the Mirror" is an undemanding piece of horror entertainment, but apart from that, there's not much to recommend.
