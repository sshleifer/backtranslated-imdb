If you thought this was the French The Mummy and if you hope for another "Vidocq" ... well, look elsewhere. It has the same kind of story as the mummy of this book of the dead and a soul that needs to find 7 missing pieces scattered in the Louvre. I found the movie a bit funny, for the most part boring. The special effects are not bad, but it's nothing spectacular since I was expecting big explosions and maybe the eiffel tower crumbled until I realized that those scenes were in The mummy and this is Belhpegor. Apparently based on a French cult TV series, Belphegor could have been much better. I voted this movie a 4/10 just for the beautiful Sophie Marceau ... she must be almost 40 and she looks breathtaking!
