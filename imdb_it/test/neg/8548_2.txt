YOU BELONG TO ME (1941) is an example of the "ScrewBall Comedy" which began in the mid-30s and ended in the post-war period (World War II). Some of these films have retained their status. Others earned the undeserved praise when they were originally on critical flops and at the box office. Like BRINGING UP BABY (1938) or MR. & MRS. SMITH (1941). Then there is this value that continues to sink. <br /> <br /> Because it can be rooted in the script / story. It tests credibility from the start, betraying a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to the millionaire HENRY FONDA who is madly jealous. He would settle for sitting down with his million dollars and loving her, he wants to keep his profession as a doctor. She wants him to become what his eyes are a useful member of society. This conflict should be fun. It cannot be recovered by the principals or by the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> Defects in this scenario can clearly be placed at the feet of DALTON TRUMBO. The character of HENRY FONDAs is written so broadly that every viewer has an immediate dislike for him. BARBARA STANWYCK has nothing to do but react to any idiotic jealousy. TRUMBO must have spent a lot of time outside the studio to be a "useful idiot", so being at work. Obviously COLUMBIA didn't get him his money, maybe he should have taken over ROBERT RISKIN.
