I love ghost stories and sit in a movie until the end, even if I don't really like it. I rarely feel like I've wasted my time ... BUT, this adaptation of the Bell Witch story was horrible! <br /> <br /> It was not frightening in any way. What is with moments of comic relief? Dialogue was boring. Inconsistent recitation The film was too long and some scenes were unnecessarily designed in my open. (Like the birthday party) <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can think of mentioning is that the costumes and props were well made. <br /> <br /> I am curious about other adaptations, but until then, I will continue to read the story.
