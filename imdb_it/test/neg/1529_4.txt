First of all, season 1 is intolerably bad. Prison is ridiculously unrealistic, the characters are so two-dimensional that they are almost transparent and the direction is terrible. It runs like a bad video of a middle school play, characters wandering in front of the camera and uttering timed and proven lines, passing through a random speech in prison. Soon the show will improve, but not by much. The return from the commercial break is always accompanied by a ridiculous monologue of Augustus Hill linked to the wheelchair, interpreted impressively by Harold Perrineau. The only time his character is constantly bad is during the monologues of the art of bad performance, most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with what is happening in the show . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the bad ideas of Oz could fill an encyclopedia of different volumes. Consider the whole situation, first of all. The prisoners are able to come out in plain sight by getting drunk, using drugs, and not only do they have CD players (CDs could even pass us steak knives), but all incoming mail is carefully examined by PRISONERS. Christ, the place is like a club for men with guards. Guards who don't do much. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the second season, a nephew of an older prisoner is diagnosed with leukemia, and all prisoners insert thick $ 20 and $ 50 bills to help send him to Disneyworld to meet the his dying desire. These must be the richest prisoners in the world. Every single Oz prisoner suddenly became considerate, loving the boys except Kenny Wangler, an irritating character but one of the only ones who is constantly convincing. Even Adibisi wanted to be kind. But that's okay, because there is no order or sense in the show, so even this is not very distracting. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, in a shocking way, there is a boxing scene in which a prisoner wears a "I Love Cops T-shirt. In prison !! Can you imagine? I have a cousin who was in I sent him an old photo with some friends in high school, and in the photo, one of my friends was holding an "I Love Cops" sticker, and one of the "woods" (boys who were in jail for years and years) has seen the image but has simply grabbed it and ripped it to shreds. My cousin was lucky <br /> <br /> Kenny Wangler also constantly scolds the guards and even the older officers for not calling him Bricks "One of them even tried to bribe him to go on an English course. You can lose track of who is responsible, prisoners or guards. More than one detective, for example, enters the prison under cover and is killed trying to stop drug trafficking I would just like to stop leaving ch and the prisoners inspect the incoming mail rather than risk the lives of the investigators. <br /> <br /> Let's see, what else? Shillinger's son, OD, is in solitary confinement and no one thinks of asking the guard how he took the drug. He just ... got them, I guess. And be sure to pay attention, otherwise you'll miss the reason prisoners have enough money to be able to afford axillary dermal grafts when they get bad gums. I didn't know that the guests in the highest security prisons were offered such luxurious treatment options. How about this, when Robson asks about Dr. Faraj's program so that he can ask what kind of gums he's been given, Faraj is so terrified that he goes to the director and leaves his job on the spot. Doctors and dentists do not have the right to ask not to see some prisoners? After Poet and O'Reilly made the announcement to the entire prison, Robson asks to see Dr. Faraj, and is escorted to his office, brought in without knocking, and the guard leaves immediately without a word. They could even give him a gun. <br /> <br /> I shouldn't keep talking about stupid ideas on this show, but it's like a flood, I can't stop it. Who thought of Chinese refugees who can't speak Chinese and disappear from view unless they are needed? Who thought of the silly religious wars and all the reverend prisoners? But who of Robson's rubber transplant? What is the problem with Busmalis and Agamennone? Agamemnon because he clearly does not belong in prison and Busmalis because of the whole affair with his nephew. Macbeth, because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end, so to speak. <br /> <br /> But what are the worst ideas? Things that are not going anywhere, that are constant. An Irishman arrives in prison and builds a bomb. Threat to detonate the entire prison, the bomb turns out to be a real disaster, and the episode ends with him as he is taken away by the bomb squad after the entire prison has been evacuated. Nothing has ever been heard by him or the whole situation again. It's like it never happened. In one episode, inmates are given dogs to train. What the hell?? If this isn't bad enough, during a training session, a guard shoots his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise. No one seems to mind. <br /> <br /> I also like how every time some sort of altercation erupts, the culprits are put aside, they don't say anything and the guards or guard or sister Pete or anyone else says "I hope you don't think that I'll let this go !! " And then they move away and let go. The public will not remember. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm spoiled by Prison Break, but Oz is just a crazy prison drama that could be better as a show. A short one. At least a low budget movie. There is not enough to support a multi-season TV show. Then again, I watched six seasons on DVD. Sometimes I don't understand myself ...
