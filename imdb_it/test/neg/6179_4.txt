So as far as I understand, this episode is trying to make a statement about how the bad guys in real life are very bad people, and that's just as scary as the paranormal. The "paranormal" imagery associated with the villain, Donnie, is purely symbolic. In reality it is just a normal human being. <br /> <br /> The problem is that I simply don't buy it. Donnie is not simply scarier than the paranormal. It's not even that scary. As a guy who looks confused and bizarre rather than mischievous, loves girls and dead hair, and has just become a murderer, he is much less disturbing than the most famous real-life serial killer (for example: it's like a VERY watered down version of Ed Gein). That's why Scully's horror of seeing only bodies with hair and nails cut off (something not very different from a normal personal hygiene routine), before anyone was killed or hurt at all, is completely out of character . He sees things a hundred times worse in almost all the other episodes and hardly answers. <br /> <br /> So, as Comic Book Guy says ... "The worst episode EVER!"
