What I liked most about this film was the chance to see Joan Woodbury, who struck me as one of the many beauties of the Charles Boyer classic "Algiers", in a leading role. She is as good as Rita, an orphan who gets up to be the mistress of the crime. His ascent to the top reminds me of the characters of Joan Crawford, for example. Mildred Pierce, who realizes her ambitions with fierce determination and willpower. If you are looking for a classic film noir, better look elsewhere. At different points, it is difficult to know where this story is going. I had the first impression that would have enclosed the plot of Rita for revenge against her father and son who deceived her into taking rap for a death to drunk driving perpetrated by the playboy's son. But the return time of the investment was only a marginal point and a springboard for the second part of the film, a bit confusing, in which Rita is increasingly involved in the corruption of the city. However, it's only 72 minutes, so a second view should clear up any nebulosity. My copy comes from a platinum casket called "Mobster Movie". The image quality is good, but the soundtrack sucks, continually skipping fragments of dialogue. There are eight films in the $ 5.50 box, making each movie a decent 69 cents. Look for Anne Archer's father, John Archer, as Rita's childhood friend, Bob. Alan Ladd doesn't get much screen time. It is definitely the photo of Joan Woodbury.
