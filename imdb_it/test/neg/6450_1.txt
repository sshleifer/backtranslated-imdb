Tug-3 is absolutely right. Although I am sure that Mr. Osmond wanted to make a sincere and moving Christmas film, this is cynical and disturbing as it comes. The religious meaning of Christmas is forgotten and replaced by cute children, incapable adults and evil villains. Production values ​​show that this film was shot with little money or by really inexperienced filmmakers - I suspect that the latter, unfortunately. The worst part, strangely enough, is really the music. You would think that someone with a long-standing musical career could do better than the title song, but you would be wrong. My mother didn't like this movie either, and she likes osmonds and cheesy stuff.
