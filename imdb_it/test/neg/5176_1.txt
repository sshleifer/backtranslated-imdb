This is probably the worst kind of cockney gangster who has ruined the British film industry since Mitchney Guy Ritchie unleashed Lock Stock and two badly made barrels. This story of "True Life" by Carlton Leach (who?) It has everything wrong with this genre, a really terrible script made up of people screaming "Cant", "Fahcking Cant" and "I'll kill ya, ya fahcking can "nausea. The acting is uniformly terrible with the two most recognizable cast members who are two former soap stars quite visibly out of their depth. For some reason the film assumes that we have heard of these people and I can assure you that nobody north of Essex has not done so, and that we should be interested in some low life story. Why? This is not Goodfellas despite the blurb on the DVD cover. The story centers on a soccer hooligan who turned the bouncer into gangster and friends end up getting shot. Boo hoo. The fact that these people are totally unpleasant is the only minor advantage of this film. In all the action scenes it seems that the camera was tied to a piece of string and spun around while people pretended to fight and the story of someone most people never heard of and nothing happens. really interesting is a complete waste of time. People talk about how violent the film is as if it were the sign of a great movie and, although many great films have violence in them, this is just an excuse for the FX man to show what he can do. Overall this film is a reminder of why the British film industry is dead and the sooner we stop funding these pathetic abortions, the better.
