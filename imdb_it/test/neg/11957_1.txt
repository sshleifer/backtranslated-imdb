This is an extremely horrible film. And if you think you've seen another horrible movie, just like this one before, you probably did. You probably saw Scarecrow 2 made in 2003. Yes, that's what I said, Brian (the director) stole the idea of ​​the movie. And not only has he stolen it, he may actually have been able to make things worse. I bet that even the actors were afraid to tell people that they were actually in the movie. I must also mention that the director was trying to compensate for his generosity by showing as many tits as possible. Even the kissing scenes were put together like a porn movie. In fact, it's probably all the director has ever seen and tried to put together a decent film that will never work.
