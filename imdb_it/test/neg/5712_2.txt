This is a glossy soft-porn; a boring soap opera focused on one thing: sex. They actually made sex boring, sad to say, because I challenge you to look at it casually and tell me what the plot was. What it is, is an excuse for Kim Bassinger to show his great body and for Mickey Rourke to smile a lot. That's all. Rourke's complacency is so ugly that it is disgusting and Bassinger, despite the great figure, seems cheaper than beautiful. Congratulations to the photographer for some beautiful close-up shots and wonderful colors, but the story is so weak - no character development and no storyline - it can't compensate. Let's face it: this film was made for one reason only - to tickle male viewers. At that level, he probably succeeded. If I remember, that's why I gave a look to a fan of Bassinger's looks, but in reality I was also expecting a story. <br /> <br /> Those who try to switch to this as "arty" and something deeper than soft porn is just making fun of it.
