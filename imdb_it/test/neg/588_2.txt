I didn't like this movie for many reasons - VERY BORANTE! It was interesting how they thought about what the future would look like in this, but seriously I was very bored watching this. There was almost no action. Although the soundtrack of the classical orchestra was very pretty. The images were very creative. Whenever this movie appears on TV, I want to change the station instantly. Not because it's a bad movie, just because I know what I'm in when I watch this - complete and utter boredom. It is a film that I saw as a young man, but I never entered the history of science fiction ... because it simply wasn't real. Just like this movie - very unrealistic. I never understood even half of the film.
