Damn awful! There is no other way to say it. Indeed, it is ** SO bad that the only reason I'm wasting words on this is to warn other reasonable viewers who want to be entertained intelligently. You will lose I.Q. points to watch this. Come to think of it, it's not even suitable for brainless vision because of the irritation factor. There is no guilt in looking at something incompetent. <br /> <br /> Reasons to avoid it: <br /> <br /> 1) Horribly scientifically inaccurate, to the point that this is no longer science fiction, it's just a sloppy, lazy and fantastic fantasy. <br /> <br /> 2) These are FX that are incredible. Not even kitsch is a wink and a nod, like Doctor Who vintage, but it's cheap and poor to the point of being insulting. FX is so bad that it's not even ridiculous. They spent about a dollar and a half on this, not more. <br /> <br /> 3) The management is so weak and senseless that the only way the actors could get to the end of the shoot without becoming depressed to pass the sleep scene through their roles, although Catherine McCormack he made some effort anyway, probably on principle and despite the director. Furthermore, this is not the only ugly movie by Peter Hyams: his flubs are much more numerous than those barely recoverable, of which Timecop was the last, and 15 years before this writing. he hasn't had anything halfway decent since End of Days was just as crappy, Arnold was the only draw, and he needed a much more solid direction than that provided by Hyams). Hyams continues to make it increasingly useless for anyone to consider giving him more work. <br /> <br /> And finally, <br /> <br /> 4) The stories of Ray Bradbury deserve much better treatment than this. Refusing to watch this movie sends this message, not that Hollywood is particularly listening. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk. If you do it and turn it off completely, you only have yourself (and Hyams) to blame because you have been more than properly warned.
