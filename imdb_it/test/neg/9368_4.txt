Or did anyone else notice the fact that the first group of episodes is too inspired by films from the 90s? <br /> <br /> I mean seriously wife who is trying to convince someone else to kill her rich husband so that he can claim his possessions. Media medicine students who are temporarily stopping their hearts to reach memories that are lost; Flatliners. A group of university bodies come together again to remember the old days but they are not entirely at ease because they did something in the past, Very bad things? Groundhog Day is one of my favorite movies of all time. Sadly enough the editorial staff behind his bullshit is a bunch of lazy bastards who can't invent their original scripts. <br /> <br /> The noble idea is totally fused in its execution.
