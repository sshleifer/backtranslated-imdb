actors cannot act. all the dialectic was plagued by bad accents and loss of character. Channing Tatum never moves his lips or changes his facial expression ... NEVER. <br /> <br /> the story is not new at all. a street kid gets involved in a professional dance world and turns his life around. what goes with the whole incident involving the boy is taken directly from You Got Served and Save the Last Dance (I'm not saying that even those films were good, but this means that this film didn't bring anything new to the table ). <br /> <br /> and dancing ... There were only 3 dance sequences in the whole film and 2 of them were taken directly by the clerk. maybe I'm too critical because I'm a dancer, but maybe that's what needs to be heard. Channing Tatum is NOT a b-boy at all. his little solo in the parking lot had little style, technique, or any wow factor, which are all part of the criteria of a street dancer. All the jazz and the ballet of the film had nothing to offer except bad technique and some acceptable pinwheels, but nothing more. the grand finale left me thinking "... OK, now they will become serious" until the end when I realized it would never happen. <br /> <br /> I certainly admit it is difficult to make a good dance film, but Step up is no exception to the rule. You Got Goted, with the exception of his inconsistencies with the street dance culture, had at least the dance aspect. Save the Last Dance was rubbish, and so it was pretty much any musical from the last 10 years (although I was impressed with Moulin Rouge) ... look at the Ballet Center Stage, look at Beat Street for Hip-Hop
