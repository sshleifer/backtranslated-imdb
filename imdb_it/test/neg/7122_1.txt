To begin with, I didn't bother to see The Grudge. The previews for that film didn't make me jump, they didn't scare me or entertain me. But when a group of friends asked me to go see The Grudge 2, I accepted the invitation, a little curious to know what this film would be like. I went mainly because of my friends. Not even 5 minutes into this film, I realized I had thrown away $ 7.50. The acting from the beginning is horrible. The female students at first seem to have never acted in all their lives. Thus, the plot of the film takes over. Let me tell you, I couldn't stop laughing at this whole movie. He is simply so stupid. I'm pretty sure they tried not to scare him. They don't blow anything or anything. Show the children, then show them "attackers". It builds on it, it's not something "suddenly". And even in the middle of the film, the heart of the film, acting is still horrible. Leave so much time between the dialogue for someone to add in your comments. This film is honestly one of the funniest "horror" movies I've ever seen. Written badly, horrible acting, horrible script, horrible cast "incapable of acting" and a horrible concept. The film darkens and changes situations more than you can count. At the end of the film, each part runs out and then binds. I would never pay to see this movie again. I wouldn't even watch it on cable, for free. This film is a joke. Please DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE !!
