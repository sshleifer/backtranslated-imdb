So this guy walks into a psychiatrist's office for his first date. After the paperwork is finished, the psychiatrist says "I'll show you the ink stains, tell me what you see in them". "Well, says the patient," looking at the first, "I see a man and a woman having sex." In seeing the second, he says "I see two women having sex". Seeing the third, he says "I see two men having sex". In seeing the next, he says "I see two men and two women having sex". The psychiatrist puts down the ink stains. "So", he says, "we will begin by discussing your monomania". "My monomania?" the boy says. "And you with all these dirty images!" This is how this film strikes me.
