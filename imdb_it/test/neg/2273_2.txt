Oh yes, I have to agree with the others that describe it terrifying. The acting in this four-hour film is uniformly negative, so serious that I find it impossible to believe that none of the actors in this production can make a living as an actor. I still wonder who did the casting. Everyone offers their own lines without seeming to have any kind of commitment or emotional investment with any other character. No one seems to have a real relationship, family or other, with another. The direction is also terrifying and any action scene is ridiculous and unconvincing. Were the film's editors asleep? <br /> <br /> The costumes seem authentic to the Regency period, but the fabrics look like 20th century and the colors (especially the blue colors!) are out of tune and I don't think they were available at the beginning of the 19th century, except perhaps in silk . <br /> <br /> Even the hair: men have obvious haircuts from the 70s, and women have "big hair" --- especially the woman who plays Anne Elliot. <br /> <br /> All the female characters, young and old, are quite adorable but this does not compensate for the lack of acting skills. The actress who plays "Anne" seems to be in her forties, while Anne Elliot should be 27 years old. I mean, where was the trick and the lights team if we found the woman who played credible Anne? He spends much of his time looking thoughtfully at the level of the horizon, both inside and out. I still wonder what he should have transmitted. Regret maybe? Yes, this production is regrettable! <br /> <br /> The actress who plays Louisa was really terrifying. She screams, screams, chuckles and jumps around like a twelve-year-old rude (my apologies to anyone 12 years of age reading this) that I found myself impatiently waiting for the moment when she gets down on the floor. How this behavior supposes to attract an adult male is beyond me. Most would go away when he first opened his mouth to giggle and scream. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays Captain Wentworth portrays someone so insipid and colorless that he wonders why a woman could dominate him for eight years. > <br /> The reunification of the couple in the end is not done convincingly or explained. How did they come together again? Not because Louisa was in a coma; this is certain. No, there must be more and it is not explained in the film. <br /> <br /> I consider this production two stars: one because it is the work of Austens, and the other because some outdoor scenes were adorable. The only reason I could observe the entire production is that I was sick with the flu and I got it from the library. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed the book, see the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I would recommend this film even if you haven't read the book.
