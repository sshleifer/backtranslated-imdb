A pretentious but - at various levels - collection of "mostly useless" stories. <br /> <br /> But let's start from the top. <br /> <br /> Kaurismaki: If one ever wondered what Finnish love was / romance was like, maybe this little oddity is some indication. Subdued feelings, non-emotions, apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from Finland to Siberia! I imagine the continuation of this story will be "For our honeymoon, let's move from Siberia to Greenland". Obviously Aki had no idea what to write for this little movie, so he just invented a semi-focused "non-story" centered on a band he particularly likes (or maybe his friends) because we can see them and listen to their music more than the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Erice: First of all, have I never heard of this guy before ?? and now I know why. A beautiful black and white photograph and practically nothing else - unless bored, a fool can be considered a resource. But you'd be surprised that many film critics and film students love boredom in movies, so I highly recommend Erice's 10-minute snooze-fest to those two groups of humanoids. <br /> <br /> Herzog: Not a movie but probably a slice of his documentaries on tribes in South America. This is not a short film but a report, but considering how boring the first two voices were, Herzog's bit is almost refreshing and has some interesting moments, and if nothing else fits into the pretentious concept of "time" of the film so very accurate. br /> <br /> Jarmusch: As was almost expected, this once interesting director (with the brain of a peanut, a talented idiot savant) we need yet another nap of uselessness. He became lazy and can't be bothered to write something interesting, both for his films and for a collection like TMO. The only positive side to seeing how a stupid vegetarian actress spends 10 minutes in a trailer is that she is played by the beautiful Chloe Sevigny. Otherwise, skip this nonsense. Oh, and btw: I don't think any young actress plays classical music; Was Jarmusch trying to be surreal by making Chloe hear that kind of music? Maybe Lindsey Lohan hears the opera? Maybe Drew Barrymore is a jazz fan? Who am I to say that I'm not? <br /> <br /> Jim Jarmusch is a moron. Oh, right ... I already said that ... <br /> <br /> Wenders: Here is the actual shock of the whole movie: Wenders can really do something good !!!!! All the rest I've seen from this overrated charlatan has been boring and useless so far. However, this short story is done in style (! Atypical) and is the best part of the film. Let us see more, even if the story has a resolution. <br /> <br /> Spike Lee: Oh, my dear ?? What can I say here? Lee makes someone look talented by comparison. Like Herzog, don't you choose a story but send a report? and a left-wing political propaganda report to this! CNN, but in black and white and one-sided, of course. Of course, "We Wuz Robbed", the retarded title of this little sleep inducer, talks about how the poor, naive and infinitely idealistic Democrats WUZ ROBBED of Bush and his team EVIL EVIL of THieves. This is by far the most stupid and boring entry in this film, and I had to use the fast forward button to keep from falling asleep. Spike Lee is really an Affirmative Action product. God knows how many talented (black) directors have never had the chance to make films because this small and pretentious and small talent continues to take the opportunity after the opportunity to create them. And miss everything EVERY TIME! Now this requires some kind of talent, right? <br /> <br /> Kaige: Chinese history has a solid premise. Everything is fine, nothing more. <br /> <br /> All in all, there are many better films to pass the time, but if your time is not so precious (as is apparently the case with mine) you can control this little film. <br /> <br /> "Ten certain minutes can be an eternity in the hands of the anti-masters of the cinema, time is precious, waste in better films." - Fedor Miklowitz, 1588
