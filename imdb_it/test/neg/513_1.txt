Don Wilson plays Jack Cutter (Ooh really hard name!) A Vampire Slayer who rails against an army of vampires, see that the story is a little different because vampires can't be killed with silver, crosses or sunlight, but rather through the click of their necks (as comfortable as the budget is reduced) and this is where Cutter comes across a reporter (Melanie Smith of Trancers III fame) The Night Hunter action sequences churn without reason during the fighting sequences and though aims to emphasize the atmosphere, makes the film even more shocking. What's worse is that these combat sequences are messed up incredibly while Wilson's martial art is masked by disjointed editing. Obviously the main interest comes from the fact that in fact this precedes Blade, however the problem is that this was done with a limited budget and that there was Don Wilson. It's by Roger Corman and basically this turkey is a film that most people would pay for not seeing. Unfortunately I am a bottom feeder and I deal with the section of the store looking for gems, in this line of work you always come across assholes. With Night Hunter, I could have the craziest asshole in the world. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * on 4- (Terrible)
