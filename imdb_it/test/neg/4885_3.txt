I'm testing myself to watch 3 bad movies in a row to find out if watching 3 bad movies in a row could give me the amnesia I dubbed in the English version of this movie. Now let me go to the points Musical score: bad quality, but at least it's suitable for Story: it's a boy who goes to a city and meets his sheriff brother who fights for farmers from a major and joins forces with Mexicans to lead them and Trinity and his brother try to teach them to defend him - The last scene of climate struggle will confuse anyone about who the good guys are #### Conclusion: better than I thought but I need to continue with this I am next going to see the films of Dolph Lungren and Jean-Claudde Vanne Damme "Universal Soldier" pray for my sanity
