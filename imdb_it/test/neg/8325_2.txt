This is a documentary about homeless women. It was interesting in the sense that this focused on women who are socially engaged - having work and lasting friendships - but they find themselves in situations where they cannot afford housing. <br /> <br /> I found some of the women covered by interesting, but there was little attention or progression in the story. Management and editing failed to keep my attention. There were differences in the stories of these women, of course, but the message was essentially the same and could have been said by focusing on some of them in more depth. <br /> <br /> I did it until the end of the film, but it was a pretty boring journey.
