I want to believe that all the new horror films that come out of Japan these days are sharp and make the vision enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Spider Forest is neither. <br /> <br /> I rarely manage to look at something and end up wasting time, but the Spider Forest was an exception in this regard. I was very taken away. The creators of the film have succeeded at one level; throughout the film I could not stop because I wanted to see the answer to the mystery spun from the plot. I couldn't stop watching. That's why I was so angry when the film ended ... they dragged me up to 2 hours of boredom for this POC? ATTENTION: the spider forest is another of those Japanese "ghost" stories, even if you don't realize what is happening. <br /> <br /> I never want to see a Japanese ghost story again. They are fake and artificial. "It's a story of ghosts" has become like a big carpet under which to sweep all the holes of the unsolvable plot you have in telling stories.
