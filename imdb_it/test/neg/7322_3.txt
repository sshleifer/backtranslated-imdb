This film has the same meaning as an episode "Ozzie & Harriet" or "Father Knows Best". An old copy of Reader's Digest (circa 1962) would provide more information on modern life, or the relationship between a father and daughter, than this strange concoction. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by Diane Keaton. Seems to sleep through the film. (Given the title of the film, I realize that his was a supporting role, but Martin Short also had a distinguished and supportive character.) <br /> <br /> I can understand the attraction of a world imagery created in a good romantic comedy. But this film is the prozac version of an imaginary world. I'm afraid of thinking that anyone can enjoy it even as pure fantasy.
