I didn't like this movie. I rented it hoping it was something like the 10th kingdom. I was disappointed when I found out it wasn't. I also found it simply unnerving. The acting was very bad, the characters were incredible and the time jumps were crazy. I only recommend this movie if you're in the mood to see a crazy guy around, but I'm sure there are better movies with the same thing. I can't believe I wasted my time with this.
