This was a first feature film for Clinton, I was there, while he shot this mess in Adelaide around 98 ... <br /> <br /> Although I wasn't directly involved in the production, I witnessed the usual delusional, post-set behavior , which went down: parties, drugs, illusory glamor, really an example of what not to do when making a film, but also a by-product of young talented people who let themselves be taken by the classical ideologies of fame and worldly position . <br /> <br /> I like Clinton, we had a curious friendship, he deserves to have another script with a more mature script ... there the problems reside, and I'm sure it will be much better the job will be done , if there is a next time! Because, frankly, he certainly didn't do any favors with this on his CV or even the cast ... but hey, it was a paid job, in a country where actors regularly die of hunger <br /> <br /> In synthesis, it is fascinating to watch "the creation of" fundamentally, not so fun to try (alas!).
