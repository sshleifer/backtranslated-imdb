It wasn't until I saw Sidney Pollack in the photo that I ever linked him to this movie. This is his worst possible film. Absolute Dreck. The dialogue is wooden and incredible, the plot is incredible. <br /> <br /> Kristen Scott Thomas is wasted on this movie. There is nothing in his character that makes you even want to believe in this story. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford is like on Valium. There is no life in his eyes. <br /> <br /> I blame Sidney Pollack for the failure of this movie. The script is horrible, and it's too smart not to see it. So he knows of some sort of reward, be it a study obligation or something else, but that's just BLOODY ROTTEN!
