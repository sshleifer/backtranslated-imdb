This was a shame for the FarCry game I had a lot of expectations, but it all ended up in a nightmare. In addition to the bad acting visual effects, the plot acrobatics also the humor used in the film was a real flop. The film is not worth looking at all. The funniest part was when the girl came and kissed Jack to give him the key to the cuffs. Guess he had the keys to the handcuffs all the time. I hope some good director will one day remake this amazing movie game. And I will invest good money to get the right visual effects and the right scenarios as well as the right ACTING. But until then, don't waste your time trying to watch this movie because surely it will drive you crazy especially if you're a FarCry lover.
