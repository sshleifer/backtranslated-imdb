Wow, what a racist and profane piece of celluloid junk, and what an insult to the great kind of westerns. <br /> <br /> Exploitive? Sex scenes abound, swear words abound, violence and blood abound ... all that gives modern films a good name, especially among those who prefer films from the classical era. This is the kind of sleaze that gives old people ammunition against today's movies. <br /> <br /> Somehow I can't imagine scenes of male nude baths in the films of Randolph Scott or Gene Autrey. Nor can I imagine feeling "motherf --- er!" he exclaimed here and there. I honestly doubt the word was even more than 100 years ago. Yet, the f-word is so widespread here that you would think of looking at a story centered in today's urban areas, not in the old west of the 1800s. <br /> <br /> Prejudice? Well, what if all the white characters were good guys and every black person was the ugly and brutal villain? Do you think anyone could complain about a racist movie? At home do we not hear a cry when the opposite - as shown in this film - is shown in hundreds of theaters across the country? <br /> <br /> Mario Van Peeples wrote, directed and acted in this bomb. Remember that name. Apparently, he is the "Ed Wood" of today's directors. Even Spike Lee would not be this racist. You can't go much worse than this movie.
