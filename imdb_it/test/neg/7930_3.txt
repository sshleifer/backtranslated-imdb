This is yet another pseudo-intellectual film "Let's make the nazis look like a real villain". The Nazis were pretty bad, no doubt - many already know that. However, this does not necessarily make any film good on the subject. A Discovery Channel presentation of "The Wannsee Conference" would have been much more interesting. <br /> <br /> "Conspiracy" falls on his ass between two categories: documentary and drama. It is not a documentary, the film is too "staged" and even the presentation is "common". It is not a drama, the characters are too superficial and the conflicts too easily "solved". Another thing is the slogan: "One of the greatest crimes against humanity was perpetrated in just over an hour." Since the film shows the Wannsee conference, the meeting had nothing to do with reaching a consensus on the final solution. The decision on the solution had already been taken by the SS. The only purpose of the meeting was to involve all significant stakeholders in an already established plan. There were no decisions or plans made at the Wannsee conference. There were only threats and coercion (some were less necessary than others). <br /> <br /> Finally: one thing that the film shows (even if not exceptionally so) is that man has a tendency to turn to culture and aesthetics in an attempt to hide the fact from himself who is committing terrible atrocities. This is seen in most "leaders" and powermongering politicians.
