* Spoilers ahead, but that shouldn't matter since I hope you won't see it anyway * <br /> <br /> If you plan to see it, I absolutely recommend you not to. Because this was one of the most wasted 1 and a half hours I lived. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a complete rip-off of the great movie "Battle Royale". It's as stupid as watching any lame American TV show like "Cops" or "Candid Camera". <br /> <br /> The plot is completely predictable. A pregnant challenger and another is a nurse, anyone who does a little logic understands in the beginning what should happen between them. <br /> <br /> The concept is torn as mentioned before and the film lacks the violence necessary to make this film enjoyable. I mean, the preggo shoots a guy in the back and no blood or any trace of the back stroke. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever without finding anything good, so take your money and get a copy of Battle Royale instead of looking at this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10, too bad I couldn't rate it lower. It almost makes Scream 3 a masterpiece ..
