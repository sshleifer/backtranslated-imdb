I acted horribly with the worst special f / x I've ever seen. It's bad enough that I wasted $ 3 to see this lousy bunch of crap, but it's an hour and a half that I lost that I could do something else like get a root canal or volunteer for the jury task. Getting drunk could not even help this video. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly, I honestly believe I lost some QI points during the course of this stupid piece of insensitive "work"! Maybe I should have followed my advice this time. Never expect a decent movie if it's written, directed and produced by the same person, and NEVER expect anything of value from Jeff Fahey.
