Every film should have an idea; Simple or more complex, he needs one ... The problem with Fragata, .. is once again, that when he decides to make a film, he is so anxious to do "anything" that he forgets this main detail, and as a result we make the characters do everything without justification, behaving without justified reasons ... they are simple puppets that follow the film on the taste of the wind. It's boring and sad to see them appear and vanish like cards that are discarded in a game. Fragata always seems to have talent in advertising and it's her job ... and this leads you to see what she did ... but in the end there's always a big disappointment. It's not enough to have a movie full of the "hot pink stars of the Portuguese magazine" ... especially when half of them can't act ... they just pretend to be funny. Here my only point goes to the actress Helder Mendes ... one of the few non-stars ": she makes the effort to establish a certain credibility, and in a film so disorderly without any direction (of any kind) I give it the credit for having tried hard, but this movie is worth checking out as a "not making a movie" manual ... and if Fragata's precedent works badly ... this is a "masterpiece" in achieving the AWFUL title. few words, .. Just take a look! It will do you good, ... and if you did your family movies, ... and you always feel bad with your work ... so it only takes 30 minutes to watch this job "called" professional ... your stuff house will look like powerful Hollywood Flicks compared to Sorte Nula.
