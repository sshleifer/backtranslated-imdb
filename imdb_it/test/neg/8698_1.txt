This film was a waste of 3 hours of my precious time ... in the first 10 minutes I was already annoyed because I am familiar with the real version of the story according to the Torah (5 books of Moses) ... but I decided to watch it to make worth my money and see how disgusting it was. Well, he sucked..way more than I thought. First and for the most part, let's start with the script and the characters the skeleton that makes up the body of a film. If you study the Torah, you will see that the story is completely wrong, here are some of the errors of distortion: Moses does not do slave labor because he was in the tribe of levers, Moses does not kill anyone on Mount Sinai. but the film describes the moses that was whipped and aaron and himself killing people ... not necessarily! When the mother speaks to the burning bush, she knows who he is talking too, but the movie makes an idiot look idiotic, he says he doesn't know who the god in the bush is ... whatever | Aaron knows his brother well, regardless of growing distance, aaron was known for his peaceful and composed nature, yet he is portrayed as angry and arrogant in this film. Moses looks like Jesus in this film ... how ridiculous ... pharaoh the real one was actually and ugly dwarf who sat on a pyramid of stairs so that he could look bigger than he was and Moses was over 10 feet and in the film the pharaoh is taller than he is and warm with clear eyes! The woman of Am Israel (nation of Israel) covered their hair and bodies with meaning and did not dance or sing in front of men, did not participate in the golden calf so they would certainly not dance with a man in public as the film describes. Moses' wife, Tzipora, was married to Moses and therefore covered herself up and being humble like them did not cuddle or hold hands in public. The daughter of Batia Pharoahs (the one who adopts and saves him from the water) converted to Judaism and therefore would have been proud of Moses when he said he would free his people. The fwd to mount the sinai moses comes the 2nd time with two series of tablets ... with incomprehensible writings. At least put the writing in the sacred language, in Hebrew or English and put it on a tablet, not on two sets. In conclusion, the film is written in a horrible, direct way and the characters are all wrong ... basically EVERYTHING is wrong in the film ... Even the old one is inaccurate, but it is more realistic, and the actors are credible. Am Israel Chai!
