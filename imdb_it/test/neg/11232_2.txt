The worst part of all is the poor screenplay, which leads to superficial acting. <br /> <br /> The character of Dreyfuss is intensely repetitive and annoying, and Dreyfuss himself has the boring face to match. <br /> <br /> The character of Holly Hunter is overly self-centered, and Hunter herself indulges in overwhelmingly, as usual. <br /> <br /> Brad Johnson was made of wood. John Goodman did the best. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the entire death / ghost story has since been somewhat exaggerated, and now it appears rather lame. <br /> <br /> Barely watchable only if you like old airplanes.
