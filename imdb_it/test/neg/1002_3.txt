I was involved in this film very soon, to my surprise, because I wasn't going to watch it at all. Now I wish I hadn't done it. The suspense starts well, with the fatal blow that results in death and the question whether the guilty character will confess, or be discovered, or (feasible now, even if a no-no in the old days of creating a movie) get away with it . The plot has already been done before - which plot has not - but the tensions inherent in it, with the complications and additional motivations arising from the unlawful love story, create an absorbing first time. Then the film abandons the hit and run to face a misty display of two unrequited and suffering loves. The two traces of the plot - love hit and run and unreasonable - simply don't have enough to do with each other, and involving the same characters don't bind them enough to justify the departure from the original story line. The screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other. At the end of the film, in the middle of the film's second funeral, I found myself thinking, "What does all this have to do with that hit-and-run?" Filmmakers might think the answer is obvious, but I think the film was dashed and flabby.
