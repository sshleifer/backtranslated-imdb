When I first watched this show on Cartoon Network, I found it uninteresting. Then I read a lot of good messages about this show and decided to watch it. The show was so boring. Each episode was predictable. Moreover, this show has no logic. Hypersmartic girls, going to school and sometimes doing such stupid things, 99% of the episodes start with a monster attacking Townswille, then the mayor (he's a real fool, NOT funny, he's so stupid, I can't imagine how he is become mayor). Professor, yes, he should be the smartest person in this show, but actually ... He didn't find any difference between the monster and his brother. Even the narrator's comments make this show boring. Because they also have similar lines at the beginning of each episode and in the finale. Even the animation is very strange. Everything but the main heroes is shown in an ugly way. Even in each epsode this show gives you life lessons, and means that it is aimed at small children, but if you look more closely, you will see that there is a lot of violence and even blood (!!!) during their battles.
