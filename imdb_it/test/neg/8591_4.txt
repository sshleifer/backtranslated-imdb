Beautiful images, propaganda and history as a toy. The ingredients of this film, good, interesting but with many shadows. Politicall ombre. Jefferson is more than the hero of a mythical America. It is a silhouette of a vision of life and of society, an extraordinary thinker, teacher of much of North America. In the film it's just Superman. The delicate outline of ideas is crushed. The subtle birth of essential truth is forgotten. And Jefferson is a basic tool for creating a good image of American realities. The end, triumphant and fake, romantic and heroic, is the suicide of a story that could be high with more wisdom. And the war against "Avatar" is another gray spot. For those who haven't heard anything about Jefferson, the film is a good start. For others - disillusionment. It is like the precious silk of a tailor. But the tailor is fascinating for silk and clothes are just normal clothes. So a sad experience. Slices of beauty and boring lakes, patriotic lesson and the crush of expectations. A film that must impress. And the ashes of a story that could be magnificent.
