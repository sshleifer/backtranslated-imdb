Rs.30 / - is all I paid for the DVD of the movie and believe me it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Do Bollywood directors think that showing fools is fun? well it is not. Please grow up. <br /> <br /> Here is a dialog box from the movie -'AGAR TUM LADKEE KO IJJAT DOGE TO LADKEE TUMHE APNI IJJAT DEGI '. <br /> <br /> The plot is useless, criminals and police alike running after fools. It is so. BHAGAM BHAG. <br /> <br /> Well, he lived the title, I had to run away from it. :) I switched to Star Movies and saw Home Alone 2 instead and I had a good laugh.
