If you decide to look at Wild Rebels, don't expect anything profound and meaningful. If you're looking for a movie that explores the relationships and structure of a band of bikers, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you are looking for an exhibition on the breaking of the American education system and the problem of juvenile delinquency, Wild Rebels is the wrong film. If you're looking for a movie that analyzes the way rural police departments are subdued when faced with a well-funded and well-organized band, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. But if you're looking for an absurd movie full of scene after scene of involuntary humor, horrendous acting, a very thin storyline and production values ​​in community theater style, Wild Rebels is the right movie. <br /> <br /> Wild Rebels is the story of a low-level tank driver named Rod Tillman (Steve Alaimo). After a fiery incident (which Rod moves away from everything unscathed despite having only cotton trousers and a Fog style London jacket), Rod decides to let it go. Without a plan for his future other than wandering aimlessly through the back streets of the South, he stumbles upon the band of bikers of Satan's Angels (a gang is made up of three of the most stupid ones who close a leather jacket and a woman who look like To share). This group of thugs spends his time terrorizing a rural town in Florida by committing such atrocities as stealing a newspaper from a neighbor's mailbox. These clumsy idiots need someone to be a driver during some of the bigger crimes they planned. Apparently, these three Einsteins can only drive vehicles with two tires, not four. They then recruit Rod to perform daring feats that only an experienced stunt driver would be able to keep the car in the middle of a dirt road during a low-speed chase. Eventually, they hold a bank, enter the aforementioned pursuit at low speed and make the most insignificant battle with the police ever staged. I could go on and on, but you have an idea. <br /> <br /> I hate the term "so bad is beautiful", but it seems that rightly describes Wild Rebels.
