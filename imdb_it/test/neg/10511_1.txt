It's 2005, my friends ... a period of extraordinary special effects and an age of technology. So why can't we see a movie that is a little more thought than this low budget movie. I've seen a lot of low budget movies that drive me crazy, but this ... it's almost like he's trying to be horrible. Just ... don't ... look at it. I can look beyond the lack of special effects and computer-generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good. I feel like a small child has produced the entire movie. There is not even an original plot. Vampire Assassins, by itself, is a big hole in an attempt to mock itself. Can anyone tell me if, perhaps, this was designed as a comedy movie and I didn't know it? I wonder, what does the sequel hold for us who love the first episode so much?
