I remember the trailer for this notorious Conan spin-off. I saw the film years later and I laughed. Accidentally! Poor Briggite Nielson. His career has never had a chance thanks to Cobra and Red Sonja. The plot of the film is this: Sonja (Brigitte Nielson) comes from a tribe of female warriors killed by an evil queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman). Queen Gedren steals the globe that warrior women protected and uses to destroy every city that passes. Sonja goes hunting for Queen Gedren and later finds out that Gedren killed her parents. In his quest Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a arrogant prince named Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his idiot clumsy servant, Falkon (Paul L. Smith), are reluctantly joined. Together they hunt Queen Gedren and the globe. The acting is sub par and the action scenes are soso. I mean, Briggite Neilson looks so emotionally distant. For someone who has lost all her family and companions, Sonja does not seem at all stunned. Arnold plays his usual stoic role and Ernie Reyes Jr .... what a brat and snotty brat was in this movie! The morally servant Falkon had more personality than these boys. The action scenes are the only saving moments of the film even if sometimes they fall flat. The scene in which the sea creature fights has made me laugh until it hurts my ribs. Dialogue is also a blast. It is as if the writer thought that no one would take the film seriously, so he gave everyone the stupid lines to work with. I can only recommend this movie if you like your extra campy epic movies. Someone else doesn't care.
