This strange little film begins with the story of Bruno (Alex Linz) in a Catholic school that has no friends and is beaten every day. She loves to wear clothes and her obese mother Angela, who is a seamstress, doesn't think it's something wrong with what her son likes. Angela complains to Mother Superior (Kathy Bates) but is ignored and, while the two return to their car, they are harassed by other children and are thrown with eggs. Bruno Dino's (Gary Sinise) father is divorced from Angela and is totally disgusted by the fact that his son is a sissy and practically denies him. Bruno meets a new student at school called Shawniqua (Kiami Davael) who is a free spirit and dresses like Annie Oakley with hood guns. Angela has a heart attack and Bruno's grandmother intervenes to take care of him when Dino refuses. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a very hard and indifferent look at all the characters involved. Angela has a lot to do with Bruno who wears clothes while she practically encourages him. A Dino was told when he was a boy by his mother that he was a sissy because he liked the work and now he refuses to help Bruno when he needs it. The Catholic school frequented by Bruno is very undisciplined and all the children run rampant and also call the word "N" Shawniqua. Once Shirley MacLaine intervenes in film turns and becomes more family oriented (so to speak). **** SPOILER ALERT **** The ending after the spelling bee is incredibly invented and "feeling good". Hugs and applause for Bruno as journalists follow him and take his picture for their documents. Meanwhile, Shirley MacLaine behaves like the "old tough" who shoots at everyone. There is one thing in the character of MacLaine in the film that no one mentioned in these comments and has to do with her masculine nature. I think the character of Helen could be a lesbian! It is very hard and strong and at one point in the film shares a shot of whiskey with Bruno and smokes a cigar at the same time. I don't remember anyone in the movie mentioned who her husband was or if she had ever been married! This is why I think his character might be gay. A lot of other good actors also appear in the film. Joey Lauren Adams, Jennifer Tilly, Brett Butler, Gwen Verdon and Lainie Kazan should have taken a look at the script before signing. I imagine when they learned that MacLaine was directing that it would be an honor to be a part of it. It is very difficult to feel any remorse or understanding towards any of the characters and the topic is probably impossible for most to relate to. Actors are not bad, but what exactly was MacLaine aiming for? Tolerance towards a boy who wants to wear clothes and freedom of expression? We take it in the first 10 minutes, the rest of the time I was trying not to shudder.
