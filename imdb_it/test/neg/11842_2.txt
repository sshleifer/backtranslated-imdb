We all know that the world is full of shady and repugnant horror films. Some of these can be fun to watch because of their stupidity, terrible effects and uncertain dialogue. But Raptor, who could have been in the same series as the Carnosaur series just as useless, didn't even ATTEMPT to have fun. It's so bad, it's really unbearable, even if you only look at it with the intention of having a brainless day at home. Where do we start? Well ... the sets are pretty bleak. My old theater group has created more realistic stages. The genetics labs seem to come from a university, and it looks just as incredible on the outside (also due to cover-up, because you should get close to the civilization where people can easily hear the dinosaur's roar), while the department doctors don't ? it seems absolutely credible. The next in the list of complaints are the effects of the creature; well, what can i say? Absolutely pitiful Also, I think it's worth mentioning, the woman's tits should be cited as an effect. Both the main female protagonists have evidently had a sodomy job and lowers the characters, since one woman is a respected member of the police, while the other is the sweet, "innocent" daughter of the sheriff of the city. Acting, however, is by far the worst tragedy. Eric Roberts can be justified at least by trying a little to give something to his role. That's where it ends. Corbin Benson should have killed his costume designer to make his lackluster performance even more pathetic, while the female lead looks so bored (although, with this film, you could leave her free). The other character that I will underline is the daughter, who lets her make her tits in the "vulgar" sex scene (Ten minutes of endless repetition of her bouncing over a guy). <br /> <br /> All in all, and summarized as one. don't worry, don't do it.
