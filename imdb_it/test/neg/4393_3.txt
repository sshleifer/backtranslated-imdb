A friend and I rented this movie the other day. At first glance, it seemed to be another teen movie, which was also what we hoped for, being fans of simple horror and comedy. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film is designed to disappoint the viewer as much as possible. It accelerates quickly into something that contains a lot of potential. Unfortunately he never leaves the land completely. We had seen him for something that seemed like an hour, when finally, half asleep, I managed to say: "Friend, this movie sucks" They were only 35 minutes in reality ... Friend agreed. <br /> <br /> The problem is: the film is simply not fun. It had to be undoubtedly fun, but he couldn't. He failed in a way that made me sad. It reminds me a little of myself. I had the potential to be everything I wanted, and instead ended up watching cheap horror / funny movies all the time. Too bad the creators of this film from the bottom of my heart. It's so sad. All that potential ... and nothing.
