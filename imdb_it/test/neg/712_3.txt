Released at a time when Duvivier was going even stronger. "Black Jack", which was wedged between the extraordinary "Au Royaume des Cieux" and the amazing "Sous Le Ciel de Paris", is a jumble, which Duvivier himself hated, which is not surprising. There is almost nothing to write about this dud. We can see that: 1. Orson Welles used to admire Duvivier. This could explain why the Wellesian actors were present in Duvivier's films: Joseph Cotten in "Lydia" (1941), and here a totally wasted Agnes Moorehead. It's the first time <br /> <br /> I didn't like the performance of Moorehead! On the other hand, Welles borrowed his Desdemona (Suzanne Cloutier) from Duvivier's "Au Royaume des Cieux" for his "Othello". <br /> <br /> 2. In each of Duvivier's films, there are one or two noteworthy sequences and this is no exception: the search in the caves where Duvivier makes sense of mystery works miracles (for a short period), then the hunt when Dalio is captured in th fishnets.The touch of a violin can also be heard in the unhappy one. <br /> <br /> For the rest, as my dear pen writer writes, it is a black joke.
