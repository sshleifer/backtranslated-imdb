For the first forty minutes or so, Luna is a real pleasure to watch. The characters and their situation are interesting and the photography and settings are beautiful to look at. Then Jill Clayburgh discovers that her son Matthew Barry is using heroin and the film starts to unravel and then becomes completely ridiculous in his illness. <br /> <br /> Clayburgh asks him why and when he started using drugs and she and the public never get a direct answer, which would be a bit helpful. He mentions not to worry about anything, but it's not fair because we see clearly in the first surprising scenes that he has a great interest in singing, baseball, his mother's sex and seemingly well-groomed enough to refuse marijuana. This film is for people who think juniors get into hard drugs because mom and dad were workaholics who lost their piano recital. I think a drug as dangerous and emotionally unstable as heroin was chosen as a sort of intellectual catalyst for the subsequent incest scenes. There is a lot of discussion about the mother's love for her son, but in reality Bernardo Bertolucci is presumptuous. Luna would have been fantastic as a small family drama. <br /> <br /> How old was Matthew Barry in this movie? I was more worried about the bizarre things he had to do as an actor for this movie than for whatever his character was going through. ** outside ****
