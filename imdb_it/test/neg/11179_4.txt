Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist in a Pittsburgh steelworks who works to recruit workers in the party, even if he isolates himself from his son, his family and his neighbors. What makes this even more difficult is that Cvetic is actually an FBI agent posing as a communist for information on party activities. The party is trying to create a strike at the mill, so the pro-strike movement will bring the workers into a wave of propaganda. Cvetic must also fight with the beautiful Eve Merrick, a party member and teacher at her son's school who finds that Cvetic is a double agent. When Eva discovers the ugly truth about the true motives of the party, the reds decide that it must be liquidated and Cvetic must help her without endangering herself. The film should have a lot of suspense and double agents, but in this film there is very little but (by today's standards), very rough propaganda and little action or chills. Lovejoy is very good in the lead role, but he and the rest of the cast also seem lazy. Few surprises here and how did this film receive an Oscar for best documentary? Evaluation, 4.
