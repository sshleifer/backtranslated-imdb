This movie made me laugh so much. It was a bloody joke to tell you the truth. So incredible and the worst plot ever. Even acting was bad. I don't know why so many popular Bollywood actors and actresses took part in this film. The script must have been somehow a joke. The visual effects of this film were painfully execrable to watch. I think a kindergarten child could have done a better job than the visual effect and a monkey could have done a better job of inventing a plot. <br /> <br /> The plot has numerous attempts to copy major Hollywood films like The Terminator but fails miserably. I laughed out loud seeing this movie. A total disaster in the history of Indian cinema!
