The director and playwright Richard Day adapted his stage material for the screen, clearly inspired by the real-life dilemma of 1950s Rock Hudson: what to do with a screen idol who is secretly homosexual? Marry him with an unsuspecting woman to quell the gossip (and make it work). A subtle and subtle idea given energy by good cast and retro production design that looks in a fun way like a Shag greeting card. Dialogue is not very intelligent, and there is a bit of a joke near the beginning that it doesn't work (spitting up food, etc.). However, when a serious tone arrives at the final act, it is handled with great taste - and is much more pleasing to the viewer than all the klutzy stupidity. Matt Letscher does a good job as a hero of the male movie / whore Guy Stone, but his experiences here are enough to reinforce his character, or would he return to the bar the next night? The film does not seem to know - or attention. Day wants to get off a few jokes and a carefully written pro-gay speech - a request for tolerance - but he has no other commitments. For an audience that is investing their time and interest in these people, the sentimental bow on this thing may seem nothing more than a joke. * 1/2 from ****
