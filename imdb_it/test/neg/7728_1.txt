I didn't get a chance to see the previous movie, but from what I read on other posts it was supposedly worse than this, though I doubt it's possible. I'm a big fan of the "Zombie" genre and I'm fascinated by the psychological aspects of the vision of creatures, which in effect are human, like an atrocity that is worth shooting in the head. That being said, HOTD 2 takes the "Zombie" movie to a new low. <br /> <br /> Without giving big spoilers (which I really should do just to not waste time watching this movie) I would like to express my total disregard for the way the authors of this film represent the special forces of our countries. Probably Gomer Pile would have survived longer than the soldiers of the "Spec Ops" in this film. To shout loudly they should have called them special education forces instead. If you are going to write a script in which you send an elite team to face a zombie outbreak, at least the soldiers will be smarter than the walking corpses. I understand that you have to kill someone or most of the team, but you can find better ways to do it than to put them on the ground with their machine guns and walk towards a tender hand on the shoulder of the madman who is swinging back and forth in the dark corner creepy basement. <br /> <br /> Writers actually try to bring the whole zombie thing to a more technological level by making this a virus they are looking for a vaccine, and the idea has merit if it wasn't stuck in the middle of such a ridiculous display of films from rebel films. I mean, come on, the zombie movies are not exactly "high art", and the viewer expects a little ironic, along with the blood and chills, but HOTD 2 is the kind of cheese that makes you turn the canal in disgust and wonder at the sheer stupidity of the characters. If you are a fan of zombie movies like me, please do yourself a favor and stay away from this.
