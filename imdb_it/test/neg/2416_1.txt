There are good and bad movies, nice and bad movies ... it's not one of them. This is a film that doesn't realize how bad it is. <br /> <br /> I saw him in a screening on November 14, 2006 at the New Beverly Theater in Los Angeles as part of the "Grindhouse Cinema" this theater takes place every month. I hope presenters Eric Caiden & co. he will think twice before leaving the writer / director Lawrenece Foldes again near them. What a scammer. The boy stood up to talk before the movie - you would think it was Orson Welles talking about "Touch of Evil" or some other lost classic. Almost. Nice on his part to occupy 20 minutes of the audience's time with its inconsistent disconnections. <br /> <br /> "Young Warriors" has been described as a cross between "Animal House" and "Death Wish", but if you're expecting something along the lines of imitations like "Revenge of the Nerds" or "The Exterminator "" you will be a sad disappointment. The script doesn't make sense. The direction is so poor that the actors seemed embarrassed and what can be said when the best thing about the movie is to watch a car explode? <br /> <br /> Poor Richard "shaft" Roundtree. In this film he plays another character with the name "John", but this is the only similarity his character has here compared to the classic above. I hope this film allowed him to pay rent for another month. Other actors who seem to want to be able to be elsewhere include Ernest Borgnine and Linda Day George. <br /> <br /> This is a complete waste of time, even the public didn't seem to care (except for the only back seat boy who shouted "whoa" every five minutes and his girlfriend giggling with the fervor of a lobotomic Barbie who talked every time he opened his mouth). <br /> <br /> For real vigilante films, I'd suggest the following: <br /> <br /> Death Wish I, II, III, Exterminator I, Vigilante Force, Ms. 45, Rolling Thunder, the No - Mercy Man (the last two are a couple of films presented in this theater a couple of years ago - probably the same budget as "Young Warriors" but both were millions of times better!)
