This film had very few moments of real drama. After the first few minutes of opening, the film descended into a spiral that did not lead us to hell and back: the vision was purely purgatory. The acting was more horrific than the subject of the film and sometimes I couldn't stop laughing. The continuity between some scenes was terrible: the characters disappeared from the scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who a few minutes before had been elsewhere. Surely this was a parody of The Exorcist. The plate at the church had to be full of copper the day Mr. Russo joined this. Do I speak Latin? Et tu Brutus.
