I can't believe this is a film that I didn't like. . . I usually find that I am open-minded about all kinds of things. . . but this film is just, well, ugly. <br /> <br /> I could treat the topic if the script and the story were better. I could do the acting if the camera works better or if the characters have been better established. . . I think it mostly comes down to the script and the direction. <br /> <br /> it was just bad. <br /> <br /> I want to give this lower rating, but. . . I don't believe it, at least this guy took his tail off to make a movie. . . so he gets four stars (just above his average score so far)
