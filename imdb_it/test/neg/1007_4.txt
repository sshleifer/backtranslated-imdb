I was disappointed with the third film in the "Death Wish" series and I wouldn't recommend it unless you are really interested in Bronson. It is his usual self in this, perhaps a little lighter than the others; the rest of the cast is great if you watch a movie of the week on TV - the whole film has the value of producing a bad A-Team episode and I like the fun of an escape like the A-Team show, but not on the big screen, even if it's an action movie that doesn't pretend to be something sophisticated. The film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does, it gets out of control to the point of being ridiculous. The plot is something of an episode of "Highway to Heaven" and Bronson looks like a fish out of water with the cast of the majority of the elderly and the gun game is so out of control that you get no satisfaction from Bronson's revenge against bad jump this and go to the fourth installment that I highly recommend.
