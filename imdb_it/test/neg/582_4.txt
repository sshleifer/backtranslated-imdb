Lou Costello (sans Abbott) plays a "waste collector" (and the inventor of a time-keeping machine!) Who secretly works in the court of the city's niece. After a spit, Lou's girlfriend (Dorothy Provine) runs into a misty cave - because it's misty that we never learn - and emerges like a 30-foot giant. Provine is definitely a good sport, and doesn't worry about not looking ridiculous (it would have been impossible anyway), however the writer is really cruel to this character, transforming it not only into a giant but annoying harpy as well. Put Costello on the field with the bosses while creating havoc with the recalled army troops, but nothing fun is done with the transformation. Trumped by "Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman" the previous year, the film stars Lou Costello in his final arc, but provides little else. The special effects are marginal, while the script required more fun lines and faster direction. * 1/2 from ****
