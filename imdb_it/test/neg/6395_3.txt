This film should be called Blame it on the Script. Directed by Stanley Donen, of the fame of Singin 'in the Rain, this mid-life celluloid crisis is not bad at all. It has some lush scenes of Rio de Janeiro and various little dressed extras that follow one another and go wild around the beach to the sultry sounds of the samba, but there is only something to observe fifty ... something of Michael Caine that lights up Michelle Johnson's whining teenager that makes you feel ... well, shabby. This plot is also complete. No one but the perverted and vain old Hollywood executives in the studio could have ignited this embarrassment. Maybe they are so used to having young bimbos like candy that they forget it's their fat wallets that hold the key to their charm, not their huge Larry King style glasses and yellow cigar stained teeth. Is it one thing for an unmarried young sexpot to have a crush on an older man, but for the father of his best friend to get married? And then throw yourself to him shamelessly? Ugh! There is nothing funny about this. It's rather pathetic and grotesque. Take note of a young Demi Moore's * cough talent *.
