He was so poor that I had to turn it off at the end. I've never seen such a pathetic film. I love movies B and I was looking forward to more or less but was sadly disappointed. <br /> <br /> This has the worst acting / plot / direction / writing, etc ... of everything I've ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone you think or watch / buy / rent, don't go there!
