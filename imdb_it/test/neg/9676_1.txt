NBC should be ashamed. I wouldn't let my children see this. I would definitely tell my church to stay away. This film is proof of why NBC has always been a third-class network. Producers, actors and writers should get down on their knees and ask for God's forgiveness for doing this fictional job. There were no pirates. Noah's wife did not march on the bridge of the ark. The ark had no deck. Lot was not even born when this event took place. Does anyone who has joined this project try to read the Bible? There were more than two animals of every kind taken. Read the story in Genesis. How someone could take it to any screen, small or large!
