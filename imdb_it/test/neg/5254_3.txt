We have shown this film in a club as an example of how classical literature can turn into some of the most terrible films of all time. Just the fact that the back of the box proudly proclaimed the plot to be set in the "techno-futile" future should have been enough of a suggestion. I think this word describes the film itself, because no matter how much technology they tried to use to save this film, the effort was completely useless. Not to mention the fact that our club adviser told us that he probably couldn't get a distributor for two years. <br /> <br /> This cinematic failure is littered with poor and melancholy dialogues that are worse than agonizing adolescent poems. The Beowulf character changes halfway in a way that is not at all credible, and whenever he is in an action scene, he is constantly moving like a hyper gymnast. There is also, as they say, a "token black guy" whose attempts at humor are completely out of place. And, of course, the daughter of the chief of the outpost Grendel is terrifying is a total fox. A fox whose breasts are exposed throughout the film. A fox who wants to fight the creature, yet he never wears armor. And his favorite weapon is a small carving knife. And despite their terrible situation, she still dresses for dinner, in a dress with a transparent skirt that exposes her shorts shorts underwear. There are a couple of scenes that could pass as soft core pornography, and in the second scene they also reuse the footage of the first one. I thought the portrait of Grendel was bad enough, but then came the end of the film, which featured a CGI exhibit that could be decent for the 1980s, but it's totally ridiculous for a late 90s. I could go on, but all of you should watch this movie for the completely ridiculous effect. <br /> <br /> The other members of the club and I had a great time watching this by taking a cue from MST 3K and making fun of it all the way. I'm still recovering from an extra weapon: a perpetual cutter rotating on a pole.
