I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I remember that the most frightening scene was the big bird that ate the men who dangled helplessly from parachutes in the air. Horror. Horror. <br /> <br /> As a kid going to these B cheese films on Saturday afternoons, I was still tired of the formula for these monster-type movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who could be the daughter of a professor and happy resolution when in the end the monster died. I didn't care much about the romantic corner of a 12-year-old child and predictable plots. I love them now for involuntary humor. <br /> <br /> But about a year later, I saw Psycho when it came out and I liked the fact that the star, Janet Leigh, was thrown out at the beginning of the film. I sat down and noticed at that point. Since the writers are making up the story, make it as scary as possible and not from a consummate formula. There are no rules.
