"You have beans, the beans are good, you eat them and you go". I couldn't help but laugh at that bit of dialogue. Beans are the musical fruit, you know. The more you eat them, the more you go up, play, play. <br /> <br /> Hmmmm ... OK, I can understand why the actors were in this because they needed paychecks to pay their bills, but I'm not really too sure what the director's and the writer's intentions were . Even after watching the making-of documentary on extra DVDs. <br /> <br /> Mike Rooker gave this a performance that he really didn't deserve. I've seen it on other films VERY better than this. What would have greatly improved this film was to throw it all out, keep Rooker and instead make another entry in the series "The Substitute". Rooker would have created a formidable substitute teacher who instructed bad and morally weak young people about the error of their ways and how they could become more useful and productive members of society. <br /> <br /> Casper, you really shouldn't just be pushing through the undergrowth as if you could take the poisonous oak. Ops. It does not matter. I suppose the poisonous oak is the least of your worries now. Well, at least this time your croaking wasn't done from the tail of the giant python. There are few things more embarrassing than being stuck to the chest by a giant snake. At least the scene of death in this film has had a little more dignity. In addition to a more liberal smear of karo syrup and red food tincture. Nothing says sad and tragic death like the liberal use of karo and red dye! <br /> <br /> The first time I saw a monster wearing a shiny rayon cape with a fur collar. First time for everything, I think. Just to be nitpicky, though, if he was an Indian ghost, why did he look exactly like a monster from European culture and folklore? Wouldn't the monster have been a little more Indian? <br /> <br /> As I looked at it up to the end credits, I don't think realistically that I could in good faith recommend it to others.
