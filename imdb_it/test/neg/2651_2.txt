Harrison Ford plays Dutch Sergeant Van Den Broeck of the District of Columbia Police Department. Try to get the bad guys, but it doesn't do a great job. When we meet him he is trying to capture a corrupt undercover officer. Kristin Scott Thomas plays a New Hampshire senator, Kay Chandler, trying to get re-elected. He's running against a candidate who has a lot of money. The last thing she needs is the death of her husband. He is a politician: he cannot be bogged down by feelings. <br /> <br /> This story moves slowly and painfully. I was looking at my watch every five minutes wondering when it would be over! The story gets lost in the details that the director, Sydney Pollack, didn't need to enter. We don't want to know about the Dutch police investigations. They throw some insight into the politicians and the "spin control" they do for the campaigns. After watching the movie I'm still wondering why they were romantically involved. Someone no longer cries? Do you need more than two weeks to consider going "horizontally" with someone else? <br /> <br /> It was great to see an actress, comedian, Chicago native and Second City Alumni Bonnie Hunt. His role is not necessarily a comic relief, but it was the only one I wanted to see more. Do yourself a favor, wait for it on video if you want to see it.
