This is the worst movie I've seen in a very long time. It reminded me of a Cirque du Soleil show I saw in Las Vegas six years ago, without athletics. By this I mean some flashy, artistic images, which appear randomly, without any supporting framework. The fake colored film in sepia is really in bad taste. This device is almost never justified and certainly not in _Tuvalu_. With apologies to Abe Lincoln: you can make fun of some of the people a few times.
