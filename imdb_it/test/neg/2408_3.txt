During my struggle to stay awake during this torment, I fought through my quasi-dosage to discover a silly story about the incredibly annoyingly annoying schmucks of fraternity, in trouble with a psychotic, half human / half destroyed cyber radioactive named Splatter who sends his soldiers behind them for the murder of their prestigious political leader (for whom the Splatter committed suicide, setting them to blame for it so that he could become the leader). These unbalanced face to face form a group that expresses their feelings anarchically, though not violently, living on crumbling streets abandoned by the "civilized world" expressing their concerns about nuclear disarmament. In any case, most of the film has these five confreres running along dark streets with graffiti walls, as Splatter and his punks do. Fortunately for these guys, they find a punk chic to help them on their journey out of this rather ugly terrain they are not familiar with. This territory that the boys of the brotherhood are immersed in is a veritable maze of streets and alleys with the idea of ​​a more difficult exit, especially when the crazy people and the Splatter group occupy almost every turn. <br /> <br /> Yes, I was tricked like the others thanks to the HR Giger poster which is the most excellent. If only he had been the designer of this dreck..this is not the case and we, the viewer, are left with a film based on the model, of all the films that it seems, Walter Hill's THE WARRIORS, with the exception of this film he does not have the style or grit that the film has. The film has a plethora of unseen fragments and crooked clashes between friars and punks with often laughable melee fights. The setting is quite interesting, and there are some atmospheric uses of neon light, but the environment is not the problem. The plot and the characters within the environment become boring. The saddle bags under my eyes weighed more and more every minute that the film continued. Yes, Texas CHAINSAW plays Edwin Neal (.. a rather amusing voice man, who has a fun interview on the DVD I rented for this blaze of a movie) and Marilyn Burns have "key" roles as opposed to the members of the their faction against the government resulting in the final conclusion within a building complex eventually. The Neal Splatter character uses these metal spikes that emerge from his metal arm to kill his victims.
