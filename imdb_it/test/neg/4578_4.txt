This film defines the word "confused". All the actors are faithful to the script. More is sin, because acting is fine, but the script is a confusing mess of random pseudo-psychoanalytic ideas. Stimulation is incredibly slow and soft-lens cinematography focuses the nerves quickly. I give it 4 out of 10.
