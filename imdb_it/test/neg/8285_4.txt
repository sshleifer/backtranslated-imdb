Six months later the high school sprinter Laura dies during a race, a murderer starts killing the rest of the athletic team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons: this is the stupid plot of the early 80s of Graduation Day, an addition lackluster to the genre that offers very little in terms of style, originality or good blood. <br /> <br /> What it does offer, however, are some incredibly horrible musical interludes, some familiar faces (including a first appearance by the screaming queen Linnea Quigley), and a handful of nudity (a prerequisite of any film Slasher!). <br /> <br /> So forget the scenes of death ?? are they lame and rather ruthless ?? and instead shit are memorable elements of the film: rapid assembly that can induce migraines and epileptic seizures; the roller disc, which is accompanied by a prolonged heavy rock song, 'Gangster Rock', played by the horrible unforgettable Felony; an impromptu jamming session for school students; Christopher George takes over the role of head coach Michaels; and the lousy music teacher who chases her students (who, for some reason, find him quite irresistible?!?!). <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, the action resumes a bit, with the discovery of the bodies of children massacred under the bleachers and a rather twisted scene with Laura's corpse in the cap and dress, but it all comes late to save this film from mediocrity.
