I went to this movie with an open mind. I was too lazy to go to the video store to pick a movie, and my friend came back with this. I promised him I would not laugh at his choice, but within the first five minutes I told him that I should resume my promise. We kept watching, hoping it would improve, but no; followed by a continuous mental rape. <br /> <br /> This "film" was probably one of the worst ever made in the film, and certainly deserves a place in the Lower IMDb 100. I really don't know how it came out distributed. Lighting was poor. I saw better acting in elementary school plays. There is really nothing positive to say about it.
