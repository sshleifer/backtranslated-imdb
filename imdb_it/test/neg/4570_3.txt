"Cheats" by Andrew Gurland is his "true story" fictionalized on four high school friends who maneuver to cheat during the tests. The quartet is: the arrogant derelict of school Trevor Fehrman (like Handsome Davis), his likeable friend Matthew Lawrence (like Victor), their chubby chubby who hates Elden Henson school (like Sammy), and geekster Martin Starr (like Applebee). Adults include Mary Tyler Moore (like Mrs. Stark) and Mary Porter Dunne (like Davis). The big jokes begin with Mr. Fehrman and Mr. Lawrence who is supposed to urinate on a teacher's book. Put this at the bottom of the pile; and, be grateful that it does not go to anyone's permanent register. <br /> <br /> *** Cheats (2002) Andrew Gurland ~ Trevor Fehrman, Matthew Lawrence, Elden Henson
