... or should I say unintentionally hilarious? However, this is one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. I was laughing at the antics of some of the most stupid fictional characters on this side of Homer Simpson. It's just a slap scene, painfully stupid after another, while the clownish and dark cardboard cutouts that replace the real humanoid characters push, pull and drag the "plot" to its inevitable and obvious conclusion. <br /> <br /> If I were to describe this film to anyone, I would call it a mutated hybrid of Fatal Attraction, Dumb and Dumber and Three Stooges, with an incredibly similar "climax" to the Family Guy episode in which the whole family enter a surprise fist fight in the living room. <br /> <br /> Tips for the Benson family: the next time you have a new animal, do the poor animal a favor and DO NOT call it Fred!
