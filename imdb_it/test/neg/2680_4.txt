All the ambiguities about Michael Myers have been ruined thanks to the chronic habit of arseholing this series with its continuity and pulling relatives out of nowhere. This entry introduces the corner of the potty that is not just a psychopath but is actually controlled by runes, which appear as a constellation of stars every Halloween, and a cult is using it for ... er, well, this movie is all other than consistent and I lost track of the plot after a while. The credibility of the film's bleeding is so abundant that in the end there is not a drop left. Why did Michael put a victim's clothes in a washing machine? Why does an otherwise empty corridor have a deadly point rising from the wall? Was he really going to blow his head? And so on. It was left to Donald Pleasence, in his penultimate film role, to make some wonderful little moments from the pile of terrible dialogues he gave.
