In fact, all those responsible for this disaster should be whipped, dragged and hung! If this is Eugene O'Niell's great drama, it is as if I never wanted to be a victim of seeing him again. There are so many WRONG things with this feature where does it start? First of all, the soundtrack of Elmer Bernstein is present throughout the film even in the quiet scenes where the background music subtracts the motivations of the character. Secondly, these characters are NOT nice people and while some reviewers might appreciate the fact that I personally didn't like every scene Ives devoured the scenery, but that was how his characters were written: being nasty. W / Loren, has it never been clear if it is good or bad ?? and all his talk about how things will change the way they were before the baby arrives? well, I saw what was clearly coming. Perkins is uncomfortable and then plays the role as a warm up for Norman Bates (who played two years later) even wanting to take the blame for the murder in the end. Hokey! Thirdly, this film is a studio theater production and suffers because of it. The story would have benefited from the position shot to develop a sense of "place" with regard to the farm (on which all the main protagonists are fighting). Since it is filmed, there is no sense of value to the property, because the film has a studio stage look that is not convincing. This is a really terrible movie.
