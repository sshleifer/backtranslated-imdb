"JB" (Jack Black) runs away from home after being spanked by his father (Meat Loaf). Years later, he finally arrives in Hollywood and meets the greatest guitarist I've ever heard, "KG" (Kyle Glass). <br /> <br /> After a little quarrel, the two decide to join forces and perform at an Open Mic Night in what appears to be a less famous bar. Because of their shock, they don't do it well. <br /> <br /> Back at their less than spectacular apartment, the two are trying to figure out what rock legends have that don't look a little old magazines. It is only then that they realize that the guitarists on the covers have the same pick. <br /> <br /> While trying to look for a similar choice, a music store employee (Ben Stiller, who is also the executive producer) tells him the ancient story of the "Pick of Destiny" they are looking for. This clerk, who has long gray hair and thick glasses, also tells them that the pick, which was made by Satan's tooth, is in a history of the rock museum. <br /> <br /> Now the two losers, delusions of grandeur, go on an adventure full of music to steal the choice. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you in advance, if you are not a Tenacious D fan, who gave us the comedian Jack Black, then you should skip this. I'm not a fan of these two, and I only saw it because it was suggested by Flixter.com. <br /> <br /> The jokes, for the most part, produce silence more than anything else. I laughed maybe at three of the lines, and I giggled at a few others. Tenacious D is only for a certain audience, of which they are not. <br /> <br /> This film is late in many places, and this is where the worst jokes appear. And let me tell you that when Black and Glass don't work on each other, they are completely lost on the screen. <br /> <br /> All the songs in this film are played by Tenacious D. Many of the songs Perfectly advance the plot by describing their adventures at that time in the film. However, I felt that the songs sounded too similar to be told apart. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this film is that the language will turn off many people. There are many four-letter words in this film. There are also some references to drugs. I would not recommend it to children. <br /> <br /> A part of Tenacious D's slap is that Black is in your face, and Glass remains in its shadow for the most part. This is how I am in this film, and it doesn't really work. Now this may have been part of the act, but I heard that Glass didn't want to be there. In one scene, he performs his lyrics (in the background) at a party and cannot work alone. <br /> <br /> Tenacious D are supposedly rock fans in real life and have maybe two rock legends in the film, I lost count because I was so bored by this movie. Personally, I would have liked to see more legends and icons of the film in the film. However, we don't get that. <br /> <br /> What we get is a film full of completely lame jokes, a lot of vulgar language, a lackluster script. You also have horrible acting, and a non-original story. However, you have pretty good songs that sound pretty much the same way. <br /> <br /> The story could have been promising, but many scenes seemed to have been added to the film at the last second. This is somewhat similar to the Blues Brothers movie many years ago, but the Blues Brothers had a much bigger following - and two songs on the Billboard charts. Tenace D has only a small following, with some special HBOs under his belt. And, unlike The Blues Brothers, the comedy is not well thought out at all. <br /> <br /> If you are a passionate Tenacious D fan, then I suggest you take a look. However, like most movie audiences when this film was released in theaters, I'd say avoid this. Save your money on this, folks.
