I broke my rule by buying this movie from the $ 5.88 basket at Walmart. Basically, if a movie has a big star in it, and you've never heard of it before, it's usually for a reason. Well, in the case of this film, the reason is because it has RIFLE! They plastered the photo of Sandra Bullock and the name on the cover of the DVD as a bait, and made this little fish wobble. I thought of donating the record to charity or giving it to the library, but I don't think I would like to submit someone else to the world for this film. Worst lines: "What do you mean with comrades in arms?" "What do you mean with your father?"
