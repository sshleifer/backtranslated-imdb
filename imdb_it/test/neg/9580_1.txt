I bought the DVD from a large container for $ 4.99, thinking I had found a documentary pearl that would actually show a vast movie on the Karakorum mountains and in particular on K2. Moving swiftly through the film, I reached the culminating scene where climbers capture their first vision of ---- Mount Waddington, which stands at all 13,260 feet, in Canada's Coastal Range. At least one of the various Bozo oriented to climb the K2 clearly has no idea how the real mountain really is - it must be assured by his friend and climbing partner who would not have been taken by that partner to a bad mountain. Given that one of the premises of the film is that about 27 people lost their lives on K2, one might think that the asshole in question could have taken a minute or two to rely on some basic facts, but the clown seems to think that the preparations on this scale, although good enough for those like Reinhold Messner, they are below him. To be honest, I didn't look at it all. What I saw makes me shudder. They say you get what you pay for. At $ 4.99, I was robbed.
