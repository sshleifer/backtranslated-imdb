I seriously thought it was a parody when I saw it at the rental shop, but I realized it was just crap, I can't even believe I didn't turn it off, as we all know that those snakes weren't giggles they were pythons and Gardner's the acting was lame and oms I still can't believe that if you look at the final loll you only look for the end it was really priceless better than the sixth sense, I don't even know if the creators of the film actually thought this title would fly, l the only time he would really fly is when I throw it in the trash ...... just look at it for a laugh it was fun in the stupidest way, don't buy JUST RENT.
