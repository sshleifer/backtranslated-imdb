He was on TV last night. I forcibly crossed it, and I barely did it. First of all, with the exception of Leroy, Hilary, and maybe Coco, NONE of the other students we should be interested in have a recognizable talent. It's like the HSPA has no standard, just sign on the dotted line and you're in it. <br /> <br /> The lines of the story were strident and obvious. Doris was simply terribly frightening. The homosexual was a clich√© so thrown away (funny how that school had only one gay, right ...) I liked the character of Leroy, but calling the teacher an obscenity and then vandalizing the school should have sent Leroy to luggage. Lisa seems to prefer to be somewhere else, and since she wasn't a talent, I wonder why they held her back. <br /> <br /> I would have evaluated this star (horrible), but the music wasn't so bad, and I liked the premise. It would have worked much better if the students had been attractive and actually had some talent.
