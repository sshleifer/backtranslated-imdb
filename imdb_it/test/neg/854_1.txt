technically, this film would have it all: decent actors, a beautiful landscape, no obvious point of view of lack of budget, a celebrity like Richard Attenborough. even the plot synthesis seemed promising, suggesting a satire on stupid bureaucracy and common people who surpassed it. <br /> <br /> however, it never offers. the plot is simply too illogical. throughout the film, not one person makes a single sensible thing. crazy politicians, ridiculous soldiers, villagers dead in the brain - everyone moves from an incredible situation to the next. what everyone does does not make sense in a context that goes beyond the current scene. <br /> <br /> of course, this type of film must be absurd and exaggerated. however, it is also assumed that he has at least one case to emphasize the madness behind the division of a city in the middle. in reality, there are (at least) two attempts, which unfortunately fail: the main character, who does not seem to have the slightest idea of ​​what is happening to him, and the "writer", who occasionally breaks jokes from nothing that could be considered amusing by an audience made up exclusively of 12-year-olds. <br /> <br /> what I found most impressive is that the film tries to be funny all the time, but it didn't make me laugh once. I've seen several "funny" bad films, but so far each of them had at least 2 or 3 good laughs. so in this sense, "puckoon" is truly remarkable. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a fantastic movie with a comparable plot, take a look at "brazil". don't waste your time with "puckoon".
