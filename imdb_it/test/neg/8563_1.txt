I can't believe they even released a movie like that. The only good acting comes from the film's water. This must be one of the worst (if not the worst) movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only scary part of the film is the bad acting, I give this 1 a movie I am kind, this film deserves a 0. <br /> <br /> The plot , and if you can call it the plot of the movie, it seems to have been written by a high school boy. Ofcaurse you have to ask yourself if it could have been better with better actors in it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, wait for it to be shown on TV. <br /> <br /> AND EVEN THEN LOOKING IT WILL BE A PERIOD OF TIME.
