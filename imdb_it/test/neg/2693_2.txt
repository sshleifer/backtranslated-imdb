I have been a lover of Shakespeare since childhood. I'm also a Jew. Merchant of Venice is anti-Semitic through and through no matter how much scholars and literature lovers try to reinterpret it. <br /> <br /> In the game, Shylock is portrayed as demonic and cold-hearted and has no forgiveness, no warmth, no love if not money and cruel revenge, while Christians are kind and moral people. His motivations in the drama revolve around money (he plots revenge from the outset based on the damage done to his business as well as on blind racial hatred), not on noble ideals or hurts racial pride as this film wants you to believe. And this characterization is given to him by Shakespeare himself, not by the other characters. As a final test, the happy ending is where the Jew loses his money and is forced to convert to Christianity. <br /> <br /> I recognize him and go on. It's part of the story and I like Shakepeare despite this fact. Therefore, I expect a movie based on this game to be correct. I much prefer to see the work adapted for its rich language and narration without whitewashing. <br /> <br /> But many of the astute subtleties and playful characters of the bard are lost in this film. For example, in the last scene in which men discover Portia's undercover work as a man who has also taken away their rings, instead of the playful play on words and misunderstandings, while the truth is revealed, it becomes a lively game in where two bitchy women play cruelly with their future husbands. <br /> <br /> So, instead, there remain only delicious detailed scenes, fragments of the rich language with poor reinterpretation, poor fusion, an intense classroom scene and a controversy. <br /> <br /> The truth is that I think it would be much easier to identify anti-Semitism in history and move forward if it were left as it is. Despite all the whitening that the producers of this film have pulled out of their hats, there is still a lot of hatred, only now people can apologize and pretend that the portrait of the Jews is not so bad. <br /> <br /> And finally, another problem is that most of the actors are mixed. Pacino is out of his reach and is very uncomfortable with his tongue, not to mention the horribly false accent. Fiennes like Bassanio is without charm and embarrassing with the tongue. The irons are reliable as always but they don't do much with his role. Portia is somehow OK but unlikely, and covered in bad makeup, just like the movie.
