This is my first comment on a movie here. I have to say that of all the bad movies I've ever seen, including Braindead for an example, this is really PESSED! I promise. Don't even look at it. He's boring, bad actor, script and bad plot, negative effects the whole movie is a big piece of shit! If I could give 0 out of 10 stars, but since the lowest is 1 which is terrible, I need to vote for it. But I would say that the film is worse than horrible. <br /> <br /> Don't hurt yourself seeing this movie and hoping it will go better because I can tell you right now, it won't! I was hoping that a single scene could come that would have been worth watching. No good scene has arrived. <br /> <br /> What a beautiful piece of shit. <br /> <br /> And Coolio as a vampire? LOL! LMAO! YARGH!
