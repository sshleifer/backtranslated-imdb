This film is simply rubbish. I have to say that I'm a junk movie expert. I reserve the "1" rating for films that are disgusting but amusing, but this movie is just boring and certainly not crappy in a fun but lousy way in a lousy way. He gets a "2", so those of you out there can distinguish between those that will make you laugh and those that will put you to sleep. There are scenes in this film where the actors look at something, their expressions are astonished and the wide eyes and relaxed jaws tell the audience that what they are looking at will be profoundly incredible, it's just not just a closet or even more desert. It must be really damn terrible for me to go out, let me tell you, I went out and so did a lot of people.
