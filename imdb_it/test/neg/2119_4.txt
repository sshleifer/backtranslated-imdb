This is a perfect example of why many people say that the 90s are sucked into horror movies. A boring tale of terror on the voodoo-on-campus featuring the very promising Corey Feldman (STAND BY ME, THE LOST BOYS, etc.). There may only be enough things happening to keep you from falling asleep and it doesn't seem too cheap, but this is still the horror film aimed at an audience that was very young in the 90s. I could have been part of that audience, but I still didn't get anything out of it when I look at it now. And nowadays, teenagers are already used to a lot more and better, and I can't imagine any of them knowing or interested in who Corey Feldman was. Or, "is", actually, how the guy is still making movies. But the only thing that still binds him to his glory days is the sequel to LOST BOYS 2: THE TRIBE that was released recently. And I also imagine that it will not encourage anyone to look for VOODOO. Just another film that got lost in the horror of the 90s for obvious reasons.
