A terrible deception: controversial film, winner of the Teddy in Berlin in 2003, Mil nubes de paz turned out to be a fiasco. The actors all act (well, they're not exactly actors); the film has tried to be a high bet but ends up being a dubious bet: it remains in the superficiality of two kissing boys and a boy whose lover has disappeared; it has no purpose: nothing to do with homosexuality presented in other films (eg Before Night Falls (2000) by Julian Schnabel). Technically the only thing that works is photography; otherwise, the camera is put into strange angles (to make it more "art-film") and the whole movie runs in a black and white atmosphere. The film is so pretentious that it bothers. I mean, it's nice to be pretentious when you have the talent to support it. Or maybe that's how art cinema is incomprehensible. History flows slowly, slowly, slowly. For me, more form than essence. Superb edition? It was nice. Superb direction? Don't think so: the film is weak. It was an interesting project. It's a shame. It is a defect. One star in four.
