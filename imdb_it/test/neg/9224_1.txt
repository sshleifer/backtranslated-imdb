This is really a really bad movie, but it's the rare kind of nastiness that is endlessly, incredibly fun! I want to add to the other comments on this film. <br /> <br /> The "rock band" on the plane resembles three skinny drunks from casual work who wear bad wigs. <br /> <br /> the serious problem of continuity with the child's stuffed tiger: it turns into a lion, a leopard and back again; it is dirty or clean depending on the shot. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER! The stuffed tiger turns into a real animal to save the child (and the writers)! <br /> <br /> The sight of little Jimmy floating on the Amazon in a coffin, squeezing his stuffed tiger and crushing it away will permanently stick in your memory <br /> <br /> Listen to one of the sound effects more inept than ever: in the late history when the priest prepares to find Jimmy, the guide demands his monk's robes as payment - the priest falls on one knee in a moment of resigned contemplation and there is the sound of a bell , not the deep "BONNNNG" of a church bell, but the "ding" of a bell from a boxing match! <br /> <br /> This is an absolute blast to watch.
