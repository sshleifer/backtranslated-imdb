Excessive and poor; and sometimes illuminated too dark. The scenario of DARK REALITY is not even close to being original. Dark and damp basement. Kidnapped prisoners. Fearful survival. Carey (Alisha Seton) tells her family and her friends that she will run the backpack all over Europe. You can't get out of the city. She is grabbed by a rainy, drugged and awakened sidewalk chained in a dungeon. Eventually he realizes that he is not alone and there are several thoughts about survival when he meets some of his fellow prisoners. His cell mates begin to die one by one. Will he be able to gather enough strength and courage to see the light of day again? Others in the cast: Laila Dagher, Rachel Oliva, Eva Derreck, Arthur Bullock and Jen Parker.
