I went into a book store in Brentwood, Tennessee. I will not say the name because I am a dedicated customer. I was satisfied with every item I bought before this. On display at the front of the store was The Bell Witch Haunting. (I can mention that this is the only store where I saw it for sale.) I had heard about the story somewhere and remembered that it should really happen. I was very excited and couldn't wait to see it. I had high expectations for this. I couldn't believe what I saw when I saw it. It didn't look like a real movie. It looked like a home video. I had the impression that it must have been a horror movie. I mean the movie had to be about a witch that haunts you know. This is not a horror movie. Don't jump from your place to watch this movie. I gave the film all the possibilities of the world to improve as it went on. I swear I did it. It has never been better. There were several scenes of this little boy who got poo and pee on him. I didn't find it funny at all. I watched the entire movie with disbelief that the store would actually sell me this. I imagine this economy is so bad. I have to say this to the cast and crew. Don't show this film as material to get other film work. Don't do it I mean sincerely. I commend you for the attempt. For the people who bought this. I say this. Don't sell your copy to someone. They could get very upset. Good day everyone.
