The big problem I had with this film is that the Lombard character is, as another user says, "unnecessarily cruel". Lombard plays the role of Ann Krausheimer Smith, who believes she is married to David Smith, played well by Robert Montgomery, abruptly dressed but appropriately grumpy. The film has some funny moments, especially when the character of Montgomery does everything to try to bring his "wife" back. Understandably, she is angry that marriage is not technically legal, but only finds out three years. <br /> <br /> The character of Lombard seems rather cold for the sincere attempts of his "husband" to woo her. Though not very skilled in this effort, Montgomery is however visibly affectionate, yet Lombard is as cool as a pillar of ice. There are almost no clues suggesting any kind of reconciliation between the warring couple for much of the film, and it is difficult to see any kind of comedy - even the dark comedy - in this aspect. To a certain extent, the film suggests almost a sadistic undertone, with the Lombard character taking a "kick" from her husband's feeble efforts. While this could be considered another type of "Battle of the Sexes", the reality is that it is a highly unbalanced battle, if this: the character of Montgomery, although certainly imperfect, is not imperfect enough to make it a typical example male chauvinist / misogynist (an excellent example of this is Michael Douglas in "War of the Roses"). In fact, the character is largely effeminate, as revealed not only by the sharp dress of Montgomery (which probably owes much to the perennially dressed athlete himself), but also his discomfort in trying, but not succeeding, to interpret the role of a womanizing bachelor. His only major flaw is his vanity, but that guilt is not balanced by the excessive cruelty of his companion. And there is no suggestion that he is trying to instill jealousy of subconscious love. This is what makes him so cruel and sad. The character of Montgomery simply looks weak. In fact, no wife would want such a weak man if he doesn't "wear pants" in marriage. But then again, a woman who wears trousers in a wedding would never try to be so cruel because she already claimed that role early on. So the whole theme seems strange. This film is not a champion of feminism (Lombard's character shows some signs of the type of independent woman of the 1960s, but this idea is soon canceled and the character falls back to the 40s), nor a battle with the sexes (like the character of Montgomery is really a sign of virility and therefore a lost cause). <br /> <br /> This film is a farce on the surface, but under that patina it is much darker, with sadistic nuances. All this makes its resolution appear, well, strange. (Perhaps that weirdness was the point?). In any case, slapstick this film is not.
