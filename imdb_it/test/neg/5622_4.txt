Another film that punishes us for the crime of enjoying "Pulp Fiction". <br /> <br /> If you like watching people get killed by machine gun fire for an hour and a half, this will probably be fine. Fans of the debut episode of "Aeon Flux", in which the title character kills literally thousands of seemingly faceless soldiers, will really do it. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's not exactly a smart movie. In fact, all it takes is an excuse for a group of young people to act rudely and shoot people. Sometimes a whole scene passes, and the only thing that happens is that you guessed it! someone gets hit. Or, to make it more spicy, twenty people are shot. First, they are just sitting there, the next minute, they are sitting there dead. Yahoo! <br /> <br /> Rough plot: a young American goes to Paris (an American in Paris, understand?), He takes on a prostitute (the ethereal Julie Delpy), he gets in touch with some old French friends, one of who has AIDS, plan and attempt a bank robbery. Of course, the movie convention states that no bank robbery breaks out in a movie, and this hitch takes up about three-quarters of the running time (it's like "Dog Day Afternoon" without the humor, patience or humanity of Sidney Lumet). While you're at the bank, things go wrong (surprise!), And the Parisian with AIDS, goes around with his Uzi several hundred times. No one spoilers here, but suffice it to say that you are at such an emotional distance from these characters that you are not likely to care who lives and who dies at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Some called it elegant. Maybe it is, but it's someone else's style, it's a movie that has already been made and "Killing Zoe" is trapped by convention. Nowhere in the film does the director (Roger Avary, co-winner of the screenplay "Pulp Fiction" Oscar) do something truly original, elegant, funky or outrageous. Unless you consider the fact that no film that took place inside a bank has had such a large number of contenders, there is nothing else that can distinguish this from the multitude.
