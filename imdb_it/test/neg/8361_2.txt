It seems no matter what I see it in, Christina Ricci seems full of promise but can't deliver. Of course she can cry and scream, but Prozac Nation sees Ricci totally out of his depth, maybe I'm too strict ... okay, I'm transferring the blame to the director. Jessica Lange is outrageous and reaches almost the heights of Faye Dunaway's megadramatization. Unfortunately I think that Lange peaked with Frances and it was all downhill from there. There were all possibilities for this film to be lucid and witty while facing depression. What we get instead is a hysteria badly dressed up with a stereotype of veneer that lasted the 1980s. I really didn't have any sense of the 1980s film in the background, as I was dissatisfied with the lame attempt to make people believe it was the eighties just because Ms Ricci wears a dress inspired by the Madonna to her "lost virginity". Cmon all, you are ALL Better than that. Filmmakers should hang their heads in shame and, following the disappointment, Elizabeth Wurtzel could probably make a package if she sued "irreparable emotional damage" as a result of the finished product. go to lizzie, sue! I would like to
