This is a truly mediocre film along the lines of "Buckaroo Banzai". The cast revolves around like a "Mad Max", and they seem to share a joke they don't want to share with the public. Wheeler-Nicholson is one of those guilty actresses you will like that you're happy to run into the movies, but it's not worth the rental price. Space Maggot starts an electric fire and burns a vote of 4.
