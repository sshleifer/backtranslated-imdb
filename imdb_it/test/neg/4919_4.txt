'A New Generation' is the third entry of Amityville to base the plot around the premise of the writer John G. Jones of an object taken from the house of Long Island that causes spooky misery and death for its new owners. First a lamp, then a clock and now a mirror. However, this is also the first Amityville since "The Possession" connects directly to the real-life events that triggered the entire series. This time, Keyes Terry (Robert Partridge), an artist, one day receives a macabre mirror from a homeless man. Soon, the people around him begin to die, leading to the discovery that the mirror was once hanging in the Amityville house - in fact, at night a man named Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in 'Amityville II') killed all of his family. Unfortunately for Terry, his discovery of the mirror is not entirely accidental, and he soon learns the truth about his past, a truth that has been buried since childhood. <br /> <br /> This seventh installment of the often worn-out franchise is something of a disappointment to me. Things were starting to recover with the film "It's About Time", stupid and unequal, but fun, and since this film tries to draw on its roots - not the first episode, but the same source material - it should have been better than was. <br /> <br /> However, three trips to the same well with yet another evil artifact from the Amityville house with another explanation for the malignant paranormal visits are upon me, to say the least. One of the biggest weaknesses of the Amityville franchise is the constant determination by each producer group to completely ignore every other episode in the series. On the one hand, it is perfectly reasonable that they do not want to be tied to the continuity of someone else, but, at least, they could perhaps recognize the lines of the plot that have already been made and probably * do not repeat them over and over again *. <br /> <br /> There is also something rather intriguing about the way the plot unfolds, no doubt due to the inevitability that this repeat feast brings. Since you already know what will happen, careful accumulation is simply slow and boring. Or maybe it's just boring anyway. Director John Murlowski probably could have done more to intensify the atmosphere of tension associated with the mirror than to simply have it blink red and make "bad" voices chatting, which has no subtlety whatsoever. There were times when the characters seemed rather unprepared for its otherworldly qualities. If they don't take it too seriously, why should we? <br /> <br /> Which is a pity, because "A new generation" has a more than capable cast. I was about to keep looking at it until I saw the name "Julia Nickson" in the credits. He fascinated my attention just as he always does and, if anything, I was annoyed by the fact that his part wasn't wider. Terry O'Quinn was equally charismatic and again, underused. Partridge himself in the lead role clearly fits the early 1990s with a square-jawed, square-jawed type of hero, and though I'm not sure he really gave him the gravity he needed, it's not like someone here is performing Ibsen. <Br /> <br /> The sets are also noteworthy, from the dramatic works of art that fill Suki's room, to the claustrophobic corridors present in flashback / supernatural sequences. Obtaining the appearance of these rights is particularly important given that certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulate fragmented memories. Clearly, Murlowski is more a visual director than an actor or horror director. Unfortunately, it's destined to be a horror movie, after all. <br /> <br /> 'A New Generation' sees the same race run for the third time in 4 years. Add to this the lack of direction in which it was really necessary and the whole effort fails to stand as high as it should. However, it should be recognized for its strong links with the source material and some good actors not necessarily in their best hours. Honestly, the ideal person for this is someone who has not seen any of the sequels of the past "The Possession", for which the story will not be a huge journey in deja-vu.
