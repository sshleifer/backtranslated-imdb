Talk about your wild life. Barely a B series movie, but that hay ... Science fiction and lesbian sex. From the mind of screenwriter and director Cody Jarrett, a slice of good taste. A chemical company is dumping waste that causes mutants in a fish farm. Hot Kristi Russell plays Dr. Barbara Michaels, an EPA agent sent to investigate this environmental dilemma. It just happens to get into a lesbian relationship with the bartender Trixie (Ariadne Shaffer) and their love scenes are just as good as those obtained with this movie. A human-sized frog incites chaos; causing a car accident, raping the daughter of the head of the chemical company, raping a girl under the bleachers of a soccer game, a stiff arm facing a runner in the soccer game, raping a nun ... all before being hit twice in the chest after an antidote everything was found ready. The special effects ... well, not special; a boy in a rubber frog costume without genitals to test himself. Hard tadpoles, do you still want to watch it? Go ahead, but corrupt any testimony of secrecy.
