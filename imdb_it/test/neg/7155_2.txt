I'm just filling this comment, because I couldn't stand the fact that a positive comment was present on the "complete information" page. I really think this is the worst movie ever made in my country. This is not just because of the terrible plot, lousy English and a tension curve that is as flat as our country. No, it's because this was a serious attempt to make an action movie, conforming to the Hollywood standard. It had to be "The European action movie of the year". For this reason they also hired Fejda van Huet, actor in the Oscar-winning film "Karakter", to do the job. I don't mind bad movies, I can even enjoy them if they are pretentious b-movies. but I can't stand films that are terrible, but they are supposed to be type movies.
