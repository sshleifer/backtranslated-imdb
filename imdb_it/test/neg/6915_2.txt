No one in this film has much to do. This is probably the longest 65 minutes I've ever spent watching a movie. The effects of makeup on the pianist with macromeglia are pretty good, but this is the only thing that prevents this from being a grade 1. The physician's assistant goes through extreme mood swings from passivity to hysteria in seconds and then he seems to forget where he was in the next scene. The director has assembled many of the right ingredients for a crazy doctor movie, but somehow he forgot the skeleton of a story to hang them. Unless you know someone in the cast or crew, I wouldn't even recommend tasting it.
