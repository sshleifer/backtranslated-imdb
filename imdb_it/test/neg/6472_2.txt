This remake is titled "That Darn Cat", but D.C. the cat is more than a sideline compared to the main character. Patti Randall was not at all likeable in this remake either. It reminded me of one of those gigantic Goth of high school that you read about who got angry from the day they were born, so they end up opening fire on the rest of the school one day. The federal policeman, Kelso, was fine, but he wasn't as good as the original. I imagine Disney is trying to turn Christina Ricci and Doug Doug (or whatever silly name) into stars, but they don't hold a candle to Hayley Mills and Dean Jones in the original. I am a lover of animals and a lover of cats and I do not blame D.C. because the remake is much lower than the original film. After all, they almost excluded him from the whole movie. All in all, a very poor remake.
