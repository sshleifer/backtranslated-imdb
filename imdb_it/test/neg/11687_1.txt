I rented the film because I'm very fond of war movies and on the cover I read "better than saving private ryan" .... mmmmm ... I thought cool! guys .... it's just a ridiculous movie. Almost funny. Nothing to do with a real war movie. I want my money back! Why do the people of the people lie ??????????? F NI SUBTITLES They tried to make everything cooler with light ... but they didn't make it. I'm sorry for this ..... but the film is terrible. The Italians are shown as "Mafia and mandolin" <br /> <br /> The American as a stupid peasant The Germans as even more stupid peasant. <br /> <br /> The actor is ridiculous and unprofessional. <br /> <br /> Please .... please ......
