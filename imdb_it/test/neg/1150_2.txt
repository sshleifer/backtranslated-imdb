I had the unfortunate experience of tripping over a preview for this movie and I thought it might be interesting. I'm a fan of the two main actors, and I find that Meatloaf is strangely attractive, but he hasn't been able to compensate for the droning plot of this movie. This film attempts to make social comments and be cleverly clever. I am sure that the public clearly receives the sociological message, but must suffer in the process. Personally, no matter how bad the movie is, I can't stop it in the middle. Something drives me to finish the worst movie, but I often regret it. This is one of those...
