"The Mill on the Floss" was one of the minor novels of Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under the pseudonym George Eliot. I tried to read this boring and very turgid novel years ago, but I couldn't finish it. I will review this version of the film solely for its merits, since I do not know how much it faithfully follows the original novel. <br /> <br /> The film's opening credits are printed in an old English typeface that suggests the Middle Ages, and therefore it is a very poor choice for a film with a 19th century setting. (On the other hand, about halfway through the film, we see a close-up of a flyer that advertises a real estate auction: this flyer is set in typically Victorian characters and seems * very * convincing.) Much of this film is extremely convincing in his representation of 19th-century England architecture and clothing. The precise location of the story of this film is never revealed, but - judging by the accents of the actors - I would place it like somewhere in the Cotswolds, perhaps in Warwickshire. <br /> <br /> The plot, what is there of it, involves a mill that changes hands a couple of times (in a couple of decades) between two rival families, a wealthy one and a working class. I disagree with another IMDb reviewer who says that James Mason has only a small role in this film. Mason has the biggest and most central role in this drama, as a scion of the richest family. Like the beat-up and petulant Tom Tulliver, Mason is darkly dark and impetuous. His performance here belongs to a better film: it made me want to see the acting of 'Wuthering Heights' with Mason as Heathcliff. <br /> <br /> Since this is a multi-generational saga (something that George Eliot did much better in 'Middlemarch'), many of the main roles in this film are divided between two actors each: child actors in the prologue, adults in the main narrative. The prologue of this film presents a very well-written scene, which establishes Tom Tulliver as a strong-will and braggart from an early age, and the young Philip Wakeham as dignified and caring. During forced labor, Philip earned half a penny: Tom tries to bully him away from him, but is not willing to take the coin with brute force: he wants Philip to give it * to him. All the child actors in this film, male and female, are talented and attractive. Unfortunately, all children speak their dialogue with elegant accents and soft voices that are completely different from the accents of actors and actresses who play the same roles as adults. This discrepancy calls attention to the staginess of the material. Unfortunately, none of the subsequent scenes is as valid as this prologue. <br /> <br /> The climax presents a crowd of workers in a thunderstorm, much more stimulated and photographed than in the previous scenes. But modern viewers (at least in Britain) can no longer take this type of material seriously. By now, practically all British comedians have done a comedy routine of "trouble at t 'mill, squire", parodying this very topic, so I had a hard time watching this movie with a straight face. <br /> <br /> The character the actress Martita Hunt is good in a small role, but the opening credits (in that old English typeface) miss her name as "Marita". I will evaluate this boring film 3 points out of 10: a point each for the performance of James Mason, the first scene with the children and the authentic Victorian composition in the leaflet of this auctioneer.
