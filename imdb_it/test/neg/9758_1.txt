As I watched this movie, I felt like a plastic bag was slowly closing around my head. The acting was terribly stifling, and it was bad acting. The most brilliant piece of acting in the entire film was the guy who had to act in a coffin. I felt nothing but relief when it was finally finished. I expected this film to be a real tragedy, with some deep psychological intrigue later. All around was stupid, without beginning, without climax, without end, just wandering back and forth, and the plastic bag kept getting worse. We create here. This is a terrible film.
