I have always found the amateur Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be profoundly pretentious, and I never understood why his work attracts so much attention. In addition to his Rayographs (which he invented by chance, and which are just photographic prints in direct contact), his only contribution to culture seems to be the first photographer to represent female nudity in a way that was accepted as an art rather than a porn . But surely this had to happen eventually, and there is no real reason why Ray deserves credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story of the Emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> "L'Ã‰toile de merde" ... whoops, "de mer" ... presents many blurred photographs and a recurring visual theme of a starfish, which is never explained. Starfish have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs - and even to regenerate whole duplicated bodies - but, if this has anything to do with the theme of this film, Ray neglects to say it. I was much more impressed by the titles of this film, which (in French) manage to include rhymes, a play on words ('Si belle, Cybele') and some portmanteaux. <br /> <br /> As often happens in Ray's work, there is really a beautiful young woman seen in this film. Unfortunately, photography is (largely) so blurry that we have few opportunities to appreciate it. I will evaluate this mess one point in 10.
