This hardly compares to adventures in the space of his time. Those of Star Wars and Star Trek. And while I'm not a Star Trek fan, I recognize that this film pales in comparison to the Trekkies series. In fact, I would have put Back to the Future in a better light in terms of space and travel. <br /> <br /> The story is of a boy captured by space raiders (pirates). In an obviously false and non-addictive battle, the captured boy befriends pirates and even helps them. And slowly, one by one, those marauders die. In the end, the boy returns home and the last remaining pirates escape seriously injured. <br /> <br /> The acting was not exceptional. But what is obvious is the total lack of interesting dialogues, effects and texture. The way they get 80 minutes of this is beyond me. <br /> <br /> If you want to take a shot because it's space, go ahead. But be careful. "D"
