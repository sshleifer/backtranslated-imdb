I must not have seen the same movie as the one in which the comments refer here. First, I think they should have serialized Ghost Story if they were to film it at all. The truncated version they invented was horrible. I felt that the performances were polite and so much was left out of the story that the performances of masters like Astaire, Douglas, Houseman and Fairbanks seemed pleasant. Alice Krige was as superb as Eva, though. Craig Wasson is a good actor, but he was only adequate as a protagonist. The decision to choose Patricia Neal and to end her role was not good. Imagine what Anne Bancroft would do with that character! I blame the script, which was poor. Production values ​​were dark and the pace was slow. A disappointing pedantic effort. <br /> <br /> The book is one of the five greatest suspense / horror novels of the 20th century, IMHO. But the film was disappointing, although a great introduction to Krige.
