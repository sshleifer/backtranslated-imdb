Yet another version of the mother of all gangster movies: the classic "Godfather" and yet another case of overcrowding due to the media circus. Sarkar, Ram Gopal Varma's thirteenth Hindi film as a director is also the weakest in his Underworld trilogy, including the other two, the excellent Satya and Company. The Charisma, the magnetic character of the two Bachchans who plays the father-son duo on the screen for the first time on the screen, is certainly a gift to watch out for. Not only strong performance but their perfect chemistry is the biggest score point here for which Varma should be applauded. However, the same equation of the duo is missing with the other characters in the film. Reason: the other characters seem more caricatures of esp. the bad guys represent the typical Bollywood villains. A character that attracts attention is the eldest son, played by Kaykay, but not yet able to resist because of the characterization halfway through cooking. . The drama and the conflict are made alive by the excessive use of Close-shots, which produced a claustrophobic effect rightly needed to build an environment. The haunting Score (Amar Mohile) and sound design (Kunal Mehta, Parikshit Lalwani & Anup Dev), together with a dark and turbid background, superimposed on sparkling and powerful images (camerawork by Amit Roy) contribute to Visuals so typical of the style of Ramu. But there is an excessive use of music even if fortunately there are no songs in the film. But can the public's interest in today's "growing intelligence" be sustained only on the shoulders of two performers and a strong Visual? I don't think so. Surely, the public "learns more" and here the film fails to deliver. In any adaptation, in order to add a new dimension, the biggest pre-requisite is the script, which here is slow to not be sharp in places, and therefore the rhythm slows down quite often. What the final public is subjected to is a very predictable drama, very common with very few surprise elements. Stunt Allan Amin Ghani's best director is not in his best form. Some scenes that require different treatment include: a minister speaks ill of Sarkar and the son is listening; a very amateur shooter in Sarkar prison, Sarkar Jr. escapes from the clutches of his enemies, a son easily motivated to kill his father, a son secretly enters his father's room to kill him, a police commissioner who slaps Sarkar Jr - all this requires a more realistic and incisive approach, which is the backbone to create the required conflict. The dialogues are weak eg. look at an amateur line in which a CM tells Sarkar Jr. "Wo jo police commissioner tha na usay maine hata diya" .. The women who take care of Sarkar's work are completely ignored. Even the uninterrupted negotiations on criminal activities while Sarkar is with his family seem a bit out of place. In fact, the film follows a graph quite similar to Ramu's own production: Ab Tak Chhappan. In depicting the battle between good and evil, the other side of life - the law, the police, the administration, politics is completely ignored. Certainly, more is expected in the contents. Here the film is decidedly insufficient and could not exceed an average rate. Dear Ramu, we agree that you are now laughing on your way to the bank, you absolutely need to take drastic revision measures in your film production factory, before it's too late.
