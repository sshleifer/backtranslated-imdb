The fact that this film is the quality of business basements is a real shame, but in the 1940s it was the only type of film made for theaters that cater to the black public due to segregation. Thus, while MGM, Warner and all the other big studios produced extremely refined films, small studios with limited budgets were left to get by with what they had. And from seeing this movie, it's obvious that there's a lot of energy in making the film, even if it's a pretty nasty aesthetically speaking movie. Some of the actors weren't particularly good (especially French), the sets were minimal and the plot totally silly, but the film also had good music - of different styles, from classical to jazz, to Rhythm and Blues. This is thanks to many talented but unrecognized Black artists. <br /> <br /> Now, as for the plot, he was totally stupid and foolish but still kitschy. I liked seeing Tim Moore ("Kingfish" from the AMOS 'N ANDY TV show) in drag version, as did the ugliest woman ever in the history of cinema (this includes Frankenstein's Bride and many others) - this is probably due to the fact that when he wasn't in drag, he was a pretty ugly but funny guy. If the man who pretends to be a woman actually seemed remotely like a woman, I doubt that this movie would work too. Seeing this ugly, rubber-faced man with a mischievous wig STILL being highly sought after by three suitors was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> This is not a great film but from a historical point of view, it is fascinating and an excellent observation for young adults to know how America was for blacks in this era. A very interesting and fun time capsule.
