A stupid and meaningless film should appeal to Southern Rednecks, teenagers with IQs bordering on the retarded and the average Bush supporter. Noble Willingham is the protagonist of this simple script for what it is and uses a generous dose of MFers, eff this and eff that is SOB. The final that I expected to "save" this empty story was the biggest disappointment, leaving me hanging and wondering, "Why"? <br /> <br /> It's a cat and mouse story or more like Bully Vs. victim. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time unless you like to hear the phone ring every 2 minutes and swear and scream continuously in this piece of 123 minute garbage droppings.
