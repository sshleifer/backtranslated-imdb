I must, in light of the eulogy of praise for this film as a spectator, once again assume the role of the asshole in the punch, as Lowell Weicker said, I am scratching my head for the large number of appreciative comments. "The African Queen" this is not. The taste of the period is wonderful, yes. Acting is fine, but no actor, no matter how big the seemingly endless flow of light and insignificantly tedious, table-like conversation can bring to life here, and I don't care how much is taken from Joyce's text. Imagine spending an hour and a half like a fly on the wall in a Christmas dinner of a not particularly interesting group of people (it is not clear to me that it is a family, as suggested by one person), having to listen to their banal speech at table and you have the essential experience of this film. Absolutely nothing happens. And nothing important is said, but it is said to have an endless length. As I said, the popularity of this film is a mystery to me. Speaking of mysteries, look at a good one rather than this one.
