20 years ago the dr. Chopper (yes, he is driving a helicopter and tearing people to pieces) disappeared when the police found bodies in his clinic. Since then people have been disappearing around Lake Tanoka (or something like that) and bodies and parts of dead bodies have been found everywhere. It turns out that Dr. Chopper needs body parts to stay alive and brought them to strangers, like a couple of lesbians and 5 sorority girls on their initiation (you get the picture) traveling across Lake Tanoka. When a group of teenagers decides to go camping, they are forced to confront the doctor ..... <br /> <br /> Well, if you want to lose some time this is the right choice. Acting varies from really bad to mediocre with girls who stumble and fall continuously for no apparent reason. Every chance of showing the skin is taken, but without actually showing anything. The same goes for the special effects that are rather pathetic with each slash turned in a corner, so you can't see it, but there are many parts of the body in the film all soaked in blood (probably to hide how sad they really are). The plot is rather flawed and the dialogue rather sad. Only the time I laughed was when Dr. Chopper said: "Howdy!" when trying to be scary. Don't look at this if you're not a hack'n'slash freak. Even then I would advise you to look at something better.
