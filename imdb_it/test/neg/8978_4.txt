Although this was Hunter S. Thompson's first documentary, I saw that it was average at best despite the involvement of big appearances by stars like Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Gary Busey and a few others. I was disappointed with this and yet it was still a bit interesting. What kept me from watching were some of the old clips from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Where the Buffalo Roam. Not so good especially because of the old guys wandering and things that any fan might already know. I still think they were milking because it could have been half compressed. However if you are a fan you would like everything that has to do with the hunter. best regards
