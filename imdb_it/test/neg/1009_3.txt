This film lacked credibility for two reasons. One, no mayor of a big city, and New York is certainly the most important ever. It would allow a village in its city to degenerate into a place so violent to live; especially for voters who may have a lot to say about their future job security. All the victims of the film were mostly elderly, Jewish or helpless. At 62, I never saw a film that described such a total lack of respect for authority as this film did. Even "Fuga da New York", which was fictitious, on the front line, that is, they told you that this was science fiction, did not resort to such deep-rooted violence. In this film, most of the elderly victims were victimized and still armed but were not willing to use them. Also, in this film and I haven't seen the previous two, it's more lawless than the movie "Escape". Secondly, the gangs as far as my research shows have never been as collaborative as in this film. On the one hand, they take a gang member from another gang that works in their area and is killed. However, when the heroes start shooting at local gangsters, the next gang is welcomed with open arms. The external members of the gang are always seen as strangers and are stopped. We should believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, the other bands want to be there. Why did the outside gangs come in handy? I believe that more than one external band has helped. What did they come for? Another question, why was the gang leader in jail and why are his fellow prisoners asking for permission to attack Bronson's character? It wasn't a great movie and I could go on, but I won't.
