Hercules ended up falling into the same category as many promising television productions that could have been a great classic, only to become a sad joke. I really like Kevin Sorbo and his supporting cast, but I don't. I'm not interested in the direction the show has taken from their film equivalents. I think the show would have had a much more positive outcome if they kept the same format they had for the movies. <br /> <br /> I looked at the beginning and lost interest along the way. I met the strange episode later, but my attention was lucky to get to the commercial break.
