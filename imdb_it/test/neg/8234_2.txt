I consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies. The more bizarre and imaginative the film is, the more blood and courage, the better, and I really fall in love with cheap gestures if they are done well. Luther starts quite well ... his origins in the circus, a chilling run in a supermarket, an attack from an old lady, and his disturbing occupation of a woman's farm created the atmosphere well. A hot sex / shower scene occurs when the woman's daughter and her boyfriend arrive home. When Luther steals the boyfriend's bike, the film takes a bad turn. <br /> <br /> The characters are presented with numerous opportunities to: A) save their loved ones, B) get the police to help, C) escape, or (especially) D) KILL LUTHER !!! I can't feel empathy or fear for characters too stupid to help themselves. The mercenaries disregard the possibilities to arm themselves with guns and knives while Luther is away. Eventually a policeman arrives and is equally ineffective in stopping Luther, though at one point he has a rifle pointed straight at Luther while Luther cluck and makes his interpretation of Polish dance. I found myself driving my television futilely: "Make sure he's dead!", "He's gone, get out of there!", O "Kill him and that's it!" <br /> <br /> Luther is a bloodthirsty savage, but it is certainly not Hannibal Lecter. If you can't outsmart this egghead, you deserve what's happening to you. In the middle of the film you will be so lethargic for the destinies of the naive medium that only a morbid curiosity will support you to last until the end, slightly amusing. This film has been noted as one of the 101 best Fangoria movies you have never seen ... well, Fangoria has a half role in the case of Luther the Geek.
