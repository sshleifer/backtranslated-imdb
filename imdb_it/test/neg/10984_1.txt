There is a beautiful view to look at here, if you can keep your eyes open long enough to see it. I'm a big fan of life-slice movies, but these people are just trivial. Although there is nothing political here, the whole film can be seen as a political statement, as it shows how communism destroys the individual, making everyone the same bland animal that simply spends its life sleeping, eating and occasionally making love.
