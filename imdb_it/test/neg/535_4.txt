I had pretty high expectations for this film. I always thought that the lesser-known films by Tom Selleck (ie Runaway and Coma), where well beyond those for which he needed the most press. Perhaps the producers should have had a little more knowledge of the former Major League baseball players who became stars abroad. Most were players who were too good at triple baseball, but not exactly the main league. I admire the idea of ​​putting the character of Selle in Japn, compared to the cliché of having played in minors. Sad to say, this film, very similar to the post title, is stuck on the third by a film that seems to work on autopilot. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel and hopefully the producers learned from mistakes. The premise is simply too unique to be left alone with this irregular film
