Seriously, I don't understand how Justin Long is becoming more and more popular. Either he has the best agent in Hollywood, or he recently sold his soul to Satan. It is almost unbearable to watch on the screen, it has little or no charisma and terrible comic timing. The only film he tried to anchor that I remotely enjoyed was Waiting ... and this is almost exclusively because I worked in a restaurant. But I digress. Apart from its terrible advantage, this film has many other debts. I understand that it is supposed to be an inexpensive popcorn comedy, but that does not mean that it absolutely needs to insult our intelligence, and to have written so incredibly trite that it borders on the offensive. Even the considerable talent of Lewis Black is wasted here as well, since he is at his highest incendiary when he is immoderate, which the PG-13 rating will certainly not allow. The only bright spot in the film was Jonah Hill (which will seem almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the meantime). His one liners were fun occasionally, but they certainly weren't enough to make this anywhere near bearable. If you just want to completely turn off your brain (or better yet, don't have one) then maybe you'll have fun, but I can't recommend it.
