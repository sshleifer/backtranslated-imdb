This film had very few points, special effects and acting were really horrible. But it was a movie made with a low budget, so you don't expect much, it has some laughter (I doubt they are meant though :)). The scene in which the old woman bends over and touches the dung that was on the floor, then puts it on her nose and goes to CHUPACABRA! in a really stupid and hoarse voice he had no price. All in all, if you have nothing else to look at and you just want to laugh at a really nasty movie, trying to cash in on the Blair Witch Project's success, then take it and then don't worry.
