Take some dark and stormy nights, fog coming in from the coast, obsession and doubt, two brothers who have a mysterious hate-based connection, a suspicious disappearance, a shoe in the night that silently grinds out a glowing cigarette butt, and finally, a tremendous heroine who finds herself threatened both by her own doubts and by one - but which one? - of the men around her. Looks like we could have a good 80 minute noir. Instead, under the direction of Vincente Minnelli and with two A-list leads, Katharine Hepburn and Robert Taylor, Undercurrent becomes a matinee melodrama of almost two hours, a long series of threatening anxieties amidst the perfectly curated cast, coitus and dress. When you look at your watch in the middle of the movie and with a sinking heart, you see that you still have an hour to go, both you and the movie are probably having problems. <br /> <br /> Minnelli, in one of his first non-musical films, does not rely on the approach of the rococo greenhouse as heavily as it was later known. However, what is basically a simple story of greed, murder and obsession turns into an endless vehicle, Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn shows us in carefully lit up close-ups how to demonstrate fear, love, anxiety, vertigo, happiness, doubt, suspicion and terror. Robert Taylor is more or less long for the race. <br /> <br /> Hepburn starts the film like the tomboy Ann Hamilton, an energetic young woman in pants who helps her father with his inventions. Their housekeeper is determined to get her married. When Dr. Hamilton decides to sell an important formula to Alan Garroway (Robert Taylor), it is love at first sight. Garroway is the fluid, beautiful and dynamic inventor of the Garroway Distance Controller, which was fundamental in the war, and which turned it into a tough millionaire builder. He is an industry captain, as one of his many friends in Washington says. Ann Hamilton, now Ann Garroway, may still be a bit tomboy, but her husband shows her how to dress and how to be a successful social worker for all those members of Congress and judges whom her husband knows. Learn quickly and impatiently. Both are obviously and blissfully in love. <br /> <br /> But wait. Cancer is about to gnaw. Ann realizes she doesn't know anything about her husband's family. None of his employees or friends seem inclined to talk to you about it. When he gradually learns that Alan's mother died in the old family home in Middleburg while he was sitting on the floor, or that he has a brother, Michael, who disappeared, Alan becomes very quiet ... and sometimes he goes over all the furies. Always apologizes. But wait again. Did his mother really play the piano? Did she really die in bed? Didn't Michael get caught taking money from the family business and Alan sent him away? All this is played against the hotel's exquisite suites, the well-kept country house in Middleburg with the stable and the refined beach house. Everyone in the film, except for the clerks, are dressed up. There are exclusive cocktail parties and intimate dinners for twenty. Even in a black and white film, Minnelli can't help but give us dining tables full of crystal and porcelain, refined and elegant furniture and lots of clothes. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, when everything is finally known, when Ann on horseback is chased along a high mountain trail, extremely well designed by the villain into another horse, when she is threatened with death by boulder and his pursuer finally meets death on horseback, it's a relief. Even Robert Mitchum, who plays Michael, is unable to bring much tension to the film. What could have been in the lower hands a small stretched B-movie, instead with list A it's just a twisted melodrama, too big for his bones.
