This film is total. I love Val Kilmer and I was very surprised at the beginning of this year by "Felon" (a good movie!). The whole DVD box is misleading. Val Kilmer while being advertised as one of the main people in this film, is in the film for about 2 minutes. Even the summary on the back of the DVD is not completely true. This may have been a good movie, but the direction was horrible and the plot was as thin as a sheet of paper. Usually when a movie is so horrendous you can sit and laugh at it. Even though this film is so bad and boring, I fell asleep (which I never do during a movie). AVOID ALL COSTS!
