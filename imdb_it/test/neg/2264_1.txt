As a passionate fan of Gone With the Wind, I was disappointed to see the original film and saw that they had left out many important characters. Fortunately, the film was a wonderful piece. When the book Scarlett came out, I read it hoping to follow two of my favorite literary characters later in their journey together. While the book lacks true quality, it remains a beautiful story, and as long as I was able to separate it from the original, it was and still is pleasant. However, I consider the six hours I spent watching the "Scarlett" miniseries to be among the worst hours of my life. Discrediting any original character traits so well formed in Margaret Mitchell's book, this series has also transformed the story of the sequel into one of the reports of rape, mistrust, murder and deformities that even the Scarlett book has kept away. The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well formed in both the original novel and the film, and even completed in the second book, and again left out at least one incredibly crucial character. In the novel, Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her ex-husband, Rhett Butler, to Charleston under the pretext of visiting the extended family. After coming to an "agreement" with Rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her relatives O'Hara in Savannah. In the end, he accompanies his cousin Colum, a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood, in Ireland, to further explore the "deep roots" of his family and is finally called "The O'Hara", the head of the family. While her duties as The O'Hara keep her busy in her city of Ballyhara, Scarlett ventures into the world of English landowners, and immediately becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. She, having been scorned by Rhett over and over again, eventually agrees to marry Luke, the Earl of Fenton, until Rhett arrives in a clich√© "night-on-white-horse" - type of rescue. The miniseries "Scarlett" also fails to do this justice. Struck by her boyfriend and scorned by her family, the series shows Scarlett thrown into prison after being blamed for a murder committed by her cousin. <br /> <br /> I warmly recommend anyone who is spending the day looking at this to rethink this decision.
