Actually I went to this film with some expectations, not because I thought the film sounded particularly good, but because I'm a fan of Italian exploit films and with a cast that sees Franco Nero and Telly Savalas alongside Oliver Twist, the I realized it had to be interesting at least. Well ... RedNeck has one or two positive things going on, but for the most part; it's a boring film, lifeless, ridiculous and useless. The plot simply focuses on two criminals (Nero and Savalas) who kidnap a kid (Oliver). The turning point in the story is that the child realizes that it would be more fun if he were accepted in the "band". Telly Savalas and Franco Nero are two actors who have shown that they can bring a movie alone on numerous occasions, and have some memorable moments in this film - even if for all the wrong reasons. In particular the Savalas give a stupid representation of the "bad" criminal. The plot does not flow badly, but since nothing interesting happens, it is not really a positive point and does not save the film from being mediocre. Overall, I can't recommend this movie; someone might like him for his cult value, but he didn't do anything for me.
