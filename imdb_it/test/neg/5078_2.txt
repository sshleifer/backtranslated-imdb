Obvious custom vehicle for Ryan Philippe. It seems that the studios hoped he could play a prominent cop and not look like he was eternally 16 (he can't). The heavyweights Jason Statham and Welsey Snipes serve as registers for Phillippe, but when I'm not on screen that Phillippe is a spy; his style of superficial acting has nothing to bounce. <br /> <br /> The script is a typical late-20th-century policeman / policeman cop with a ridiculously predictable plot and dialogue raised by TV shows such as "The streets of San Francisco." Snipes resumes his role as the eternal black hat criminal, playing a fool a little less crazy about his role as a Demolition Man. However, Snipes and Statham did not have much to chew. The Statham character announces that he has renounced nicotine and caffeine - something that this film desperately needed injections. <br /> <br /> Really forgettable moment: Ryan Phillippe exposing the Buddhist dogma: Galloway: are you a Buddhist? Dekker: No. It's just something I picked up along the way.
