Seven pioneer children strive independently over many miles of Indian territory and in adverse weather conditions to reach Oregon. <br /> <br /> According to the story, young people who traveled alone for long distances - as with the "Children's Crusade" - were manipulated and exploited by abuse and sold into slavery, but these guys are pretty hard and do their best to prevail in achieving their goal of building a farm in the west. The film is a little too syrupy at times, but it's good for "The Waltons" and "Little House on the Prairie" fans. <br /> <br /> Dean Smith offers a nice performance like "Kit Carson".
