Review: Nunsploitation film. I've been around forever. Some that come to mind are the Mexican devil who loves the movie Alucarda, The Night of the Demons 2, The Convent and, of course, Dante Tomasellis, Desecration. We can't blame someone for trying to exploit a sacred / religious image and turn it around to make it scary. If done right, it works. Here is the most recent addition to the nunsploitation sub-genre simply titled The Nun. <br /> <br /> The story is about this group of girls living in a Catholic school. In this school there is a nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls. The girls who act in self-defense against the abusing nun accidentally kill her and then decide to bury her and not tell anyone. Fast forward 18 years later and the nun is back in search of revenge by those who killed her. <br /> <br /> This film was produced by Brian Yuznas Fantastic Factory. You know, the company that produces horror films in Spain. Need a reminder of the genre of films that this company produces? Well here's a little reminder: Arachnid, Darkness, Romasanta: The Werewolf Hunt, Rottweiler. Get the picture. About the only truly beautiful film that this company produced (in my opinion) was Stuart Gordons Dagon. That's all. Oh no, wait, I think they also produced the excellent vehicle Christian Bale The Machinist. But that's all. So when I consciously rented this movie, I knew I wouldn't see anything good. Yet with all that mental preparation I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> One of the positive things this film is doing is its elegant appearance. The film has a beautiful photograph. It doesn't look like an economic horror film. The film's special effects were fine, with The Nun able to travel across the water. Well, that was an image that lent itself to some good fx moments that sometimes caused a sensation in poor territory, but sometimes they were interesting enough to watch. I dug that scene with the nun hurling herself at people like a bucket of water. It's not a particularly lethal move, but it's made for fantastic graphics. There is some blood here, but not much. One scene in particular that involved the death of an elevator was cold, but unfortunately the film reached its peak with that scene. And it was only halfway. After that, nothing really beautiful happens and the film turns into an incredible borefest. <br /> <br /> The film turns into The Nun every now and then to give us a scare, kill someone and then CUT it! Let's go back to the characters who talk about shit, go through the rooms, open the doors, get the drill. And I personally hate it when a horror movie turns into this. People open the doors and go to the rooms. Boring! And when the characters talk about his terrible dialogue. In a particularly stupid scene, a character decides out of the blue that the nun turns into flesh and blood whenever he's in the water, so it's the way to go and try to kill her. And everyone says OK! And everyone draws up this plan to kill the nun in a water tank. Now, who gave this guy this information and why others took it for granted? Who the hell knows, but his scenes like the ones that make the movie look silly. <br /> <br /> Yet another thing that hampered my enjoyment of this film was the fact that they used Spanish actors who have a thick accent. When they try to speak English it is very difficult to understand what the hell they are trying to say. Id prefer them to be nicknamed, so try to figure out what they're saying and get frustrated. The fact that this DVD does not have English subtitles was of no help. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, it is a film that has slick images, nice sound effects but a terrible terrible script. I imagine this shows that you could have the biggest budget or the best special effects, but if your movie has a negative script with terrible characters and situations that your audience can't connect to, you still have a bad movie. Such was the case with The NUN. <br /> <br /> If you want to have some fun with the nuns, rent one of the films I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Now, as for the creators of this film, they should go and say ten hail mary and light fifty candles to their saint of choice to see if they will be forgiven for making this sinfully terrible film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5.
