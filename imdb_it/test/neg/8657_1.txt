Yash Raj's films are so funny, whatever their job, but are they called the best production company? <br /> <br /> Seeing Bhatt's films they copied the formula, the bikini and everything else with low actors like Uday and Tanishaa <br /> <br /> The film is so horrible that it makes you shudder <br /> <br /> the jokes are so nasty and horny that they make you slap them Uday looks like a gay plus a monkey <br /> <br /> Tanishaa looks like an idiot <br /> <br /> The director thinks we're all idiots Arjun Sablok takes the public for granted Music is saving The camera is good <br /> <br /> Uday Chopra hams like an idiot, Tanishaa looks like Kajol in K3g if Kajol was annoying then Tanishaa is worse, so Tanishaa is worse, the rest is fine
