This movie sucks !! They seem to have chosen to put together the scenes at random. Good blood, but little plot. Sally complains and complains about everything until she becomes a demon. I thought he had premenstrual syndrome. It seemed so. The dubbing in this film is horrible. A scene where the woman was talking and a few seconds before we heard the sound. I knew that at that time my suspicions were correct about not coming from the United States. I tried to follow him but I got lost halfway and found it very hard to believe, even for a horror movie. Some good characters, but not many. It is not worth wasting time.
