Breaking Dawn starts in a Californian college while Professor Simon (associate producer Joe Morton) tells his students that they have to do an intense six-week mental patient study at Cape State Hospital as a crucial part of their education, fail and fail they will never become qualified doctors. A brilliant, young, attractive and intelligent student named Eve (Kelly Overton) receives a particularly difficult patient to study. His name is Don Wake (James Haven) and he is a convicted killer, he was found covered in blood besides the corpse of a woman (Diane Verona) and his young daughter (Jenette McCurdy). At the beginning Don doesn't even look at Eve much less he talks to her, but like the soldier who is Eve continues to try to understand him. Eventually Don starts talking but what he says scares Eve, he says someone is watching her and mentions the name Malachay. Eve then begins to see a dark and obscure figure in every turn, while Don churns out the conspiracy theories and bizarre statements Eve slowly begins to lose his head as the line between fantasy and reality becomes increasingly blurred. Is there anything more in the supposed absurdity that Don talks about besides being the mad delirium of a psychiatric patient ...? <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Mark Edwin Robinson I have nothing but negative feelings towards Breaking Dawn. Now, we all like a nice ending, the kind of ending that surprises us, surprises us, works well with the rest of the film and remains in our memory like the fantastic finals of The Sixth Sense (1999) & Fight Club (1999) to cite just two good examples and to a lesser extent the endings of films like Scream (1996) in which the identity of the killer comes as a surprise and is not so obvious. Then, of course, there are movies whose endings spoil everything that happened before and let's take it as an example, oh I don't know, let's say Breaking Dawn because I've never seen such a terrible ending for a movie, ever. Breaking Dawn begins as a decent psychological horror film with spooky things that start to happen to Eva, it's not the most action-packed movie of any imagination, but it keeps its interest, it's not the most engaging film ever, but it's more than watchable and it's not so bad a movie until the end of the twist, I have to keep mentioning it because everything else up to that point (which was OK to be honest with it) suddenly becomes irrelevant. I'm sure there are people out there who think they have this confusing mess of an ending understood to the last detail, all I can say is that no one will be able to explain this to me satisfactorily and as far as I can it concerns me, it makes no sense and never will be. Breaking Dawn sucks and it's a waste of time watching it to be rewarded with the weakest ending in the history of cinema, it's as simple and direct as that. <br /> <br /> The director Robinson doesn't make a big mess of what could have been a decent thriller, maybe he thought that what he had shot would be fine or maybe it was ruined in the editing room, but I guess it was more likely that it was a junk script while trying to tie all the absurdities together in the space of a few confused minutes and give us a final blow that was happier than happy. It builds up the tension quite well during the first 80 odd minutes, but at the end of the day it's all in vain. <br /> <br /> Technically Breaking Dawn is fine and is generally well done everywhere. The acting is pretty good, Overton is nice and easy on the eye and shows a decent performance. I was just me or the guy who played Don looks like John Morghen star of Italian classics like Cannibal Apocalypse (1980), The city of the living dead (1980), The house on the edge of the park (1980), Cannibal Ferox (1981), Stagefright (1987) and The Church (1989)? OK, maybe it was just me ... <br /> <br /> Breaking Dawn is rubbish, I hated everything because of the last few minutes. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't exactly exciting until that point, but it was OK. Definitely one to avoid as far as I'm concerned even though it seems to have the right share of positive comments on IMDb ...
