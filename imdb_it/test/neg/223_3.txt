The heart of almost every crime thriller is a carefully planned and planned high-stakes super-crime, which 9 times out of 10 is committed by a group of friendly and listless dishonest moralists for those who are not the right life, for those who have returned man is, well, something worth cheering for. Screenwriter James V. Simpson's first-time script for Armored gets this right half. He made an extra-double-sure that we have nothing but sympathy for the Iraq war veteran, Ty Hackett (Stomp the Yard's Columbus Short), who is about to have his home taken away by an evil bank (brother, I ' I was there). And he gave Ty a good family friend in Mike (Matt Dillon) who is super nice and does a job at the armored vehicle company he works with in Baines (Lawrence Fishbourne) and some strange French guy (Jean Reno). These guys like to have fun and make jokes, but they are also serious armored vehicles, so it means they carry weapons and are tough. <br /> <br /> After a while, as theoretically Armored sees, one might begin to think as I did, that perhaps - just maybe - this will be some kind of amazing, ironic and ironic robbery film with some characterizations on the nose that move the story along its natural course, raising the stakes of all those involved in the hope of revealing a truly, truly intelligent plan with many potential moments of "holiness". I mean, music alone is a textbook action film, gritty and angular that work overtime while we deal with close-ups of characters who say things like "I do it" and "Are you crazy?" 45 minutes, the film had a serious potential for the genre. <br /> <br /> Then things really start to smell. These guys, these idiots, don't have a plan. There is no "Ok, here's what we'll do ..." scene, no project, no explosives, no black van or ski masks (despite their "test-run", as you can see in a trailer). No, these guys will steal $ 42 million dollars from their trucks (which are monitored only by a CLOCK contact via radio, despite having sophisticated and high-impact "GPS technology"), and I'm not even going to sit down and discuss it . Hell, Mike just tells Ty about the plan the night before, which is completely ridiculous. But, of course, Ty has his home to think about until Mike promises that "nobody will get hurt", he's on board. Guess, though. Someone gets hurt. Why? Because, in addition to driving trucks into an abandoned factory to hide money, they don't have a plan. It was like this. That was the way they thought things. So, of course, things start to unravel. These cats deserve all they get to be so unprepared. <br /> <br /> This script, frankly, looks like the product of a bad improvisation game: "Armored car, robbed by its own guards ... GO!" Despite an accumulation of decent media that could have brought the film in some interesting directions, the story has completely collapsed and, very soon, NOTHING makes sense, or even remotely plausible. <br /> <br /> When the directors don't have a "hook" for their robbery, their characters seem silly and bungling. And when the characters are stupid and messy, it's hard for an audience to invest in them and their story. And when that happens, every suspense drains the bottom of the film, leaving a laughable and empty hole. <br /> <br /> Jump. 3/10
