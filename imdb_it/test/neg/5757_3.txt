The director and the man FX John Carl Buechler doesn't have to do much to terrorize me; the mere sight of his name in the credits is enough to frighten me in my heart. <br /> <br /> His deplorable straight-to-video release in the 1980s sat on the lower shelf of the horror section of my local shop rental; twenty years later, and his DVDs occupy the same space. It seems that the more things change, the more they remain the same. You can rely on the old JCB to serve dreck, whatever the format and regardless of advances in film production technology. <br /> <br /> In this despicable offer, a group of friends travel to a remote city where they discover the secret treasure of Jeremiah Stone, AKA the forty-nine a threatening cannibal that caused chaos in the mid-1800s. Before the his death, Geremia cursed whoever found his gold, and it won't be long before the pick-ax killer returned, slamming away the unfortunate treasure hunters. <br /> <br /> With his horrible screenplay, the effects and the bad Scooby-Doo style, "The Curse of the Forty-Niner" is Buechler's comparison. Only supporters of the genre Keren Black, Richard Lynch and John Phillip Law give this film any credibility, with the rest of the cast offering performances ranging from bad to terrible (although I will forgive Alexandra Ford, who is a real hottie). /> <br /> Even fans of the ugly horror of slavery will be disappointed that most women keep their clothes on, and many of the dead come off the screen (which is probably not so bad after death on screen they are pathetic). <br /> <br /> 'The Curse of the Forty-Niner' is another in a long list of duds for John Carl.
