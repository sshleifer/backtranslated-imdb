Most of the American remakes of European films are rather poor, but this is in a separate league. Actually this could also be the worst (Sandra Bullock) movie ever made. I dare say that I could have passed as another innocent Hollywood thriller if I had not seen the original Dutch, SPOORLOOS. The altered ending here is quite stupid (and executed with particular ineptitude), but a crime far worse than that is removing all the intelligence and depth of the character that marked the original as a classic. The real horror that lies here is in the fact that the same man who directed SPOORLOOS is responsible for this atrocity. Please, the real George Sluizer please stand up?
