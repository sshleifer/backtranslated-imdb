Stay away from this. The worst thing is the scary story. There seems to be an intent to convey some subtle message of spirituality / love / friendship, but it is so pathetically devoid of any substance that you cannot help but cringe. Also, most of the screen time is far below the standard story of thieves, criminals, and our heroes who deal with some alien time travel artifacts. I know you're looking for problems when you're dealing with time, but the story is fuller than usual. Also you have: cheap sets, bad acting and some of the worst musical arrangements in the history of the moving movie, oppressive, cheap, abrupt and disjointed. All I can say is "Man alive! This movie is bad!"
