Plankton, or Creatures from the Abyss as I am positive is more commonly known as & filmed below as the title Creatures from the Abyss appears above a moving image and in the same font type as the rest of the credits, starts with five 20 something kids , Mike (Clay Rogers) his girlfriend Margaret (Sharon Twomey), sisters Julie (Ann Wolf) and Dorothy (Loren DePalm) and an annoying idiot named Bobby (Michael Bon) who decides to adapt to a small rubber boat and go out to the sea, don't ask why, because I don't know. Oh, and the complete idiot Bobby has left the gasoline behind and never thought of telling anyone, so it's no surprise that they end up in the water without petrol for the engine and, aggravating things, they get trapped in a thunder-storm and find out a corpse floating in the water. Shortly after their luck seems to change when they come across a yacht and in a potential security, in a moment everyone gets on the yacht and they start to explore. First of all, they find a scientific laboratory with various specimens of fish and computer equipment, so below they find fully furnished and luxurious cabins. They find a chemist (Deran Sarafian) who looks crazy and can't talk. They eat fish from the fridge that makes vomit Dorothy vomit green, cockroaches and snails. They learn that these fish live fossils thousands of years old and have been contaminated by toxic waste discharged into the sea and that they fly, mutate, bite and are generally unpleasant around. I can't really worry about going on with this plot, so I won't do it, here's what I think ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was produced and directed by Massimiliano Cerchi in the pseudonym Al Passeri (Mi I hide under a different name if I made such a bad film) and I think Plankton is simply one of the worst films of all time, there are so many things wrong with this film that it's hard to know where to start. First the script by Richard Baumann is total crap, it doesn't make any sense and it's so slow and boring that it was a torture for me to sit down. Why should five people just set sail for the center of the ocean on a dinghy just big enough to fit them all? What were they thinking of doing exactly? Because we often get snapshots of points of view from these fish creatures, but they seem to be totally invisible to the characters because they are never shown on the screen even if they are right next to a character, and how do these fish wander around as there is no boat Is it water to make them swim? People's actions and reactions to things are wrong, they constantly divide, they make bizarre decisions that simply make no sense in the situation they are in and some of the dialogues are as horrible as anything they have heard. I could go on all day on all the holes in the plot and ridiculous things, but run out of space if I do. The fish creatures look horrible, a mixture of rubber junk puppets and some really bad stop motion animation at the end, the scenes in which they interact with the human cast seem terrible with some nasty super imposition. I've heard many comments that say Plankton is bloody, don't make me laugh! Forget that there is practically no blood or blood in Plankton, there are a couple of slimy scenes when Bobby turns into a fish monster while having sex with Julie but it's rather short and he doesn't kill her, it's just a kind of drips of slime on her, grows a couple of tentacles and a fish head comes out of her mouth. Later, Julie's vagina starts dripping dark slime, but that's it, we never see what happens to it or what the slime is. Dorothy has a fish creature that comes out of her back, off the screen, and controls it, but once again we never see what happens to her as Margaret commits suicide, a very short shot of a plastic harpoon attached to her forehead. The grossest scene is when Dorothy vomits that green stuff with what look like cockroaches and snails. That's all, only one person really dies on the screen and for the most part plankton is quite tame and exciting as looking at the dry paint and I almost fell asleep it's so boring. I can't see how anyone can like this total crap, I can't. The acting is horrible, the dubbing is horrible, the characters are horrible and I hate them all. Technically even plankton is predictably lousy, with an estimated budget of just $ 250,000 all I can say is where did the money go? The sets are monotonous and boring with a laboratory and some booths, the special effects are the bottom of the barrel, including the boat that explodes more fake than ever, the cinematography is bland, the music sucks there is no atmosphere or tension and in the as a whole Plankton, like its name, is the lowest in the food chain as it could be. I hate Plankton, it's horrible in every single aspect of its 86 minute duration. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs unless you are masochistic or sleepless.
