Adored by fans for his unusually charming and Hollywood creativity for his softball and user-friendly movie making techniques, Tim Burton tipped the scales too far in favor of the formula with his new flip of a movie legend, Sleepy Hollow. Following the search for Ichabod Crane ?? played by Johnny Depp, who delivers this film so sad is the only brilliant point? in the heart of the mystery surrounding the seemingly random and gruesome murders of a city by a legendary headless knight, the story unfolds as if he intentionally tried to be repulsive. Regarded as the children's bedtime story, the introduction of the characters is full of thrilling, uninvolving chase scenes that, with characters not developed on the run for their lives, produce as much fear as a thrill of The Nightmare Before Christmas. <br /> Toss in an endless bundle of old trees for the environment and a loving blond with wide-eyed, Big-busted (Christina Reechi) and Burton himself has a movie that takes the age-old legend of Sleepy Hollow and managed to do it like a Disney movie without charm or charm. The dialogue was agitated and ridiculous, the severed heads were in abundance and there were enough revealing plot monologues to embarrass people like James Bond. Even with the support of Emmanuel Lubezki, the most sought-after filmmaker in Hollywood today, the wonderful acting of the extraordinary name recognition of Depp and Burton, Sleepy Hollow has nothing to lose.
