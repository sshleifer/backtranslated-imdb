What a really great movie, all I can say is that the writer must love magic mushrooms and LSD very much because this must be the result of one of his 'journeys'. <br /> <br /> Follow the whole movie thinking it's okay this is very strange but hey I'm sure there will be a perfectly valid explanation for all this at the end ... Just to be sorry to find erm no there is no it is no explanation and the turning point in the end makes it even more confusing. At the end of the film you will probably have the same facial expression as if you were in a Que paying for the expense and the merchant told you, please, 11.95 please and you will be going to elbow him in the balls for not having him reason. There are so many factors in this film that they are inexplicable and I think they leave the viewer's imagination in a completely bizarre way. Don't get me wrong I like strange movies, 'The Cell' could easily be described as strange and twisted but in my eyes it's a brilliant film (despite the casting of J-Lo that I don't like at most even if it failed to influence the My opinion). This is not one of those movies, and I think you should consider the characters of those who praise this movie. I can tell you that they are probably the kind of people who would go to an art show, see a patch of pigeon droppings on a white board and say "Oooooh what a masterpiece, the artist has really found a unique way to portray eternity "when in reality all that is, is bird droppings on a table. <br /> <br /> Keep this in mind while watching this movie, <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading!
