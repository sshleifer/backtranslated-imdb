This show is what happened to The Screen Savers after G4 got its hands on it, taking it from a useful source of information about the computer to a show that had as its culminating point moving a miniature web server to the someone's back. /> <br /> With the collapse of the G4 ratings, players have moved away from their original target audience, the players, towards young generics generated by hormones, adding pleasure to the staff and a segment of sexual counseling. Now even the players who applauded the show are initially moving away in disgust. I look forward to the end of the show and the network, largely expired and well deserved.
