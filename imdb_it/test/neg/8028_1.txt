<br /> <br /> I rented this movie on June 20, 2001 and watched it for about 45 minutes. I concluded that looking at an empty screen would have been delightful in comparison. There was not a single person in the cast so I would have shed a tear if hell had opened up and swallowed the whole group. <br /> <br /> So I emailed all my friends and relatives warning them, and I'm taking the time to urge everyone who could see this note to avoid this movie like the plague! I've seen some really bad movies in my day, but never one as bad as this.
