Rozema's 1999 adaptation of Mansfield Park is far superior to this seemingly slightly more faithful film. The 1999 film is insulted by many Austen purists, but I admire Rozema's work in creating Mansfield Park. It may not be strictly Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, but at least it was well written, beautifully filmed and performed well by a top level cast. I don't see how the Austen purists can be happier with this 2007 version of ITV (and rebroadcast on Masterpiece Theater / PBS). The script is poorly glued and turned upside down, production values ​​are lackluster and the cast (apart from Jemma Redgrave and Blake Ritson) are largely guilty of bad acting. I can't think of a worse disaster than Billie Piper as Fanny Price. His appearance was completely wrong (discolored hair and dark eyebrows ??) and his talent was simply not suited to the material. Sir Thomas seemed constipated all the time. Michelle Ryan as Mariah was on autopilot, as were the actors who played Crawford (when I think Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davidtz were in the '99 version, I just shook my head). <br /> <br /> I didn't see the 1983 version, so I can't comment, but I'd recommend anyone curious about giving the '99 version a chance. Read the novel before or after and make a decision.
