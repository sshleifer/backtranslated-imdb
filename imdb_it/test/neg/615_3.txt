This is a film that really makes me shudder. In 1951, MGM and Looney Toons made some of their best cartoons - with extraordinary animation, exceptional backgrounds and fantastic stories. Then, in the late 1940s, a new style of animation began to appear (like the "Crusader Rabbit" series on TV) - animation with an extremely simplistic artwork to save money. Unfortunately, Columbia Picture's cynical ploy worked !! Instead of the public that hated toon (as they should have), many accepted them and the Oscar people (AMPAS) gave this film the award for best animated short film giving legitimacy to an inferior product. Unfortunately, in dollars and in the sense of the Hollywood world, this soon began to creep into the products of legitimate studios, resulting in rather crappy cartoons. Later, it became even worse, in addition to the bad animations and backgrounds, the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults. The intelligence and style of classic cartoons were gone. And for this tragedy, I blame, in part, GERALD MCBOING-BOING - one of the low-cost cartoon grandparents. The story is not so bad, but the animation is a horror and listening to the child saying "boing-boing" is an incessant pain.
