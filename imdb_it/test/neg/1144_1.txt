I sat through all 2 hours. I don't know what was worse, the horrible plot, the crippled characters or the Hawaiian bomb that Eddie's 11-year-old son and his 80-year-old grandfather made sexual progress. The money spent on this was simply emptied on the throne. Matty Simmons should be ashamed. The original idea for this film was "A Swiss Family Griswold" and somehow it turned into this mess. The only positive point is that the evaluations are so negative that we will never see it again on TV. AVOID ALL COSTS ... RENT ERNEST SAVE XMAS or something else.
