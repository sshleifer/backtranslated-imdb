When I saw the trailer for this movie, it looked like a good romantic comedy. I was expecting some light and fluffy fun. Instead, I was bored and a little depressed. <br /> <br /> Honestly, there was no harmony between the leads, and the film had little, if anything, that was fun. The little girl was adorable - when she cried, I cried - but I thought they could use someone a little younger in the role. <br /> <br /> However, the film was full of long, boring silences or swelling of opera music. They are not anti-opera, but I would have preferred them to spend that time making us know the characters, who were all rigid and underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> I was really disappointed in this movie. As long as I saw it, I kept thinking about how much better it would be.
