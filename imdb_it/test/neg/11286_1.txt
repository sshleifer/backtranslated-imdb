Cobb. He sucked. I didn't learn anything about the man I hadn't heard before. Performance was exaggerated. A scene where Cobb and Al are walking down a snow-covered street looking for women in Reno must be one of the worst scenes in recent memory. He is simply stupid and introverted. The flashback sequences were terrible. And they always used the same sequences OVER AND OVER AND OVER. If I had seen the same dose of Cobb fighting with someone on a base again, I would have become physically ill. Looking at this "movie", we learn NOTHING of how it was in the Cobb era. We learn nothing about his relationship with his players, nothing about his days as a manager, nothing about his relationship with his family members, apart from the fact that "he doesn't like them". I thought that when I sat down to watch this movie, I would learn SOMETHING about the era of baseball where Cobb played. Instead, all I could see was a reconstruction of how Cobb hated everything and everyone, and how they hated him. Boy, what a beautiful film (sarcasm was intended). Cobb is portrayed as a constant liar in the film, so which of his stories should be accurate? Who knows? Who cares? No one will see him after seeing this piece of shit. If you decide to rent this movie, make sure the fast forward button on the VCR works, as you will be tempted to use it repeatedly. I hope one day someone makes a GOOD movie on Ty Cobb. I liked this film as much as the people in it liked Cobb, which is to say - I hated it. Now I know why I found it in the RENT ONE GET ONE FREE section of the video store. I think I'll ask you to return my fifty cents to the video clerk, since I can't go back in time that I missed looking at this trashcan. Oh well, what could I have thought of a movie that would feature Robert Wuhl.
