You have to deliver it to writer and director John Hughes. With enormous success behind him in the maladjusted / adolescent vein, he managed to expand into other areas of the comedy, finding in the pact a great ally in the comedian John Candy. Here, after a bad birthday, Candy becomes a better person after having agreed to babysit her brother's children; It is an infallible formula designed to satisfy both cynical teenagers and their parents, and it's no wonder the film was a winner with the theater audience. However, Hughes almost completely relies on Candy's charm to end the scenario, and eventually he can get tired of the repetitive gags with the front and center of the star. The children are smart sitcoms, the other adult blobs are shapeless, and Amy Madigan is too intense, too exaggerated in the role of Uncle Buck's girlfriend. Later it became a TV series, which is suitable because the material was already perfected on television. * 1/2 from ****
