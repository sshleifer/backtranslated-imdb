A great gangster movie, with brilliant performances by well-known actors with great action scenes? Well, not this one. <br /> <br /> It is rather surprising to see such a large cast of famous actors, who have many good films in their filmographies in this film, no doubt this could be one of the worst thing they could appear. <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot is as you would expect from your average gangster biography, nothing new, nothing special. The way it is said makes the film much longer than it is (when I thought the two hours were almost over, I was rather surprised that only 45 minutes had passed). <br /> <br /> The action scenes look a lot like the TV series of the 80s - the A-Team, for example. It's just that in the 80s (especially with the A-Team) those scenes were much more sophisticated than those of "El Padrino". It is particularly fun to see the boys aim their weapons in the air and hit something again (not to mention people hiding behind the doors of the cars that later appear to have been hit). <br /> <br /> acting adapts quite well to the action. Or you have the same reaction to everything that happens (Dolph Lundgren style), or it's so overwhelmed that you might think it's a parody (but unfortunately it's not). My advice is to stay away from this movie, any other gangster movie is better than this.
