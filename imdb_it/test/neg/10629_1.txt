I rented this movie because it is assumed to take place in a jazz club - you know, those trendy, hip places where you might run late Saturday night. Well, there's not an ounce of "cool" in this ridiculous movie. The soundtrack is stupid, the original songs are horrible, the singing of both protagonists is continuously off-key (to be kind) and unprofessional, the plot is no more complex than "boy meets girl", the acting is ridiculous, and the only decent cinematic moments are the scenes in the movie. The jazz club scenes are characterized by a suffering dialogue suffocated by too busy organ music. This Joey de Francesco should keep his day job (unless his day job is not helping with movie scores). Is it possible not only to get back my four dollars, but also my therapy sessions? This film, quite interesting, is so ugly, you might want to watch it. A bit like driving in a bad accident: just look at it at least once. Prepare earplugs!
