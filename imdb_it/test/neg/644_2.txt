Some Plot Spoilers Ahead. <br /> <br /> The so-called Nashville Network renaissance as "The First Network for Men" is a complete disappointment, as is its block of adult cartoons. The new Ren and Stimpy was simply awful, "Gary the Rat" at most mediocre, and "Stripperella" rather unwatchable. This comic is mostly boring; if "Ren and Stimpy" has suffered from excessive exploitation, "Stripperella" is free of shock gags, witty gags, clever gags or gags. The concept is bad to begin with: Pamela Anderson, a super-heroine stripper, saves "The City" from an assortment of super criminals. This cartoon looks like a tribute to extravagant parodies of superheroes, like "Darkwing Duck" and "The Tick", but without the humor and good writing of those cartoons - or even good storyboarding. "Agent 0069" tries to swing between being stupid and sexy, but she is neither one nor the other, and the inability of this cartoon to make her or the other leads to this series. <br /> <br /> Watch your recorded episodes of "The Tick", "and see how it's a real superhero cartoon parody.
