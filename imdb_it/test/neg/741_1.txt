Poor Jane Austen. This dog of a production does NOT do justice to its wonderful tongue on the cheek. Starting from the top ... poorly adapted. The writer deserves a very low score for trying - come to think of it, I don't know what he's trying for, but suffice it to say he lost the brand in the light years !! Couple that with all the excessive and terrible production values, this is an adaptation that should never have happened. It would have been far better if they had given all the money they paid on this flop and given it to a worthy charity. Do yourself a favor, read the book. It is almost certain that you will like it a thousand times more than trying to sit in this atrocious production!
