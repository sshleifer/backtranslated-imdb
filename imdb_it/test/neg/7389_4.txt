A bad movie, but with a reel that is worth savoring. For most of the film, the jokes are bad, the songs are bad, even W.C. The fields are bad. Then there is a sequence with Bob Hope and his former film; the dialogue is witty and the song (a version of "Grazie per i ricordi") light, cynical and delicious. Who was dropped for a while? Yet it makes all the value worthy of the original admission of 25 cents.
