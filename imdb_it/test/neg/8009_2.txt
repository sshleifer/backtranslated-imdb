they (dueringer, dorfer) are good cabaret artists, young, not ugly, they have money, girls love them, the public appreciates everything that is doing them <br /> <br /> and then they made this film ... < br /> <br /> no story, some lines were old in the fifties, the acting is horrible. save your money for something useful, like a present for your girlfriend.
