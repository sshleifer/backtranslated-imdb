"Nuts in May" could be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If Ed Wood were still alive, this would be the kind of film he would make. To say that this film is bad would be the euphemism of the century. But how serious is it? Well, here are two levels of bad quality; "it is so ugly it is beautiful" or "it is so ugly that it is GOD TOO". This film is part of the second section. That little involuntary humor he has does not compensate for the boring, slow, difficult understanding of the film. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Two middle-aged Anglos take a ride in the countryside for some R & R and camping, there they met Ray, the near future by Jim (I will explain later), who is the tent is next to our main couple. During most of the film the two protagonists go around the beach, in a rock quarry and in other exciting places. Among these adventures they talk incessantly of the environment, of vegetarianism, of the collection of fossils, of the duty of a true citizen and of an appropriate diet, all that I want to see in a comedy. They have bored anyone who hears them. The dialogue is not only negative, but the rhythm of some scenes is so slow that sometimes it seemed to me that I had to dose them. The scenes would go on forever and just as it starts to grow and something is about to happen, the scene ends. In the middle of the film I thought to myself: "Nothing is going to happen in this thing, it's really a film about nothing". <br /> <br /> The characters are annoying and constantly repeat things. On the one hand I felt that the director was playing a cruel joke on his audience. The scene I'm referring to is the "Sing Along" scene. In it our two fanciful Englishmen play some music there for us, in reality they were the same 4 four lines again and again and again and again. The idea was to have Ray sing along with them, but Ray knew, like us, that they were the worst songwriters known to man. This scene was beyond boring, from the fifth time the song was played I started to question the existence of a merciful God. <br /> <br /> Words cannot describe the horrible nature of this film. The first thing that strikes you are the indecipherable British accents that most of the cast has. Remember the thick Scottish Trainspotting accents? Times that for 10. <br /> <br /> Towards the end our tree embrace, incoherently, the couple begins to quarrel with some friends of Ray who have total lack of respect for the rules of the camping. Our hero becomes so furious that a climatic battle breaks out between our hero and the head of the infernos. To resolve their dispute the two men engage in a stick battle. It's a stick fight! Now this is where unintended humor begins. I laughed so much because of the ineptitude of everything I thought, "This could make up for the other 80 minutes." After this hysterical battle, our hero runs behind some bushes to cry his eyes and the other man calls Ray, calling him Jim for some unknown reason. <br /> <br /> A stick fight, a crying nature that loves 40 years and a character's name changes 3/4 in the film, Ed Wood would be proud. <br /> <br /> Although, I was again forced to endure the last 10 minutes which, to summarize, ends with a long shot of a pig. Why? who the hell knows. At a certain moment we see a grazing pig and the next the credits start to become protagonists of the screen. One of the worst conclusions of one of the worst films of all time.
