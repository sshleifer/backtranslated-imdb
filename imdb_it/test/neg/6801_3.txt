As the first representation of the turmoil of the 1960s that followed, Diane Arbus (Nicole Kidman) can be excused as a firstborn child of flowers. The film itself does not deserve such a latitude. The lack of character development, the motivation and justification of the character's behavior make the film very disappointing. I sat and watched and waiting for some explanation of the bizarre actions only to find out that Shainberg was allowing me to peek into a story that must have been someone in a joke. The fact that the few facts presented did not correspond to the life of Diane Arbus did not help much in clarifying things. <br /> <br /> The Art Direction faded in the "normal" life of Diane was well contrasted with the brilliant colors in her 'awakening' life with Lionel. And the staircase of the trap door was a beautiful demonstration of Diane's attempt to inject her new life into her existing family (however, I don't see how that trap door in her dining room ceiling could connect directly to Lionel's apartment which was two flights of stairs on her). <br /> <br /> Perhaps my analysis is a bit too literal in looking for a character development and an understanding of relationships that goes beyond a sentence or comment. I also wanted to see at least one of Diane's photos. I will not wait for the sequel.
