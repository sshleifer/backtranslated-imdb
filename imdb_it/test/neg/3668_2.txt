A misguided, miscarry, murky and interminable madness, given the high gloss of the MGM A-budget treatment. Kate Hepburn plays a bride who comes to suspect that her rich and beautiful husband (Robert Taylor) is not the dream boat he married, but a psychotic killer. MGM's attempt at a Hitchcock thriller is condemned from the beginning by a turgid, confused and ridiculous script, and by Hepburn's idiotic casting as a woman at risk for her life (who could ever imagine Hepburn being afraid of something?) Louis B. Mayer forgotten to tell Vincent Minnelli that he directed a thriller, not a musical. Taylor is embarrassing. Only Robert Mitchum, also cast-against-type as a good boy, maintains his dignity in a quiet and discreet performance. The fascinating cinematography of Karl Freund creates images of a disturbing beauty - and has been wasted in the wrong film. Final result: "Parnell" Metro from the 1940s.
