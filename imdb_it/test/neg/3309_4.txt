Like many other people, I heard about "more" and wanted to see it because of the music composed by Pink Floyd. I must say that I was really disappointed, not because of the music but because of the film itself. it's a boring, insipid film that lacks rhythm. Where does this disappointment come from? In my opinion, from different things. First of all, the subject of the film, the drug goes wrong with the relaxed atmosphere of the film. This should have taken place in the sordid areas of Paris and should have created a dark and defenseless climate, for example. Furthermore, he should tell a descent into hell, but this descent is attenuated and barely sketched. Barbet Schroeder does not insist enough on the dramatic side of the story. You could have wished for some madness by cutting. On the other hand, Schroeder fails to win the emotion and the adherence of the public in the face of the anguish of the two protagonists. Carelessly watch their drug trials. Considering that the two main actors are perfectly expressionless and hardly evolve during the film, especially Mimsy Farmer. In the end, only the beauty of the Mediterranean landscapes bathed in sunlight is preserved. The film created a tremendous feeling when it was released in 1969. Today it looks dated <br /> <br />. The hippy culture is nothing less than a distant memory.
