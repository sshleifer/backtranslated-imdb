* SPOILERS INCLUDED * <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock's ingenious and innovative adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel was an incredible film, unlike any other previous one. Every shot, every angle of shooting, every nuance was PERFECT. He did not break the rules, he invented a series of new ones. <br /> <br /> Here's the spoiler: there is absolutely nothing new, different or original about this movie. Gus Van Sant does not just pay tribute to Hitch, but tears every idea, and does so in a less original and more conventional way. I had nothing against Gus Van Sant before seeing this movie. I liked Drugstore Cowboy and thought that My Own Private Idaho was a very interesting film. The question that comes to mind when it comes to the remake of Psycho is "Why did you do it, Gus?" <br /> <br /> In my mind, there are only two reasons for making a remake: 1) The original was a good story, but the film sucked. 2) The original was a good film, but someone thought of a new approach to the material. Neither factor is present in Gus Van Sant's version of Psycho. Apart from the fact that it is in color, and there is a scene where there is a montage of disturbing images related to the possible inner dialogue of the title character (which I found not necessary), there is nothing new here. <br /> Also, I found that the casting left something to be desired. Anne Heche was as good as Marion, but lacked a certain vulnerability that Janet Leigh interpreted in the original. I didn't feel in tune with his character, because the choices he faced seemed much less limited as a woman in today's society, as opposed to the choices he would face as a single woman living in the early 1960s. Vince Vaughn took a few laughs with his portrayal of an incredibly naive Norman Bates, but I feel that Anthony Perkins' timing and nervous and tormented appearance were much more disturbing. The only performance I liked most about the original was the character of Lila Crane, played by Jullianne Moore. He was excellent as usual and brought new strength and intelligence to the character. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there is a good job with the camera, especially during the famous "bath scene" in which Van Sant takes advantage of his use of color to show the murder in vibrant shades of red. Yet throughout the film I had this irritating sense of deju vu. Haven't I seen it somewhere before? Oh wait, I've seen it somewhere before! Almost every scene seems to be copied for the original shot. One almost has the feeling that the director has made this film as a school project. "See, I can also make a Hitchcock movie!" <br /> <br /> If you haven't already done so, go see the original. It has stopped over the years, and beats this piece of mediocrity, hands down. You will not be disappointed.
