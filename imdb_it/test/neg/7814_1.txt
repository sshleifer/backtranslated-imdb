This film must be one of the worst I've ever seen. The humor was rough, hardly funny and was heard a million times before. The departure was special and the situation worsened. I came halfway and could not bear to see others. Fortunately I only saw it on TV, so it didn't cost anything, but I seriously recommend not wasting time or money. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the film was new. The characters were not developed at all. Actually I think it would have been better as a children's movie because it was full of stupid and unrealistic "funny" events that happened ... it's like what happens at home alone or something. Not to imply the house alone was in no way as terrible as this.
