An interesting concept transformed into carnage ... <br /> <br /> My first feature film by Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper), when I started taking an interest in it, at the time seemed an interesting concept ... <br /> < br /> Shakespere + Aussie Film + Gothic setting + Melbourne Gangland <br /> <br /> A very strange mix that has turned into a disastrous Australian film that gives my country a bad name ... <br /> < br /> Pros: - Interesting instruction <br /> <br /> Cons: - Management of a good cast - Stifled and stupid construction - Camera corners - Not much variety of places - Use of Shakespearian diologue of footprints <br /> <br /> Overall: Australia's worst attempt at a Shakespeare film, Stick to Baz Lurhman ... or Romper Stomper (WARNING: That movie is dangerous)
