To define this film as a complete waste of celluloid would be a euphemism. <br /> <br /> The acting was nothing short of convincing, especially by actor Craig Fong, who could not have acted more rigidly. As for the story ... well ... what a story ?! The "film" speaks nominally of Harry Lee, a Malay of Chinese descent who returns to his country after failing every course he has followed and tries to create a band. <br /> <br /> The film has always had a clich√© you can think of: sex, tension between band members and some racial tension. <br /> <br /> The problem is that even with a subject who has been adequately treated even by the most amateur filmmakers, this film is everywhere and the whole thing simply feels invented with parts that would make the auditors' hair more bristling hardened. <br /> <br />
