So my friend and I are having a good time in our local movie rental shop and we are looking for something to collect with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, so why not take the third episode of the Scarecrow series!?! Keep in mind that this is not just the Scarecrow Three; this is, Scarecrow: Gone Wild. Now we both saw the first two Scarecrows, so we felt obliged to finish the job. Let's start with the DVD cover first. First we see a photo of Ken Shamrock ("The most dangerous man in the world") on the cover. He was apparently used to marketing the film as a "protagonist". By the way, it has the least display time of any member of the accredited class. Next we see a photo of a very attractive and very poorly dressed woman in the middle of the cover. I can assure you that it is not in the movie .... at all. At the time of the rental we thought that this should have reiterated the fact that the scarecrow was "unleashing". In the background we noticed a great carnival on an island in the ocean. I can also assure you that even the carnival is not in the movie ... at all. Looking back and my friend should have known there was something. I really mean, who the hell puts a carnival on an island. Now on the current film. We start when a young man is inexplicably fused to a scarecrow in the middle of a corn field. Don't ask me how they were fused, but think of when Brandon Lee awoke from death in The Crow. It's just that stupid. But in defending the scarecrow, he is "mad". Anyhoo, the scarecrow, who now lives vicariously through the young man, travels to his local beach to brutalize those who have wronged him. Because yes, in the world of The Scarecrow, the beaches are in the same general vicinity as the cornfields. To cut a long story short, the scarecrow kills everyone who stands in his way without any warning except for the whistle of the scarecrow mark that signals a cut. This is however quite impossible to believe because the scarecrow's costume mouth is clearly sewn. Several tracking shots that would have rolled Kubrick into the grave later, and we have one of the worst third parties in a series ever. Well, except maybe the third Matrix. As Joel Siegel would say, "This scarecrow is terribly bad."
