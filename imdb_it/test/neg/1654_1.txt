My God! The Beeb touched a new low with this shameless act of political correctness, a mixed-race family living in Birmingham with a disabled child launched for good measure. Anyone who has commissioned this tripe should be hunted and thrown to the dogs. The usual fun Jasper Carrott is as fun as a pile of this show and it doesn't get me started by others. They have the timing and subtlety of a nuclear bomb. I just hope the play gets better, but with characters like Little Britain and Catherine Tate I seriously doubt it. I think you'd better get the box set for a decent comedy than other times like Fawlty Towers or Bottom if you want a laugh. <br /> <br /> BAN THIS RUBBISH SQUEAKY CLEAN!
