This film brought a completely new meaning to that well-worn phrase "how to look at dry paint" because this was "like looking at dry paint in the middle of a monsoon". <br /> <br /> I was attracted to the film by its location on the west coast of Portugal I visited. It is an extraordinarily beautiful place and black and white has introduced a new dimension to beauty. That was the only good thing. The story was terribly trivial and frankly you have to have some history. <br /> <br /> A film crew has finished the films and the whole crew has to wait. Well, waiting is an expectation. I can wait for a bus number 15 on Princes Street in Edinburgh, I can spend hours at a remote train station in the middle of nowhere during the cold Sunday afternoon in winter. However a wait is boring and yes, even this waiting was boring. <br /> <br /> Then the leader goes to America to protest with the supplier of the film that punishes him for not having done everything in color. After a certain number of arguments, two blessed bullets resound from everywhere and finally the long-awaited end arrives, and not before time. <br /> <br /> Yes, I would see this movie again if someone armed me with a couple of cans of color film so that I could throw them on the screen.
