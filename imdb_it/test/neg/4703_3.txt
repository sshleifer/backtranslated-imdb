THEREFORE IT IS WHEN the head of the Columbia of their Unit for short subjects started his direction, eh? Yes, it is no less than Mr. Jules White who is credited (or rather "exposed") as the director of this entry in the MGM DOGVILLE series. Given the co-credit as co-director is a Zion Myers; whose name is unknown to us so far. Mr. Meyers was, without a doubt, the boy who controlled the four-legged actors and was responsible for training and "acting". In short, it must have been the Dog Trainer on the set. <br /> <br /> THE TITLE OF THIS SHORT FILM is without doubt a game on the MGM film of the same year, THE BIG HOUSE; played by Chester Morris, Wallace Beery, Robert Montgomery and a stellar cast in support. We must implore ignorance about this title; not having seen it up to this point. (Sorry, Schultz!) But there are many gags that refer to what we read about the film *; not to mention some character-specific gags. For example, we observed a death row inmate who st-stammered and correctly deduced that the wow-bow actor was imitating the comic character, Roscoe Ates. Later we cross-checked the cast of THE BIG HOUSE and soon his name is there! (Brilliant deduction, a measure for Holmes & Watson!) <br /> <br /> EXERCISE of the popular features of lampooning was already a tried and true practice in the realm of comedy short films. It was one that seemed to have no objections from the producers and owners of the copyrights of the main films; but rather a bunch of tax approvals received backwards. After all, imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery; moreover, any producer would even like a seemingly irreverent parody. ** As for the film itself, we found it interesting in a kind of perversion. To see so many "best friends of man" to be so artificially animated in a single, long and boring form of anthropomorphic gag seemed to us very tiring, which constitutes the public. I mean how many little dogs have been made to bark, to no avail, to get the illusion of "talking"? <br /> <br /> WHEN IT COMES TO PETS, OR "ANIMAL COMPANIONS", AS THE POLITICAL CORRESPENS PREFERENT, WE'RE RATHER THAN ETHICIC; favoring not only dogs; but also cats, hamsters and parakeets. We don't like to see any animal exploited in a game format that is not so fun and extensive. <br /> <br /> INCREDIBLE AS It might seem, the step that Mr. Jules White made of MGM's Shorts to direct Columbia's It seems that the production of 2 Reeler was not just a tep up in the area of ​​finance ; but at the $ or in the Content Arts tic. We never thought of being a Director-Producer for the likes of 3 Stooges, Andy Clyde and Hugh Herbert, as well as some who have certainly seen better days, like Charley Chase, Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon; it would be a cinematic step forward. <br /> <br /> IN THE CASE We have not yet clarified our point; we are officially panning for this. So watch it at your own risk. We warned you! <br /> <br /> NOTE * We read excellent reports of both THE BIG HOUSE and Laurel & Hardy send-up, PARDON US (Hal Roach / MGM, 1931) in both MRs. LAUREL & MR. HARDY by John McCabe (1962) and THE FILMS OF LAUREL & HARDY by William K. Everson (1967). Both books have our most enthusiastic approval. <br /> <br /> NOTES ** The image of the prison has become a genre in its own right; all due to a debt with THE BIG HOUSE. In Pardon, in the United States, Laurel & Hardy, Hal Roach and his director made a first class parody, the first of many; for a prison comedy it has become a must for so many characters to watch.
