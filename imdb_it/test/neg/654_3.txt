Okay, this movie starts and looks * like it's a pretty comedy about a completely obsessed soap opera fan. He has no contact with reality outside of soap (a sort of inverse of the main characters of "Pleasantville") and escapes to Los Angeles to meet a fictional character. Well, it's a nice movie ... but at the same time, it's also a dark and very violent movie about two hit men who are trying to kill Betty for complex reasons to tell here. Or the plot would have been enough on its own, but "Nurse Betty" contains both stories simultaneously, and the effect is very striking. I did not like it so much.
