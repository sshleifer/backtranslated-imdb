I think that saying that this film has too many is not what makes this film negative. The twists are not the problem of the film. The story is quite clever and could have been very good if turned well. The biggest problems everyone complains about in the film's turn is that the film is not fascinating enough to make people follow them. The film is badly filmed (at least compared to its genre brother, Lock, Stock). Worse: the characters are (though often well recited) simply flat. The characters do not have enough time to be presented well enough to allow the viewer to be involved in only one of them, let alone to understand them. Oh, and the locations are just terrible: location-person (I didn't bother looking at the credits for your name) - find another job (maybe still photography or interior design)
