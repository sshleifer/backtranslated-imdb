This 3-hour TV-made miniseries came home from Blockbuster this weekend. The production company spent a lot of money on sets, costumes (particularly Bridget Fonda) and special effects (including a large polar bear and Jim Henson reindeer). They should have spent a little more to get a coherent script. The plot was so broad that it never managed to come together. The Germans may be overlooked with Irish accents, but not the erotic narrative. With meaningless loose ends that included a special appearance by the Devil, this is certainly not intended to be a Christmas classic. Too bad that they have wasted the good performances of the two female protagonists.
