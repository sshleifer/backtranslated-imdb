A little too rough for me. The cast was beautiful, beautiful to look at in all the romantic scenes. The place was beautiful with blue skies and azure water. He simply didn't convince me that such a cruel man who is prone to nothing but his building could attract so many beautiful and vulnerable women. I think only in the Mediterranean. Certainly in no world with which I am familiar. The macho were really hateful and I found it hard to believe that female characters could have something to do with them for so long. The script, the cinematography, the direction, etc. It was created to offer a Class B movie, the main effort is to show beautiful female boobs exposed. It was aesthetically beautiful for a while, but could not sustain a very mediocre film.
