I've never seen the other two "Ninja" movies and as far as I know they are known, but for some reason I saw this. This starts pretty fast since this ninja goes into a super murderous madness. It is almost unstoppable because it requires a considerable number of bullets to bring it down. He is not out for the count though as he ends up owning a woman and then continues his ways of killing using her as his tool. Another ninja enters the fray and apparently the only way to kill a ninja is with another ninja, so he volunteers. This leads to a great battle eventually when the dead ninja returns to his body and they have him out in a total war. It looks better than it actually is, but at least it wasn't boring.
