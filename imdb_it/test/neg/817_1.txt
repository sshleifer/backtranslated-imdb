I say this. If you want to see art, go to an art gallery. If you want to watch a movie, go to a theater. Trying to weave art and film proves disastrous in "Where is the heart". An interesting cast is totally wasted on this embarrassment. You like Dabney Coleman, see "Short Time". You like Crispin Glover, see "Bartleby". You like Uma Thurman, see "Kill Bill". Above all, if you like Christopher Plummer, see "The Silent Partner", because his character here is a terrible embarrassment. In reality this entire production is an embarrassment. Of course, the human artwork is intriguing for a few minutes, so make a brief, but don't subject the public to unnecessary absurdity, masquerading as filmed entertainment. - MERK
