I got this movie in a business basket, hoping for a funny and bad movie. Boy was disappointed. (except for avon.) See, the movie is really horrible, but so horrible, it's not even ridiculous. The plot, oh wait, there is no plot. I suppose we can say that this is the main character that rises in the ranks of street fighting. At the end of the film, the directors decided they no longer made sense, or, more likely, they died and ended up with a monkey to direct the film. DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO SPOILED! even if the ending does not spoil anything. The main character ends up in a room full of mirrors, at the Enter the Dragon, and then gets angry, has a stupid flashback and hits a mirror. The end. Wheeee. <br /> <br /> The only saving factor of this film was the Avon scene. He's talking to the rival boss of the street and he says something like that, completely impassive: "Don't worry about him anymore, sir, I killed him in a sophisticated way, I won him, I had dinner, we went to the disco. We had fun a lot and then I killed him ". at that point the boss says "good job, you're number 1." And avon says "Number 1! Alllriiiiight! Alriiight!" The scene continues with avon continuing to say "alllrriiiight!" over and over. The next scene is of a dead Avon floating in a pool. Intelligent? I do not believe. <br /> <br /> Finally, I own the "Homeboy" version of this movie, which means that the title on the box I own is "Homeboy". Shows a huge boy holding a giant gun and screaming. This never happens in the film. This man is never in the film. High quality. <br /> <br /> Note - I am new to this review, but hell, yes, I will continue to do so.
