Too bad some good talent was wasted. This is a boring and overly conscious film that could tell its story in half the time. Is Derek Jacobi under that beard who plays two roles? Gosh, who would have guessed. <br /> <br /> The emotional payoff in the end was weak and unsatisfactory. Certainly not worth bearing the film's padded length. I felt quite disappointed. <br /> <br /> The sound was terrible. First, they used repertoire music. Secondly, it was so strong during some dialogues that words were difficult to understand. Only three crew members and a trainee? There were more people listed in the credits for accounting or legal. <br /> <br /> Some of the shots were pretty good, and the actors did a good job with a mediocre script. <br /> <br /> It's not a good use of viewing time, at least for me.
