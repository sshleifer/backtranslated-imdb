This film moved too slowly for my taste. The concept of the story is pleasantly different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally retarded family member in a way I've never seen before on the screen. However, the execution of the concept was imperfect. Each character developed completely in the scene of his first appearance, so it was necessary to endure the feeling that each character was trampling the water for the rest of the journey. That is, every character clumsily interpersonalized his relationships with others in the film, which I found to be a form of emotional and social retardation. I suppose he has an artistic merit, given the irony that the story revolves around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by friends and family of above-average intelligence. The acting, however, was well done without exception. I agree with the other reviewers that the cinematography was beautiful. In summary, I think the film has a strong artistic merit due to cting and cinematography, but fails emotionally due to the shortcomings described.
