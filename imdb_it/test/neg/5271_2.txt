Well, <br /> <br /> First of all, as many reviewers have pointed out, this is a rip-off of Martin Cahill's story - first represented by the BBC and John Boorman's "The General" - which is a great movie and much, much more than that. <br /> <br /> Speaking as an English native, the supporting cast for Kevin Spacey was really good in terms of British and Irish acting talent, especially Peter Mullan - but it was completely wasted. The characters were c ** p! And as for Kevin Spacey - he didn't see himself as a lovable thief but as nothing really meaningful or significant. <br /> <br /> Not much to redeem this film. The best pieces are the gags and the rigged sockets from the other films that tears. Compare the notes on this film and "The General" - I would be interested to see what others think. <br /> <br />
