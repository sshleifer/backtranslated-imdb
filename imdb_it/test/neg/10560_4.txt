As a professional poker dealer for over 25 years I have found this film very difficult to watch. Too unreal. It seems that the producers of this film had done little or no research or simply didn't care. Card tricks are something you would never see performed in a real poker game. Good sense, isn't it? He was also full of movie cuts and so on during the tricks. Who could not do it? The scam was amateur stuff. Palming, marked cards, etc. Would you sit in a high-limit game where they use open deck cards? Would you sit in a game where players push their chips into the middle of a pot (constantly), mixing them and then only verbalizing how much they bet? LET'S GO, STRENGTH! I gave a 4 because the turns could be interesting for some people, but for those who know how to play the game it will be quite painful. Next time they should use real players and have some ideas on how to do it the right way. OUCH !!!
