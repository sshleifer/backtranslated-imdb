The whole film has barely arrived ... Acting is bad, dialogues are even worse. I felt like st00pid 4 watching it, but it was called the same as one of my favorite games, so I struggled a lot. They even ruined the sound. In some parts of the movie the background music is so loud that I had to turn down the volume. It would be nice if this was a competition on who can spoil the most. <br /> <br /> Oh and PS: I don't know what this "Uwe" guy is capable of creating ... I certainly don't. I think this film is bad just because it's the director. I checked the list of his works, and this is his first (and probably the last) creation I saw. <br /> <br /> over & out.
