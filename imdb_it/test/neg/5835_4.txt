I challenge you to watch this movie and to deny the above statement. That is, IF you can stop looking at his virtually flawless face. He also does some fighting and a bit of shooting, but not as much as I hoped. The film is extremely slow and on a tight budget, although at least they tried to find an excuse for the so-underpopulated spaceship; almost the entire crew is in "suspended animation" and the ship moves on an autopilot! And the heroine does not save any of them, nor does it report anything useful to "home"; it seems that to deceive the evil woman in space travel was the only part of her mission that could not be more easily realized by the missiles that explode the ship at the end. There are also some long but rather softened soft-core scenes, and a couple of "Alien" monsters that kill about 2 people. * 1/2 out of 4.
