Michael Caine's character has problems. He is a simple man, short-sighted and insecure in the mid-1940s. He is married but his wife no longer seems to love him. He has a poor relationship with his only daughter. But his most immediate problem is that an extraordinarily beautiful young woman, played by Michelle Johnson, is chasing him too hard, kissing him, touching him and trying to start sex on every occasion. What is the poor boy to do? <br /> <br /> This film should be removed from the Comedy section and placed under Science Fiction. Only an intergalactic brain chip can explain the actions of Michelle Johnson's character. Let's see - 3 billion men in the world - she can almost choose her choice - she goes with a clumsy and old loser. This goes beyond the middle-aged male fantasy into something so delusional, you just hope that everyone involved voluntarily undergoes therapy. <br /> <br /> There is nothing really fun here. There are some quick attempts at wit by Caine, who often seems to play Hawkeye Pierce more than a new character. Joseph Bologna is like nails on a blackboard. Michelle Johnson is not an actress - she has a crying scene that won't go unnoticed in a school play - but she is beautiful and takes off her clothes. Then buy the DVD, jump to scenes 4 and 9 and forget the rest.
