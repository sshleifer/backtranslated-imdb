and totally not scary movie. The characters don't care at all and are spent most of the time in a car. The dog is at best ugly, never really scary. To interest, a more threatening threat would have been needed, at least some people you care about and evoke some emotions in you. And, not least, something interesting has to happen. Something unexpected. As it is, this film always drags on, in what appears to be forever. Perhaps a Saint Bernard was not so smart to choose as the Terrible Threat to life and society? <br /> <br /> In most scary movies / thrillers / thrillers, whatever the genre, there must be characters that arouse interest and make you want to know what happens. Here you really don't care, you just have to wait for everything to stop, and you wonder if it would be better to see something else. One of the weakest adaptations of the king.
