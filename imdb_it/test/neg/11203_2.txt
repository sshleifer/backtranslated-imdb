Tarzan, the leader of environmental awareness, faces four trappers who, by unorthodox means, kidnap animals to take them to the zoo. Tarzan has a dull but quite sexy wife with an impeccable hairstyle and a child. No one should criticize Tarzan for being saddened by the vicious actions of hunters. <br /> <br /> This film by Gordon Scott Tarzan is one of the most foolish, completely and unnecessarily foolish; for one reason or another, the team didn't find anything fascinating to support the film, and so it's just a silly nonsense. Tarzan and his family are threatened by a group of bad hunters, because Tarzan's environmental awareness has led him into open conflict with the evildoers. The child and the chimpanzee, both belonging to Tarzan, are kidnapped by bad hunters; so Tarzan calls the wild animal forces of the jungle to free the child and the chimpanzee with Tarzan leading the attack. TARZAN AND THE TRAPPERS is foolish, unattractive, quite uninteresting. Perhaps as a child I would have liked it? Now those pathetic hunters punished by Tarzan must be too petty as wicked to ask Tarzan for a shot of not being a fool; this grant. But one also has the right to ask these Tarzan films, however foolish, to have and to show some taste a little taste. A few kicks, a little excitement, a little fun. Now the failure of Gordon Scott Tarzan is too foolish exactly in the sense of having no taste at all, of lack of excitement. (Yes, I liked the sequence of the jungle beast that ate a snake. What beast? Watch the movie, kiddos, now I've given you an excuse to do it.) For one reason or another, the bad guys look a little pathetic and arouse pity rather than virtuous anger. <br /> <br /> The books leave the impression that Tarzan seemed quite brilliant in his own way; and if finding a decent bodybuilder or other sportsman to look smart enough for the role could prove to be too demanding, almost impossible, Gordon Scott was still too far from meeting that ideal. <br /> <br /> The wife scolds Tarzan for disliking the books. <br /> <br /> The script suggests that Tarzan was ignorant, almost illiterate and unfavorable to learning; but the book says the opposite, and we know that Tarzan has studied a lot, alone, using the books of his missing family, even before meeting the whites. <br /> <br /> And I didn't like this scream. <br /> <br /> (Dear kiddos, you are supposed to be a genuine wild scream, not a missed yodeler.)
