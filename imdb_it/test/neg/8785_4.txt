Whoa. I mean, whoa. I mean, whoa whoa. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie, with my eyes open when I was eight, in 1996. In those days, CGI films were a rarity; and the good ones even more. Furthermore, at the time we listened to things called CD players. But I digress. I really liked this movie a long time ago, and until I saw it again, I really kept some good memories of it. Hey, I'm Don Bluth! Anyone who hates "All Dogs Go to Heaven" is clearly a robot. But again, I digress. <br /> <br /> Then, I saw it again. This is actually not one of his best, I can say now, eleven years later. I have seen many more films and have gathered a little more knowledge. Now, of course, dubbing is good, I'll give it. The story of ... okay. I mean, we always see it. A LOT. But it works. Musical numbers are what bothers me. This would have been more at ease in the 1980s, with this type of musical numbers. In 1996, most children's films had epic numbers, such as the Lion King (released about a year before, but whatever) or things like that. Here you have shows, vaudeville style. <br /> <br /> Even the kind of animation hurts. Sometimes moved, and others completely changing style and format with the change of a shot, it's really hard to miss. <br /> <br /> I still like "All Dogs Go to Heaven, but this may have been better. <br /> <br /> 4/10
