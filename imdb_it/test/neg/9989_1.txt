It's a rare feeling to come across a film so embarrassing that you want to get away from the screen. But when you see a noble actor like Sir John Gielgud surrounded by naked couples and couplers, that's exactly what you want to do. Add to this Peter O'Toole the emperor of syphilis Tiberius and Malcolm McDowell who points a finger at the anus of a male victim, and begin to appreciate that Caligula is of interest only to addicts of sick / outrageous films. <br /> <br /> The film shows the life of the famous Roman emperor Caligula (McDowell), a very disturbed individual whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters, beheadings, betrayals, murders, incestuous relationships and sex scenes lesbians. <br /> <br /> Although Caligula was completely insane in real life, and probably succumbed to his basic instinct most of the time, the film is still unforgivable filth. Sex in the film is not used as an aspect in a multi-level story - sex is history. After a while, all the nudity, the push of the hip and the nipple sucking become boring due to sheer repetition. The performances are totally undisciplined, in particular McDowell who throws caution to the wind and gives an exhibition that is all a wild expression. O'Toole seems to treat the script with the contempt he deserves (surely there is purely for the money?!). It is rumored that other pornographic scenes have been added without the consent of the director during post production, but in reality there is not a single minute to Caligula that is dignified or well done. It is unlikely that this amount of time, talent and money will ever be thrown into a porn movie, so in this sense Caligula is a unique experience of its kind ... on the other hand, it is so monumentally terrible that perhaps the fact that it is "one-of-a-kind" is a blessing in disguise.
