I did a screen test and read the script for this turkey in 1988. It was horrible then and even worse now - I noticed it on VHS at the local HollowWood Video and I said, "oh, hey, for auld ang sine ". Yech. <br /> <br /> They had to shoot most of the film in Mexico after they ran out of money, a couple of cursed whores "stars" because they had finished some kind of exotic fruit crap. The plot of the film is OK, I suppose, but I know for sure that the writer intended it to have a spy thread running. <br /> <br /> Dr O has become a cartoon character. He still has to turn around in his grave on the Kremlin Wall. <br /> <br /> Technical errors were everywhere in the film, not only with infantile atomic technology, but with uniforms, insignia and military jargon. They were too cheap to hire a professional military consultant, of course. Even the presence of August and of Mr. Newman's experts could not have saved this bird from the stuffed for Thanksgiving.
