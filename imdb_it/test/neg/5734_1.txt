In the mid-70s, my NYC got it right. the building was finally wired for cable TV and since Showtime (instead of HBO) was the only premium channel offered with recent films, I signed up. Being a writer and a night owl by nature, I soon discovered that the channel showed films late at night and until the early hours of the morning I had never even heard of American and foreign independent films that had never been given a theatrical version in the United States. Many of them had recognizable "star" casts and highly respected directors, and thanks to Showtime, I discovered many top quality movies that I (and other Showtime subscribers) would never have had the opportunity to see. Most of these movie bastards were really "dogs", but often so bad they were unintentionally hilarious. One evening, Showtime unveiled a small jewel of Italian production called "Redneck" (shot in 1972, given a limited European release in 1973). Although the film was never released in the United States, the MPAA classification was listed as an "R". Since the director was a Sylvio Narizzano (the director who made himself known with the glorious "Georgy Girl"), and the three protagonists were Mark ("Oliver") Lester, Fabio Testi and Telly Savalas, I decided to try it. And I found myself pinned to the incredulous TV screen for 89 minutes. As a souvenir, Savalas and Texts played two criminals, the first a furious maniac who, in a scene of churning, casually sent a German family to death by pushing their trailer from a cliff, falling into the depths of the wild below. So far, so bad. Then, from nothing, Texts (like the "beautiful" psycho) and Lester (all fourteen years when the film was shot) are seen, both naked, in a men's room, Texts that furtively peek at the child's body while he shaves, and poor confused Lester fixed on close-ups of the bare backside of Testi. Being a not-yet-exhausted member of the film industry, and a liberal who carried papers (I was against censorship then as I am today), the whole film made me sick (and, being the first few years 70, when I thought I saw everything in the movies of that era liberated, including Altman's full version of "That cold day in the park", a real dropper until it was cut for an "R" rating and we would have written The career of The End for Altman did not later have something called "M * A * S * H"), I still wonder if anyone but me had ever seen "Redneck" and was as shocked as I was. Trashing the actors and the cinema audience is a joy that the misfit filmmakers have enjoyed happily since the beginning of time. But exploiting a highly esteemed and talented child actor (Mr. Lester) with lepidation at a time when he was starting to make the difficult transaction from a child to an adult actor (and I am sure that his film offerings were therefore reduced to a meritric junk like "Redneck" ") ... Mr. Narizzano, you should lay your head out of shame. (Incidentally, I would soon be friends with actors who appeared in the future of Narizzano, indistinct efforts, both despised him.
