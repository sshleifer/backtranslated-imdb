This film is worse than Cat People, which I saw during the same week. It has all the 80s style. The MTV punk rockers, the real anti-social ones, not the commercial PC type of today, the brethren and a villain named Splater. I really like Splater, and the film makes that 80s blue light feel, but the rest looks like a cheap Canadian schlop. I saw so much of this while living in this great country, and I realized that this type of film was created because of tax breaks. Avoid at all costs.
