This film was terrible. The acting was lame, but it's hard to tell if someone was acting well since the writing was so bad. This is one of Johnny Depp's worst films - I strongly advise anyone to watch it. <br /> <br /> If you still need to see Cry-Baby, I recommend turning it off and watching Mr. Depp for an hour and a half.
