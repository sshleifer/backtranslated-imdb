** Could contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Ok, let's finish this movie in one word: bad. Two words? Really bad. Now why do I think so? Let me explain. <br /> <br /> Guttenberg leads a group of special operators composed of four people who are assigned to shoot a deadly virus after some arms traffickers steal it from a laboratory. They do this by attacking arms traffickers in mid-flight and somehow manage to recover the virus after some fighting. However, suspicions arise about Guttenberg because one of the terrorists knew his name. After debriefing, team members are attacked by unknown people and everyone begins to suspect that everyone else is involved. After deciding not to trust their leaders, they decide, once again, to steal the virus and try to attract potential attackers. In theory this is a storyline that could have worked with a small film budget that just wants to be broadcast on TV. However, the plot is compromised and the film has been ruined in several accounts. First, the plot is completely predictable and it's not fun to know how the film will end in three minutes. Second. The acting is really bad, or the actors are meant to behave like puppets. There are not many emotions, the change of facial expressions etc. I was particularly disappointed with Guttenberg that I believe he can do much more, but fails completely in his attempt to be a rough action hero. Furthermore, even though I am not at all an expert on the subject, I am absolutely convinced that I can train a better undercover team by collecting five strangers and training them for a week. This seems to be a theme in the film to make things as stupid and non-professional as possible. This also applies to good guys, villains and bystanders. So I sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultants, if any, of the film. For example, I poured liquid nitrogen on my hand and I didn't break up instantly. <br /> <br /> I don't know how to really conclude, but let's say that this film has a predictable plot, a bad acting and they seem to be amateurs in whatever they do. Sorry, it can't be nicer than that. Don't watch this movie, it's not even that bad it's funny. 2/10
