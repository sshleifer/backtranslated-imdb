So you're a giant mantis and you've been around in the Arctic for a while, and you're tired of the Eskimos hitting you with snowballs. What should a giant mutant insect do? Head to the big city, of course! See the sights, maybe catch a Broadway show. But wait! Just when you find a nice cozy tunnel to call yours, some annoying humans attack you !! Argh! It's time to destroy! <br /> <br /> However this film is a step forward in most of the other giant bug films, because it has decent effects for 1957. But that's all. Avoid unless you really need to see another big bug destroy things, or see another Perry Mason actor in a B. movie <br /> <br /> 4/10
