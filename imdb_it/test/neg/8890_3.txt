"The Quickie" tells of a decadent Russian mafia family living in Malibu and ... well, frankly, this terrible attempt at drama is not worthy of comment. <br /> <br /> Jason Leigh introduces himself to Mr. The street boy comes from "Pacific Exterminators" with huge letters in plain sight on his back playing "West Coast Exterminators". Eventually the criminals became suspicious because he was exterminating in a bedroom. (Duh). <br /> <br /> In another scene Mr. Mobguy plays Russian roulette giving a $ 4000 prostitute to bet on whether he will live or die. He has 5 out of 6 chances to keep the money if he bets "live". Well, she bets "die". (double du) Later he complains that he wasn't right and wants to play again. (Triple duh). <br /> <br /> The list of defects goes on ad infinitum as this offensive intelligence of the film stinks and sinks into a quagmire of disgusting music, mediocre photographic work, bad direction, boring story, etc. on this loser. (D) <br /> <br /> Note - The barebone DVD I rented had no English subtitles or English subtitles.
