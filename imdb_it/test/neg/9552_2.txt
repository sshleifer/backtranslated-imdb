I just saw him this morning on the Fox channel by accident (my dog ​​woke me up) - I saw him years ago and thought I remembered him pretty well. As a child, I enjoyed it. But now? As another poster commented, many of the reels were out of order, and while it was initially confusing, and bizarre, it seemed to fit the production - what was simply horrible became surreal and fun. The musical numbers for what I think was the "big" fundraising show ("you're in the entertainment world, I'm in the entertainment world, most kids are in the entertainment world, let's put on a show") come out of nowhere BEFORE all the speeches about the staging, and then vanish without applause to "direct" scenes that are completely extraneous. The protagonist's girl introduces herself, spits out lines and lines of dialogue, then disappears. I was half awake and loved every crazy minute.
