Boyle Heights, Los Angeles: the legendary South American goat vampire, El Chupacabra, is at liberty, feeding on anyone who has been unlucky to cross his path. Animal control officer Navarro (Eric Alegria) and Chupacabra expert / author Starlina Divide (Elina Madison) attempt to track down the creature, but find their progress hampered by a pair of stupid police, hungry for money eager to capture the beast for a fat reward and a couple of nefarious scientists who want the monster for their experiments. <br /> <br /> Smelly more than a two-week taco, El Chupacabra is an incredibly bad horror film that even incredibly bad horror movies fans might struggle to sit on. With his horrible screenplay, the terrible direction (not one, but two talented hacks, Brennon Jones and Paul Wynne), ridiculous dialogues, and some of the worst acting of this porn movie, I recommend this movie as much as I do by drinking the water of the tap in Mexico. <br /> <br /> As Navarro and Starlina proceed with their investigations, the spectators are treated with an incredibly weak gore, the worst jacket in the book designed in history, the least convincing person I saw from the alluring corpse in Dr. Butcher MD, and a high-tech computerized security system consisting of a keyboard nailed to a post. <br /> <br /> To be honest, for a guy in a rubber suit, the monster is rather scary (furry, with big claws, and a face like a particularly ugly bat), but his appearances are few and far between among them, with more time spent on the screen in the tedious trials and tribulations of the official Navarro human than on the murderous antics of the titular creature (how many times is it necessary to see Navarro carry on his bitchy paperwork?). <br /> <br /> If, like me, you make the mistake of wasting your hard-earned money on this terrible Latin bilge (in my case, it was a whole 50p), consider using the disk as a coaster for your tequila rather than actually looking at it.
