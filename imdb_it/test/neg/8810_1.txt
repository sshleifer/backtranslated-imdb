Danny Glover and Carey Elwes have obviously forgotten how to behave when they made this film, the acting is absolutely atrocious. The pay-off is even worse. I'm sorry for Danny Glover, I hope he was well paid for it because it makes him seem completely silly, the same goes for Mr. Elwes. An absolute slap in the face of any fan of the horror movie. Despicable. This is probably the worst acting performance of veteran actors I've ever seen. I wonder if they took the time to look at the script, or if they did it must have said "forget everything you know about acting" because that makes them ridiculous. For the two experienced veterans who act in this way is scary, I hope the payroll control was very broad, I thought, at first, it was a parody. If you can find satisfaction in this film, then more power to you.
