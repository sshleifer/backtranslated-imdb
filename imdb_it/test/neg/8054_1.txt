Terrible is really all you need to know. First of all, think of all the things that could go wrong for a film. And then try making a film that is bad in all these ways. You will have created "Vacationland". The state of Maine should feel insulted: it is a place too beautiful to be the backdrop for such a banal, senseless and boring skeleton. I am a romantic, and I always want to film about two people who are each other to succeed, and I have tried to find the good in this. It was hard; very difficult. I couldn't find a glimmer of emotional connection between any of the characters in this monotonous monotony exercise. Except maybe in one or two of the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Maine is a good vacation area; this film is not.
