Move to Manos. Back Boogens. It doesn't take a Baby Genius to know that Malibu Beach Vampires (MBV for the rest of this tome) is now and will always (unless someone follows Zarkorr The Invader) the worst movie ever. The only horror in this is to watch it. I wonder if this was an attempt for someone to meet girls making a movie. If this were the case, girls are not girls just like this is not a movie. It's crazy. Do not wait. Dishonor the word dreck by calling it dreck. Ulli Lommel (of Boogey Man's fame) would call it "uber dreck" or Schei√üe. It should be used to torture prisoners. If you find it on a shelf in a video store, go back to it in silence and notify the authorities.
