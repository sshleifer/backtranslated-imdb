After their cross country racer died after a race, the members of an athletic team are persecuted and killed by a mysterious masked assassin seeking revenge for the girl's death. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of this film, it was pretty obvious that it wouldn't have been very good (at least for the real quality). The "dramatic" track race at the end of the introductory scene was one of the least credible sporting events I've ever seen in a movie. It would seem that the winner of the race has never raced before in his entire life. Not just track. . . but, rush to all. Never. From there, we get a horribly unrealistic female Navy member who was breaking numerous rules of appearance with her jewels and tricks, not to mention that her hair was loose on the collar while she was in uniform. Ridiculously embarrassing camera angles, pathetically concluded guretic effects, and acting that ranged from frighteningly exaggerated to boring in fact (all in an actor, mind you) all contribute to making this film one of the most unwittingly entertaining horror movies ever made. On the other hand, writing was not so terrible and the story was fine. But the direction was horrible, aggravated by bad offensive cinematography. Acting ranged from acceptable to simple abyssal. Regardless of all the embarrassing elements, however, there is something here, whether it's cheese or something else that I can't understand, which makes the film extremely enjoyable and worthy of a watch. Maybe it was just Vanna White. <br /> <br /> Mandatory slasher elements: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: The death scenes were quite funny, but the blood was just horrible: the blood spurts from impossible angles, no wounds or knife wounds, etc. But this film has the first "death for football" scene I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: there was a bit of nudity (I mean, there is Linnea Quigley, after all), and some high school students too excited, but nothing excessive. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer: If you think that leather gloves, watch clocks, follow suits and fencing masks are fantastic, this is for you. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: Not really any. There is a moment that takes place in the girls' locker room that I was preparing to be scared of. . . but, it only led to a typical stupidity and was ruined for me. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: A little bit, but if you can't understand the identity of the killer about 20 minutes in the movie, then I'm not too sure of your deduction powers. <br /> <br /> - Awkward Dance Scene: there is a big improvised jam session ("Graduation Day Blues") with a guitar and a harmonica that leads to some wonderful 80s. This is followed shortly by a sort of strange mix of 70s disco and 80s break dance that was probably the scariest part of the film. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 4/10. Don't take it too seriously and you might enjoy it (just like most of the other things Troma touches). <br /> <br /> -AP3-
