This film lacks everything. Except for Bobby deol, who is mediocre in his own standards, no one in this film came close to acting in a single scene. Kangana is completely false in his acting. <br /> <br /> The great Anupam Kher looks like a guest and is better in those 2 minutes than in the whole movie. The music does not compliment the movie <br /> so well. The contrast in Music between Bobby and Upen is not highlighted well. Great concept completely wrong. The film has no suitable ending. Please don't waste your time like I did in this movie
