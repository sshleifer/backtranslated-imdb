Well, this was a complete waste of celluloid. The preview was promising, but after watching the movie, it looked like the preview was * the entire movie. No plot, no clear texture, just some suspense out of place. It seems that the director has tried very hard to create an atmosphere of mystery and fear, but there are still gaps to be filled. Why drugs? Why the number 11.11? (As Sarah enters the library, the clock says 11.14) What is the connection with the murder on the parents? What is the role of this Rayden woman? Are you one of the children or not? Who are those children anyway. There is a lot of material around to create the definitive cult film like "the Omen", but the director simply leaves them lying on the floor without digging into the story. Even "the Blairwitch project" was scarier than this. All the gaps that you hope to fill up as in "The butterfly effect" remain open as the credits begin to roll .. OK. Go to the next movie ...
