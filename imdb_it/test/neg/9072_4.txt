Ed (Kel Mitchell) is a teenager who lives for his job at Good Burger, a small but friendly neighborhood burger, while his friend Dexter (Kennan Thompson) works there too, but lacks his devotion to his work is there because he accidentally destroyed his teacher's car Mr. Wheat (Sinbad) and has to raise money to pay for the damage. When Mondo Burger, a giant fast-foot chain, opens up across the street, it looks like Good Burger is history, until Ed makes a secret sauce that brings hundreds of new customers to their door. However, the monomaniacal manager of Mondo Burger, Kurt (Jan Schweiterman), is determined to get his hands on the sauce and put Good Burger out of business. Meanwhile, Ed and Dexter have to save Otis (Abe Vigoda), the oldest fast food employee in the world, from the Demented Hills Asylum, and Ed could only find love with Monique (Shar Jackson) if he could take his head off the burgers long enough to pay attention to her Good Burger is a children's comedy, a decent story, acting and, in general, a fairly harmless children's film.
