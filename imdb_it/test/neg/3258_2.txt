Caddyshack II is one of those photos that makes you ask "Why?" As in; "Why was it funded?": "Why was it created?" and 'Why was it released into the public domain?' <br /> <br /> To say the least, it's a bad movie. It serves no purpose except to underline how much his prequel was superior by setting a group of almost identical characters against each other in a plot similar to that of a "New money" land developer trying to buy the camp sanctuary golf course of the establishment. <br /> <br /> From the outset, doing the follow-up for 8 years after the original is quite bizarre. I mean, if you're about to cash in on a very successful image like the first, then you have a window of a few years to do it. But leaving it for 8 years means that the formula is not fresh enough to simply follow up, or a poor imitation like this, so your kind of obligation to reward fans of the original by giving them at least a reference to whether or not they actually made contributions effective by the actors who made the first one so memorable. But there is little or nothing of this. <br /> <br /> Instead we get economic imitations. Okay the disappearance of Ted Knight in the interim years would have made it impossible to bring back the memorable Judge Smails but the inclusion of Robert Stack as "Chandler Young" (a WASP elitist similar to the Smails character) is unimaginative and seriously lacking in kind of anarchist frustration that made Knight's turn so watchable. Jack Hartounian by Jackie Mason is a weak attempt to recreate the jokes spoken by the character of Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) of the first. While the role of Dangerfield was infinitely quotable, Mason's is completely forgettable. <br /> <br /> Bill Murray's ludicrous gardener "Carl Spackler" and his war of attrition with the annoying local gofer were replaced by the role of the militant "Capt" of Ghostbuster co-star Dan Ackroyd. Tom Everett ', who has a high-pitched voice, shares your sides with frustration in contrast to the expected laughter. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid, brilliant as Cousin Ed in the National Lampoon's Vacation series, is exactly the opposite here playing Hartaunian's unstable lawyer. The looks of disbelief shown by the actor who is watching the character of Quaid, understood as hilarious acts of inappropriate violence, echo those of the public. You're not laughing. You're just asking, 'What the hell is he doing?' <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase shows up, all occasionally and wisely rather fleetingly considering the disaster that is going on around him, like the pro club 'Tye Webb' in the movies have only a direct reference to the original, without resisting the golf course itself. With his deeply tanned skin and strong Hawaiian shirts, it seems that Chase has just returned from a long summer vacation and needs a salary. He moves away from events in the real picture enough to take little of the blame and leaves with someone, all in all small, still intact credibility. <br /> <br /> Jessica Lundy as Mason's daughter, Kate, takes the role of Danny Noonan of the original as a teenager fighting class divisions. Seems ridiculous, right? At least in the first Danny (an Irish Catholic belonging to a blue-collar family) and in his laughable attempts to penetrate the world dominated by the whites and Anglo-Saxons and Protestants of the golf club mover and shakers, they performed some memorable sets dismissed by the resident Lutheran bishop, as well as being derided by the lineage of the local yacht club. Lundy's embarrassment about his father's inability to adapt is hinted at being because of his Jewish roots. Apart from that, he could also have to deal with him as a classless moron, but such intricacy is set aside even though I stopped worrying long before they were solved. At the end of the day Noonan was trying to move on in life. Miss Hartounian's biggest problem is to convince the noblemen of the local golf club to please her multimillionaire father so she can have a date with the club's prodigal white boy. Or so I gathered. <br /> <br /> However, in summary it is poorly written, badly scripted with fragments of lame and wastes a lot of talent. Indeed, congratulations if you were able to sit up to its conclusion. It really is a penance. However, there is a question mark as to why many original actors have not returned, rather than being replaced by artists who on paper seemed at least their peers. Maybe they weren't just asked. Or maybe I suspect they actually read the script. Keep to the original !!!
