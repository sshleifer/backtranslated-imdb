This film is very similar to all other modern horror films. It is predictable in the way it accumulates and progresses and never manages to bring anything original or shocking to the screen. This is really the biggest disappointment of the film, which overall still had a promising main concept for a film of its kind. <br /> <br /> You can call this film a cliché of the great modern horror film. It has all the elements in it that make modern horror films often not so great to look at. One of these aspects is a plaintive and very naive boy. Why do they keep putting this kind of thing in the movies? The same applies to the type of aspects of the drama, which involves the family. It simply doesn't work for the film and is anything but interesting or effective. Often, instead, it makes the film drag the parts and becomes boring to watch. <br /> <br /> So it has all the clichés present but it fails to bring any of these clichés to the screen. As a horror movie this is simply a poor one. He does not handle his horror or his tension very well. For fans of the genre there is very little to enjoy. The film its story is not too well connected and accumulates within the film. Too often the film sleeps in parts and never allows its horror to do its best. <br /> <br /> The film is often too obscure (no doubt as an attempt to hide its rather low budget) and also shows a bit of gore, mainly due to the fact that you simply can't always see things like that well. <br /> <br /> You can only say by watching this film that the director JS Cardone does not have much talent for the genre and does not know how to correctly manage its present ingredients. He made some attempts in the past but all his films have failed so far. unfortunately continues to try. Who knows, maybe with the right people behind the camera (like Tobe Hooper, who was initially attached to the director), this film could still have been something decent. <br /> <br /> It is a poorly cast film, with mostly large unknowns inside. The most important name of the film is Ben Cross, but his role is too small and, in a sense, not relevant enough for the film and its history. He didn't even seem to have much fun playing. <br /> <br /> Jump. <br /> <br /> 4/10
