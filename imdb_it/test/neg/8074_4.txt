The film was a pleasure to see if you are a Stooges fan. The story is told from the point of view of Moe Howard and his relationships with his brothers Shemp and Jerome (Ricci) Howard, also the long friendship with Larry Fine. The film deals mainly with the high points of photography and the falls of Stooges' multi-decade career. The casting director and makeup artist did a good job of finding actors who looked like the famous ensemble. The actor who plays "Curly" Howard did a great job portraying the antics of the camera of the most beloved Stooge. A must see for fans of Three Stooges shorts.
