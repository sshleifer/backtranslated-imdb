It really surprised me to see that it would take so long for someone to evaluate such a bad movie. The beginning (of the film) had some truth. The "AF" partisan was started in 1943 when two Croat Ustashi AF communist pilots left, along with their observers, respectively in Breguet 19 and Potez 33. The plane saw some actions in the bombing and hand bombardment, but it is not lasted very long. One crew member was killed and the other survived, the pilot was killed later while flying with a Spitfire Vc. The real partisan squadrons were founded when the RAF broke off two of its (Yugoslav) squads of Spitfire Vc and, Hurricane IIc, respectively, with crews of pilots of the royal and former Yugoslav aviation and assigned them to the forces of Tito on the island of Vis. Even those were never engaged in air-to-air activities, but strictly for ground support. So the film was a gigantic cow manure, to put it mildly, and the lowest point for his director, otherwise not bad at all. For some strange fate I was present at the shooting of the last sequence of the film, when dozens of German planes were destroyed (trainers of the Yugoslav 522, also used in flight sequences) on the military airport of Mostar. The fireworks were impressive, and the Scotch served generously by the film crew was even better. Otherwise, the film was a shameless lie and was often joked by contemporary audiences.
