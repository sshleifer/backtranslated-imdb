Simply terrible. I'm including a spoiler warning here just to include a joke about the movie - there's nothing else to ruin, since it's already rotten. This slag was made during what must have been one of Sellers's "For A Few Dollars More" periods, when he would have participated in some shit for a few dollars. I had seen him as a 15-year high school student in 1972, and I hated him then. No need to see it again; after 35 years I now remember him as one of the first five worst films I ever saw as a child. As far as I can remember, the sellers had a current cameo role rather than a guide, but even his presence could not improve stale jokes, unpleasant plot and childish responses. An ongoing theme revolves around the use of Sellers' fingers: in one scene, he holds his hand open to a group of drugs and, lowering his fingers, enumerates the groups for which there is a hospital: interns, nurses, administrators, etc. - until only the middle finger is left, after which it says "... and the patients!" Har Har. In another scene, to avoid costly laboratory tests, he dips a finger into a urine sample and sticks it in his mouth to check for sugar, then urges the interns gathered around him to do the same, which they do. He then informs them that he put his middle finger in the urine, but he sucked the index finger and warned them to pay attention. Hee hee. (The only reason I remember this, and this film, and I'm writing this review, is that a friend told me an even more puzzling version of this 'joke' today). If you do, you'll like it. Otherwise, see 'Hospital', with George C. Scott (released the same year, 1972) for a genuine, wonderful black medical humor. Better yet, read 'The House of God', by Samuel Shem, and if you can, watch his film version, which has never been published (please, make a copy and send it to me - I'd like to finally see it).
