Cartoon-like special effects, acting and horrible dialogues and dry plot! This movie has it all! My friend and I went to a blockbuster to find a horrible movie that we could make fun of, but this was just too much. The film begins with a woman and her son on vacation on an island prepared in the Bahama region. Women, who happen to be a doctor / virologist, find themselves in the area when a man collapses. He has a strange wound on his arm and she immediately knows that it is a contagious virus. The story continues to show an incredibly fast love story between the two teenage protagonists (this is justified by the girl who says "I know it's fast, but it's beautiful." ????) In any case the whole island is infected from this virus and the CDC is introduced. We are told that within three months, if the virus is not treated and contained, it will spread to the United States and kill millions of people. This information does not prevent the CDC from leaving the island to save itself. Fortunately, the cure for this horrible virus is just in time, and the whole island is saved. To celebrate the death of their loved ones, the people of the island have a fabulous party where everyone dances, enjoys and forgets about the horrible epidemic that has just occurred.
