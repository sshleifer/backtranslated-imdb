it's hard to make a negative statement here after all this delirium about how great the action poll, how wonderful the actors have been and so on and so on. I didn't like the movie. it's lousy! <br /> <br /> there are orgies, they have taboo sex (gay sex, bi sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother-sister-sex, brother-brother-sex, sex on drugs, sex without drugs, sex, sex, sex seems to dominate their world, I guess the director desperately needs to fuck.) The story is dirty and shameful. I wonder what made those people up with this story. and above all: who cares? <br /> <br /> technical things did not satisfy me. the sound is poor, so the editing and the "direction" are absent. the actors are certainly good, but guess what! it's their job! their job is to act! no need to jump out of places if an actor has done a decent job. applause when a bus driver takes you home safe and sound? you see? <br /> <br /> I gave it 2/10 because after all this thing had something I couldn't say in words. b charm of the movie? camping fun? nudity? I do not know.
