My girlfriend and I are really into cheese horror movies. Especially those with a lot of unnecessary nakedness. When we saw the box set for this movie at the blockbuster we thought it would be a perfect movie for the evening. We started watching it, we didn't already expect it to be BIG, but I thought it would at least capture our interest. At 20 minutes from the film we realized that the rhythm would not be up to par and that it was an incredibly boring film. We tried to get in, but the plot made very little sense even after reading and rereading the back of the DVD. The film was shot very dark and it was quite annoying trying to figure out what was going on in every shot. Every violent scene was very difficult to understand and one can never really see the violence one is expecting. This is definitely a movie for no reason that was shot badly and very pulled out. Every scene was about 20 minutes of the same thing and I felt I understood the point after the first 5. Skip this movie and review another Freddy or Jason movie and you'll be much happier.
