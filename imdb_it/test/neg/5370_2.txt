This show, Paranormal State, looks almost like "Blairwitch Project". As in, you're watching a "documentary" that is actually just a scripted movie, made to look and feel like a documentary. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the show is their "going to" Warren external consultants, who were made famous for their "investigations" into the Amityville murders, which proved to be completely fraudulent, based only on police reports of family deaths! (such as the eldest daughter who was actually involved in the whole affair, to the point where she could even help with some of the deaths!) Then there's the way they constantly jump to blame the demons for everything. Not to mention how proud the group is about the cases they take. They don't want to help those who need it most, they just want the most bizarre cases, which will have most of the press and attention. <br /> <br /> They are complete, simple and simple frauds.
