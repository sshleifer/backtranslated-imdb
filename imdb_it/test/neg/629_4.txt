I've seen Cédric Klapisch's previous films, so I was expecting a quality film with psychological depth. Being an Erasmus student myself and having visited several friends who study abroad, I know very well what it means to spend some time abroad and mix different cultures at the same time. Yes, it's very funny! For this reason I thought I would not miss this movie. Unfortunately I was disappointed to find that L'Auberge Espagnol fails to satisfy in many ways: the characters are stereotyped, the events are trivial and the story is superficial. Although there are some family situations, they are an irritating cliché and do not go beyond trivial events. This made the film uninteresting to watch and gave me a strong "state-of-what-you-don't-have-to-add-anything?" sensation. Apart from that, the film lacks a firm story. Sometimes it seems more like a documentary show or "real life" than a seriously made film. <br /> <br /> However, I can imagine that if you haven't studied or traveled abroad, it might be fun to watch it.
