*** SPOILERS! *** Sometimes I wonder what makes sequel producers think that they have to explain (and therefore destroy) the mysteries behind the iconic horror films. The original 1987 "Hellraiser" was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made. The 1988 sequel "Hellbound" was also a fantastic horror film, although I personally didn't like how the viewer had basic information about the Cenobites, some of the most fearsome villains of all time in the original. The third part, "Hell on Earth" (1992) was already a mess, whose producers obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to Pinhead lead-cenobite, previously incomparably terrifying (a typical stupidity of the 90s) and therefore destroyed most of his fear. This fourth part "Hellraiser: Bloodline" (1996) is slightly more atmospheric than the third, but lowers this quality by inventing even more foolish and completely useless "basic information" on cenobites and the opening of the gates of hell. <br /> <br /> Seriously - do we need to know how the mysterious boxes of the puzzle that open the doors to hell are made? I think not, and this is not the only mystery about cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film. The "Bloodline" setting goes back and forth in three different periods. The film begins at a space station in the 22nd century, when scientist Dr. Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) attempts to close the gates of hell forever. When government soldiers stop his mission, he must explain his reasons. In the eighteenth century in Paris, the ancestor of the Merchant was a toy manufacturer charged with building a puzzle from an aristocrat obsessed with the occult. An evoked demon, the princess of hell, took over the body of the beautiful Angelique (Valentina Vargas). Since the only person capable of destroying the door of hell is the one who built it, the machinist's bloodline would have been cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites over the centuries ... The film, which takes place in the eighteenth century, present, and the 22nd century, it really is a mess. I admit that the part set in the 18th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film, but it's also its smallest part. The parts set in the present and the future are rather weak and full of stupid and unworthy elements. The strengths of the film are undoubtedly the make-up and special effects, the very valiant Valentina Varagas as the demoness, and Pinhead (Doug Bradley), who despite having lost part of his anxiety, is still a rogue threat. It is an almost offensive idea for "Hellraiser" fans, however, that Pinhead should be defeated by a ridiculous light show. Overall, "Bloodline" is not a complete disaster, but it is definitely an unworthy sequel to a series that started so brilliantly. Even the director Kevin Yagher was obviously embarrassed about it, as he preferred to be credited as Alan Smithee. Overall, this is recommendable only to hardcore Pinhead fanatics, and most of them will probably get angry with another decrease in the creepiness of their favorite demon. All others are invited to follow the brilliant first and excellent second part of the "Hellraiser" series and skip all the others. The effects of makeup in "Bloodline" are disturbing, but almost everything else is disappointing. My vote: 3.5 / 10
