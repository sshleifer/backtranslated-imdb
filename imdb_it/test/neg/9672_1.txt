Just when I thought that nothing could be offensive and / or irritating like a Billy Mays commercial, I had the intellectually shocking experience of renting this piece of junk. Peter Barnes and John Irvin should be accused of criminal charges for introducing this script into the public place. Actors must be accused as accomplices, serving no less than a life away from the public eye. <br /> <br /> This production offers the disclaimer, "By dramatic effect, we have taken a poetic license with certain facts", or a statement so inadequate to fully encourage you to repel a biblical story that did not need added drama. What they added was enough to make your I.Q. releases three full points for every five minutes of display. <br /> <br /> The "poetic license" taken, invents such bizarre characters, you will recognize nothing but the names of a few and, of course, the ark. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Noah and Lot both live in Sodoma, so maybe Abraham was on vacation in Switzerland for a ski trip. Lot's wife, played by Carol Kane, is a harpy, and when she turns to a column of salt, Lot breaks a finger and carries it around in what appears to be an empty baby food jar. If this is "poetic", I am a kumquat. <br /> <br /> When Noah - who has now started drinking wine in quantities that could help float the ark - whines for the hard work of the construction project, he wakes up one morning to find out that God has delivered enough pre-packaged timber to lighten its burden. At least I think it was God. It looked like an 84 Lumber delivery, neatly stacked and packaged. Maybe 84 Lumber is really an agent for God ????? Rather than bore you with the load being loaded, I will avenge you with the pirate attack account on the ark. Incongruous, do you think? This film is full of senseless nonsense. After an incalculable time on the waters, Noah discovers a pirate ship heading towards them. And who could be the salty sea captain? Well, duh, it's Lot, of course! My only surprise was that his uncle Abram was not on board. If you're about to slaughter a plot, kill everything. The attempt at piracy is unsuccessful and the bravado was pathetic, not poetic. I think it was around this brand that my nausea prevented me from punishing myself. <br /> <br /> A nasty, senseless, absurd distortion of anything resembling a biblical account. On a scale of 1 to 10, this film is a premeditated mental abuse. Stupid and insulting, you'll be more amused by reading the Yellow Pages.
