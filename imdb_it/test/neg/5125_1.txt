I'm a dance teacher and I couldn't wait to do some good dance routines in this film. How sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I had big problems with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alex extremely repellent. Beals face is so young, sweet and innocent, and this is very inconsistent with Alex's disquieting darkness, especially in that lousy restaurant scene. He also has the tantrums of a small child. It is very difficult to believe that Nick would continue to return to such a moody teenager after his frequent rantings and ravings, especially after opening the door of a moving car and pulling a stiletto at him, rather opting to go home - in the middle of the road - with only one shoe !!! And what to say after his idiotic behavior after the night at the ballet. In fact, the whole love story was very disturbing: the 30 year old man of a certain age chasing a girl who looks like about 16. Yuck. <br /> <br /> As for the dance, I'm afraid this 80s style is totally dated. What the hell was that dance sequence on TV in the club? Who was supposed to dance? I wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in drag! And even that famous ending sequence is rather disappointing, especially considering the context of an audition for a ballet company. The camera shots of his jump actually ruin his effect because you can't see what he's doing. And what the hell was he doing when he passed each of the panels on them? And as many other comments have pointed out, you would NEVER enter a ballet company on the strength of that audition - maybe that's why they don't actually tell in the end if it was successful or not, the closure is the fact that you have overcome his fear in the end. Of the "Flashdancers", I actually thought the best sequence belonged to Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You could see that she was a real dancer and her stunts were really impressive. This is obviously if you can overcome his scary costume and make-up. <br /> <br /> In this film there were two beautiful pieces: the dancers that get longer when Alex goes for an audition for the first time: they are so beautiful and classy, ​​and at least this helps to underline the difference between his current career as a dancer and the one he aspires to. The other good scene was the pause for dancing in the street. I also liked the parents of ice skaters, they were fun. <br /> <br /> Some other random points: who was Hanna and how did she meet Alex? What was an eighteen-year-old who lived alone in a converted warehouse? How could he afford that beautiful bar and all the furniture? Where was his family? Was that scene in the "naked" club really necessary? The person who wrote in his comment that it was something like a Disney movie needs to be examined. And anyway, what happened to the skater? <br /> <br /> Many people said that the film was poor, but they liked the message: don't give up hope, keep trying, and your dreams will come true. Look instead at "The Little Mermaid".
