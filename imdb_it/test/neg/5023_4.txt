To be completely frank, the popularity of this show saddens me. Inuyasha is certainly not terrible - he has some beautiful moments, the occasional flash of intelligent humor and, unlike so many souls, dignity. However, it is completely devoid of essential elements of a useful story. From the beginning, his premise seems to be stereotyped. The main plot is focused on collecting pieces of a broken jewel before they can be possessed by evil, and it is, as one might suspect, a totally generic epic fantasy affair. The story follows a familiar pattern of fighting various enemies for pieces of jewelery, and is therefore quite predictable, lacking in complexity and easy to lose interest. But as many souls have shown, a poor premise can be saved by realistic characters. Unfortunately, nobody saves Inuyasha's story. Kagome, the main character, is the heroine of stereotyped souls (and remembers too much Akane, the main character of the previous work of the comic author Ranma 1/2); he is kind to other females, but treats many males, in particular his love interest, with unjust, unperturbed, unjustifiable brutality. Inuyasha is a tough-on-the-outside-but-sweet-on-the-inside guy, and Miroku is the deplorable "pervert" character. <br /> <br /> Defects continue with what happens to this plot and these characters - that is, nothing. Despite the constant action, the story does not progress. Despite the normal romantic moments, not even the main relationship. Despite all the time, the characters never really change. And to add a cherry to the cup of mediocrity, all this stagnation is extended into about 150 episodes. <br /> <br /> My final criticism of this anime is animation. Although certainly not ugly, it shows an almost disrespectful laziness on the part of the creators. The animators seem to have fun in the long scenes of Inuyasha jumping in the air with the whistling wind in which they have little to do but move a background. <br /> <br /> In short, with all the beautiful animations of the world at the fingertips of a keyboard perched on the keyboard, there is absolutely no reason to watch Inuyasha.
