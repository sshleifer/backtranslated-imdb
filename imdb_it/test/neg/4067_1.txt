My suggestion ..... This movie really wanted to be a "comedy", didn't it? !!!! If not, the producers, directors, actors and hair stylists should really choose another career! Now, the guidelines of my request require a minimum of "10 lines". How can I add more to the world? Hmm ... Let me see. Oh yes, the beginning of the film was pretty funny with the crash landing scene. Too bad the plane didn't hit the tanker truck and a group of "Martians" would have moved away from the wreck (obviously hidden) and decided to conquer the "world" planet and make a better film. Now, it would have been a great start! <br /> <br /> T
