I can't believe some of the comments here in the reviews. The film is dated and, from our comfortable point of view in the era of the CGG, many of the special effects are not very convincing. But even taking this into account, Helen of Troy is so bad that she is almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Scripting is horrible, simply horrible, without any characterization. Performances suffer, you can see characters like Hardwicke and Andrews writhing in awkward anguish as they carry the most ridiculous and ridiculous lines of shitty shit. The writers seem to feel the need to explain almost everything in a terrible educational script that allows the viewer to decide nothing for himself. The beginning of the film describes the historical background as if no one had ever heard of ancient Greece; I know they had the American public to consider, but the patronizing way we are told twice to make sure we understand that the action is really terrible. <br /> <br /> I honestly can't believe the comments above that describe this film as a great epic movie. Even taking into account the relatively primitive cinematography and the relative refinement of today's audience, this film really stinks.
