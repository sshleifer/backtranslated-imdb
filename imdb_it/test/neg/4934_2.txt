I had trouble sitting here. Every single turning point is predictable. You're just sitting there waiting for him ... waiting for him ... and yes, here he is! Just like you expected at the beginning of the film. Or 10 minutes out. Et cetera. <br /> <br /> Smart writing? No. <br /> <br /> Porn torture? No, there is no nakedness. Other reviews they call this tortured porn are most likely written by people who use hard drugs. Unfortunately there is no torture and nudity (yes, no nudity). <br /> <br /> There is no suspense in this "thriller". The only positive part of this film is the ending, but I'm not going to ruin it. <br /> <br /> I'm giving him a 2/10. A 1/10 would be a horrible B-movie. This film has played better.
