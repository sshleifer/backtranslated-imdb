Due to the rather questionable plate tectonics, Japan begins to slide under the sea. Initial forecasts say it will take about 40 years before the country is submerged, but a rogue scientist adds an even more dubious science and determines that it will actually take less than 1 year! The government thinks it's disgusting, but the evidence soon starts to bring out its theory. <br /> <br /> This large-scale catastrophic film follows the formula set by any number of Hollywood films of the late 1990s (I presume, not having seen any of them), with the scale of disaster and tragedy that brings out the nobility of the human spirit (good, Japanese) in acts of heroism and sacrifice, and demonstrating the power of love or something like that. that is, it is naive in its psychology as in geology ... we all know that half of the population would have been raped and looted at the very moment when they thought the police had turned their backs, and the other half would simply panic useless. /> <br /> The film has some very nice special effects, but it's not as smooth or expensive as an equivalent Hollywood production. It is at least nationalist, devoid of sense of humor and lacking in self-awareness, as the Hollywood movie would be anyway, and probably even has worse acting. It has the evil chick of Battle Royale as one of the protagonists ... but it's not even slightly evil, and is therefore much less hot. <br /> <br /> The film is too long at 132 minutes, and it gets worse as it progresses towards a conclusion that put me in danger of vomiting. I certainly didn't care if Japan sank or not halfway, and well before the end I was trying to think of ways to speed up the process if I ever found myself in that situation for real. > <br /> But it has some nice special effects, and Kou Shibasaki is still pretty hot, so I take it magnanimously ... 3/10.
