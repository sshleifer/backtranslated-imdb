I don't understand why so many comments here seem to indicate that this is acceptable entertainment. The astonishing horror of this cinematic monstrosity cannot be overstated. My girlfriend and I watched it together, and I'm not sure we'll ever be able to have sex again. I'm not sure what was worse, the gaunt, unattractive cast, the supremely unicotogenic genitals, the rancid attempts at humor, the shrill noises that claimed to be songs ... <br /> <br /> No, I know what it was the worst of all The girls in green tights, with a green face, who licks Alice to dry her, then propose, with a childish and broken speech, that they suck the milk from her breast. That was the worst. <br /> <br /> Also, what was it with the nurses, and why do they seem to have so many problems finding each other's vaginas? Why are all male actors gay? Why does Humpty Dumpty dildo in the air and pretend it's his penis? Why did my eyes have to see this? There are no words.
