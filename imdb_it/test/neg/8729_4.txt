"The Apartment Complex" is a campy comedy full of kookie characters created in place of a real story that tells a young psychology student (Lowe) that he takes a job managing an apartment complex and finds himself involved in a murder ... um, if you can call it that This low-cal watch contains no suspense, no thrill, no drama, no action, precious few funny moments, a hint of nudity and almost no love story. "The Apartment Complex" is negligible junk food, forgettable only for the most needy sleeping pills.
