***** SPOILERS ********* <br /> <br /> This movie was really horrible. This woman deceives her employers from the beginning and then proceeds selfishly to separate them. Eventually you see her make a profession out of the trade that she had learned from the father of her "pupil". I put the pupils in quotation marks because the housekeeper never really seems to teach the child something. He seems to hate her and can't bear to be near her. I was sorry for the girl who simply wanted to be loved, absent, it was understandable that she said and made things outrage only to attract attention but the viewer should not have sympathized with the child, the viewer was supposed to sympathize with the housekeeper he hated his pupil and manipulated and deceived his employers. I couldn't do it. This was not the story of a self-taught woman, indeed, it was a window into the minds of those who use others on every occasion without any other thought for anyone outside of their own family. I couldn't stand the governess! This was a really horrible movie. I only paid a dollar to rent it but that was too much!
