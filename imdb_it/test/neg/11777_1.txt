I looked at this piece ONDEMAND because the description was quite extravagant. This movie smells like cocaine, the opening scene alone must cost at least five digits in a movie. This is a piece of racist and homophobic junk that trudges for a good 1 hour and 22 minutes without any direction. I'm a little confused about how this has good reviews here. I won't bother to tell you the plot because, as far as I know, there is no plot. I'm pretty sure everybody has performed every day on the set with giant lines, dressed Loretta Switt with deep necklines to show as much as possible breastfeeding and screaming action; leaving the cast to improvise in a cocaine frenzy. Just like real beer, this movie almost made my liver fail halfway. Save your money and watch "Strange Brew" instead.
