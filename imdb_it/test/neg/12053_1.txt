Yes, I bought the blood of the camp and I lost about 86 minutes of my life and 5 kilos of my money in this shit, I mean, I didn't expect a fantastic movie, judging from the cover I didn't expect anything exceptional, but At least not the tits in the first 3 seconds (I don't moan about the tits ..) Am I complaining about what the hell has to do with something? this movie should have been hand held at home as a joke .... they suck ... why was the blood more brown and turd like that real blood? ... I tell you cheaply that I mean they weren't all yellow, and another thing that made me die laughing at this sad excuse for a movie was the fact that they were trying to pretend the clown was a woman all the time, though he was clearly a short-haired, flat-chested black man. no one noticed that the only special effect in this film was a slow down of the jump ... which was also poor oh and the fading effect that you can find on many basic pc programs like ... powerpoint .... this film shots
