"Undercurrent" presents a cast of very first wonderful actors that could have been assembled for the perfect living room comedy. Alas, they are practically wasted on a potboiler of a "woman's view" - and for a paper-thin one. Katharine Hepburn is truly radiant as a tomboy / old maid who finally gets married, but her husband is deeply upset and has dark family secrets. The director Vincente Minnelli has absolutely no idea how to put together this extravagant plot, invented by Edward Chodorov from a story by Thelma Strabel, and the friendly and first-rate cast (including Robert Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Edmund Gwenn) was left behind trample in murky waters. ** from ****
