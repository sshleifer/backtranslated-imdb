This is a poor attempt to run the old "cons turn good" yarn, which we have seen so many times in the past. In fact it reminded me of the American series "The Players", although it never went so well. Omar Epps is totally unconvincing as the tough guy in the group, as is Ribisi, whose attempt to be the funny guy gets lost along the way. Danes' performance was decent, and you can see from this performance, because it was chosen in Terminator 4. <br /> <br /> The MOD Squad is a film that is in a kind of gray area between the serious thriller and comedy. Sometimes it gets serious but sometimes it tries to be funny but fails miserably. The film has an almost finished feeling - as if it were stretched up to 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> You will be disappointed.
