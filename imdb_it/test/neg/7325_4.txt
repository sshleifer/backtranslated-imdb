I tried to love this movie. I really did it. Kevin Bacon plays a victim of cerebral palsy who became friends with a 10-year-old girl, whose fantasies of digging in China, flying away in a balloon, and so on, are his way of dealing with a sad existence. I admit I took a step forward in one of the scenes where the two share the friendship and simple pleasures, while the soul piano music plays in the background. Okay, three or four of those type scenes. Maybe nine or ten. Ok, ok, they were fourteen. But I sat and watched most of them.
