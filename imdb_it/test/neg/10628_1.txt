Regarding the film itself, there are ample comments. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say something about the German version, which I saw recently on TV. It is strongly cut. From 103 to 76 minutes! It is normal for the bloodiest scenes to be cut for German TV. I understand the reasons for this, but this film was something else. They have not only cut "bloodshed" - they have cut entire sequences, saving only glimmers. Like: "We must attack THEM" - a 5-second shot of explosions in the field - the protagonist who flees. <br /> <br /> When the assault on the island begins, it is no longer even possible to follow the plot. All the cuts create something that is equivalent to a series of irregular and disconnected scenes that no longer make sense. <br /> <br /> I could not bear to watch the end after spending 60 minutes at this nonsense. /> <br /> I think I would have given the original 7/10 The German version is worth only 1/10 <br /> <br /> Download it on DVD (and check the runtime first) or forget it.
