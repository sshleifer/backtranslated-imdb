Humanité is a mystery of murder. These films tend to be popular, <br /> <br /> and the 6.9 score they currently suggest was also that. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film has no ransom. <Br /> <br /> Some non-spoilers, for example, include a 5-minute scene <br /> <br /> in which the main character eats an apple. And another 3 minutes <br /> where he breathes. <br /> <br /> In case you are wondering, this is not, in effect, the art. Nor is it a comment from <br /> <br /> on humanity, which from the title seems to be trying <br /> <br />. It is, in fact, boring. There are numerous attempts in this film to say something about humanity. You might think of <br /> <br /> onesself, "How would I comment on humanity?" And the most obvious and boring answers will obviously be sex, love and death. <br /> <br /> Not that these options are uninteresting if done right - only that <br /> <br /> are canonical options. For sex, this film does its best to <br /> <br /> making it unattractive and disgusting. In your first five minutes - <br /> <br /> so this is not a spoiler - you will see the bloody vagina of an <br /> <br /> 11 year old girl; It's a mystery of murder, remember? Further on <br /> <br />, some people throw each other and have what the director would have us believe is a "raw" sex, but in reality it is <br /> <br /> invented and overly symbolic - but worse still, uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I like to be disturbed by the movies. This movie showed me the reason: <br /> <br /> Scary movies usually show something inside someone, <br /> <br /> their humanity, that they didn't know existed and they are a little <br / > <br /> afraid of L'Humanité tried to do just that and failed, and I walked <br /> <br /> out of the theater undisturbed, but disgusted, thinking I had <br /> <br / > lost my time in the theater, despite having seen the film for free. <br /> <br />
