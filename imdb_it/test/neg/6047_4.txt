In Chicago, four electricians led by Dean (Richard Grieco) arrive in an old building to disconnect the energy. Accidentally they activate a portal and arrive in another dimension, where Chicago was destroyed by a Queen of Spiders and inhabited by mutants. The group meets the survivors led by Crane (David Nerman) and Elena (Kate Greenhouse) and finds the inventor of the portal, Dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who has lived in this dimension for thirty years. They join forces, trying to rebuild a portal to bring them home. "Webs" is a plagiarism of watchable "Slider", only worse. Most dialogues seem to be written by a person who did not finish elementary school, so they are imbeciles. Furthermore, the story is illogical and it seems that Chicago is the only city in the world. The scientist who tries to start his sophisticated machine with broken wires as if he were stealing a car is a lot of fun. Richard Grieco's face looks like a white version of Michael Jackson and it's horrible. If the observer interrupts his brain, he or she may like this forgettable TV movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Na Teia do Terror" ("In the Web of Horror")
