This film is very bad. If you like the logic (or lack) of National Treasure and bad acting, then it could be a movie for you. Otherwise, spend your time in the sun and your money in a beer. <br /> <br /> Actually it looks like a bad promotional movie or a demonstration photo to promote the people involved (actors, special effects and so on). Accidentally, they produce a bad exposure of their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> In a case like this, the film company should be obliged to return the money to customers who are not satisfied with the product. <br /> <br /> It's really lousy.
