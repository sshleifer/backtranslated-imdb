I had a bad feeling for ten seconds in the film, while a couple of overworked tumbleweeds (probably left behind by a bad western) went through the scene. The bad feeling grew ten seconds later, when the obliged - transformed - human sacrifice stranger without apparent reason lowered the rearview mirror to see a shadow in the back seat. For the next five minutes on the credits we are offered a header of the machine that swings back and forth and only the dramatic music made for TV informs us that there was a killing, not a training session. For the next 27 hours we are treated by two idiotic idiots who for some reason seem forced to drive together in the desert of the south-west, chasing each other like an insane abbot and Costello. Even with the "shocking" twists at the end, we are simply left to shake our heads and wonder if the producers and the director / writer are ashamed and embarrassed as they should be to create these incoherent and incoherent nonsense.
