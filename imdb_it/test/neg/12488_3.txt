What the hell happened to RGV? There are so many things wrong with this film that you have to stop and decide where to start music sooner or later. Every scene was accompanied by this pretentious background music that told you the atmosphere, quite pathetically, I could add. Secondly, lighting: do we really need such dark scenes where we wonder if the projector still works? And finally - if you are going to Indianize the Godfather and Godfather 2 - please understand that many of us have seen. Nayakan was a cheat of GF1 but done better and more fun. I saw a similarity in both Company and Sarkar and while RGV's Ab Tak 56 was brilliant, these two films leave something to be desired. People will no longer be impressed only by corrupt politicians and by fate. Maybe RGV should see Maqbool, which is good enough to be RGV !!
