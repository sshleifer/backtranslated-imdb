Every once in a while, 4kids brings new shows to his company. In recent years they have brought pure gold like Kirby: Right Back at Ya! or Mew Mew Power. But Recenetly, 4kids has been disabled. CatDog is one of the examples. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to write a negative comment without hitting the show, but in truth, Weekenders is pure junk. It's about a group that has too active a brain. However, the problem is that anything you think of is bad. It may look good on paper, but after seeing it, you will realize how good this show is. <br /> <br /> The pizza boy is an extremely stupid character. It's very one-dimensional, there's really not much to it. It is hyperactive, the end of history. Although many believe that the whole character is a South Park rip-off, I think the opposite is true. Mechazawa from the cromartie High-School is an interesting character, and is able to make me laugh. Tino can't do either. <br /> <br /> The cast for the show is no better. Like Tino's mother, they suffer from lack of character. They are limited to one characteristic and that is all. The only quality that redeems is the fact that the show can make you smile. Whether the scene is actually fun, or you might just smile because it's stupid. <br /> <br /> Thje Weekenders is a very crappy show from Disney / 4kids. Although it seems to love some fans, it should be left to children.
