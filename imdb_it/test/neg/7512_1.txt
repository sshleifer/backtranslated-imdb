If you like to see it in a film history lesson or something like that in your school, try to convince your teacher to see something else. believe me, everything is better than this movie. Is it slow, confusing, boring, badly constructed, bloody, do I need to go on? The message is good, but I saw that they were better managed in many other films. Acting is not even good. This film is even more embarrassing, as it starts out as fun (not intensional) because of its surreal history, which eventually becomes just uncomfortable to watch. <br /> <br /> I honestly feel like 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life have been robbed. Why would anyone want to see a girl describe a trio for 10 minutes, rather than see them drive in a traffic jam for 20 minutes, listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear, witness a sort of rape, rather than see the female lead his husband. <br /> <br /> Honestly this film deserves nothing but a 1/10. And if you're not satisfied with my preview, I'm seriously open-minded and I like movies that protest through symbolism, but this film was just awful. make any excuse possible to avoid this movie.
