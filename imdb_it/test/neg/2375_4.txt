It's not horrible, but what a waste ... Lousy gag, bad music, bad drawings and animations ... <br /> <br /> As for the impressive number of animators and intervallists on this image (from, hum .. to a hundred different studios all over the world? Come on, how can you expect something coherent when you make an animated film like this!) I wonder if a guy on the credits = a drawing! The lines are rough, the 3d work inadequate (I'm not against it, but not in this film) But the backgrounds are correct. The plot is rather stupid, far from the precise skill of the BD, and obviously aimed at an international audience. Distributing a movie around the world does not mean taking everyone in the world for a simple guy ... A cultural object is much more interesting when it is challenged, even when it is a foreign film (being French in this case is even worse!) ). <br /> <br /> Some new things are going well (the character Olaf, at times, as with the explanation of stone, but it's not great) but modern references are exasperating (music, SMS - not even a verbal joke , just a stupid bird called short message service: does anyone know the imagination? But, hey, it's an M6 / TPS production with some Celine Dion ... pathetic. <br /> <br /> Asterix is ​​underemployed and Obelix talks too much. Goudurix could be great (as in the book) but it is too clearly a "cool" with a love story (with a female character not very interesting). In fact, only the Vikings (except the wizard) are fun. Too much action, not enough laughs. The best part of the film is the end credits. Not the music, but the few stills it contains. BD style. Well, surely, Asterix is ​​not made to move!
