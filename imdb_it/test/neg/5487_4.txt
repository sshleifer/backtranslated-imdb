I liked all the Lilo and Stitch movies. The TV series weren't great, but I put my opinions on the series aside when I saw this movie. And I have to say ... It was bad. <br /> <br /> One thing I found disappointing was the animation. Yes, you heard it. The animation. I found its quality greatly degraded from the first film. Its quality was only as high as the TV series, something I didn't expect at all. If you're looking for a treat for the eyes, don't expect anything much here. Furthermore, the animation failed to portray serious moods. Even in the alleged sad scenes, I heard nothing for the character, another downgrade from the first movie. <br /> <br /> The next was absolutely dreadful dubbing. I found it very, very unconvincing, and I wondered why, Disney, with all its riches and its glory, could not afford talented voice actors. The skill of the voice actors was just as annoying as that of the series. I tolerated the one in the series because, hey, who wouldn't get tired when he was forced to act for so many episodes? Heck, I don't even know how many episodes there are (Theoretically, there are 624, but I can't believe it). However, I thought the dubbing would have improved in the film, and I was put in the face by the truth, that what they could do in the series was already their best. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, it was the horrible script. It was a mess beyond redemption, and writers try too hard. They try to make a few jokes, but I just found them annoying. Maybe it wasn't the narrator, but the poor dialogues that ruined the sound section. (On the positive side, the soundtrack wasn't bad, and it matched the mood quite well.) <br /> <br /> Fourth was the problem with the plot. I predicted everything, and the plot was what made the characters so original and unpredictable suddenly. You have aliens get new positions and responsibilities in the inouter space. After the initial joke, they realize that they really didn't like it and lose their old life. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the evil villain is driven from prison after a very 'action packed' action scene and breaks into Jumbaa's laboratory to steal his experiment. The experiment was then cloned into another 100 and the hamster wants to conquer the Earth. When the main characters discover, they try to stop the hamster hamster, but are faced with a crazy final showdown against the experiment and hold it in an extremely lame excuse for trying to make the series more beautiful. The characters therefore renounce their new privileges and return to Earth to resume their lives. Seriously, how many other films have already used this ending? The plot was extremely short and formidable, so don't expect too much from it. <br /> <br /> So Disney has failed in sound, graphics and plot. The only charm of the series were the original characters, and the way they managed to maintain the "feel" of the characters, but even that was not able to save the film. I tried to like it, I really did it, but I gave it a 4/10 rating. Another Disney failure.
