If anyone thinks this is a great sports movie, it's probably the only sports movie I've ever seen. There are several aspects that a sports film can take. Whether it's professionals or colleges or high schools. Examples of sports films that I liked (and haven't seen many) are Jim Thorpe: All American, All the right movements, Any Given Sunday, Eight Men Out and Rocky, among others. All those films had little more than simple sports. Whether it was a rise of a man and then a descent from greatness, or a man who loses a dream with the actions of a vengeful coach, or the effect of money on professional sports. In Hoosiers, there is not much content. It didn't even seem like the film had a beginning or an end. There was no character development, everyone was forced with us. I could summarize this film, citing a bad coach: "Go out and try to score more points than the other."
