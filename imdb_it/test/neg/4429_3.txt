I looked at part of the first part of this film and small pieces from other parts. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think it's worth watching this movie. The strange characters and events attract your attention and it is quite interesting, but there are also bad things and some gross things. The magical and mythical side shocked me, and for most Christians this film would not have been very suitable or useful to watch.
