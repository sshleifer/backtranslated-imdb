SPOILERS FOR EVERYTHING: <br /> <br /> Not good. The film differed completely from the book (not that the book was exactly a classic but it was really very beautiful). I guess Demi Moore was OK. In fact, I don't remember much of his performance in one way or another. However, the great disappointment was not for Mrs. Moore. <br /> <br /> WHY who did the rewrite decide to suddenly make the millionaire a heart? (I refer to him as "the millionaire" because he also had a different name in the film, then in the book version, just another change.) <br /> <br /> People who didn't read the book obviously won I know things are different but in the BOOK version this guy is much more ruthless and complex overall. It's also fascinating. The fact that so much change has been made in the film alters the whole plot. It was almost like seeing a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> I know that MANY films vary a lot from books. But I also thought that the character of Redford was a little bit angry. This is NOT Redford's fault (he is a great actor and could have played ruthlessly well) but without those qualities he becomes just another dazzled man in love, so the story becomes just another clich√© love story involving 1 woman and 2 men. This was not really the point of the book. <br /> <br /> This could have been much better. Even if I hadn't read the version of the book, I wouldn't have liked it very much, but changing so much around definitely takes a few points less for me.
