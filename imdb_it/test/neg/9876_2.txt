I never read the book. I really don't want it now. I had no idea what this movie was when I entered the theater. I still don't really know what he should have gone through, but I know two hours of my life have been wasted. Two precious hours that I will never be able to get back. <br /> <br /> The plot was so predictable, it's ridiculous. Werewolves ... or something like that ... a plot very similar to Romeo and Juliet. I expected the endig within five minutes of the start of the film. And I was right. <br /> <br /> Acting is not horrible. The only two fantastic characters in the film were the British cousin and the Rambo-graphic-novel player. Even the other characters ... the dialogue is very bland and predictable. <br /> <br /> The absolute WORST part of the film is the transformation between "human" and "wolf". If you wanted something bully like Van Helsings, you'll be really upset. Imagine a dancer, a bright light, then a wolf. Yes ... that's all. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this movie. Period. Especially if you read the book, because you just want to punch children.
