There is nothing worse than science fiction created by people who don't have the sensitivity. By grabbing a concept that would not be so terrible on its own (a future in which cloning is common enough to require a crime to breed with someone genetically too close to you) the screenwriter proceeded to allow his sufferer the imagination to run . <br /> <br /> When the character of Tim Robbins was able to guess the password of a security guard's computer by simply making her say something about her, I knew I was in trouble. This ability was later revealed to be due to the fact that Robbins had taken an "empathy virus", using viruses to grant instant (or almost instantaneous) skill updates to its users. The love interest of Robbins complained about his experience with such a virus - a mandarin virus in Chinese, which allowed her to speak Chinese, but while complaining, "he could not understand what he was saying". Ok, first of all, empathy, no matter how intense, is not ESP. Without incorporating a sort of true aspect of mental reading (like an empathic virus that actively activates virions in the vicinity, infects people nearby, collects fragments of their memory, then leaves for the original host - that is, as you can probably tell , a smidgeon on the non-practical side) you can't justify the possibility of determining a specific detail like someone's password simply "listening to the things you didn't say". Nor can you acquire the ability to speak a language without understanding what you are saying - the virus cannot infect your vocal chords and translate for you on the fly, because a virus cannot * think *. To give you the power to speak Chinese, such a learning virus should change your brain. It should encode the knowledge between the neurons, and once it's there, it's * your * - you certainly understand what you're saying, why you have to. To use your brain to perform a task, you need to understand that task (for the most part). Unless, of course, the film is not suggesting that the virus was deliberately designed to implement a strange multiple personality mental schism in which some of its secondary personalities function as an integrated one-way translator. <br /> <br /> The mélange of the languages ​​spoken by the characters is quite decent, although it is never close enough to justify all the love that other reviewers have given. Moreover, all the multicultural insertions of the world cannot compensate for a simple and frustrating fact: the dialogue stinks! It's slow, it's struggling, and it's unnatural. Again, I am sure that the adherents are convinced that the strange excess is simply the result of an inspired genius that creates a truly futuristic form of speech (and therefore subject to linguistic drift). I do not agree. A good dialogue is a good dialogue in every age - and the same is true for tripe. <br /> <br /> Finally, I will revisit the central concept of the film - the ban on sex with yourself. Diffuse cloning is a nice classic science fiction theme. So global warming leads to ecological devastation (which Code 46 also incorporates). Unfortunately, the two don't go together! If you have an ecological disaster that seriously destroys the available living area, don't run for the cloning of people! You have enough demographic problems - don't add them by adding new problems. Regular, antiquated sex and birth provide all the population you need and cloning of any kind would be mercilessly suppressed. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the film was not bad at all. He had a beautiful photograph. Maybe if I looked at it quietly, I could enjoy it.
