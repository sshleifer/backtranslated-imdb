Nothing I don't like more than a kung-fu movie that sounds for laughter. That's the main reason why I can't stand Jackie Chan (or her double). I wasn't always a clown, I have to add. "My Young Auntie" is a slapstick martial art of the worst kind. It is a perfect example of how the subgenus was brought into the mud by endless stupid antics and childish behaviors. Unless you're 5, I really don't understand how anyone can find this kind of movie funny. But humor is really a very subjective thing. Personally, I think this kind of approach has permanently damaged the beloved subgenre. I thought the main character Kara Hui was very good here. But I spent such a difficult time in this film that I couldn't appreciate his beautiful performance. If you don't mind all the stupidity, you could enjoy it. I know I didn't.
