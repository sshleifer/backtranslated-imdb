This film is one of the worst adaptations of Pride and Prejudice ever shot and if Jane Austen were alive, she would have requested that her name be removed from the film. Austen's novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. It is also a comment on the class structure of Regency Britain. This film focuses only on the love story, so the disappointed spectators who hoped could do justice to the novel. <br /> <br /> There are numerous problems with the historical accuracy of the film. In the film, the dance in which Darcy snubs Elizabeth is not the refined dance made by the nobility, to which the Bennet, Lucas, Bingley and Darcy families belong, but rather the dance of the lower classes. The nobility would not have danced as if they were in a peasant barn dance. There are also problems with costume and hair. The custom of the period required married women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair and for women to wear hats when they were outdoors. The women of the Regency period were not so liberated as to renounce the requirements of the bonnet in public. The worst historical inaccuracy is the morning meeting of Elizabeth (in her nightgown and coat) and Mr. Darcy (without a tie and vest) in which they admit their mutual love. This is an unforgivable freedom with the novel. No respectable young woman or gentleman would venture out of the house in such a state to undress or try to meet someone of the opposite sex at an hour so early. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this film is the change in Austen's dialogue and the atrocious modern dialogue. Austen's dialogue needs no assistance from a writer who thinks he can write like Austen. The writer of the non-Austen dialogue not only lacks Austen's talent, but does not even have the feeling of Austen's style. The juxtaposition of the two styles is shocking. <br /> <br /> As for acting, the best is done by Judi Dench, who clearly understands the aristocracy's imperiousness. Brenda Blethyn takes some liberties in making Mrs. Bennet less horrible than Austen's portrait. His portrait is interesting and seems to work. Donald Sutherland is a mixture. His British accent is terrible and portrays Mr. Bennet too much as a father of the 20th century and not a father of the late 18th century. Matthew MacFadeyn's portrait of Darcy is flat. I can't imagine anyone falling in love with his Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightly is a beautiful Elizabeth, but her portrait of Elizabeth Bennet is too modern. Knightly focuses on Elizabeth's frankness, but her interpretation completely lacks an understanding of social customs and conventions of the time. He would have done well to read the novel before attempting to portray Elizabeth and research the behavior of the women of the period. <br /> <br /> If you are making a period film, you must be faithful to the period. This film needed a historical consultant who really knows something about the Regency period. He also needed a writer who had a better appreciation and understanding of Austen's text. I can only hope that Emma Thompson decides to make a Pride and Prejudice film in the near future to erase this abomination from our minds. <br /> <br /> The best thing that can be said about this film is that it contains many beautiful scenes from the English countryside. Chatsworth is well used as Pemberly (as he was in the BBC adaptation of 1995). But the beautiful scenery and cute actors can't save this movie. True Austen fans will rush home to watch their 1995 BBC production DVDs with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth or read Austen's text to delete this version from their minds.
