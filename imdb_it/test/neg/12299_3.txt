My wife invited my son and I to watch him on cable TV on a lazy Saturday night, thinking he could show an unusual role for Juliette Lewis. With this promise, at least, the film offers: his character is ineffective, adhering to almost all the clichés of slasher-type horror films. How does the film. A cataloging of his adhesion studied to them would be an exercise in recalling something that I hope to forget quickly, so I will not make one. Basically, this is a whodunnit, heavy on false tracks: everyone seems guilty, rather than just the two suspects from the start. The rule "Rule the logical and obvious, and what's left is" the bad horror movie rule works well on this. The only surprise of having an impact on me was her final end to the final undetermined cliché: Jane will keep her date with her attempted rescuer, who will tell her the identity of the second conspirator (obvious to the public), pushing her in another round of hysterical victim-game. Fortunately, I'll never know.
