There is a certain irony in a parody of the Gothic genre turned into a mess of clich√©s of filmmakers who had no idea what the purpose of the story was, or just didn't care. All the distinctive traits of your average family film are present: younger and more turbulent brothers, a grumpy teenager who does not want to move, insensitive parents who are unable to see the appearance and, of course, a romantic subplot. The film has very little in common with Wilde's original story, which was largely written to make fun of the melodramatic Gothic novels that were all the rage at the time. If Wilde had seen this version, he probably would have laughed - and then, of course, he would have written a parody. One can only hope that the children who watched this crazy, mass-produced product eventually discovered the wit and sparkle of the original version.
