The premise of the film has had much to do, however, despite the novelty of models selling someone else's furniture to live the high life, this film has nothing to do with it. The characters are cardboard. The dialogue is so painfully scripted, it is difficult to sit down and if there were any jokes in the film, I lost them. Marilyn Monroe is walking in the walls because she doesn't want to wear glasses is absolutely amazing and not funny. Grable's stupidity is also too cruel to believe. Bacall's gold digging is so forced, it's annoying to listen to him. Because anyone would like to sit through this is beyond me.
