Wow, where to start with this. Well, if you enjoy laughing at the directors' deepest failures, then this is for you. I bought this film for $ 5 because I never missed an opportunity to laugh at the mistakes of the god B Casper Van Dien, and the boy was one of them. It may have been enough that this film contains the single most lame movie monster ever. This thing, which should be an Indian ghost, looks more like a plastic skeleton for candy you put on the Halloween porch. He wears a cloak that is clearly a garbage bag, complete with what appears to be a bucket-shaped cap on his head. In some places it is a man in costume, while in others it is clearly a plastic object placed on a horse. This monster has the extraordinary ability to see with the vision of "predator", a clear rip-off, and can miraculously appear after having launched its spear. Sometimes the lance cuts people, sometimes not. This thing also manages to drop a helicopter with a single arrow. Wow, this makes a lot of sense when the child blasts a spaceship with a firecracker at the end of "Critters". This creature is impervious to bullets, but somehow dies at the end of the film. At the end of his murderous madness, which we never really found out because he is on, he is blown up. This is an incredible feat, because we had already seen this thing blow up 3 times in the film. But, I guess the last time was the charm. <br /> <br /> And don't even get me started on the lameness of the other characters. First of all, what unit of Delta Force does women employ? The last time I checked the military does not yet admit women in combat situations. Furthermore, this unit is "under cover". Why? What possible reason should they be undercover? And they are not even good, I imagine that nobody would realize that they were military if they didn't have the uniforms, BUT THEY WERE ALL BROUGHT TO PISTOL MACHINE (which incidentally change the sound effects throughout the film, in some places playing like air guns, BB guns, and in others, royalties). There is a part when the skeleton man throws some masons from a catwalk and you can clearly see the block on which they fall. At another point Michael Rooker falls off a hill that is clearly flat. They tilted the camera slightly to give the impression of a slope, but he is clearly pushing himself into this fall scene looooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. Then, when he is helped up the hill, the rope is flat, and when he shows the woman in the "top" of the "hill" the rope rises up from his grip, not as it would appear if he were pulling someone up a hill. Rooker actually has a sentence that says: "I will not haunt him, I will haunt him". What? This is perhaps the stupidest thing I've ever heard, and I watch these ugly films as a hobby. The saddest part of this quote is that it can be said that all those involved in the script / production of this film thought it was so bad. Believe it or not, compared to the rest of the dialogue, this is good. <br /> <br /> Acting, bad The trick, really bad. These characters had scars or wounds that liked to change their faces. Maybe they are alien scars that like to run in the face. Yes, I think I'll make a movie about this, "Attack of the Alien Scars that Move Around on Your Face". That villain would be more intimidating than Skeleton Man, and the film would probably be scarier.
