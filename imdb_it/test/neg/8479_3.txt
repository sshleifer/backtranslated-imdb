This film is not worth going to the movies to watch, I did and I didn't like it, the effects on the film are really well done, and there is a laugh here and there, but the story is really bad, they seemed to be short of ideas, and what is that of loki and odin getting along? that totally destroys Norse mythology, and I imagine they forgot that the powers of loki only worked during the NIGHT !! If you absolutely had to watch this movie rent it when it comes out, don't go to the movies for this! <br /> <br /> They could have done much more with what they did, it seemed they were the only ones who wanted to make a movie to show animations and fantastic effects
