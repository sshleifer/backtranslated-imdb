Several things become apparent after the first few minutes of this film. First, the scenery and special effects are incredible - the best, and if everything else worked well, his austere presence could have turned it into a great movie. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the actors open their mouths, you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your den watching a movie. The story itself is full of cloche and melodrama, and dialogue is among the worst I've ever seen. And as if that wasn't bad enough, they made fun of the main character and, in my experience, you don't want to do it unless the film is a comedy. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: I had trouble getting into it and I wouldn't recommend it.
