Eastenders made the complete revolution from the unmissable in 1985 to today totally abysmal. It's such a bad reflection of the nation that this shit is at the top of the classifications. <br /> <br /> Plot ideas can consist of nothing more banal than ever putting the names of characters in a hat. The first two (regardless of their gender) will sleep with each other, the 3rd and the 4th out will have a fight in the Vic, the 5 will be arrested, 6 will develop an addiction, the 7 will remain pregnant etc. <Br /> <br /> The producers are smart though. The 30-minute show is actually composed of only 3 lines. <br /> <br /> 1) Someone will walk into the Vic and say "What's going on?" 2) Someone else will stand up saying "let it go" (out) 3) Then a woman will say "Doan choo enters ere 'n' insult mah fam'ly" <br /> <br /> That's it. This is every show. Apart from the occasional "Get it sort-id / Is it sort-id?" <br /> <br /> The show was once a realistic representation of the East End folk and their way of life. The buffers came out when 1) They extended it two nights a week and 2) The Slater family showed up. The way they attract viewers is beyond me. The character Kat symbolizes everything that went wrong in society, treating someone else as something he took from the bottom of his shoe. <br /> <br /> The people who vote for the best character in these polls must be the same as those who vote for Jamie Redknapp's best Sportsman, despite not having played for 3 years. <br /> <br /> What I can never understand is if the show is the pinnacle of British TV because all the biggest names go? Ross Kemp, Martin Kemp, the list is endless. <br /> <br /> How long did the marriage of the longest couple last, with mutual loyalty? Yes, people leave, but until the writers understand that the characters, the couple can be interesting and pleasant without sleeping, the show will continue to deteriorate. One episode last week had 3 separate lots of exactly that. And Zoe and the doctor even outlast Lofty and 'Shell' as a 'more unconvincing couple than ever to appear on TV.' <br /> <br /> Yes, Eastenders is the most watched show, this is undisputed. But many external factors contribute to this. 19.30 / 20.00 is the perfect time to get the most spectators, has an omnibus edition for 2 hours, and more than that, millions of viewers look at it, for nothing more than habit, but if they were completely honest to themselves , they would admit that (in 2002, more than ever), it can be absolutely painful.
