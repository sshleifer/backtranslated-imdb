The film quickly arrives at a chase scene with ever-increasing destruction. The first really bad thing is the hijacking of Steven Seagal that would have been defeated by Seagal at the helm, but he probably would have closed the whole premise for the film. They seem to have decided to make all sorts of changes in the film's plot, so just plan to enjoy the action and not expect a coherent plot. Transform any sense of logic you may have, it will reduce your chance of having a headache. <br /> <br /> It gives me hope that Steven Seagal is trying to get back to the kind of characters he portrayed in his most popular films.
