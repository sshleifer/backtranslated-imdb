The four Los Angeles policemen in Fedora driving in a large black convertible seem slightly absurd, and even more ridiculous when it turns out that Nick Nolte, the most stupid of the lot, is in charge. The writer never manages to create a spirit of camaraderie among team members, and the director fails to snatch the joint from the Nolte man's mountain. Try to interrogate anyone. The character of Nolte lights a cigar, gets angry and beats the interviewees into a pulp. His methods do not lead him anywhere, until, at a certain point in the action, he is wandering from the house tossed to the house tossed with his mouth open and his brain closed. It destroys an FBI team and throws two military officers out of a flying plane, with only a vague anger report in headquarters and no punishment. At the end of the film it is as gormless and muscular as it was at the beginning. How he managed to make a beautiful whore fall deeply in love with him is a mystery, as well as the eternal devotion and the tragic sense of the betrayal expressed by his unemployed wife. Two interesting shots in the photo: one of an atomic explosion, the other of a giant crater, apparently caused by a bomb. It is almost ruined and swollen like Nolte's face.
