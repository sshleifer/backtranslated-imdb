Once upon a time Theresa Russell made some decent halfway films, so I still hope that one of her efforts over the last ten years deserves a score of at least 6 or 7 (out of 10). However, DARK WORLD is just the latest in a series of disappointments. The first 90 minutes are very difficult to watch. The lines are delivered by the main actors as if they were read in a first try or even in a casting session (in which the actors do it for the sake of their agents, but they don't really want the parts for which they are readily perfected) . The sets and props seem "dull" in some way (what kind of police department would allow a detective to have an entire wall of the living room set aside full of documents?). The screen is constantly cluttered with meaningless times and data lines, which appear without rhyme or reason. Now, if the writer were here after the lights came up from a movie screening, no doubt it would be said that all these shortcomings are indeed clever clues to the plot that turns into the background in the last five minutes of this misfire. Well, for those members of the public whose only other cinematographic experiences are TV: THE MOVIE and SURFER, DUDE; could be mistaken for nodding with the head. But it's hard to believe that ANYONE who has seen 10 or more movies in their lives - and isn't a close friend or relative of a DARK WORLD cast or crew member - could fall for such a crappy canard. Despite what the d.v.d. box could make you believe, this film bears more resemblance to SUNSET BOULEVARD (dead narrator device) or Hitchcock (schizophrenic device protagonist) like an emptied bottle of Jim Beam filled with urine that has to drink!
