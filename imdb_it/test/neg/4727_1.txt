Oh, how I laughed during those first two episodes. This stupid movie about an 11-year-old boy carrying a gun, stealing cars, stealing warehouses, thieving houses, extorting money from other children, burning houses, shooting rats, buying drugs, distributing drugs to his mother and friends then he kills a boy. What a great play! But it was not meant to be a comedy. It was intended as a social drama. How can it be? The events of this film are absurd and ridiculous. The characters are all stereotypes from the immature imagination induced by the comics of a 4-year-old child. Dialogue is ridiculous; people talk like idiots. It's a very stupid movie. <br /> <br /> The first scenes are really very funny, for all the wrong reasons. But the involuntary hilarity of the idiotic premise ends after a while, and after that the laughter only comes rarely; at that point the viewer cannot believe what he is seeing and is alternately amazed and bored by what follows (if he has at least half of a brain cell). <br /> <br /> A short film, but it feels like an eternity. The film is actually a serious attempt to show the world of a degenerate young man, while imitating films far superior to it, like "Divertimento". There is only such an air of falsehood about everything; children, adults, all lack credibility in their actions and in their dialogues. The little boy at the top of the saucer makes his way into the film as if he has seen all of Jimmy Cagney's films at least a hundred times. And, in general, the child is not portrayed as a reserve of evil, but, instead, as a small misunderstood artistic talent. Of course. Every young hooligan is misunderstood - society has made him bad. Poor child. <br /> <br /> The film is embarrassing; a collection of occasional hilarious clich√©s put together to make a film that lacks intelligence and meaning. The intellectual level of the film is zero.
