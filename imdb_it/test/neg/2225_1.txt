What bothers me with so-called "scientific" programs like these is that it's presented as if it were a FACT that the dinosaurs live "millions" of years ago. First, nobody can even conduct a scientific experiment to show that the earth is millions of billions of years old. It is a superficial theory based on inaccurate radiometric dating methods with enormous assumptions thrown into the plate of evolution. <br /> <br /> Secondly, no one can prove that evolution ever took place. All of Darwin's missing links are still MISSING! If you look at all the fossils somewhere in or on the earth, they are complete animals of a certain type, for example: a dog or a cat. No one has ever found the skeleton of a dog that turns into a cat or in the example presented in this series, a dinosaur that turns into a bird. <br /> <br /> This is a real pain in the ass. There is more evidence that Santa Claus exists than any animal that turns into another type of animal. <br /> <br /> All the ideas presented in this series are an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and everything in it has been created. <br /> <br /> This series is NOT SCIENCE. It is a vision of the religious world that is hidden under the banner of science. Science is something we can observe and repeat. What you are seeing here is SCIENCE FICTION. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a science fiction program that has the decency to admit it's a science fiction program, then look at Star Trek or Star Wars.
