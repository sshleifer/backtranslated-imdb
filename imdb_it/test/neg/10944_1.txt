Most people get the luxury of typing a movie title and discovering the movie before watching it but unfortunately I've never been one of those types of people. I wouldn't even want to read the synopsis for fear of spoilers, but there are two sides to that because if you ignore those warnings and even give a movie a chance after it's done in theaters, you're coming in at your own risk and you might just end up with the bitter in the mouth that is exactly what I feel for this stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the only good thing about Shakalaka-Crap-Crap are some of his songs (and seriously excluded the title track). Even the ever promising talent of Kangana Renaut (Metro, Gangster, Woh Lamhe) is seriously wasted here while playing Ruhi, the woman who caught the attention of both male characters played by Bobby Deol (who plays AJ a rootless music producer ) and Upen Patel (who plays Reggi, an emerging artist who crosses the path of AJ). Celina Jaitley provides the right amount of OOMPH requested to a socialite who is kidnapped by Reggi (who helped set foot in the door of the recording industry). This doesn't sound like a mix or a movie that should include Anupam Kher right? Well, you're wrong because he's inside like Reggi's father (another wasted talent). <br /> <br /> The film could not have been so bad if they had not passed the script of the character of Deol. The moral message was too predicative (revenge had a deadly dark side) and the ending was too exaggerated that will make you wonder why you sat in a movie so foolish in the first place. Really, this is the epitome of shit.
