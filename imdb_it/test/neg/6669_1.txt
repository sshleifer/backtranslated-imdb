It is a pity that someone so idolized by many children as their parents should belittle themselves of appearing in this exploitative tripe, a jumper of carriages. I often wonder if Mr. Wisdom in his later years has looked back on his excuse for a movie with some pride. At least Sally Geeson has had the decency to retire to do something useful after appearing in this low-budget junk. A cameo of a long-forgotten pop called Pretty Things can't save the film from its terribleness. If you want the nostalgia of the '60s to instead invest in "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush", Barry Evans and Sally's sister, instead, are played by Judy.
