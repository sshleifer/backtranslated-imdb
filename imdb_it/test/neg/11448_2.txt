I saw this movie and I can say that this is really a bad movie. The director has gone mad ... of course he knows a lot about the army, but it's certainly an economic type. There are also a lot of technical flaws in the movies ... <br /> <br /> Okay ... here's my doubt - in the end when they save the family (including a girl who was just raped) ... because do they leave them out of their place? I haven't seen any ambulances around! There are many aspects to the film that are real ... but then I just wish the Major had narrated / helped / assisted some other good director and made the film. <br /> <br /> Mohanlal certainly deserves a better director film!
