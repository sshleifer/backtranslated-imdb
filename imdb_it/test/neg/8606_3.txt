Have you ever seen something so terrible that you just have to keep looking to make sure it's really as bad as it looks? This is one of those movies. He was criticized by critics for his release, not least because of the way it was funded. I took it on TV last night and succumbed to curiosity. <br /> <br /> In the case, that's what it says on the box, neither more nor less: low-level humor, rawness, much in the 'Carry On ...' vein but with 'adult' language. In fact, he links up with the British porn industry of the 60s and 70s, cheating bettors by promising real sex and not delivering (do you understand the nipple?) That all the dark age is recreated with love here, but with cinematography modern. <br /> <br /> It has the advantage of Mackenzie Crook (The Office, Pirates of the Caribbean and more) and also of Johnny Vegas. The girl from the chip shop is genuinely sexy. Beyond these unexpected positives, it leaves me to wonder what happened in England. Junk food, low-paid work, social housing, desperate lives. As a bonus, there are some nice shots of leafy Birmingham. Foreigners might find it informative about British attitudes and aspirations. Overall, though, I still feel incredulous that I sat through it.
