I always wanted to see the movie because I loved the novel, but I was warned because I heard that the film was a stinker. IS. Fowles wrote the script and I was able to follow him well, despite having read the novel more than thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is execrable - strident, tinkling and totally inappropriate - breaking every attempt at mystery or mood in the film. I suspect the director should take the responsibility seriously, since Michael Caine is terrible and was already doing a great job at ALFIE a couple of years ago. <br /> <br /> The "Mysteries" evoked by the book is not well translated on the screen. I'd like to see someone redo this.
