Chip Foose is an absolute genius and the end result of the projects is truly amazing. Condos do a good job. I particularly like to watch the "project" come together. The final results are much better than when they left the assembly line, with today's mechanical and cosmetic advances. However, it kind of annoys me that the "projects" seem to be owned by the already rich and / or famous. Too bad that those who are overhauled can afford the business. Let's see now, Vince Neill of Motley Crew gets a car for his friend. Hello! If he (Neill) was a true friend he would have paid to have his friend's car restored. What a joke! Another episode shows a seemingly wealthy middle-aged girl who had Betsy make the '56 caddy. The husband of over 30 years was behind everything. The couple seemed to have little money. What a pity. I imagine that the bucket of lunch guys like me will have to save for the day that will never come. I happen to own a 1953 Chip Ford project. Will someone choose me?
