as a retired MSF USAF (aircraft maint), this was one of the worst films I've ever seen. the fact that a teenager can never get on the flight line, much less enter a f-16 is ridiculous. the army spends millions on each pilot to make them the best in the world and this film makes the aeronautics and all its members seem stupid at best. yes, I know it's just a movie but it sends a message to the youngest that we're all idiots, and believe me, we're not. the logistics involved in the creation of any type of mission is very involved, even in the eighties, military computers were too safe to hack from any teenager, and the other flaws in this film make Peter Pan more credible. I'm sorry, this film has no entertainment value for me.
