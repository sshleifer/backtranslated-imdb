Nice attempt to bring the Shakespearean language alive in a post-apocalyptic context, but the end result is terrible. The futuristic Liverpool is not at all convincing; the budget was obviously not very big, but the production designer could have come up with a slightly more creative approach. Alex Cox has made some good films, eg Repo Man and Highway Patrol Man, but I really don't know what he was thinking here. Just an opinion
