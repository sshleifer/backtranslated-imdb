The writer-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and transforms it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite the A-list actors, refined cinematography and elegant production design. It's all in the plot, and the plot is ridiculous. "Teach me how to be nice", the art dealer François Coste (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Dany Boon), and this sums it all up. We learn almost nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil could be a good actor, but not a minute we believe he could be the ruthless egoist that the script depends on him. Just as we hope the disguise is over, Leconte pulls one of his usual third-degree cathartic acts, from rapid progression to damage to disaster. Like the precious Greek vase by François, everyone in this film is fake. Leconte's only asset is Julie Gayet as Coste's business partner, Catherine, who looks sexy and sexy despite a serious haircut.
