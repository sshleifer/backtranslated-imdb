This film cannot be called "cheap" thanks to films, music and recycled ideas. But for me, when I saw him as a teenager, it was pretty funny. (I didn't know BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS before.) In retrospect he has something nostalgic about the SF wave of the early 1980s and the special effects of this time. Its old-fashioned trash look and its ingenuity provide a certain attraction. To enjoy this film, I recommend concentrating on the paternal relationship between the characters of Vince Edwards and David Mendenhall. Also, I liked the idea that a bunch of scoundrels find out his heroic qualities after being unfortunately confronted with the challenge of caring for a child.
