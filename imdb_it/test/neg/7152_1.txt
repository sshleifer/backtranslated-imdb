If this film is coming to a theater near you, consider it a threat. I was unlucky enough to see this movie here in Tokyo. Since I'm Dutch, I was surprised to find a Dutch movie that played in a metropolis like Tokyo. I thought it should be a bit special if a Dutch film goes all the way to Japan. So I went there with some friends, and we were happily telling the theater staff that we were Dutch and that we were so curious about the movie. As it turned out, this was one of the most childish, stupid, stupid, worst acted, with the worst spoken English film I saw in maybe 10 years, and I left the theater trying to avoid the staff, because I felt almost responsible this catastrophic film. Sometimes you feel like you know what the director was aiming for: Lola Rennt, Trainspotting like a movie. Instead it was more like MacGyver on drugs with outdated breakbeat music as a score. But if I didn't feel too annoyed, the film was unintentionally rather hilarious once in a while, as it showed the Netherlands in its smallest dimension.
