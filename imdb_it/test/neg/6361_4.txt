Basically the first two Critters films were already silly but in a good and fun way. This film is much more than a B-movie, which is silly but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> This is the first sequel that does not really follow the plot of the first two films. Basically all the characters are new and there are no bounty hunters this time (well, like no one, since the bounty hunter in this movie shows up too late) and the budget for this obviously went down again. To save even more, the film was shot in parallel with part 4, which I imagine will be just as bad, since it directly follows this film and is made by the same people involved as with this one. <Br /> <br /> It's just a typical genre B movie, which actually has no originality or entertainment. It makes "Critters 3" a true redundant sequel, which you can safely do without. Of course, things would have been worse for this film, but it's not really a good thing. The film becomes flat like a science fiction / horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> It is also strange to note that the Critters have suddenly changed in this. They are about twice their usual size this time, without giving an explanation for this and they are even more Gremlins as in this film than it was in the previous case. <br /> <br /> The film is made interesting only because this was the film debut of Leonardo DiCaprio. He was about 17 years old in this film and obviously he looked like a kid, like he still does today. I like to watch the well-known actors in their first roles. It's fun to see how they work and if their style has improved and changed over the years. Of course DiCaprio has improved, but it has already given its jokes in the same way it is these days. <br /> <br /> Really a movie too silly and disgusting. <br /> <br /> 4/10
