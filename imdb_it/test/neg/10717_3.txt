I couldn't wait to see this movie, unfortunately I should have listened to my daughters' advice. This should have been a parody, but it took on a realism that multinationals had a lot to answer. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey after all the work he has done is still Jim Carrey and his play does not get any better, his co-star was unable to support him. Their son in the film was invisible. <br /> <br /> The life of crime was a blink of an eye, and that was the missing link in the film. The film showed 2 or 3 robberies and they were richer than before, the one in which he lost it for me. <br /> <br /> I laughed in some parts but, overall, not good enough, AlecBaldwin felt it was there to add some weight to the film. His character was not strong enough. There were just too many gaps to make this a smart and tight movie.
