Well then. This film is totally unattractive, childish, has gags from other films, has songs from other films ("Mutt" by Blink 182, "We Luv U" by Grand Theft Audio), an unlikely protagonist, a ridiculous storyline and limping parodies movies like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty. Redeeming functionality? Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly. Enough said.
