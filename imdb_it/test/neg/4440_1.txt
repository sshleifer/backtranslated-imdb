Robert Altman's "Quintet" is a sad, gloomy, hard to follow thriller in which you eventually give up after a while because it's so complicated. I remember seeing it at my local twin on the opening weekend with a full house. By the time the photo ended, it took less than a quarter. I have never witnessed such a mass exodus without an emergency to drive people out. This should tell you how bad it is. I think it's the worst movie ever made that involved important talents in front of and behind the camera.
