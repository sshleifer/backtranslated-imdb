After just over 50 years of film sightings, I have developed some simple rules for making good movies. <br /> <br /> 1. Present your main characters in advance, certainly within the first half hour 2. Keep your characters to a minimum. If you're adapting a novel, combine features and actions of minor characters <br /> <br /> into a person 3. Make sure your characters' actions have credibility; if necessary, create additional scenes to establish the motivation 4. Keep the action clear. Violence does not have to be explicit, but it should not be confused, either 5. Get the best music money you can buy. It often counts more than acting, photographing, etc. 6. Usually if a movie is not very nice within the first 10 minutes, it will not improve at all <br /> <br /> `Cannon for Cordoba 'is a textbook example of what happens when these simple rules are not followed. The soundtrack of Elmer Bernstein is rinkydink, one of the worst I've ever heard in a modest film. This is quite surprising considering Bernstein's credentials ("The Man with the Golden Arm", "The Magnificent Seven", "The Great Escape", "The Children of Katie Elder"). Paul Wendkos' direction is scarce and confused. The performances vary from very good (Don Gordon, Peter Duel) to terrible (Raf Vallone, Giovanna Ralli, Gabriele Tinti) with the usual reliable George Peppard who falls somewhere in the middle. This should come as no surprise, considering the mediocre direction and the amateur script, which breaks rules 1, 2 and 3. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time. I give "Cannon for Cordoba" a "3".
