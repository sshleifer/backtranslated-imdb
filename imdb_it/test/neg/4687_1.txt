Now you know the story of "Sweeney Todd", most likely thanks to Tim Burton's recent film. But you probably don't know, from this version of the old story by Andy Milligan, the infamous junk merchant who gave Al Adamson and Ted V. Mikels a run for their money. <br /> <br /> It must have come to an end In my years of watching the horror and exploitation from the 60s to the 80s, I am finally reviewing an Andy Milligan film. You see, from 1964 to 1990, Andy gave us many exploitative and horror films, none of which were good, and barely watchable. "The Bloodthirsty Butchers" is no exception. <br /> <br /> There is a dialogue and well, there are speeches, and this is one of the things you'll find here - lots and lots of talk. The film reaches levels almost "Manos The Hands of Fate", sometimes, while you tirelessly wait for something to happen. Even if I love the effects of economic-looking gore, violence is too small and distant, and despite its reputation, the "breast" scene is not so shocking. <br /> <br /> I love economic and bad exploitation as much as the next trash movie fan, but "Bloodthirsty Butchers" is the kind of evil that the MST3K would have torn to pieces without mercy. Unfortunately, Milligan will die of AIDS in 1991, and if there was one of his films I would say I like it, it would be the delirious "The Ghastly Ones". This is not a "horror", but it's just ugly.
