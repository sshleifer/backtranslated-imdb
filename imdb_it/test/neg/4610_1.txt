The funniest parts of this film were the clips from the original film. The acting was poor and the premise of sexual scorecards was disgusting. The effects were marginal at best. There were no prominent performances, Amy Irving was featured in this film to try to get a part of the H20 Halloween audience. The original was much more pleasant and rewarding. I'm sorry to say this won't be one of the best 10 years ... so far it's at the bottom of my list. Don't worry about these people !!
