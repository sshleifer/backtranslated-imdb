Hi everyone, <br /> <br /> I bought it on DVD from England. See, I have one of those multi-region players. I thought it would be fun to have an interesting movie to show to my friends. Well, surprise for Amy-Jo Johnson, she's barely in the movie. Even if she's on the cover. It's really hard to imagine how such a bad movie was made in the first place. Maybe someone has a trust fund. <br /> <br /> Oh ... It's about the Vampires living on the beach
