At first glance, I must already say, look at The Contractor, 2007. Also with Wesley Snipes. A better action movie with a more dramatic plot. <br /> <br /> The detonator has a horrendous plot that focuses on a kind of atomic bomb, set in Romania and with an incredible direction for an action movie - there's nothing exciting about the moments and an action movie turn into boredom. <br /> <br /> Really, what do you expect Wesley Snipes to do when horrible scripts like this are offered to him? Don't blame him, he needs money. <br /> <br /> This was the first impression when I saw the film, 3 years ago. But I will never see him again, in any way. To the devil. It sucks. There. I said it. <br /> <br /> PS: I don't think I ever said "this movie sucks" on an IMDb review. Thanks, detonator!
