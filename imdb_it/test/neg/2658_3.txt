So much chemistry between Kristen Scott-Thomas and Harrison Ford, but whenever the story of their relationship began to gain momentum, the script deleted and treated an irrelevant subplot that did nothing to advance the story. In fact, the subplots had nothing to do with the story. They were like commercial breaks in which you watched a trailer for another film. <br /> <br /> Writers (or someone who controlled writers) obviously didn't trust themselves to write irresistibly about the relationships and inner life of their characters. They looked uncomfortable unless they had launched some battles with guns and fights with the bars. Or maybe they didn't trust the public to pay attention to a story about a man and a woman trying to understand their relationship in difficult circumstances. After all, we all know how boring "Casablanca" was. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the relationship between Kay and Dutch had been developed more and allowed to play, the writers would have known how to end the story. This film is a disappointment for not having done more with its wonderful actors, who gave good performances but could have done more with a better script.
