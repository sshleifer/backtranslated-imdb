A man is torn from a street in London and taken to a foreign country where he is tortured as a suspected terrorist. A boring and trivial film bored me to death. More an idea then a movie. I was halfway through this 77 minute movie when I realized I had no idea who was on screen. It was as if they had taken every other similar film and brought out all the ideas and put them in one place without the true notion of character. Surely it is acted with passion but there is no emotional center, there is only one type of every man that the directors believe is sufficient. It is not. And while the story presented in theory is important as a warning, the film is too boring to convince someone, especially if one has seen the other, better films than a similar one (performance with Reese Witherspoon for example)
