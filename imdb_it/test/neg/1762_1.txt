<br /> <br /> This movie really has nothing to do. With the Reverend played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman who complains of his constipation and toilet humor in a 2.5-hour movie, you know they didn't make any cuts and left the shit out, literally. It's a waste of talent and total embarrassment. Terrible! <br /> <br />
