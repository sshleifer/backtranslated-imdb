Aussie Shakespeare for the 18-24 set.with blood, blood and other blood.and good dose of nudity. this will not be the case for all levels of May, to those violent for some too cheap for the most part. done on a limited budget, they try to do the best, but it only works sporadically. And this macbeth seems to be missing, but it is not convincing. although there is good acting by most people who do not enter their heads, especially the mecbeths. the best performance came from gary sweet and the strangest mick molly. if you are in Shakespeare then see, but if you like your ripe cheese you will love it. It's not a bad movie, but it's not even nice. sam peckenpah would have loved it, that is, if it was shot as a western. I was expecting a lot from this, since I liked a stomach ache. but this was a vacant effort.
