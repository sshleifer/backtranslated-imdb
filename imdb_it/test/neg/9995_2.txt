Many people have said that this was a great film with Hoffman's performance. I went from suspended incredulity, to restless boredom, to almost come out. it's not there there. <br /> <br /> Hoffman does everything. he is committed to performance. but sometimes the role of a sick man seems to be that of an interested actor who chews the landscape. <br /> <br /> no character in the film, apart from the tops, is much more than placeholders - nell, jack, perry, shawn, the sheriff, all one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> yes the film shows the manipulative, clean, dishonest sides of the hood. shows them so many times that I started wondering why - do the filmmakers think we need to have everything explained? It is again? It is again? often refers to the genius of Capote but does not show it. shows him surrounded by fans and flatterers but he never convinces us why. <br /> <br /> but my goal is not to deconstruct the film. I'm sure others will have other interpretations. for me, this was a two-hour movie that looked like five.
