Isn't it depressing how the most violent cartoon on Cartoon Network is for girls? While I don't watch the fired soldiers and blow up Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, it would be nice if there was a cartoon or at least something on TV that I could watch to satisfy my violent impulses. And something that wouldn't tease me to look. I saw a few episodes (I really should have been shot for this) and I had to go through the movie (now, where do I find a gun?), And it's pretty clear that this lost its spark after the first few episodes. If you like to see monsters of 500 feet that can destroy huge cities in seconds slaughtered by children about one foot high, this is a must see. But it becomes very boring after a while, and with a show like this, even the original ideas become mainly boring. The film seemed too long an episode (I don't remember any of this) and the villain should have been much more intimidating than a green monkey. This show is a laughing stock. Performs the same basic premise episode after one episode after another, and although he may try to have some mystery and intrigue once in a while, the ending will always be the same - "The Powerpuff Girls Save the Day!" Everything is good and beautiful, but everything is very, very repetitive ... I give it 3 out of 10 to be the only cartoon dangling on CN to revolve around violence, although it is aimed at girls, so I won't tune in to always. I established myself as a fan of war and violence films and I don't want to destroy this reputation ... 3/10
