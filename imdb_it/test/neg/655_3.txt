I was pretty excited to see this movie when it came out. The commercials made him extravagant and I generally like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, and the combination of the two seemed like an interesting idea. Unfortunately I was deeply disappointed with Nurse Betty. Personally, I have usually noticed that violence and graphic comedy do not go very well together and the only directors who have ever combined the two successfully, in my opinion, are Tarantino and Coen. There is not much violence in Nurse Betty, but what there is of violence made me feel a little strange when I had to laugh. Of course, for me, part of the problem was also the fact that there didn't seem to be many places where I was asked. <br /> <br /> The film does not work much like a drama. Renee Zellweger's Betty, the protagonist of the story, is clinically insane and impossible to report in any real way. I will say that Zellweger plays the role well, and Freeman, Rock and Greg Kinnear all do a good job too. The problem is in writing; Freeman is the only person who can play an interesting character. It's really too bad. 3/10
