Julie Andrews scoffs irony with her image of two beautiful shoes in this drama overdone musical drama, but if she approaches her role casually, she is alone in doing it. Blake Edwards' film about a woman who is a music hall entertainer and a German spy during the First World War does not know which tone to aim for, and Rock Hudson has the thankless task of playing a romantic second-fiddle. The musicals had grown from the favor of 1970 and elephant productions like "Star!" and this film really tarnished Andrews' reputation, leaving a lot of dead space in his catalog until "The Tamarind Seed" arrived. I always thought that Julie Andrews would make a big villain or a woman's shadow; his strong voice could really attract attention and hit some low notes that can be impressive or seductive. The husband / director Edwards seems to realize this, but neither he nor Julie can produce much energy in this scenario. Screenwriter William Peter Blatty is not a good partner for Edwards, and neither has his heart in this material. Beatty's script offers Andrews only a fabulous sequence: a striptease. * 1/2 from ****
