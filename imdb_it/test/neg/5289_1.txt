I started watching it because I thought it was really shitty porn. While I kept looking at the only emotion I had from this film was finding out what the name was, so I could search for it and rip it off. I just finished it and thought I'd end my life knowing that someone made this film. <br /> <br /> For people who have commented on this film with a good script and fantastic acting, my words of wisdom to you are that you probably don't have friends because you were in the movie. I hope you have all the time you've spent on the life you've wasted on making this movie. <br /> <br /> It is not possible that this is a serious film. There was an old man who was stabbed and didn't even hurt him. And when all the others are stabbed, they fall dead. <br /> <br /> It was probably important that these people killed people at random and ate them and found themselves with an 80-year-old man who wanted to put the parts in his body. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was when the old man found the "emoglobens" or otherwise you write it because this made the film very intellectual and probably helped to reach the older audience. <br /> <br /> What really upset me is that they decided to put college girls going into the woods looking for fake skulls in that casual scene. <br /> <br /> If you try to watch this movie, you should probably fill up your bathtub and drop the hair dryer into it and be ready to jump inside. <br /> <br /> THIS IS TO SEE !!! .... for those who believe that life could not get worse because this helps you understand that there are people out there (the creators of this film) who are even more pathetic and who do not go where in life.
