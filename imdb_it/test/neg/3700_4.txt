"Haaaarrrryyy!" <br /> <br /> The amplified and dispassionate female voice could have been Leona Helmseley in heat but, no, it belongs to Allison Hayes like Nancy Archer, the 50-foot woman of the title. In the most infamous role of his film career, Allison's performance literally pierces the roof. In fact, it creates a couple of roofs. <br /> <br /> Jaw-droppingly tacky, "Aot50FW" is the story of Nancy, a drunken neurotic heir and her lovely husband Lothario, Harry (William Hudson, who also co-stars in The Amazing Colossal Man). Nancy has a close encounter with the third type, in the desert, with a bald giant of outer space wearing a miniskirt and gladiator sandals and who has a weakness for Nancy's jewels. What he does once he has taken her away is probably a mystery, but soon Nancy will start to grow. <br /> <br /> Walking in the center of the city on tranquilizers, wrapped tightly in nothing but the sheets, the giant giantess heads for the low rented salon where Harry is having a laugh with a homosexual named Honey ( Yvette Vickers). The fight becomes ugly. <br /> <br /> The Poverty Row f / x makes the alien giant and Nancy seem transparent due to incompetently transposed images. You'll understand why director Nathan Juran changed his name to Nathan Hertz in the credits. Juran was no stranger to directing giant, human and non-human creatures, having also directed "The Deadly Mantis", "Sinbad's Seventh Journey", "Jack, the Giant Killer" and several episodes of "World of Giants" and " Land "of TV. of the giants. "<br /> <br /> Lots of laughs for all the wrong reasons.
