Jack Frost returns with an army of Styrofoam balls that can only be thwarted by blows of super-bathers laden with margaritas. What's that like for a plot? The film is based on such a ridiculous premise that it just raises an eyebrow when the characters are killed with BBQ tongs and are impaled by carrots. You could also say that the whole movie is skating on thin ice (ba-boom-tish). Indeed, there are some fantastic one-liners including an observation on the Murderous Coconut Shark. <br /> <br /> The right times are hard, but this does not justify the willingness of the actors to take part in this hat-trick. <br /> <br /> For those fans hoping to see Jack Frost, be ready to accept it simply as a phallic carrot climbing on the beach with a melancholy comment.
