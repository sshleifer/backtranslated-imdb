I didn't read "A Time to Kill" by John Grisham, and maybe this would help me better understand the film. But maybe not. I have heard that this is Grisham's most faithful adaptation, and if it is true, I can understand why so many publishers rejected the novel when Grisham presented it as his first work. <br /> <br /> "A Time To Kill" is one of those movies that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once. It wants to be a suspenseful suspenseful thriller and, at the same time, a film dedicated to exploring some social and moral issues. Let's face it, those two types of films don't go together in Hollywood, which is why "Dead Man Walking" had to be done independently. <br /> <br /> The story involves a young lawyer named Jake (Matthew McConaughy) to defend a black man named Carl (Samuel L. Jackson) from the murder of two hillbillies who brutally raped his young daughter. The day before the rapist trial, Carl hid in a courthouse closet and when the rapists were taken through the building, he charged them and killed them both. To help the defense, Jack accepts the help of a former law student (Sandra Bullock), who demonstrates that his role in this film was completely superfluous and inserted the film only for marketing purposes. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, one of the rapist's brothers (Kiefer Sutherland) was angry that a black man killed his brother and decided to take revenge. All this leads to a shooting in front of the court, a kidnapping, a brutal beating and a racial revolt. I must admit that all this caught my attention during the film, besides the classroom scenes. What I later disputed was the film's management of ethical questions and its use of formulas in the plot. <br /> <br /> The main question that the film constantly asks, over and over again, is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury. Of course they can, but that does not mean that man must be absolved because the process is fair. This film, however, does not seem to think so. In addition, there are many holes in the plot used for comfort. For example, there is an unknown character named Mickey, who is a member of the Klan, and, for unknown reasons, is helping members of the defense team escape the grave dangers of other Klan members. After Bullock was kidnapped by Sutherland and the company, and left for dead in the desert, this unknown person comes and saves her - and we will never find out who he is and why he is helping the people he should terrorize. /> <br /> And speaking of the reign of terror of the character of Sutherland, it's amazing how the police and the Bullock character stopped him throughout the film. There is a scene where Sutherland becomes a sniper from a building in front of the courthouse and tries to shoot Jake as he leaves, shooting one of the guards. Now you would think that since there are dozens of cops around, it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper. Not much luck. From what we could see, nobody even seemed to care that a sniper was still at large. Even after Bullock, he was saved by Mickey Mouse, never, never named who his abductor was, nor was he even questioned. Why was this? Simple. Sutherland's character was needed throughout the film to add continuous suspense, although logically, it should have been out of the scene. <br /> <br /> In addition to the character of Bullock, there is another ungrateful character. It is Jake's assistant played by Oliver Platt. There seems to be a reason why his character is in the movie - to provide a number of one-liners to the public. In my opinion, one-liners show great weakness in "serious" films when they are used. It shows that the directors are not sure that the story and the dialogue are enough to keep the audience's attention, and then use them to make the audience laugh to reassure everyone that they are watching a funny movie. <br /> <br /> But enough of the movie are a lot of small problems. What about the movie message here? It is clear that Carl is indeed guilty of murder. We saw how he planned for hours to kill the men who raped his daughter. The lawyers say it was temporary madness, etc. Which forced him to kill. In desperation, Jake asks the jury to close his eyes as he talks about the rape in detail as part of his final discussion. After describing everything that happened, he adds a final line ... "The girl is white". We then see members of the jury with tears in their eyes. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, a girl comes out shouting "It's free! It's free!". Wait a minute! Do juries base their verdicts on their emotions or facts? Above all, because there were no scenes showing the jury that was deliberating and what they were really thinking after their emotions had vanished. I'll tell you why. They could not show the deliberation because NO JURY could absolve a man of such a crime, no matter how the final defense discussions touched their hearts. What is the message? That someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime done to them? <br /> <br /> This film should have had the courage to say that murder is NOT OK in this situation, because in reality, there would be no acquittal. But since the dollars were at stake, the directors were more concerned with saving the public's feelings than with presenting a responsible message. If people start killing as a form of revenge, those responsible for this film should be held accountable. This is a socially irresponsible film!
