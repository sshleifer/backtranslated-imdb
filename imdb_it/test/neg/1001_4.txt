I'm a big fan of both Emily Watson (Breaking The Waves) and Tom Wilkinson (Normal) and I enjoyed seeing them overshadowed by Rupert Everett (Dellamorte Dellamore) in this incredibly rather small film that had all the ingredients to be like this so much more. The too short scenes in which he portrays a languid, infinitely titled, unworthy son of a rich Lord are clear and amusing. But for a love triangle there was very little chemistry to talk about between anyone. The music was annoyingly the quality of the film of the week, and the voiceover was unpleasant and completely useless. Clearly the work of a first-time director with a limited budget who did not or did not sufficiently consider good advice. Sin. <br /> <br /> I can appreciate how the people you hate in the beginning are the ones you like in the end, and vice versa, so there's a sort of character arc, unless in terms of perception. For example, the character of Watson, despite being genuinely honest with her husband about her feelings for another man, began to scratch at me, especially when she told her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions, and more late when she simply stated that she would return to their marital apartment, without asking permission, without apology. And I went from the unpleasant character of control of Wilkinson / moral relativist to a kind of understanding of him and I really didn't want him to change (unlike his wife). <br /> <br /> This film awkwardly turned into a "Love Story" "or" Steel Magnolias "drama of the disease without informing me sufficiently of the fact, so I was left to guess absent-mindedly what the next twist would be after they were all revealed (was the Lord driving the car? The dog of the Lord?) The scene where the Lord visits Wilkinson and tells how brave Watson, the best nurse a dying boy could ever ask, Florence Nightingale has incarnated, etc. It went well until she started sobbing like a baby Good God, if you ask me, she's just another rich and crazy person with too much time available, and so she leads her hard work, providing the spouses with madness with a useless drama. Her wandering was just another way to occupy her empty life, the dying man's thing was an added advantage for her as it somehow made her work. the precedents completely above any reproach. <br /> <br /> Look, everyone would have been better off if Wilkinson had just left it for his secretary, who seemed to like it for what it was. Instead he acted like an abused dog, his open lust for his wife's affection increases with every kick she gives him. They are not anti-PC or anything else, they just didn't sound real, even after taking into consideration all the hard realities of middle age that we all tend to face. The ending for me was (and not the intention of the director I am certain) depressing. The film spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people don't join, so I didn't find any joy in the promise that their relationship would continue. I am not above wishing that my emotions are manipulated by a story, but it must be somehow plausible and not trivial. Is it asking too much? <br /> <br /> My score: 4/10
