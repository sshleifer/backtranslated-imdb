2 deadly dishonest girls remain in their Uncle Benny's beach house. Uncle Beeny doesn't like the party. But guess what? the deadly little fun girls have, yes, you guessed it, a deadly unfair beach party. If you haven't grasped the not so subliminal message I'm trying to convey. First of all, you are a moron. I'd rather see a team of jello tags naked watching the game between Bea Aurther and Cameryn Manhiem VS. Rosie O'Donnell and Jessica Tandy. This film, and I lose the term freely is just so bad. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kristin Novak and Charity Rahmer topless, Iva Singer shows her breasts and sandwiches
