This is the "Battlefield Earth" of the mini series. With few exceptions, all the disastrous ingredients that have condemned that film will follow him to the grave in the cemetery of Turkey. They are both adaptations of books with an infinite number of pages that have been turned into a complete disorder by a screenwriter and a director (in this case they are the same person.) Who clearly do not know what they are doing, they have an ambiguous messiah who in reality he doesn't deliver, as a hero (played in this case by a boy who looks like Mark Hamill but unfortunately the strength is not with him.) and a group of stupid villains who like to betray and ruin their lives for one other, both contain scenes stolen from better productions and both are cheap productions that try to look expensive with some computer animations (often badly done). The exceptions that really make it all worse are the terrible work done by the lighting guy who doesn't even have the ability to turn on the light in his living room, the camera's operation which for some reason is sometimes tilted "Battlefield Earth" mode but for the most part it is flat as a pancake, the extremely cheap and small desert set that contains only a pile of sand in the front of a desert-like background, which becomes very old very quickly because it appears in almost every scenes, and the bad idea of ​​the costume designer to try to imitate the folly of "The fifth element" fashion with the addition of the silliest hats ever made. Stupid moments to remember: 1. Every scene with guild members, which looks like MST3K observers but with stupid hats. 2. Irulan shows up at the party dressed in her butterfly dress (Why the butterflies? - was the one with the stuffed parrots in the vacuum cleaner?) With the foolish hat combined, along with a couple of guys with stupid balloon hats. 3. Paul the cabaret artist. 4. Baron Harkonnen is in overdrive, shouting "I'm alive". 5. Every scene with the background, because more recent it fits on the first floor 6. Every scene with the false religious cremonies of the Fremen, especially the cermony "water of life". 7. The battle scenes in which the same guys are killed a couple of times and the same things explode over and over again. It is much more but it is a limit of 1000 words on this, so it is better to stop before being taken away.
