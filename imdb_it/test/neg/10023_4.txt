Everything they said is already true enough when it comes to "The Prey". Endless naturalistic movie, bad acting - In addition to these elements, this is a film that can be watched for unlucky fans who, in some cases, is considered a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Jackson Bostwick and Jackie Coogan play pretty well with each other. There is also a three-minute banjo solo that shows Bostwick's skill behind the instrument. Not bad if I say so too. <br /> <br /> The last ten minutes of the "film" are his saving grace. The ending still haunts me today. This can also have a short-term advantage as a John Carl Bucheler does special effects. Some may know it from films like "Troll" and "Friday 13 Part 7 - He directed both of these films". All in all, this is not a movie, everyone will find something redeeming. In fact, at Hollywood level, this can be classified right there with one of the most amateurish endeavors of companies, but for that handful (but very loyal) fan of slasher films in the world, even bad acting and the atrocious movie of nature can be forgiven.
