This movie really hurts to watch. Not only did I not laugh once, I ended up having a severe headache. At times, I felt so sorry for the actors involved. The best way to summarize is to note that, among the sex comedies, it is probably the least fun and the least sexy of all time. I'm just sorry I can't rate him less than one. To give this a rating of one is an insult to every movie that marks two or better. <br /> <br /> Now I see that they are shooting a sequel. Feeling that someone is actually paying these people to make another film convinces me that there is too much money in Hollywood. RAISE THEIR TAXES !!! Following up on this film could very well be a crime against humanity; perhaps an international court should be convened, or U.N. applied to directors. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a really bad film. Really really.
