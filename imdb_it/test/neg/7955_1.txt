Patetic NRI Crap ..... Appeal to all those who are not Indians .... This is the WORST of Indian cinema, made from the worst piece of trash NRI ..... The plot is boring and clich√© (the way in which NRIs and Westerners see India) ..... Go away if you want to get bored to death. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the situation of widows in India before independence. Much is true even now in remote rural areas but not to the extent that it is depicted (perhaps because it is a period film) ..... <br /> <br /> There are many other Indian films directed by directors of great talent that is worth savoring. ..This is a precise lack ... Watch a documentary or look for information on the net if you are sincerely interested in the situation of the oppressed in India. <br /> <br /> I lost time.
