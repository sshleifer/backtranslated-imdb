Solo is a poor film that cannot be ignored. The acting is mostly made of wood (the only exception is Adrien Brody's performance as the creator of Solo, Bill) and the story is light enough that you will probably ALWAYS forget where you watch the movie. That said, these films speak more of the action than of the plot / acting and, as such, live or die by the action-pieces - which is the point of these films after all - to give fourteen year olds something to smile while adults watch real substance film. And even on this Solo cannot deliver - the little action that is there is poorly done, boring and uninspired. After watching the trailer for this on television, I was hoping for something like Predator with a robot to replace the Predaot. Instead I got a fairly lifeless action movie with an insufficiently built depth attempt, taking the message that robots can also feel. Look instead at Terminator II or Predator ... both classics that this film desperately wants to be except for the lack of inspiration or, to be honest, the budget.
