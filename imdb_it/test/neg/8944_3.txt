Early talkies based on a popular theater show. A murder has been committed and a group of people hire a medium to conduct a seance to see who the murderer is. While the lights are off, there's another murder ... so there's someone in that room. <br /> <br /> The following is a mysterious, murderous and obscene murder. Most of the cast looms over ridiculously. They act like they're on stage (where you have to overdo things) and it looks silly on the screen. Most embarrassing is Bela Lugosi (two years before "Dracula"), who REALLY upsets her as a police inspector. Tod Browning's static direction (which has always been overrated) does not help. <br /> <br /> Only for the Browning and Lugosi completers. I give him a 3.
