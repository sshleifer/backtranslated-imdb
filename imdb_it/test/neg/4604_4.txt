In Los Angeles, the alcoholic and lazy Hank Chinaski (Matt Dillon) performs a wide range of unqualified duties just to have enough money to drink and play in horse races. His main and only goal is to write and get sexy with dirty women. <br /> <br /> "Factotum" is an uninteresting, useless and extremely boring film about an irresponsible drunk tramp who works a couple of days or weeks just to get enough money to buy spirits and bet, being immediately fired at because of his reckless behavior. According to IMDb, this character would be the imaginary alter-ego of author Charles Bukowski, and based on this story, I certainly will never read any of his novels. Honestly, if the viewer likes this theme of alcoholic couples, it is better to look at the moving and touching "Ironweed" by Hector Babenco or "Stories of Ordinary Ordinary" by Marco Ferreri based on the life of the same writer. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Factotum ?? Sem Destino" ("Factotum ?? Without Destiny")
