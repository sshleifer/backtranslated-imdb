It's not a terrible movie ... But there are monster scenes where you roll around laughing - it's not a good thing for an action / thriller. Acting is generally pretty decent for a SciFi channel movie. Barry Corbin plays a credible US senator, and Lou Diamond Phillips again offers us a decent military / police / sheriff / agent / marshal. The special effects are good, "special" - for example, the shots of the external train are very clearly a model train. <br /> <br /> Feet: A meteor hits a car stopped in the opening scene. The car breaks into flames but does not move an inch. After the impact, the meteor is in the upper part of the car's hood, impossible from the low angle where the meteor arrived. <br /> <br /> Spoilers ... <br /> <br /> A good part of the film's events is predictable, from the crash of the helicopter ("Pull up, pull up!"), to the fact that annoying people come to the end, to the classic suspension bridge over a 1000-foot gorge that awaits the train, to the sequel set at the end. <br /> <br /> The scenes that show the attacking aliens are hilarious. They are nasty, cute puppets and they move at an overwhelming speed - do you remember the Monty Python rabbit? Spoiler: in a scene four people taking a clip after a clip can't hit a single creature because they move at the speed of light. Later in the film, Todd Bridges sets up a mini flamethrower that he uses to send a number of creatures at close range. On several occasions, Lou Diamond Phillips can easily grasp creatures with his bare hands.
