Terrible. There is no way around it. A screenplay at the level of a Mexican soap opera, a choice and use of shooting locations that make the film labyrinthine and at the same time, repetitive and monotonous, with disastrous performances of almost the entire cast. The references to Tarantino's work, so poorly done, are more an insult than anything else. I suspect that it was not for the shameless and plotless exploitation of the generous curves of Matadinho, no one would have tried to go to see this film in any theater. <br /> <br /> These are the films that make me have no desire to watch Portuguese cinema.
