I seem to remember a lot of hype about this movie when it came out, but I had avoided seeing it over the years. I wish I had waited longer. Maybe this movie was fun in 1988, I don't know. I was younger then, but it didn't seem that the world was so different. Michelle Pfeiffer, beautiful as it is, is never convincing. Mercedes Ruehl not only chews the landscape, but sticks it in her cheeks like a gerbil to save for later. Dean Stockwell is as convincing as a mafia boss, as James Gandolfini is the Bolshoi's main dancer. And Matthew Modine has shown the most pronounced case of delayed puberty I have ever seen. All in all, it's not so bad that it makes you want to tear your eyes off with a melon dancer, but it's not far.
