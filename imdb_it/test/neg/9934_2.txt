I've been a rabid Star Trek fan since 1966. I still am. One thing I learned from Star Trek is that the special effects are secondary to the characters. Encounter At Farpoint fails in its mission. <br /> <br /> Superbly manufactured. <br /> <br /> POORLY directed, written, recited. A.D. Fontana really ruined this. This episode is so embarrassing that the master tape should be mastered. <br /> <br /> The first half of the first season didn't go much better.
