The most remarkable thing about "Talk Radio" is how bad it is. Caller entries all have a false script read signal. An evening with an annoying uproar at a Dallas radio station is told with the portentousness of a Sartrean look in Hell. Stone looks for an existential revelation and instead gets an unintended comedy. Whenever a caller makes a "deep" (empty) point on something, Stone pushes the camera towards the face of one of his characters while they are hit by a traumatic realization that is never revealed to the public. Bogosian overacts in everything in one of the most irritating performances ever smeared on celluloid. Undervalued classic? Give me a break.
