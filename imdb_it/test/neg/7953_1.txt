Maybe you have to be an ex hippie to fully appreciate it, because apart from outdated fashions, music and dialogue, nowadays it really has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> Four fun-loving college art students appreciate the carefree days of painting nude models and riding on motorcycles. They take acid in a scene and go to the zoo. On the screen appears a sign saying "Do not feed the animals", and suddenly they are in a cage laughing and hanging from a swing of the chain wheel (?!) An evil artist (Larry Swanson) tells (in flashback) how his artistic career was almost ruined due to a paralyzing hand disease. Send zombie henchmen dressed in black to kidnap people, then inject them with a serum that distorts their faces. He's trying to create a new form of abstract act (I'm guessing here, the details provided are a bit confusing, to put it mildly). Meanwhile, Jason (Ross Harris) is preparing to save the day after the death of his friend Scotty (Chris Martell) and his girlfriend Janet (Eugenie Wingate). I thought the zombie trick in ZOMBIE LAKE was horrible, but wait till you see it here! It is by Douglas Hobart, the protagonist of DEATH CURSE OF TARTU. A small role is played by Brad Grinter, the director of Z-classic BLOOD FREAK, which is much, much more fun than this deadly boring turkey (aka NIGHTMARE HOUSE). <br /> <br /> Useless trivia note: The 1984 The Regal video version presents the wrong cast (for THE BRIDES WORE BLOOD) printed directly on the video label! <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10
