Dictated by a subtle experience (both of life and of industry) and without cash, Sofia Coppola's first short film is almost necessarily an observation piece set on a high school campus. The cast is rather weak and does not benefit from being shot in b & w (it is difficult to distinguish the characters). Sound editing does little to help a simple story of confident teenage devotion. <br /> <br /> However, there are one or two things to note. Inamongst the inconsistent editing of the high school campus is shot with a balance of close and close shots of the aspirant. Even the modification of music creates interest and impulse (without descending into the underworld of music video). Coppola clearly made an attempt to vary the rhythm of the film. The dramatic turn is cut quickly and to the point and the second act is almost non-existent; we recognize that in reality it was played in tandem with the first, which is the point of the trope narrator-on-crutches (which is a character otherwise curiously added in that first act). <br /> <br /> Despite these notes it is an embarrassing short. 2/10
