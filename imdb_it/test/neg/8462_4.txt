this movie is not great ... but it's nice when you just want to laugh, because it's pretty ridiculous :) there are many mistakes in it and it's poor. I had this movie for Christmas like 5 years ago, but for some reason I never gave it away. I guess I like it for a rainy day even though I only watch it once a year. This is a very 90s movie, so it's really fun to see how they all dress and act. this film is good for someone young ... even if you think about it, I didn't like it much when I was 12 but this is just my personal opinion. the film was really predictable. I would have liked to have some weird twists, but I guess they were trying to be a movie for everyone. I think it was appropriate for the whole family, but Hallie's dress was a little unmodified, but certainly quite appropriate for the family material.
