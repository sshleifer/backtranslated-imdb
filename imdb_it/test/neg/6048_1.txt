I just saw ... the plot, the plot, the script makes absolutely no sense !! His Samvise is the brave part 2 (without the RING), his characters show themselves out of nowhere (without reason), his Hercules hated by everyone (nobody knows why), his Leelee Sobiesky shows his true talents (two of them), its disgusting special effects, some good actors who waste their talent (I mentioned Leelee's two talents ??) ... should I say more ??? IT'S APPROFIT, even for NBC-TV standards !!! It's just the lowest .... what a waste! by the way: how can you give this mini series so many stars ????? It's beyond me! .... Shame on you! I have to do 10 lines, so this is my last word: AVOID, AVOID, if you're thinking of buying it!
