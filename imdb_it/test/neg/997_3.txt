Writer and director Robert Downey, Sr., a pioneer of the underground cinema movement in the 1960s, satirized the New York advertising world Madison Avenue with his avant-garde comedy "Putney Swope". Downey does not limit his ridicule to advertising, but faces the black culture of the militants, the dynamics in the Hollywood representation of the race, the elite of the structure of white power and the character of corruption in every power struggle. Bold and ambitious as "Putney Swope" strives to be, he qualifies as a terrible film, made amateurishly on a string budget of shoes with an unnamed cast and humor that lacks hilarity. Everything about this film smells like improvisation. "Putney Swope" sparked controversy during his initial release with his politically incorrect handling of race and consumer culture problems. Like most Marx Brothers films, the plot is subtle, providing an excuse for Downey's anecdotal gags, many of which are terrible. <br /> <br /> The president of a prestigious Madison Avenue advertising agency dies during a board meeting. Before the body is removed, the commission holds a secret ballot to determine who will replace it. Each member understands that voting for himself is prohibited. The pure incident occurs when everyone votes for the black member of the token, Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson), since no one thought anyone could vote for him. Swope Pink slips everyone but one of the white executives, surrounds himself with blacks, packing people with the gun and renames the company "Truth and Soul Advertising". Swope decides to change the face of American advertising. Refuses to accept customers whose products are alcohol, tobacco or war toys. Swope's customers stage an exodus after becoming the managing director, and the title of actress attracts a new line-up of clients who show up in her office, dragging bags of money and being abused by employees Swope militants. Swope also uses his African American staff, ruthlessly taking their ideas after dismissing them and calling to mind a series of offensive advertising campaigns, all accepted as a "new wave" of marketing genius. Incredibly, Swope's conservatism is effective, but the agency becomes the target of government agents who claim that Swope's advertising tactics constitute "a threat to national security". The culmination of this 85-minute black-and-white comedy is the color TV spots. Unfortunately, Downey doesn't know when to cut these intelligently-initiated ads but bring them welcome. The funniest part of "Putney Swope" concerns the reports of our namesake protagonist with the President of the United States Mimeo in Washington DC (Pepi Hermine), a dwarf in search of marijuana with a Teutonic advisor of Kissinger (Larry Wolf) who makes jokes without taste as he tries to convince Swope to invent an advertising campaign for his new car, the Borman 6.
