Boring acting, weak screenplay ... the worst Spanish movie in years ... I was <br /> <br /> attracted by the (naked) beauty of Paz Vega, but as an useless actress <br /> <br /> , you almost can't understand what he is saying ... <br /> <br /> About the story there is not much coherent to say ... we have heard about it <br /> <br /> before, but as this is a "modern Carmen" we find some changes: - The French soldier is now a Basque soldier. -Merimee himself is a character in history. -Carmen is a dangerous "bandolera" in love with a famous "matador" and can speak fluently Basque ... <br /> <br /> Can anyone understand this mess?
