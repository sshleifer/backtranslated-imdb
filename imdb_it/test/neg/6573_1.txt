... One time. "Manos, the Hands of Fate". That was worse than that, a little worse: but he had one thing: there were beautiful women in negligence who tore off each other - for about 20 minutes. This has a fat 45-year-old with 3 tits and a tail, in a cellar scene cloned directly from "Star Wars". Not to mention an obese blue seductress, Uhura, with big legs and ass hanging from a kind of crazy bird costume, in this Method Acting Mess. Have you always wanted to perform in front of a "captive audience"? He must have understood the poor wretches who paid 8 dollars hoping to see another "Wrath of Khan", or at least a "Voyage Home". Captive "is right, I wonder how many people in theaters tried to cut their wrists while shouting" mommy, stop ". <br /> <br /> No question about it," Final Frontier "is not just an absolute disaster, it is a cruel and unusual punishment, this is Star Trek from hell, this is Shatner with mushrooms - or maybe the peyote.This is where no man has gone before and he wishes he never had it in the first place, or, to paraphrase a review of "Heaven's Gate:" It is as if Gene Roddenberry sold his soul to the devil for the success of a television series, and the devil is about to come around to collect. "<br /> <br /> And don't do it even get me started on a drunken Kirk and a smiling McCoy singing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" together, as if they were lovers in a sort of demented gay dream. Then we have the horrible dynamic Duo of Sulu and Chekov, who walk together in the woods ... probably en route to a Barry Manilow concert. Then there's Laurence Luckinbill in the role of Spock's brother ??? !!! Yeah, for sure! Unbelievable how these relationships that we've never heard of suddenly crawling out of the woodwork when we need a new texture. And don't forget that Spock hurtles past the air after Kirk falls from a cliff in Yosemite. Sure. He reaches Kirk and saves him at one foot from the ground. Where did you get those beautiful Rocket shoes, Spock ?!
