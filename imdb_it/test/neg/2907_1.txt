A montage prologue, obviously produced by the blessed maniacs who actually choose to distribute this thing, tries to convince us that the comical impact of this incredibly incompetent piece of nothing is entirely intentional. You don't believe it: this is for Lloyd Kaufman as Andy Warhol is for Herschel Gordon Lewis. He is so radical in his project of torturing his hypothetical public that it seems a sort of misanthropic denialist art installation, only it cannot be because it is completely devoid of self-awareness. As hateful and ugly as "Cose" or "Frozen Scream", this manages to raise the mail by recycling with an exaggeratedly bald insistence that must be seen to be believed. A Hitchcock-style analysis, for example, of the attack on the cardio girls could produce twenty changes and maybe three minutes of shooting - only the sequence lasts ten minutes! YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THIS HAS BEGAN THE LIFE AS A SMALL SUBMISSIBLE SUBJECT, UNLESS YOU HAVE REMOVED THE REPEAL THAT WHAT REMAINED WOULD BE MUCH LESS when the "demon" enters the room, it only inspires extensive, highly apathetic looks, completely empty of its imminent victims (off screen). Repeat this scenario about four times, in marginally varied settings; connect them with maybe thirty rows of total dialogues; offer actors even more hateful and lethargic than those of the classics mentioned above; and embellish with a monster made of gauze, ketchup and a yellow Spock ear, and you also have a film too shocking to refuse, a working definition of bad. I'm proud to own it!
