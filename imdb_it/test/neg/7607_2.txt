This is a student film and it's a piece of shit. I would like to use a much stronger language to describe it but then the review would not have been posted and the world needs to know, beyond any reasonable reasonable doubt, that this film REALLY JUICES. <br /> <br /> There seems to be a different ruler used to measure the early works of an already famous director. How in some ways it was brilliant that we were too stupid to understand since it finally made it now, today. I'm not buying it. The first "Bad taste" movie made by LOTR Peter Jackson's sucks and this "early work" by another famous director really sucks the same way. These "early works" are representative of everything that is disgusting, from budgets to scripts to actors, etc., Everything is the bottom of the bucket garbage. Don't be fooled by the big name. <br /> <br /> If you like watching a handful of 70s hippy puppets, pretend you can command a ship with the worst special effects you've ever seen - this is your movie. <br /> <br /> I can't f * 37449 believe that this thing won a Golden Scroll award for the best special effects. This is a joke, right? Or a joke prize? <br /> <br /> If you want to see what this movie DESIRES that a season or three of Red Dwarf was for rent, you're a smeghead.
