Not as bad as "Billy Bathgate" but close. As much as he could, Warren Beatty could not be believed as Bugsy. Every time he came out, instead of being shocked by violence, I found it rather embarrassing because he was so fake. The other actors are not doing well either. Annette Bening doesn't have exactly what it takes to play seductive women, it's better with confident characters. As many have noted, Joe Mantegna would have been better off if the script had considered him a more credible George Raft. Only Harvey Keitel came out unscathed, but then again this guy can make these films in his sleep. And Robert Beltran, with a single line, steals one of the great scenes of Beatty and Bening. With these films, I'm never sure that the director is willing to make the mob look like ordinary businessmen or come out like that. Anyway, I don't like it. These guys were murderers and no matter how much Las Vegas owes to Bugsy Siegel, I don't think a movie should be made glorifying for the boy, especially one with great studio support.
