So I rented this film hoping to learn about the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the beginning of its independence from Belgian rule. I was thrilled to be familiar with the figures involved in its history, mainly Lumumba and Mobutu. I wanted to see how the new Congolese government has tried to bring together the various groups that oppose colonial rule, the political reasons behind each one, the reasons behind Belgium's decision to give the Democratic Republic of the Congo its independence and also how the United States and the former Soviet Union were involved. Unfortunately, all my questions were largely unanswered. My belief is that this film was made by people who, through a familiar familiarity with the history of the DRC's struggle for freedom, saw a story full of drama and emotion and decided to exploit it. They then proceeded to try to put all the dramatic points into a plot, briefly filled them with dialogues, went to the set and shot them. I could be wrong, but if this is the case it is all the saddest, because then the producers must simply have become too tied to get everything in, and end up ignoring all the details in an attempt to create a comprehensive story. Whatever the reason, the fact is that the film could be a temporal sequence of statements and sentence-written facts along the screen. The film goes through every main event and tells the viewer the main idea of ​​what is happening, completely smoothing out the real details in favor of crossing the big things. For example, there is the scene where Lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by Mobutu. In the situation the soldiers have three possible points of view: one who sympathizes with Lumumba, one who slanders Lumumba, and one who is in the middle, who sympathizes and yet obeys orders. Correspondingly, there are three soldiers speaking in the scene, pronouncing lines that clearly show their points of view. So, to avoid facing the real tensions that these opposing points of view entail, the screenwriters simply inserted some random shots, other army boys showed up and ended up beating everyone. This is the reflectivity measurement of the film. Most of the time, each character simply states their basic motives, the other characters respond with theirs, and that's it. There is little to tell through actions; even the things they say are directed to the point of pain. It is hard to believe that the people represented actually acted in that way. Moreover, in the tendency of this immediacy, things like political tension between factions boil down to the simple recognition of the fact - we never learn what these factions are, what they are fighting for, their power, practically nothing except that they exist. Even the characters are one-dimensional and flat; unfortunately I do not know if Lumumba was actually a freedom fighter passionately devoted to the ideals of the Congolese unity, but after an hour or so of the film I do not trust certain to tell me. The DRC, like many developing countries, has a complex and important history, especially in the period before and after independence. But the story of these stories will not be useful unless the complexity of the situations is recognized. Lumumba fails to give proper attention to these details, and ends up telling the spectator a little less than the most general of the contours.
