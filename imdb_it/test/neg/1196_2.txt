This film was fine, but like most TV series it would have been better if it had been created for television. The best and most loved characters had only five-minute roles, while the three mediocre characters were present in the film. <br /> <br /> Unlike most British films based on television series, this film kicks off and seems to have come to a winner, but the rhythm suddenly stops when the three mediocre characters are in the real world in waiting to capture the three comedians. <br /> <br /> The film then does not go anywhere when Hillary in a room with Steve captured, Lipp disguising himself as Steve, and Geoff somehow joined the medieval period. Which made me think 'hold on? Why doesn't he need a key to enter that world unlike the characters of Royston Vasey? The medieval scene was fine, but Monty Python did it much better and, of course, more fun, with Peter Kay and Simon Pegg's cameos, both of them didn't say anything funny, Kay had a line and Pegg just got up to watch bored. <br /> <br /> What also thanked me is that they seem to forget what happened in the previous episodes as Hillary escaped the Caribbean in the TV series 2, but in the film ran away from prison, and even Lipp is a pedophile vampire that he was not mentioned in the film at all, which was also quite disturbing when he was left alone to look after the children. <br /> <br /> Have there been many holes in the plot and inexplicable situations like Geoff and the Dark escapes from medieval times to Royston Vasey? Like the 3 series it started well but, as the film progressed, it went slowly downhill and had a very weak predictable ending. <br /> <br /> It would have been better to do what Monty Python did and do all the best and classic sketches from the 1-3 series and the Christmas special, and turned it into a movie that would reintroduce the characters to a completely new audience, which cannot be asked to watch the series or buy DVDs. <br /> <br /> The best advice is to save your money and wait for it to be on television ..... Where it belongs.
