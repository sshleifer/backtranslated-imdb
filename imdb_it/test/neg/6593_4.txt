This is based on Michael's life from 1983/4 to 2004. The Flex Alexander performed well, but it didn't look like Michael. I think Michael was portrayed as a stupid person who I don't think was (even though he sometimes trusted the wrong people). I thought Flex Alexander looked Chinese when they made Michael look white. I think Latoya should be portrayed in this, she was always portrayed with her brother in the 80s. I never thought that the supporting cast resembled their counterparts. There were some things that were inaccurate Lisa-Marie Presley's son seemed about 4 in the wedding scene, even though she was not yet 2 when Lisa and Michael were married. Also, when Michael tells his mother Katherine, he thinks he and Debbie should get married if he's bringing his son, it was Katherine's idea that the two got married.
