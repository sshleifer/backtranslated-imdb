oh man, where to start ..... <br /> <br /> drop your gun to go into melee with a zombie, while holding a bitten soldier to argue to shoot him b4 he turns, then he turns and bites the person who holds him, turning his back on a "fallen" zombie, firing constantly at his chest and seeing that it doesn't work, so they shoot again in the chest, having the idea that a child has collapsed on a desk with the blood that comes out of his mouth is still fine, walking along a soccer field as if nothing was wrong, suddenly noticing that the zombie soccer team was doing everything in the middle of the field as if they had not been seen to that point .... <br /> <br /> I could go one for a few more hours, but get the point ..... Childish writing and dialogue, bad direction, horrible special effects, really sad and underdeveloped plot (haunted campus from zombies, he must get the viral host and then lose it .... two vols te), the only advantage I can find is that this does not include the clips of the real game playing the "action scenes" .... <br /> <br /> saying that you don't waste your money, but id being more upset about the waste of time, i saw it on cable and wanted the 2 hours of my life back
