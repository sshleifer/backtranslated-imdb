This (presumably) based on a true story, a TV movie about a woman fleeing the FBI and a * seriously * stupid one. <br /> <br /> First, we have Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson), a "normal man" type with a nightmare job, an ex-wife, a child he hardly sees and some cats. <br /> <br /> Then there's "Elaine-Lisa - you call him" (Tracy Pollan), an intelligent, sexy, good-looking woman whose tongue would have turned into a flame if she ever said the truth. Roger and Lisa meet when responding to an advertisement of lonely hearts. Roger is one of those poor people who can't bear to live alone, so after his wife dumps him, he places his publicity. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take long for Roger to find out that Lisa is * not * a good person, but he has no idea how to get rid of her. He doesn't even have the sense to change the locks on his apartment door after he throws it out. <br /> <br /> Go ahead and watch this if you have nothing else to do. <br /> <br />
