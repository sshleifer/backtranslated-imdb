A well-evoked 1930s setting offers much interest for a viewer at the beginning of the 21st century; unfortunately, "London Belongs to Me" has very little to recommend besides the charm of picturesque English charm. All the problems lie with the deeply blurred story. The main plot concerns the actions of the young boy Richard Attenborough, the problems he encounters and how the community in which he lives bands together to save him from the laws of society. Or something. The main problem here is that the character of Attenborough brings everything on himself and, frankly, he is guilty of almost all the accusations made against him, so it's disconcerting why the film (and all the characters) have so much sympathy for him. He is treated as a victim of circumstances when in reality he is not; and moreover he is not shown to have much remorse for his actions, worrying only about getting away with things he did not intend to do. Alastair Sim gets a lot of time on the screen in a subplot that has absolutely nothing to do with the main plot and you wonder what it does to us (even if Sim is, as always, superb). You know that there is a problem with the structure when the main plot has a constant impact against the subplot, but not vice versa. And, following a calm rhythm and careful growth, the plot disintegrates completely in the last 20 minutes with a deeply unsatisfactory and inexplicable conclusion that does not even show us if the Attenborough character has developed into all the previous proceedings. The film does not end, it stops. <br /> <br /> Acting, directing and the general atmosphere of the film can all be praised, but unfortunately the story and the structure of the piece constantly gurgle. One last point of curiosity: Alec Guinness based his performance in the hit film "The Ladykillers" in the performance of Alastair Sim in this film, in which both characters have the first almost identical scenes.
