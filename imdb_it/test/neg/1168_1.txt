My way of thinking behind the vision of this film (although it was free) was more or less out of curiosity ... slight, slight curiosity ... I wasn't so familiar with this "biographical" straight-to-video account by Mr. Gein is discovered during the opening credits that featured the horror icon Kane Hodder in the lead role. My emotions went not only from curiosity, but now from a glimmer of slight anticipation of how his interpretation of Gein would come about. Even in the credits (among the bad photos of Ed's crimes) were Michael Berryman and Priscilla Barns. "Okay," I thought to myself ... "It could be slightly funny." As the film started and progressed (slowly), my microscopic confidence (or as I call it, "micro-hope") for this film completely faded away and I was stuck with an overwhelming feeling of humiliation while feeling a bit inside looking at this pile of manure. Hodder, who is widely known and respected for his past work as an unstoppable serial killer, puts him inexorably at stake here - turning Eddie Gein from a mild recluse, to a backbreaking full-blown war machine. He hides at night, killing the cemetery keepers, his tomb-robber friend and teenage girls, leaving Plainfield in a panic as the local sheriff's department seems to do nothing to fix the dangerous situation. The MP and his mother have a lukewarm relationship that gave me a confused feeling (or that may have been the cyanide pill that I ingested halfway through this turkey). I'm not sure what the meaning of this film was and obviously the director knew nothing about the subject he was working with. There is already such an abundance of films related to the story of Gein that, unless the "Ed Gein Snuff Footage" is discovered, I no longer want to see them on the shelves. If you want a more authentic film of this nature, watch the movie "Ed Gein (aka in the moonlight) of 2001".
