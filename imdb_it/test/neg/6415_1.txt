This film has no respect for the viewer's time. It takes 15 minutes and extends over 95 minutes. To achieve this, they must use a very slow narrative and make sure that everyone runs around with frantic and implausible anxiety. The moment this film showed something interesting in the plot, I didn't care. The problem is not the acting, but the rhythm. The story is only weak. Jim Carrey is a capable actor, but his attempts to inject light humor into a serious role are out of place. His style of humor is not generic, so he presents himself as a watered-down version of himself. The number 23 causes great pain and frustration to people in history, but the justification for this is never logical. At most it is only slightly interesting. Jim Carrey has many more skills in a serious role than what this film reveals. Don't waste your money seeing this in the theater. Rent this movie if you have had trouble sleeping. If you are still fully awake after 10 minutes, then you liked it better than me. I didn't even like the lighting and the artistic aspects of the film. A lot of visual passive eye candy was launched to the viewer with lights or effects and did little to improve the already weak history.
