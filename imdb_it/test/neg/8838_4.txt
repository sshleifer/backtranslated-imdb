I saw the start twice, I couldn't make sense, and it bothered me throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> So, do it with me: Wayne (the good guy) jumps on the stagecoach, disarms the pilots (!), steals the money (?!), and takes off. <br /> <br /> Unarmed, one pilot is then killed and the other wounded by the bad guys. Thanks to Wayne, who disarmed them, and then saw them happen. <br /> <br /> Then Wayne drops the money in the dirt, saves the girl, goes to town, giggles at Yak (shame about the death boy, I guess) ... and then later says he "found" the money on the scene. And everyone is fine with that. <br /> <br /> And is he the good guy? And I'm pretty sure there weren't any small portable torches at the moment. And Bell made his first phone demo in 1876 ... were they at home then? Am I thinking too much about this? Normally, I'm happy to suspend judgment to enjoy a movie, but that annoyed me. And this is a sign that the move didn't really work for me.
