I was thrilled to see this show when I started seeing the promos on A & E. I've been fascinated by ghosts and the paranormal since I was a kid, and I love capturing "Ghost Hunters" when it's active (SciFi Channel). I tried to watch three episodes of "Paranormal State" and I only use my time to comment on it because it is so ugly and perpetuates the idea that anyone who believes in the paranormal is a credulous gullible. The "paranormal state" is beyond the mess. Dictionaries of "Director's Log" that will leave Captain Kirk to be desired. Cheese teasers that go into advertising breaks that are taken completely out of context. The whole paranormal of this show is automatically assumed as "evil" and the work of a demonic spirit. Then come the exorcists, the demonologists, the psychics ... as in "Poltergeist" one almost expects the team to leave and say "This house is clear". I really appreciate the "Ghost Hunters" approach, in which they come in to deny the claims, then take away what they can ... and they are almost always reassuring for the customer (if he finds something) that the ghost is not equal to evil. "Paranormal State" is not "so bad it's okay" ... it's just plain ugly. Was A & E not an acronym for "Arts & Entertainment"? The artistic part has long since gone and the entertainment factor is also falling.
