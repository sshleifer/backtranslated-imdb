How many monster tree movies can you see in a lifetime? Well, I'll go to a limb and say it. This movie is looked better late at night, with a pack of 12 beers, the sound turned off and you and your friends dialogue. <br /> <br /> On a Pacific island a young man was sentenced to death for collaborating with the "bad Americans". (It seems that his loving wife slept with the sorcerer and have him die, so the doc may be king). Well, he swears to go back and take revenge. <br /> <br /> Before you can shake a stick, the natri crazy go to the hut of the American scientists who shout "Tobanga come!" <br /> <br /> It seems that the young corpse did just that as Tobanga, the walking tree monster. Yes, his revenge is terrible (and so is this film). It seems that these natives cannot escape from a cumbersome tree, so it throws them into quicksand, breaks them down on the hills, etc. Shortly after the new king wants to exchange his woman or kingdom for an ax or a chainsaw. <br /> <br /> The general problems with this film are numerous. The relief of the comedy is an unpleasant woman with a cockney accent (as this film needs comedy). You want him to die at his first appearance. The protagonist is plaintive. The protagonist man is a boor. The acting is of wood (pun intended). The dialogues are rigid and heavy. The natives have Brooklyn accents. The monster costume is pure giggle. <br /> <br /> Although this is a bad movie, it's still fun to watch. Gets a 3 on only involuntary laughter Your dog can only rate it a little higher, but only if the tree was not mobile.
