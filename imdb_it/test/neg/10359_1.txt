I read the positive comments on this film. I assume that the people who were in this film have to come to this site to give them a good press because this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I always watch the whole film, despite the quality or lack of what explains why I watched the whole movie, but I don't think I once laughed during the duration of this movie. The jokes were mostly very bad, but when the lines had some promise, the delivery was off. If you liked it, maybe you should fire your buds because you need to keep the 5 or 6 brain cells you have left. This film had a mediocre script, bad acting, bad direction, weak storyline ... nothing of virtue and it wasn't funny. If you haven't seen this movie, don't do it.
