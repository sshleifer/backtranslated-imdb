Why did they unleash this movie on us? It seems as though they had decided to make this film a total slap in the face of Anne Rice and every self-respecting fan of Vampire Chronicles. Ignore the basic work established by Interview with the Vampire, mutilating the plot of the novel and Stuart Townsend stumbles drunk. <br /> <br /> Stuart is NOT our Lestat! Our rascal prince, our adventurous rebel with the most humble sense of humor. Stuart It is a second course, a boring cheat of Dracula in black leather. He hasn't read the books or knows the character ... is he illiterate? Tom Cruise is dyslexic and still made a point of reading books and knowing and loving Lestat. <br /> <br /> Don't joke, it's not a "Stand Alone" vampire it's simple and simple garbage.
