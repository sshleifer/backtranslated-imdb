My mother and I went to see this film because my brother is serving in the United States Peace Corps in the same region where it is set. In the middle of the film, I decided that given its failure to measure what it claims to accomplish, the title is pretentious. The subject matter could have been an excellent documentary, but due to its poor performance, it left me much less educated on the issue than I had hoped to become. I agree with laura-jane of Canada ("Powerful message but lacks attention"). I also agree with the user who commented that the narrative free style of this director is the opposite of that of Michael Moore, but I do not agree that he presents different points of view and invites the viewer to decide for himself same. I agree with the comment of a user that "a lesson is best learned when conclusions are drawn on their own"; however, our conclusions can be nothing but poorly founded if we are presented with little relevant information from which to derive them. <br /> <br /> The main points of the documentary seemed to be that 1) Africans who live near Lake Victoria are very poor and suffer a lot. 2) The introduction of perch on Lake Victoria, inflicted by Europeans, has ruined its ecosystem. 3) The communities surrounding Lake Victoria are financially dependent on the perch economy. <br /> <br /> The best things I can say about the film are that it has attempted to relate the perspectives of the average people in sub-Saharan Africa, which, unfortunately, is an anomaly between the films, and that has attempted to portray poverty as the result of a dysfunctional economic system rather than a universal, inevitable phenomenon. I liked the irony that he captured in the huge amount of fish that leaves the country in the face of a famine. I appreciated the U.N. assigned to the region was with people. Like almost all documentaries that do not have the word "women" in the title, this film fails to do a good job representing the voices of women - most of the interviews made are that of men. <br /> <br /> Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to catch some key points that I might have missed, but I failed to detect Sauper's theory of the relationship between the introduction of perch to Lake Victoria and unfair living conditions for Africans living near the lake. Also, I could be wrong, but I was struck by the fact that Sauper could do well to improve his interviewing skills. Not only the questions he asked and the answers he included seem to be arbitrary, but he seemed to have a real ability to make the respondents awkward and uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The most compelling development of the film is the suggestion that the export of perch now works to mask the import of weapons and that the real economy that lurks on the Tanzanians is that of war, not of fishing. Unfortunately, Sauper avoids conducting a thorough exposure of the idea (or at least extending the interview to the journalist who seemed to know what he was talking about regarding the importation of weapons) and comes to terms with an approach "decides for you ". <br /> <br /> If Darwin's Nightmare was meant to dispel the myth that the first world exploitation of the third world gives them "the possibility of a better life", they have not done a good job. Had it been designed to describe how the arms manufacturing industry in the United States and Europe is responsible for many armed conflicts around the world, it has not done a good job of it. If he wanted to represent what drives people to prostitution, it was not a good job. If it had been designed to throw light on the incapacity of the U.N. to complete his mission, he did not do a good job. If you meant to say that the meager income that Tanzanians earn from the roost is not worth the human cost of tinkering with mother nature to create a profitable product, it was not a good job. If it meant that Tanzania would be much better if the Europeans never came, it didn't do a good job.
