Well, I noticed that IMDB didn't offer information on the plot ... it's because you can't do it without looking cowardly and disgusting ... because that's what this movie is ... VILE AND DISGUSTING !! I looked at him because I am a huge fan of Chris Noth, whom I met in person and he is a good guy ... but if I ever meet him again, I will have no problem asking him for whatever caused him to act in something like that terrible He plays a former child prodigy who is now a brilliant doctor, who spends his free time running on small children with his car, with the intent of mutilating and paralyzing them ... this is not a "spoiler", because all this it is made very clear from the beginning ... quite nauseating ?? Oh, it's better ... he's manipulated into doing this, by his incestuous sister, who threatens to withhold sexual favors from him if their latest victim can't die ... even Clive Barker couldn't write anything so horrible. Please, if you want to see Chris Noth in something worthy of his talent, rent "Teddy Roosevelt and The Roughriders"
