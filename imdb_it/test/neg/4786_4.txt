It seems that people are attracted to shows that show pathetic lives without purpose. For me, I confirm my sincerity to NBC for the terrible efforts made to bring new changes to the television, making the free shows laugh. They always seem to find great success, like The Office. When I started watching, it seemed like it could be potentially a big hit. But after a couple of episodes, I really felt like going to church and donating every penny across my bank to pathetic people presented in these petty, poor, shameful areas. And in the end where they show Earl and his brother in bed together, it seems to me that this show is trying to show the negative side of life, like street beggars or people struggling to pay rent and have no sense of what the they are the real world of normal people in society. I always seem to be disgusted when I look at the filth where people live on this show. It's like Venice Beach in California, beautiful but so many hobos. Believe me, I'm not a rich, middle-class guy, or even a delinquent, a little sloppy maniac, but it seems to me that the show can't get away from all the gruesome and gross people out there who have a leg. I just hope they show a little more class, not all the dirt and poverty and the trailers and just below average life, it just seems to depress me. For me this show is nothing but a showcase of what not to do in life, what not to be. He also shows me that education is the most important thing you can have because apparently these two don't have an ounce of intelligence. This is a schmuck-u-mentary.
