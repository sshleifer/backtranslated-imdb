It's a kinder and kinder Cyborg movie with a love story. Awww. It's not as bad as it sounds. The action, when it's there, is decent and Jack Palance, Elias Koteas and Angelina Jolie are always reliable. Is it the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible film by Jean Claude Van Damme, or is he the caper of the Masters of the Universe trilogy? I'm still confused about this. However, there was really no need for this film. What was needed? Angelina Jolie. She could play a killer robot who can explode in the mid-coitus, but what a way to go and even if this is her first film, she still has the presence that earned her a prize.
