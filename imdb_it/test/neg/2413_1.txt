So I give him a star for the real quality, but I'd give him an eight and a half for pure enjoyment. An incredibly strange hybrid of sex comedy and vigilante thriller, "Young Warriors" is just the kind of ugly movie that one hopes to find when rummaging around marginal video, yet so rarely. Start with about half an hour of extravagant hi-jinx, jokes about sex and juvenile cheating (including an olive in the martini joke that must be seen not to be believed). Then the main character's younger sister is raped by a group of dark motorcyclists (a questionable scene that prevents me from giving this entertainment value 10 - rape is not entertainment!), And the main character gets the rest of his brotherhood sex brothers to help him in the quest to clean up the city, find the responsible motorcyclists and kill anyone who is a little criminal they meet along the way. <br /> <br /> It's fun, non-stop fun, apart from the same unpleasant rape scene, and it's essential for viewing any serious fan of the bad movie. Trust me - I've spent my time on these things, and this is one of the best. Highlights include a wonderful visit to the library, a large shaking shot in a sleazy bar (with a photo of a guy who smashed his foot which is quite impressive), a couple of decent actors (Richard Roundtree, Ernest Borgnine), a pair of recognizable semi-famous faces (Lynda Day George, the screaming queen Linnea Quigley) and a couple of relatives of famous people (Chuck Norris's brother, Mike, a member of the Van Patten James clan). He also has one of those big "What have we become?" type fine moral lesson, even if the turning point comes when the vigilant confreres shoot down a couple of children by robbing a shop with a toy gun. I always wondered why that was the catalyst that made the hero think; after all, whether they were kids and not hardened criminals, and whether or not they had a real gun, they were actually still robbing a store, so as far as I can tell, it was just another job well done for our vigilante brotherhood guys, right? Wonderful stuff Highly recommended, don't blame me when you have fun with yourself.
