The worst Wrestlemania ever. <br /> <br /> This didn't need to see attacks and many bullshit. This took place in Las Vegas and the WWE made the employees dress like Egyptians! They even changed the name of Howard Finkels to Finkus Maximus, which probably means nothing. The sight of seeing Jim Ross in that terrible suit still gives me nightmares until today and I'm 21, so you can imagine it when I was 7! Bobby Heenan was still fun. <br /> <br /> The games included The Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzales in a poor ap * s match, The Headshrinkers against The Steiner Brothers in a useless match, Doink vs Crush in a comedy and a boring match with Razor Ramon vs Bob Backlund. Hulk Hogan collaborated with Brutus Beefcake to fight Money Inc. It was clear that Hogan had a black eye. For the purposes of the plot, Ted DiBiase and IRS beat Hogan while playing poker or something in casinos, which is a poor plot, but in reality, Macho Man Randy Savage hit Hogan because Savage thinks it's like The Hulk) no not the wrestler but the character of the film. <br /> <br /> The main event consisted of Bret 'Hitman' Hart facing Yokozuna in a game of the very boring main event. Mr. Fuji threw the salt in Hart's face and Yoko won, but not before Hogan came down and crushed Yoko in 21 seconds. <br /> <br /> Overall grade - E
