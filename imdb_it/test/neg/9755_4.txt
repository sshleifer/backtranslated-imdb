Step Up is a fair dance film about some guys who get their big performance break. The film is average in every way with little more for the viewer. An athlete fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an experienced partner and a teacher who sees something special. The acting was fine, but the dialogue and direction had little to add to overcome a predictable story. Nevertheless, you still feel pretty good about the outcome of the film. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that were a bit exaggerated. This is a class B + movie with moderate continuity errors and dialogue setbacks. The scenery was good and the characters were true to life. It is worth looking at if you like that kind of movie.
