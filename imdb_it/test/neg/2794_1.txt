Don't take this movie seriously, rent it out with some people who want to play Mystery Science 3000 and you'll probably cut yourself to pieces. Bad guys aren't that scary, it's funny, it's like a seventh grade guy with a scythe in a scarecrow getting up. Acting is hilarious. I love the occasional self-torture with a poor horror movie and that really made me giggle. I recommend it on this basis. Of course recreational drugs will improve the experience. Oh, there is a naked group swimming scene, which will allow some stardust on the 5-star system. The black male is hit badly, but continues to joke and to use the injured part of the body quite easily. Enjoy this complete and total shame for the movies.
