Are you kidding me? This is probably the worst amateur movie I've ever seen. The casting was horrible, the acting was worse than horrible and I'm sorry, the boy at the speed of the picnic who loaded his plate full of food was somewhere useless and the demonic asshole and the chamber pot that they were chasing Drew was nothing but comic. When I joined Bell Witch, I wanted to believe. I read some publications and thought that a plausible story was possible. But this movie just destroyed it. Ric White (director, screenwriter, leading actor, etc.) He takes himself a little too seriously and I think he gives himself a little more credit than he deserves ... Do yourself a favor ... skip this.
