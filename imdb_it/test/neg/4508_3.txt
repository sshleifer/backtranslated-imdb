Victor Good as the devil? Surely someone had to be drunk when that decision was made. This is not the worst part of this silly mixture of various haunted house devices, but it gets my vote for being the funniest part of it. Although the film is not terrible at all, it doesn't even come close to the other "haunted house" movies of the 70s such as Amityville Horror, The Changeling and The Legend of Hell House. Evil can be fun in places, but don't expect to be afraid. It is best dealt with for what it is: a silly horror film made all the more foolish by its too serious approach.
