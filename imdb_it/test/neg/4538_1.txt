This was a bad film that tries to be funny in a dark way, but it's not funny at all. Say at a film festival in Chicago. That's exactly what the title says and I just didn't do it at all. The bad narrative was what it contained. If I rewrite it and get it back, it "could" work. This attempt fell into the "hole". Horrible movie.
