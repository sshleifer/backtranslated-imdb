Hi, when I heard that this movie was a NATIONAL LAMPOONS I thought it would be great, but I really had a say that it was a disappointment. I've seen most of the movies they made, from Christmas holidays to van wilder, and this movie is the worst movie in their name, really bad actors and a very intense movie. this movie is probably good to see if you watch it with a crowd of people who are upset and have the ability to laugh, but if you're in a good comedy like me, I don't suggest this movie, I'd rather watch van wilder a second or third time, rather that watching this movie ... you've been warned.
