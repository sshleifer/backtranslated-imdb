This is an honest film, good for a unique vision. The plot itself is pretty well done for a picture of this kind that is a pleasant surprise, as is acting, which although a little friend, is better than normal for these types of movies. <br /> <br /> the effects are exhilarating - a translucent giant and a brash polystyrene / papier-mache hand that sway unconvincingly on a wire. <br /> <br /> Definitely to look at once for the value of kitsch entertainment. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
