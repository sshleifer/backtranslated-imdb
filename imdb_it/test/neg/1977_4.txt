I give this movie a 4 because I'm a passionate fan of the video game series. the graphics and animation are excellent and it's nice to see the whole gang in CG Sephiroth is still cool <br /> <br /> now the reasons why it has only 4 good characters feel like wooden boards with some of the worst acting voices I've ever seen (I've seen epic movies) <br /> <br /> the film seems so cloud-oriented as to make even the embarrassed fans from the cloud and cloud cloud. clouds mentioned so much that you want to not see it in this movie <br /> <br /> the bad guys have the prize for the worst villains ever (I was more scared by the wicked witch of the west) <br /> <br / > all the other characters in this film are simply put in the film for a nod to the fans and don't push it beyond that <br /> <br /> with the chally coolness ??? <br /> summary: waited 9 years for this film and this is what I get a great scene of useless and boring cut I beg the head of Cenix square to shoot the man responsible for this burning of every copy of the film and any one involved in it and create a new movie from the ashes (it would be nice to make the film into action live and based on the original game)
