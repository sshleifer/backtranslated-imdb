This film is absolutely terrible ... Definitely a bull story and even worse acting. Too bad Charlie Sheen is involved in something similar since he's a decent actor and has made a couple of really good movies. <br /> <br /> The special effects are the standard of "team A" with the classic machine shot and then flips with a small fireball under the hood. <br /> <br /> Obviously the enemies are portrayed as total idiots and die faster than they can say '-Die bad Americans'. <br /> <br /> Unless the braindead movies are a game, don't spend 113 minutes of your life in this junk. Take the "Platoon" or "Apocalypse Now" instead.
