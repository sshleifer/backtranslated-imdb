My only reason for joining this site was the opportunity to write a comment on this film. I felt that I had to get rid of some of my anger by writing to myself. <br /> <br /> The movie "Babas bilar" must be just the worst movie I've ever seen. I truly believe that the script may have seen being able to become a pretty good movie or at least OK, but something happened on the line somewhere. What makes it even more strange is the fact that the cast seems to be quite good on paper. Put both scripts into practice and the cast fails to deliver. There are many actions, many things happen and you can't help but wonder why it happens. And then the cast, the actors make so little effort that you almost feel like crying. <br /> <br /> If you have a lot of time, I'd say you can see it. If not, don't do it.
