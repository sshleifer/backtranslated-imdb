Hitchcock is a great director. Ironically, I mostly find his films a complete waste of time to watch. I admire Hitchcok on a purely visual and technical level. <br /> <br /> First the positives. Hitchcock invented the notion of the test chamber. The curious eye that is able to retain or seek information. It is not exactly a new visual grammar, but it was revolutionary. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Hitchcock has practically perfected the thriller and the chase film. It has an economic style and always thinks of the public. It gives them regular chills, jolts of humor and regular shocks. In short, it anticipates the basic needs of the public and sounds like a violin. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic needs of a human being are mostly stupid. Food, sex, the thrill of danger and a small comedy. Hithcock meets all these demands on the screen, with the exception of food, which, judging by its size, adapted to the screen. <br /> <br /> It is this indulging the public that sabotages most of its films. A second negative aspect is that most of the work with Hitchcock's camera and visual grammar is now commonplace. What allows his films to be glimpsed is the simple economy of his stories, the intelligence of his work with the camera and his ability to create action tensions. <br /> <br /> Then on "Saboteur". This is a cheerful game in the vein of "The 39 Steps". Jump from one sequence to another until it ends with the typical Hitchcock final action movie. <br /> <br /> Emotionally, the relationship between leads is not up to Robert Donat and Madeleine Caroll in "The 39 Steps". So the whole story lacks some energy. The plot simply sounds like a machine, desperately dependent on the addition of new scenes. And new scenes only bring us closer to the end, since it is not clear if the hook is the hero's escape from the police, from the villains or from his action to stop the traced sabotage. <br /> <br /> There are the usual Hitchcock logical flaws. For example, a guy with handcuffs gets rid of using a car ventilation belt, etc. (Why don't you just go by car?) Are the handcuffs not so restrictive? He is able to swim in them, after all!) <Br /> <br /> If you want a Hitchcock propaganda film better than the 40s, I suggest you watch "Foreign Correspondent". They are both stupid pursuit movies with a catchy ending, but "Foreign Correspondent" makes great use of umbrellas and tulips, something that Spielberg does well in "Minority Report". <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 - Some good set pieces. In addition, however, there is nothing to sink your teeth into.
