This film is one of the worst examples of hype. People who read IMDb comments may be tempted to see this total waste of time, as I was, from false lines like "A return to the horror of the 80s" and what not. This film sucks, from acting to directing to history. Horrible, across the board. And I really like horror movies, I'm not at all snobbish. This has sucked. For reference, I loved The Grudge 1 and 2, Black Sheep, Planet Terror, Texas Chaisaw Massacre The Beginning, The Others, The Ring, Jason X, Slither, Planet Terror, and really hated The Ring 2, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (re- do) Wolf Creek, The Hills Have Eyes (re-run) Hostel 1 and 2, and this movie. Gore does not trump fun or originality.
