This film makes "Glitter" appear as "Schindler's List". Tarantino and the Weinsteins really need to consider more carefully before putting their names on a product. Green lighting at P.O.S. so, regardless of the friendships involved, it's just bad business. Larry Bishop must be kept away from a camera at all costs. Bishop writer / director / producer / actor shows that his skills are inadequate for any of these jobs. A vanity project that went south, "Hell Ride" usually allows good actors to chew the scenery ... at least when the camera is not centered on Bishop's weak attempts to steal every scene he finds himself in. (Which is pretty much EVERY SCENE!) My last three words on "Hell Ride" are STINK, STANK, STUNK.
