* spoiler alarm! * gives me the courage that some people have to redo (and I use the term freely here ..) good movies. in the American version of this Dutch thriller, someone decided that the original ending wasn't quite pasteurized for the American public. so what do they do? create a new one! a fool, unlikely, I-fake-I'm-dead-but-come-to-life-so-good-boy-can-kick-my-butt-some other kind of ending. do yourself a favor and get the original one
