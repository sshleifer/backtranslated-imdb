"The Final Comedown" wants to "say something" about racism and violence in urban centers; unfortunately, the message is invalidated by the nonsensical script, amateur production and heavy controversy. How much does it weigh, ask? To give just one example, a black doctor comes out of his hiding place, unarmed, with his hands raised in the air, ready to surrender to the police: one of the policemen (all white) says "Don't shoot him, he's a doctor", to which a another policeman: "So what? He's still a *****", and continues to shoot him in cold blood. The policemen are portrayed as ignorant and racist assassins, even if in the end there are as many deaths among them as they are among the blacks who staged the revolt. And this whole event was somehow meant to "raise awareness" of whites about black demeaning treatment, when in reality something like this can only generate more hatred and violence on both sides. Pamela Jones, like Williams's girlfriend, briefly turns on the screen with her smile and her body, particularly in a tender sex scene, and elevates the rating of this movie from 1 to 2 out of 10.
