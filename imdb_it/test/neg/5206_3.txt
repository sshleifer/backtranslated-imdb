I liked the movie, it's just that the characters run without any real point of their madness. As I was saying, poor goat. The goat was stupid while the boy pretended to grind on it. I would have liked the scenes of the rape to be more graphic (not the one with the goat). Jane Ryall who played Celia only made this film. He was completely naked everywhere. This crazy couple who killed and tortured many people ended up in their rightful places. I almost forgot about the couple of gay transvestites who were chosen to be sinners. If you like crazy things, then this is your movie. 3/10
