Everyone knows the so-called plot, so let me go to the point. <br /> <br /> The forced frivolity. Fluctuating artists who work hard to have fun and have fun. The brilliant Meryl Streep makes a big attempt. Pierce Brosnan is simply embarrassing. Inexplicably set on a Greek island. Many screaming and screaming women. Very. <br /> <br /> It was a stupid musical on the juke box on the stage, now it's a big, splashy, very little juke box musical. If you like ABBA, so-so. Otherwise, an assault on the senses and an insult to whatever intelligence leaves you when you exit the theater. I readily admit that I didn't really want to see this movie and I went with some friends who did it, but for the love of God. Why does my genre scream and scream to convey joy? Do you ever sit near a table of women who have drunk too much and are absolutely determined to have a GREAT evening in the city? This is the feeling of this whole project. I felt so good when he stopped.
