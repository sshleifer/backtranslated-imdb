Not finding the right words is everyone's problem in this urban vaudeville-type comedy. They don't know what to say, and they don't know how to say it, and that's why they embark on the potentially humiliating undertaking of pre-established speed appointments. Unfortunately, they all present themselves as cardboard characters rather than real people. The story follows a conventional structure in three acts: to know the cast of considerable size in their miserable singles, the real circuit of appointments, and a final stretch of romantic fallout, which shows some of the follies of newly found couples. Because it's all so predictable, I would say that as a narrative, "Shoppen" is a failure. As a comedy, most of the time it's too stupid to be really funny. Congratulations to Kathrin von Steinburg. It stands out from the soap opera crowd as the detached and independent Miriam. Special makeup also on her (Verena Wei√üert): the heavy eyeshadow meets the skin-colored lip gloss, creating a meditative and bohemian effect, yet feminine. Congratulations also to Stefan Zinner as the Bavarian love machine and Tanja Schleiff as the hot nutritionist. They ignore the challenge of communication through the timeless body language of copulation.
