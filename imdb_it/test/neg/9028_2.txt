This film is a big disappointment. Director Vicente Aranda has provided many interesting films during his long career, some of which have been highlighted by the strong and powerful interpretations of Spanish actress Victoria Abril. JUANA LA LOCA, also relies on a talented actress, newcomer Pilar Lopez de Ayala, but this is barely the only positive element in an otherwise terrible mess of a movie. While Lopez de Ayala tries to portray Juana as a romantic and passionate young woman, completely obsessed with love for her handsome husband, she seems to have been unable to develop her character on this one-dimensional feature; Juana was an important figure in Spanish history, and the politics of that time was essential in his plot ... but here she is presented as a romantic protagonist from a soap opera; this is a real pity, and the film is a missed opportunity to show how personal lives can influence history and vice versa. Worse still, the Italian actors Daniele Liotti and Manuela Arcuri are turning into real bad performances, which, in the case of Liotti, is a real problem while portraying Felipe el Hermoso, a key role in this story. It seems like a clear choice to attract a young audience, as both seem to be top models of this era. On the other hand, talented actors like Giuliano Gemma and Rosana Pastor are completely wasted in supporting clearly underdeveloped roles. Even though it was a big budget movie, little attention was paid to bringing a good script or creating "vintage pieces" on the screen. The costumes are particularly grotesque in some group scenes, as if they were taken from stock material, regardless of true coherence. All in all, the main problem with JUANA LA LOCA (and this is what makes the difference with historical films far superior like LA REINE MARGOT or ELIZABETH) is the lack of a director's point of view. This is a strange turning point in Aranda's career, since he was able to develop it in other works (LIBERTARIAS and AMANTES come to mind), creating very personal and interesting films, while this JUANA is nothing but a routine historical academic .. and not very good!
