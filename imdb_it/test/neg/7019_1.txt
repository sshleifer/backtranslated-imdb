For starters, I really love Lucy. His television program still makes me laugh. He was one of the greatest comedians who ever lived, right there with Chaplin and Keaton. But his performance in this film is disappointing. It was too old and the gauze filters on the lens make it look like a London mist refugee. He couldn't sing, and his voice was so jagged that she croaked through every song. His dance days were long in the past. Just because you are a fan of Lucy, do not ignore this wrong and sad performance and sing its praises. I prefer to remember Lucy in her wonderful TV series (I Love Lucy) and draw the curtain of charity on the terrible mess of a movie called "Mame".
