This movie stinks. IMDb needs negative numbers in its evaluation system to properly evaluate this turkey. The acting is in wood or over the top; the film apparently was NOT written by anyone in particular; and the monster scenes were mediocre at best. Even as a film driven solely by monster scenes, those shots were so disappointing that they could not inspire any sympathy for the rest of the film. I want the 80 minutes of my life that this movie has stolen.
