This film was so bad, so cheap and so mushy, that I found this movie one of the most boring and slow movies of the 80s I've ever seen. I like the economic horror films of the 80s, but I would never take it again. It just didn't make any sense. A family living in the woods invites their son, his wife and their daughter to spend time with them for the holidays and during the film, for some reason, the mother and daughter-in-law don't get along. We never understand why until almost the end of the film, but until then, all we see is the fact that the mother has some form of ESP and the daughter-in-law is having nightmares and flashbacks of a catastrophe of what will happen to the unfortunate victims of this "thing" that we have no idea of ​​how "everything" is, everything we see is a bright light that signals its approach and everything we hear is an economic interpretation of the voices of Darth Vadar and a soundtrack stolen from various horror movies. Then when we finally find out what and who is all I did was laugh. This "killer" turns out to be a sort of alien Japanese warrior of World War II who seems to have come back to life to claim his mother and his family. And all the mother does is there in front of the living room to shake with her hands on fire or something as if she were going into a kind of convulsion. This movie is pathetic! Avoid it, it's not even worth renting.
