My wife and I have observed this abortion from the beginning. I hated it right away, but my wife was fascinated by it for a couple of years. For me it has only gotten worse and worse and the characters have all been undoubtedly dark and depressing without any saving features. Then my wife got tired and we stopped looking completely. Occasionally I take a clip or step while navigating the channel. There is always someone screaming at someone else or doing something terrible. There never seem to be lighter moments or happiness of any kind. This has always been my main problem when we first looked at it - no humor. Writers seem to have no idea of ​​the drama: they seem to think that conflict is drama, and of course this is only one element of it. Light and shadow are desperately needed and actors can bring us something. I'm sure Eastenders' actors are competent but have nothing to work with. It must be the most depressing acting job in the entertainment world. I can't understand why the British public looks at him and adores him. What the hell does it say about our psyche? I have heard that it is "just like real life" - it has nothing to do with my life or the life of anyone I know, otherwise we would throw ourselves out of tall buildings or by public transport. The themes he deals with are far from the observation of the family, but are still shown as a pre-divide. I love series like Breaking Bad or The Wire but I wouldn't expect to see them at 7.30am or 8.00pm. The program is trash written in large and should be avoided at all costs.
