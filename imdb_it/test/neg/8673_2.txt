... when we all know, nobody likes the BBC. <br /> <br /> Being an avid fan of this species on a Sunday night watching, I couldn't wait to do it. How disappointed I was! In the first thirty seconds I didn't think it was promising and after two minutes I was struggling to look. <br /> <br /> However my friends and I only insisted on finding a bad acting and a complete misunderstanding of half of the characters. The plot was rushed to the extreme and the makeup and costumes are gorgeous and the 21st century in 'bbc robin' style. This modern style may have been able to be positioned within sharp camera angles and visually sumptuous cinematography, but unfortunately we did not get either. The direction was decidedly sloppy both for the acting and for the choice of the shot. <br /> <br /> After 30 minutes we couldn't find out and we went out and rented "The Prestige" (which is very good) Maybe it's unfair that I judge this because I saw so little of this, but I rarely got felt so obliged to warn people not to look at something! However, my friends and I thought that the house and the umbrellas were beautiful, but this is the maximum.
