This is really a re-make that should never have come out of the barn. It has two casts that act in completely different layers. At the top of their game are Joan Plowright and Maximillian Schell. Every shade of the Franks is in plain sight. at the bottom there are Melissa Gilbert and Doris Roberts. I can't imagine how Schell and Plowright can sound so good when Gilbert and Roberts are doing their anti-magic. Gilbert ruins all the scenes in which he finds himself. It is as if the father was the best in the ghetto. It's a light from Ann Frank. His race for Helen Keller was subtle but not terrible. This is a sacrilege. Doris Roberts makes Mrs. Van Damm simply annoying. It is a totally inappropriate choice to play the sexually hungry woman whose flirtatious and unsatisfied presence has caused so many problems in Acherhuis. This had to be interpreted by a woman who could convince us that she at least remembered how voluptuous she was. Its weight is not the problem. Joan Plowright could have played this part beautifully. Roberts was at the peak of his career when it was done, receiving a lot of publicity and many opportunities. His performance here shows his weaknesses as a shameful actress. <br /> <br /> James Coco and Clive Reville, have most of the scenes with Gilbert and Roberts, and, although they are strong, they are completely unable to undo the damage done by their partners. Reville is an astute actor capable of the iconic kind of performance given by Ed Wynne in the original film. He does not get support from Gilbert. She unloads color from every scene. <br /> <br /> I read with dismay the comments of those of you who grew up watching this version, full of attachment to these performances. It is a lesson on how the version you see attaches you first. It makes me reconsider my attachment to some inferior products that I loved in my childhood. I encourage you to look at the original. It has very few weaknesses and the head and shoulders above this mess.
