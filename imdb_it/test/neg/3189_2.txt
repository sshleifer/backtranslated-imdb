One Night at McCool's wants you to think it's a smart and fashionable black comedy. He pushes his "extravagant" characters and "outrageous" situations to the viewer like a crack that does extraordinary things. The premise speaks of a woman who digs gold, named Jewel, who makes an appointment with men to force them to steal and sometimes murder, so that they can have all the worldly possessions they so desperately want. You know, this would not be a bad strategy if you chased the rich. This film really wants us to believe that a foxy with an artist can waste time with bartenders and Andrew "Dice" Clay. Please. The important flaw of the Jewel scheme is actually the only entertainment found in this skunk (and is not intentional). Looking at it, it's not hard to believe that there could have been a good movie in it somewhere. One night at McCool he just couldn't decide which direction he wanted to take, so I sat in the middle of the road like a dead armadillo. Try to be sexy but don't take off your clothes on the camera, and the few body-head scenes are terribly pedestrian. There is a recurring scene in which a hit man is asking the protaganist (played by Matt Dillon) about how sex is with Jewel. Looks like Matt doesn't know, nor the spectators. Why was he going out with her anyway? Even One Night at Mccool wants to be fun. I'm sorry, strange coincidences and misunderstandings didn't even work on Three's Company. What's worse is that this movie really seemed to go in a dark atmosphere to accompany his play. Kind of like a Coen brothers' second-year movie, but his superficial script couldn't sound subtly, nor could his cheeky baseball bat in any shock. What remains to the public is a film that seems committed to trying to please everyone and to lose any appeal along the way.
