I have rarely given just one or ten stars to any film, but it was so terrible, I had to make an exception. <br /> <br /> I am a SciFi fan and have seen some SciFi comedies that I really like. There was really nothing that could please. <br /> <br /> I realize that this started with a very small budget from a film student. But even considering this, the sets and the effect are bad. Cinematography is mediocre, but it could be the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> Acting is bad. A sad state when the female voice for the computer is the best actor. Dialogue is bad. The script is very weak and the plot is inconsistent and almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> Humor is not only subtle and sublime; not found anywhere. For example, a full 20 minutes of the 80-minute movie is spent on a combo joke of 2 tablets with the alien mascot and the elevator. <br /> <br /> This had to be a parody of everything, from the SciFi 1950s villains to 2001. What we end up with, though, is only a slightly updated version of an old science fiction movie of the years '50. At least those movies were fun because they took themselves seriously.
