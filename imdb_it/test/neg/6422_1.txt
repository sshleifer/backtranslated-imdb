If you see this movie on TV listings, ignore it. If you're looking for something scary, you'll be better off watching the X-Files reruns. <br /> <br /> The previous comments referring to the incredibly poor acting of the female lead are dead. It's almost unwatchable. The sum total of his range includes "whining and scared" and "plaintive and not scared". <br /> <br /> I am the kind of movie buff who likes a good "bad" movie. But this is ridiculous. There is no direction. The plot is as simplistic as the number of numbers that keep throwing at you and very similar to that series of numbers, but in the end it has no meaning. <br /> <br /> Your time will be better spent if you turn off the TV and bathe your dog.
