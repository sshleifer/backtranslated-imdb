In this film everything was wrong and I don't know why I took the trouble to look at it until the end. It would have been more fun to look at the dry paint. To cry out loud I also liked D-Tox and it was much better than that. Here is the basic plot for you: a redneck is bitten by snakes that hold the evil of 13 murderers and becomes a machine to kill undead by killing teenagers who have zero personalities. During the film I lost hope when it didn't scare me at all, when the killings were bad and there was BCA CGI blood and CGI snakes. The situation worsened with the thin cardboard characters who killed their friends by holding her by her legs and not letting her go so as to be impaled by a tree and when the villain moved underwater like the shark to Jaws. I'm still upset because I even worried about this. I guess because I'm a fan of horror movies.
