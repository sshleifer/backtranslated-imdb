First it separates the story from the film. The story of a second war continues in the sky is good, very good. Religious films are not the main choice for many people, but angels are at war. I loved the story and some of the images provided to support it like the field of angels on the peaks ... fantastic images. But the real movie was just poor, I can't find any reason for the main character - the policeman-priest is in there. Even the female protagonist ... there was no reason to be there, the dialogue of the main characters was only empty, had no substance, the story could have been told well without them. Now, some outstanding performances have been staged, Walken, Stoltz and Mortensen have come up with some wings, although their scenes were mostly with lifeless leads. <br /> <br /> Another thing I don't get from this movie is the reason why Native American rituals are present to purify the dark soul. The child who bears it is clearly of Native American origin, but apart from the final scenario there is nothing here connected with that inheritance. The plot about the dark soul itself is barely told, strange considering that the dark soul is the driver for the entire premise of the film. The previous history of its original owner (the colonel) is briefly touched, but not enough to allow us to understand why his soul is that special. <br /> <br /> I can't find a justification for the scrolling shots in this film too, many of the plains around the "chimney". I had the feeling of having a helicopter and wanted to make the most of the idea that none of the shots had any relevance, nor are they in line with the mood -> Horror. The film falls into the category of science fiction rather than horror. There were no real shocks or scenes of fear, some blood and blood but no element of fear. <br /> <br /> So, apart from 3 roles played damn well, this film is a big oily. Unfortunately the dud factor exceeds the good acting factor, just too many weekend actors.
