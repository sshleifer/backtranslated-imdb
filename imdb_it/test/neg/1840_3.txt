Doll Master is an example of a horrid horror film, fallen somewhere in space with its two not-so-well-established genres, a horror film and an emotional drama. It seems that The Doll Master strives to be a very scary horror movie, but fails. The noise of the dolls as it moves is like taken from Kayako's croak in Ju-On, and the cats are like sadako esquire. The killer dolls will remind you of a cute version of "Chucky". But compared to Child's Play, this film is more superb. But the story seems nothing, the brilliant shots and the splendor of the acting have been taken away because of the plot. <br /> <br /> Don't watch it if you're expecting big shocks.
