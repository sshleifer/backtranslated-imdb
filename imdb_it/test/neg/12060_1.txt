1st watched 07/19/2003 - 1 in 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): a ridiculously lame 3D movie, which practically follows the plots of many of the 80s. Stupid kids go to a well-known homicidal camp, they are hunted by an unknown masked man, and then we try to figure out who, if anyone, will live. We don't really care who's behind the mask, but even this isn't hard to tell if you've seen one of these types of movies. What a waste of a 3D viewer, despite some pretty decent 3D effects.
