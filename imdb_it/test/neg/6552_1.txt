This piece of trash belongs to the basement of an old moldy house where it will never see the light of day again. The only scary thing about this stuff was the admission price. I enjoyed it only when the credits started running and I was free to leave the auditorium. What insensitive boredom; a complete waste of 1.5 hours. When I die, I pray that he can come back as a ghost and give the fool who wrote this meaningless fever.
