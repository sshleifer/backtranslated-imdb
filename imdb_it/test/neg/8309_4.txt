I'm from Texas, so I thought I knew big hair, but the bad woman in this movie had huge hair. Whenever he was on the screen I couldn't concentrate on anything except his hair. Get the presence on stage! There seem to be many people with hearing problems in this film. There was a traffic warden who wrote a parking ticket that somehow hadn't noticed the owner rushing to the car screaming his throat until it hit the car. Then there was a guy in a phone booth who couldn't hear a huge bulldozer coming towards him until he was 5 feet away. All the killers in this film seemed a little deaf, nobody had to hurry with them. The only "hero" of this film was so plaintive and ineffective that it was fun. The bar-fight was pretty funny. There is a priceless scene in which the hero and his girlfriend have just had sex and judging by their expressions, it was not good for either of them. It made me laugh out loud. This movie is set in the 50 martial arts of the Movie Pack if you want to see a lot of bad movies (with some of the decent ones).
