Dr. Krellman wants to save his son Julio who is dying of heart disease. He decides that a heart transplant with a monkey will cure his son (no, I'm not kidding). He does the transplant and (somehow) the son changes from a fragile man to a muscular man with a jig mask that looks like a monkey! Naturally he goes out, kills men, tears the clothes of women and causes chaos. This is all interrupted with the boring story of the police lt. Arturo Martinez and lady wrestler Lucy Ossorio. We also have senseless female wrestling sequences that add nothing to the plot. Everything ends by copying the end of "King Kong"! This is (obviously) a rather stupid film. The plot has little sense, there is free female nudity (a staple of every exploit film) and a VERY puffy graphic that seems ridiculously false (except for open heart transplantation). However this has merit. The whole cast takes it all seriously and it's not really bad as an actor. Even the dubbed in dialogue was (for a film like this) well done and interesting with a surprisingly good dubbing. Also I saw an excellent DVD print with strong and brilliant colors (which helps). We are not talking about a classic here, but an exploitative film OK.
