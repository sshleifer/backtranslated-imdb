This is probably the most inaudible film I've ever seen. I saw it because I have a weakness for Leon (everything Besson did was just horrible, in my opinion, with the exception of the script by Wasabi) and Jean Reno. It's a testament to how bad this film is that Reno, one of the most charismatic actors and without affability (I admit he has just started here) cannot make this film watchable, or the moments when it is on screen. <br /> <br /> It's all very filmed: black and white, no dialogues, people doing things for no apparent reason, people chasing each other, while in turn they are chased by a flickering camera. And predictably, none of this is fun. <br /> <br /> It is not a "French Mad Max" as some people claim (actually, I think they mean "Mad Max 2") - this is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have an environment post-apocalyptic, and it's just the kind of comment you'd expect from someone who doesn't know what he's talking about. Mad Max 2 was pulsating, Mad Max 2 was exciting, Mad Max 2 was worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is none of these. <br /> <br /> I know it should be as beautiful as the arty black-and-white French film and equally cool to say you've seen something in them that other people don't have (or you managed to sit without feeling sleepy) , which is why I wouldn't trust anyone who claims to appreciate Le Dernier Combat, because I don't see anything of value in it; he asks so much and returns nothing. I found myself drifting after about five minutes and never did anything to get my attention back. Anyone who can sedate him without distracting him is not human, or, at most, he is psychotic. (In fact, they're probably just trying to look "cool").
