Max Cash, a rental boat captain who works on the Caribbean island of San Sebastian, is hired by Sarah, who is looking for a legendary boat, El Diablo and her stolen treasure that sank into the cliff in the 17th century. But something seems to protect the fate of the ship, as the people who knew something were killed. <br /> <br /> I must agree with those who had the impression that it would be a horror feature. Instead we ended up with a deep-sea adventure film from 1977 called "The Deep", which took place in the late 1980s, with a low level of rent, but with a mysterious supernatural origin and an injection of mystery. The story is a bit confusing (so many inconsistent corners don't make a lick of common sense and encourage a spotted rhythm) and the technical side is clumsy. Beautiful exotic location and underwater photography though. Even carefree performances weren't that bad. A gruff Wayne Crawford is pleasantly witty and June Chadwick is proud next to him. Sheri Able is practically a feast for the eyes. There are some bizarre developments that entertain and one or two disturbing sequences. However, there is a real lack of cohesion. Most of the split deaths occur off the screen, except for the bloody and unassailable opening killed by something invisible. Again just another thing that leaves you up and dry. The music is generic with its jokes to warn us of the approach of danger and the POV shots get a good workout. Tatty, but watchable.
