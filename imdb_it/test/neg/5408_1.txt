Although Casper van Dien and Michael Rooker are generally demoted to the B films, they too are above this film. He can't even convey the slightest sense of excitement, fear or terror - unless you consider the terror of sitting through the rest of this garbage. The management is amateur with annoying cuts and jerky movements that hide the fact that the killer is not close to the victims when he attacks. And what a killer it is: a cheap skull mask and a black hood. I liked it better when he fought He-Man. This is one of the laziest character design jobs I've ever seen. I mean, it's Skeletor! And it's on horseback! Should this be a scary and supernatural creature? How should we take it seriously? All we get are the scenes of this guy riding the forest on horseback - he can barely stay - interspersed with scenes of soldiers shooting at random in the woods, thinking they can shoot a ghost. Occasionally, Skeletor will shoot someone with an arrow or ride and stab someone, revealing how trivial the effects are. I generally like the Sci Fi channel rate on a basic cheese level, but this movie is too inept for any level of fun. Where is Dolph Lundgren when you need him ???
