After watching the previews for a while, I couldn't wait to see Steve Martin in a play that I thought could be a keeper. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The problem was that the previews were the only fun parts of the movie. The rest of the film was practically a bunch of junk, scenes that were made to death and characters that we saw thousands of times. <br /> <br /> This film was proof that if you put enough money on the table, you can talk to someone about something. Steve Martin is my favorite, but this was a big clunker. The only actor in the film that was worth seeing was Eugene Levy; he was the best of a powerful lame group.
