Normally I like Casper in his films, a real honor for the STARSHIP tricerators. But the cover of this video of SSOOOOO drives me renters crazy. On my local video, people give it to them expecting a Borg (vampire) as a vampire, and instead gets a bad reward from Lon Chaney. It had great potential, and fell very flat. I really think I could have written a better storyline and script. Why is it in EVERY sci-fi movie, they (the cast) constantly refers to a solar system as a galaxy? Did none of these writers or authors stay awake in science class? It's my pet pevee, but a solar system is a single star with planets, a galaxy is a whole group of solar systems. It's like referring to a can of coke as a gross of six packs. Makes it even more stupid.
