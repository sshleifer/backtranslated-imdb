A scientist (George Zucco) wants to create wolf men from American soldiers to fight the Nazis, but he is branded as crazy. Use a simple gardener (Glenn Strange) to experiment mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf. Strange, constantly setting his dialogue with the tones of Lon Chaney Jr. in "Of Mice and Men", he has no idea what's going on, but only the fact that sleepwalking. The victims begin to accumulate (including a little girl, whom modern viewers might find rather disturbing, and two of Zucco's rivals). There is a good dialogue on how man should not mess with nature (still prevalent today) and play with God. Zucco's motives can be honorable, but his methods are the most questionable. And then there is his daughter, Anne Nagel, who is sympathetically friendly with Strange, yet has no idea of ​​her father's actions. Johnny Downs is a reporter who comes across the evil part of Zucco questioning him, but wins Nagel's heart, thus creating the usual and always boring romantic subplot in classic horror movies. At 77 minutes, this is about 15 minutes longer than usual for a horror movie from the early 1940s (especially one on PRC, which published this), so the romantic story could have been cut for costs and accelerated a bit 'the things . Zucco, fortunately, is never a hammam; He left it to Bela Lugosi (who has always beaten in a delightfully theatrical way that made him dear to the public) and to England Todd Slaughter. But try not to think of the "The Bride of the Monster" workshop while observing Zucco's work, or some of Lugosi's dialogues in that classic cult movie. "Mad Monster" lacks a cult that follows more because it is not deliciously bad, it has only a boring rhythm in more than a few points. For PRC and Monogram lovers, I would recommend "The Corpse Vanishes" or "Fog Island" higher than this
