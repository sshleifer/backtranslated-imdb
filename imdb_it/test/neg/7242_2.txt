The Salena incident is set in Arizona, where six prisoners on death row are transferred from the state prison for unexplained reasons, while driving along the heavily armed prison bus gets an apartment and the driver is forced to retreat from the street . Then two blond birds arrive and after having seduced the incompetent prison guards they manage to get the better of them, the six prisoners are released but in a shootout their escape car is damaged leaving them all stranded in the middle of the Arizona desert. They decide to head to the nearest town, Salena, several miles away, and take the cops hostage with them. Once they reach Salena, they find it strange that the place is completely deserted without a single person in sight. They soon discover that the entire city was killed by meat that eats aliens and they are firmly placed in the menu ... <br /> <br /> Also known as Alien Invasion Arizona in the US on DVD and apparently has the working title Terror Town, this low-budget science fiction horror film was co-written, co-produced and directed by Dustin Rikert and has no real redemption, to be honest the Salena incident is the kind of film that gives the movies a bad name. The film could be roughly divided into two parts, the odd forty or fifty minute opening focuses on the prisoners in a thriller that is heard opening up, the guards and the escape even though it is written rather badly and staged stuff. The dialogue between the two blond birds and the prison guards is so ugly that it is unintentionally funny, as the two birds in the form chat between the two imprisoned prison guards. Funny things actually, unfortunately, the Salena incident should be a science fiction horror movie, not a comedy. Then, once the escaped soldiers and hostages of their prison guard arrive in Salena, they enter sci-fi horror mode while the aliens show up and start killing our cliché character which is good because they are annoying. Look, the whole movie sucks because it's badly written, thought out and made. I can't really worry about getting into it, but trust me. The Salena Incident is horrible at every level. <br /> <br /> Besides being just a bad boring and stupid movie, The Salena Incident is also badly done. The scenes of action scenes are horrible, the aliens seem terrible and are never shown on the screen at the same time as the human character and, as such, it is sometimes difficult to say what is happening. Even the special effects are poor, the aliens seem like garbage, and even the effects of the computer in CGI are absolutely terrible. The assembly is poor, the cinematography is poor, the sets are cheap and the whole is just an eyesore. There is some blood, there are gunshot wounds, someone is torn in half and a severed hand is seen. <br /> <br /> Obviously shot on a low budget The Salena incident has low production values ​​and seems inexpensive from the beginning to the end to finish. Shot in Superior in Arizona. The acting is terrible from anyone I've ever heard of, even though the actress who plays the doctor is pretty nice. <br /> <br /> The Salena incident is a science fiction horror film that is terrible in every way, not worth 90 minutes of yours, mine or anyone else's.
