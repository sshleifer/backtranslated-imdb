The film producers hope that the name of Cameron Diaz can help sell this image. Unfortunately, nothing can save what has already been captured on the screen. Despite some wonderfully filmed European locations and some solid production design elements, the film fails mainly due to its awkward and incredible love story between Brewster and Eccleston. An elegant cinema experience.
