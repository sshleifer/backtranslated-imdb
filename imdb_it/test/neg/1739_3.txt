OK, let me start by saying that this is not a horrible movie by any means. That's no good. I remember a poster that said acting is not campy, it's just fading. No. I saw a Japanese and Asian faded acting. I'm sorry, you're wrong. This is the field. <br /> <br /> The characters are totally unpleasant, the deaths are totally random and completely meaningless. The writing is bad I'm fine with the suspension of disbelief, I'm fine with not having given me everything in terms of plot. But this film has no plot. A reviewer said: "This film is set in a small town where people go crazy for whirlwinds and spirals." This is not a problem, this is the whole movie. Congratulations, I just saved you almost an hour and a half. There is nothing else. No character development, no plot development, no explanation, no resolution. And not even the lack of "Acceptable within the realm of J-Horror" resolution. Only nothing. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the soundtrack is made by someone who obviously wasn't watching the movie at the time because it's random enough to cause whiplash. Cognitive dissonance is one thing and done well can be brilliant (see Dark Water), but here it seems that the score was designed to go along with another film. <br /> <br /> The best example I can give is as if the Japanese had rebuilt the Evil Dead without any of the clever pieces or good acting. Crolla floor. It's J-horror without the horror.
