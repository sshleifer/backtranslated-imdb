Although I rarely agree with the filmkr√∂nikan, I must say that this film was not terrible, but it didn't do anything at all ... and everything seemed to be out of place ... it had its moments ... three or four that made me sick ... but most of the time I was sitting and wondering why? why did the characters do this? even the Hot Shots characters felt more thoughtful and enriched ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good Norrlands movie, look at Pistvakt. There were more than random ethnic groups who simply shot at each other on the Swedish tundra ... I'm so disappointed ...
