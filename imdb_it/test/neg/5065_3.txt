The controversial German journalist Jutta Rabe, who was herself the successor to the Estonian disaster, put together this stupid "thriller" to save her investment. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is obviously always watchable, but it's only in three scenes. Deliver your material perfectly - as you can ask from a professional. Furthermore, the main protagonist, JÃ¼rgen Prochnov, is sometimes very good. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is, however, bad. The actress who plays the secretary of the Swedish minister (or whatever it was - does not seem listed in the cast) is EXTREMELY bad. <br /> <br /> The script has some nice ideas, and the story is actually quite interesting. However, the final script should have been rewritten a couple of times. Some scenes are simply ridiculous, especially the final scenes. <br /> <br /> The film lasts almost 2 hours, or 45 minutes too long. Presented as a 60-minute TV movie, this may have been really interesting. As a two-hour performance, it is pretentious, boring, stupid and simply silly. <br /> <br /> Jutta Rabe could be a good journalist (her ideas about the governments that use Estonia to transport military items from Estonia to Sweden were concluded as recently as the Swedish military officially declared to have actually used the Estonia ship for this), but as a film producer it sucks. <br /> <br /> The director, writer and actors suck more. /> <br /> I give this movie 3/10. I would have given a 1, if it were not for the fact that sometimes the story is quite interesting, there is Donald Sutherland and he has a real repertoire documentation. <br /> <br /> But we don't even let him see the boat sink! What kind of film about a sinking ship is that? Like a werewolf movie without werewolves ...
