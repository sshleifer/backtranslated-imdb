I was so disappointed in this movie. I know the case very well, having read not only Mark Fuhrman's book, but also the distant superior "A Wealth of Evil: the true story of the murder of Martha Moxley in the richest American community" by Timothy Dumas. Anyone who looks at Murder in Greenwich should know that they are watching the story of Mark Fuhrman, not the story of Martha Moxley. This film is nothing but an ego journey for Fuhrman. It is enough to watch his character trudge as if it were the second coming (yes, also to be observed by women). The actors who play children seem too old for their roles and the flashbacks of the 70s are absolutely unconvincing. If there is any hero in this story, it is Martha's family, his mother Dorothy and his brother John. They kept this case alive for twenty years before Fuhrman entered to make a name for himself. They, and Martha, deserve to have told the true story.
