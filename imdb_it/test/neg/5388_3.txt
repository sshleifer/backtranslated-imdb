This movie can be great, but it's a complete rip-off of Bill Forsythe's Comfort and Joy. c & j is one of the sweetest movies I've ever seen without becoming a diabetic. <br /> <br /> Okay if you like it, but realize that EVERYTHING in this film is a direct rip-off. <br /> <br /> The original is http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0087072 I can recommend almost anything forsythe - Local Hero, Gregory's Girl, That Sinking Feeling. I'd better go get some tonight. Local Has a young Peter Capaldi, and an old Burt Lancaster. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately he gave up on making a movie after a really lousy Hollywood treatment. Sad.
