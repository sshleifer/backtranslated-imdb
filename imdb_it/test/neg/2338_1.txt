I have the feeling that many people liked this film (not all people, but many of them) because they don't want to admit they don't understand it. People of average intelligence, if you will, who always pretend to be so avant-garde and fashionable that they think Lynch is a genius. <br /> <br /> Lynch, for me, is like Tarantino. Both are fantastic, but neither is the messiah that so many fans want to believe. No director can change the world, so relax. And both sometimes make success sometimes, it just happens. Everyone has a bad day. And clearly, since this film was initially designed as a pilot and then hack-jobbed in a feature film, it was not created with all the passion and foresight that should be included in a film. Admit it, much of the film is incomprehensible and incomprehensible that cannot be understood. We can come up with all the meanings, Lynch might have his point of view, but it doesn't matter. It was scattered on the screen inconsistently. Of course, the first part had the appearance of a passively interesting story intentionally twisted, but then it falters. <br /> <br /> The cowboy, the mysterious organization of men with their phone calls, the lawyers ... come on. I can almost imagine David Lynch screaming, forcing the crew to gather around him and explain to all of them "Look how crazy and weird I am! Isn't it beautiful? It's so weird and crazy!" Strange and crazy it works if it's a by-product of your style. However, he is pretentious and tired when you do everything to do nothing but that. It is as if all those Pulp Fiction midpoints came out after Pulp Fiction. Is not beautiful.
