I found the first 90 minutes of this film very interesting, although some parts were ridiculous (ie the character of Philip Seymour Hoffman). The last 60 minutes were unpleasant and I started to lose interest in the film. The last hour lasted forever, it seemed. <br /> <br /> The film is well performed and I can understand why Rene Zellweger won an Academy Award because his character was so interesting. The film is also beautifully filmed and the plot is emotional. However, I found the negative message: not surprising these days in Hollywood. In this story, "Inman" (Jude Law) deserted the Confederate army during the civil war. His reason: his girlfriend misses him and wants him at home. He is also disillusioned by the war. (Can you imagine if every soldier who was on a similar boat deserted the army in the two world wars ??!) <br /> <br /> However, in this film, of course, this is perfectly acceptable. Then again, as a liberal director have you ever had a beautiful thing to say about the US military? To add to their sinister inclination, they represent a group of vigilantes that chases deserters like cold-blooded sick killers. Well, in the film world, as we know: good is portrayed as evil and evil is good ... and only liberals portray defectors as heroes.
