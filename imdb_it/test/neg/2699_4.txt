I went to see "Stop" with high hopes, because the director's "shower" had impressed me. In spite of some falls in sloth, "Shower" tops my list of all-time favorite films for its insightful insight into family relationships and its generally superb action and direction. And I've seen it at least three times now. <br /> <br /> But "Quitting" fell flat, in my opinion. It seemed a useless exercise and I was quickly so tired of the unbearable personality of the main character that I wanted the film to end. I admit to falling asleep six or seven times, but it was only for a few seconds at a time, so I think it's still OK to write this comment. <br /> <br /> I admired parents and sister. The device to use all the real characters in the movie is a nice film I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> Disappointment aside, I will still make an effort to see any film bearing the name of Yang Zhang, simply on the base of the beautiful "shower".
