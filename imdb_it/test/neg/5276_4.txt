The German regional broadcast station WDR showed both "The General" and ODC. On Saturday I saw "The General" and thought it wasn't very bad, but not very good. But yesterday I saw ODC and turned it off after about an hour. Although Kevin Spacey was the main actor, the film was totally confused and seems restless. "The general" told the story in a direct and orderly way, but ODC just wanted to be cool. There is a reference on the films of Guy Ritchie "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch", but it doesn't have the freshness of these films. <br /> <br /> So in the end, I would say 3 of 10!
