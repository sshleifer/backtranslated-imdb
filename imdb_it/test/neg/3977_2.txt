I've never seen this movie alone, but like many others who have already commented, I saw it as an episode of MST3K. Really terrible TV shock of the 70s. But someone saw his potential because it was turned into a $ 125 million flop called The Island. <br /> <br /> And to the person who asked if there were any good films made in the 70s, I want to remind you that it was a golden age for American cinema with directors like Robert Altman and Martin Scorcese who came forward for the first time. Not to mention small things like Star Wars (1977). Just a reminder that the 1970s were far more creative than the 21st century has been so far.
