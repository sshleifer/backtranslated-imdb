You would have more enthusiasm to cut your testicles than to look at this, clearly a trick to let you rent "Descent" instead of "The Descent", which is a much better film. <br /> <br /> This is a total rip-off of "The Core" and much, much worse as regards the special effects, I could have done better with a box of cornflakes and a roll of tinfoil, I mean come on! .... that "Mole" thing bore more resemblance to a dildo vibrator than an underground vehicle. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it - if you do it you will find the room where you have a strange smell for days and you will have this annoying feeling in the back of your head that you should kill yourself or something.
