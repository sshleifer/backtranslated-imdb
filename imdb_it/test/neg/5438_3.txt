"Congo" is based on the bestselling novel by Michael Crichton, which seemed to me to lack the usual charm, clever characters and Crichton's fist. Well, I'm sorry to say, but the same goes for the movie. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot: <br /> <br /> Greed is bad, this simple story of morality warns. A C.E.O. megalomaniac. (Joe Don Baker) sends his son into the dangerous African Congo in search of a source of diamonds large enough and so pure to function as a powerful transmitter of laser communications (or are they laser weapons?). When the contact is lost with her son and the team, she is sent to her daughter (Laura Linney), a former CIA agent and computer freak. During her research, she is accompanied by gee-whizz gadgets and some eccentric characters (including a mercenary (Ernie Hudson), a researcher with a talking gorilla (Dylan Walsh) and an Indiana-Jones type nut in search of King's Mines Salomone (Tim Curry): After some narrow escapes from the surface-to-air missiles and some African wild animals, they all discover that often what we want most is the source of our ruin. <br /> <br /> The actors in this film he had no talent Dylan Walsh behaves like a pathetic whimper, especially at the end: Ernie Hudson is unconvincing (isn't it surprising that he acted in TV movies?) and Laura Linney is nothing special, certainly the only talented actors in this film they have very small roles: Joe Don Baker and Tim Curry, an always entertaining actor (though sometimes scarred for life by constantly remembering his "Rocky Horror Picture" days). <br /> <br /> This film also had other issues, including a horrible management style, cheese dialogue and a boring plot, which has been completely erased from the Crichton novel. <br /> <br /> Not even Stan Winston's creature effects could save this film from being a disaster. I am deeply disappointed with this film; there was not even a camping quality with which to redeem. It was just awful, shoddy, boring and ridiculous, and turns out to be one of Crichton's worst book-to-film productions. <br /> <br /> 2/5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
