Now I like Johnny Vegas, which is a good start, I also like toilet humor <br /> <br /> Like Young Ones and Bottom etc. But this failed to bring even a small smile <br /> <br /> to my face. The story follows Johnny around after his wife <br /> <br /> pulled him out (as did his beautiful wife and the child I don't know) <br /> <br /> while trying to fuck everything what moves. Fail normally. I was looking forward to it, but I found it completely boring and a waste of time. Unless you're stuck for something to do for 90 minutes apart from washing the car so don't worry ..... <br /> <br />
