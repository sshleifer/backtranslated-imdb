Van Sant copies Hitchcock's masterpiece shot to frame some modern facets: a walkman and Anne Heche's nakedness. Unless you have a strong desire to see Ms. Heche naked, there is absolutely no reason to see this film instead of the original. Hitchcock's masterpiece is much better and Van Sant can't understand that hiding nudity and blood, the original shower scene is even more terrifying. Ask Janet Leigh about that. Even the acting is much flatter and the technical aspects much less impressive.
