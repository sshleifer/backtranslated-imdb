The first half of this movie was pretty good. It was interesting and full of suspense. The second half was pretty bad. The story of the revenge of the comics has reached the starting point and we see many Nazi comic characters and some "good guys" who behave badly. There is a lot of violence in this film. I'm not picky about violence, but I think it should at least have a purpose in a movie. Here there was little purpose for violence except to create a genre film in which we see a lot of people being cut down with guns. Somehow we should be amused by this. <br /> <br /> I recently saw the Reservoir dogs. There was a film in which violence was used effectively. It was realistic in the world created by the film. There have never been exaggerated sound effects. It was a detective film that played it directly. Inglorious Basterds should have interpreted it but did not. I was rolling my eyes to how exaggerated the violence was with sound effects and extra bullets on the head and face. <br /> <br /> None of the background of any of the Basterds is really explained, they are simply Nazi hunters. We don't even like any of them because they're too busy cutting scalps and shooting people in the face. It is "revenge" and very little. <br /> <br /> It took us 2 and a half hours to work here, but some of the Basters were examined in depth. It seems it was simply a stroke of revenge, pure and simple. We saw it in Tarantino's last film, "Death Proof" which I didn't even care about. He suffered the same problems. The characters were almost interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The first half was good again. I wanted to see the Inglorious Basterds' ventures across Europe. I was presented with a very bland film about the resistance movement that plots revenge against some Nazi comics when they all go to the film's premiere in France.
