The premise of this film seems to be that overcoming the generation of the Second World War in America, with its fake apple pie and its hypocritical morality, was a terrible tragedy. Those terrible hippies have apparently ruined everything. <br /> <br /> What holds the film together are the excellent performances, in particular that of Lemmon which is truly remarkable. Otherwise we have a boring drama of the slice of life (just over 24 hours of Jack's life) with pretensions. <br /> <br /> I found a task to sit on.
