Well, in all honesty it's beyond the boundaries of the stupid, but "Killer Pussy" is still an insanely funny little movie. No plot, tons of oiled cha-chas, cheese effects and a monster that eats penis! What's not to love?! Practically - a couple of explorers find this creature who likes to lurk inside a woman's beef tents until a schwang is unfortunately ... ah, pushed into her mouth. He finds his guest who is later discovered frozen in a deserted house by a group of cruel boys and their own unscrupulous friends, whose van breaks down. The creature jumps from every girl while everyone is getting drunk like drunken rabbits ... There's some cold blood, a girl on a "blood fight", a KY Jelly vomit, puppet monsters and a lot of soft sex core processors. Ridiculous but a waste of time ...
