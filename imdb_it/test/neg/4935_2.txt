Brainless film about two girls and some guys meeting at an airport taking the wrong shuttle late at night and ending up in a world of trouble. The big twists are totally, and I mean totally wasted, in a movie with such an incredibly stupid plot to defy the description. What is happening in a general sense is fine, I mean, the idea of ​​a boy who kidnaps unattended girls for nefarious purposes is good. The problem is that the details are so incredible that I would be shocked if you didn't turn off the film in total disbelief. Damn, a guy about to take you home doesn't go into any of the ways you know, and you stay on the bus? From there it gets worse, he thinks of every bad choice and this film has made the characters do it, to the point where they could just leave, but never do it. What's annoying is that some of the twists might have worked if there was something clever before, but there is almost no intelligence anywhere in this movie. Ok, maybe there is, the end, the end is smart. The end is the kind of thing that should scare you. should be the "oh # $ * @ !!!!" moment and become a classic of horror cinema. Instead it is found only in the stupid ruins of a stupid film. One of the most mindless films of the year.
