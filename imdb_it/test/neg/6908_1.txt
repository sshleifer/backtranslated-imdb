Hi, I usually love movies. I'm 19 years old, I've seen a lot of them and I don't like just one or two. However, when it was over, I had to tear my sister off the back of her arm (she wanted to see him) and I burst out laughing when I left because it was such a ridiculous movie. <br /> <br /> Because it was terrible: - all the cows had breasts, especially annoying were the MALE ones with udders - none of the characters was unique or engaging, except perhaps the main Coyote Dag - the idea of ​​keeping cows looking at coyotes is simply ridiculous - "funny" moments are repetitive and simply become a sequence to overcome the last - the themes of working together, which should have been present at the end, were non-existent. Instead, people get the impression: well, I'll take all this on me, and in this case I was lucky my friends decided to support me without my knowledge - all moments similar to the lion king (as mentioned below) they were beyond the cornea, even for a children's film <br /> <br /> and ... the worst of all ... PARALLEL THE KING LION IN EVERY SINGLE WAY responsible father who is killed by the Coyotes (the Coyotes are essentially the hyenas, with Dag, the protagonist Coyote, being the equivalent of Scar) The farm falls into chaos, Odis (the cow, although basically Simba) wants to play, and is shocked by the fact that her father is dead, she believes it is it was his fault (even though in this film, it was his fault), he faces the coyotes and takes a screaming ass, after which Dag tells him to leave, and about to leave, Odis somehow decides to go save some chickens and friends back (with complete surprise of course, he leaves without sap eras that will come to help him). <br /> <br /> Other things taken from the Lion King: stars that move like signs, paternal figures that refer to stars / signs in a mystical and loving way, the obvious circularity of how Father Ben found Odis and he took care of him, and how in the end the loving love of Odis gives birth and has a similar experience. Birth at the end? GOOD GOD, what the hell ... and also music of a similar type, which seems completely tacked at the end because it is completely different from all the previous music. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is the first movie I have ever seen where I was really rooting for the bad guys - I never understood what others were saying, until now. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: don't waste your time going to see this. Convince the children not to see it and observe the Lion King again. Or that, or get them to see Ant Bully, who was creative and artistic.
