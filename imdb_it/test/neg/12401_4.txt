Of all the films in the history of films I can't imagine anyone sitting down and saying, I want to spend X amounts of dollars (or pounds) to redo that imperfect classic movie called "Breeders". Many stories have been turned into films about meteors that come to Earth with something sinister hiding inside. Why not invest your money in a spectacular 3D "It came from Outer Space" remake? Why look for a squalid nudist film that existed only for the purpose of showcasing a rubbery series of monsters and some naked spies? The script for the 1986 version of "Breeders" was so inspiring that these producers thought it necessary to do it again and this time done correctly? When approaching, the only reason this film exists is to show off Britcom's Samantha Janus gay pie. But if you're going to make a leather movie and take advantage of Sam Janus, you'd better have her naked more than this and naked more often than this if you want to succeed. <br /> <br /> Meteor lands. .. the monster escapes ... the coeds have their clothes ... the monster eats people ... and another "and if?" Unfortunately, I never thought of ever recommending the original "breeders" compared to any other film, but this would be the second to reach 2nd place.
