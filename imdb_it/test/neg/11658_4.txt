The movie seemed to have been released for some reason. Definitely not a well-made film. Unbelievable. The scenes in which the president (Holbrook) was downtown and walking among the people was a farce. There would be no chance that ordinary people would be within 30 meters of the President in that situation in real life. If it weren't for blood and bad words, it was shot as a TV movie. It could have been decent if it had been done differently. The talents of Holbrook (President) have never been realized in this film. Shatner's acting is fine. The production values ​​in this film leave much to be desired. Overall, I think most people would be better off without wasting time looking at this deal.
