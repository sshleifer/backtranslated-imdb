As another user, I found this cheap - I thought. 85 crowns (Â£ 8). Although it is not worth that amount of money, it is a total classic that I - like other users - saw for the first time when I was a child and could not wait to see him again about 20 years later. The story is incredibly thin (which is why it might have worked for children), but all the radio language and the trucker's stuff make up for it. It would look good on my DVD shelf for years to come. First vision (1980): 10/10. Second vision (2002): 4/10
