This film has the distinction of being the worst movie I've ever seen, and the only film that has ever given a 1 out of 10 on imdb so far. I was teased to rent it because of the fantastic cover by H.R. Giger on the box. This cover is the only thing that has any good on this steaming pile of ... <br /> <br /> It was about brothers who fought "monsters" in a post apocalyptic world, strange but not for this less interesting, where cities are in ruins / chaos, but apparently the suburbs are still a safe and wonderful place for young men who hate other men in brotherhood organizations. The funniest performances of boring characters, not so special effects, desolate and unpublished landscapes and generally mediocre quality in all aspects of production make this lemon the loser of all time on my list. <br /> <br /> FINAL RATING: 1/10 I wish I could give a zero. <br /> <br /> Noob Aalox
