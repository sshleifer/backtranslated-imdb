This film is from the 1980s, but it appears to have been made in the Stone Age. The effects are too trivial. My copy has Sandra Bullock on the cover, which is why I bought the film. It was in the movie for about 5 minutes of total screen. Most likely it would deny all involvement. <br /> <br /> In short, there is no part of this film that is worth seeing, other than laughing at how bad it is. Rent this to see the worst movie ever made, without exception.
