This relatively obscure "relative" of Hong Kong is the perfect movie for the deserted island for video age videotapes (at least the first half is). Every set, every scene, every sequence is an excuse to look for a girl's skirt, stare at her breasts, look down at her and look at her tight horse. What is being established is the perverse inclinations of the protagonist, of course (!) <br /> <br /> Genre stalwart Anthony Wong is a marginally perverted married man who is tormented by erotic daydreams and outrageous fantasies. All involve sexy, poorly dressed and sexy Chinese women with nothing but sexual servitude in their minds. <br /> <br /> The plot is thickened by a murderous subplot, a skewer of voodoo dolls and a bit of rape and looting. <br /> <br /> Some sex scenes are rather hot and the cold is liberal, but the supernatural elements introduced in the second half seem to be cooked and the developments of the plot are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Clearly, flashy garbage producer Wong Jing had a terrible rush to get in and out of theaters. <br /> <br /> The sequence of the arty title did not deceive this jaded punter.
