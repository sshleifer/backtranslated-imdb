The Detonator is set in Bucharest where a sort of former CIA government agent named Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) tracked down an arms dealer named Dimitru (Matthew Leitch), but things go wrong and Dimitru discovers that Sonni is working for the United States government. After a major shootout, most of Dimitru's men were killed by Sonni whose local Romanian police forces are unhappy, the top man Flint (Michael Brandon) decides to send Sonni back to the United States and at the same time protect a woman named Nadia Cominski (Silvia Colloca) who is also sent back to the United States. However, it appears that Nadia is wanted by Dimitru and her soccer team that owns the leader Jozef (Tim Dutton) who needs her to conclude an agreement for a nerve gas bomb that they intend to blow up in Washington killing millions of people .. . <br /> <br /> This American and Romanian co-production was directed by Po-Chih Leong and The Detonator confirms beyond a shadow of a doubt that Wesely Snipes has joined the club of movie star action in a state of neglect who are relegated to making generic action films set in Eastern Europe, Yep Snipes has joined luminaries like Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Dolph Lundgren, Rutger Hauer and Chuck Norris. I give Snipes some credit as he has kept a little longer than the rest with the excellent Blade: Trinity (2004) still fresh in many minds of viewers (every film he has made since he went directly to the DVD ) but sooner or later it had to happen, like many of the names I mentioned. Snipes has lost the reputation of some great films and if you look at his career, he has been in the worst movies and in the good ones. Like the recent JCVD ​​& Seagal films, The Detonator is pretty horrible. Martin Wheeler's script is predictable, boring and numbers like anything else out there. The Detonator is the kind of movie you'd expect to see on a dark cable TV channel that plays at 2am. The Detonator is chock-full of clichés, Snipes is forced into a situation in which he must protect a woman and at first they don't love the other but in the end they are in love, his dearest friend of the CIA turns out to be a traitor while the hateful by the head of the book that no one really likes is a pretty decent guy, the character of Snipes is allowed to go around Bucharest by shooting, killing and blowing people up as if he didn't care and will never be arrested, the action is boring and boring, the villain owns a football team, so there are a lot of annoying football terminologies and there are not even funny jokes. <br /> <br /> Director Leong does nothing to rekindle things up, The Detonator seems cheap with a car chase in which the two cars never seem to exceed the 30mph limit. OK, the action scenes are relatively well staged but they are few and far between and absolutely forgettable in a 'bad man shoots Snipes & miss, in exchange Snipes shoots at bad guy and kills him' in a sense. There is a decent car accident and an explosion, but very little. It seems that some of The Detonator were shot in a Romanian soccer stadium, I think I would have preferred to watch the game for 90 minutes rather than this movie. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of around $ 15,000,000 The Detonator is reasonably well done, but not much. Set and shot in Bucharest in Romania. The acting isn't great, Snipes doesn't seem interested and feels like he's there for the money I don't blame him at all. <br /> <br /> The Detonator is another poor, the cliché action film starring was an actor and set in Eastern Europe. Why does Sony continue to do these things? I don't recommend it, there are much better action rates out there.
