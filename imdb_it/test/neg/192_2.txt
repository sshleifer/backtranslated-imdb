The sadness was the emotion I felt after the screen went dark. Puzzled, it was another. Why do two experienced screen vets like Matthau and Lemmon sign this putrid project? I get the impression that they didn't read the script before the cameras started shooting. The whole cast is wasted, in this film not funny, uninteresting and not very impressive. Sadly enough, this was one of Edward Mulhare's latest projects, here as the heavy. Dyan Cannon tries, Hal Linden looks bored, Donald O'Connor plays some obscene phrases. (?? !!). I'm not with the "Legion of Decency". The point is that they were expressed only because of the strangeness of hearing him use an off-color language. This is a desperate attempt to infuse "humor" into an image. He actually delivered the only entertainment bite of the movie when he started dancing on the dance floor, however. Except for my harshest criticism for leads. Walter Matthau should have known. It still offers great solo performances (IQ, Dennis The Menace, etc.). His character, although affable, is rather boring and one-dimensional. I saw it once, saw it all. Jack Lemmon gives another one of his male portraits, "too mild and sensitive", of his trademark. When this mode starts, I indirectly want to give him a box of handkerchiefs. OUTSIDE THE SEA is painfully little fun, and anyone who has produced this mess should be forced to walk on the board.
