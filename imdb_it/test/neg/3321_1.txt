I remember all the hype about this movie when Aaliyah was killed. Being a fan of Ms. Rice's novels, my first thought was "how can they do Queen Of The Damned without first doing Vampire Lestat?" <br /> <br /> Having finally seen the movie, I can now see how they did it. If you've read these books, imagine eliminating the bloodiest parts of Vampire Lestat, putting Marcus and Marius together in one character, and removing everything that has to do with the beginning of Lestat (the wolf hunt, the violin that plays, the Vampire Theater, and also Louis, Claudia and Gabrielle), then in the last 15 minutes in "Queen Of The Damned". <br /> <br /> What we lose is a very important piece of the character of Lestat. His inner anguish of having to kill for a living, the fact that he carefully tries to select the killers as victims, and his hate-love relationship with Louis, Armand, Gabrielle and all the other vampires. <br /> <br /> Just as important for the story is that we lose the "Twins Story", which is the genesis of Mrs Rice's vampires. And while I'm sure cannibalism was intense to be shown on screen, they could have done something closer, and it showed us more of ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> Worse, we have this love interest thrown between Jessie and Lestat. The Vampire Chronicles is basically an American Yoni story. For those who don't know, Yoni is another form of Hentai (Japanese comic). But in Yoni, it is about homosexual relationships, told by a female. While I'm sure many men oppose the "gayness" of the characters, in this film they went to the opposite extreme in the opposite direction. Instead of Lestat pursuing the killers, he chases young female groupies. <br /> <br /> And the other flaws in logic and plot are huge. At the beginning Lestat emerges from a century of prolonged sleep, then asks Marius how he overcame the 50s in red velvet. Marius has no idea who Elvis is and says he slept for that period. You wonder how Lestat knows the fashion and music of the 50s, since he slept in the same period of time. And nothing is ever even mentioned about Louis, Claudia or Gabrielle. I think it's a great pity. It's like seeing "Snow White and the 3 Dwarfs". <br /> <br /> Overall, the film I thought was really bad. The only positive thing was the soundtrack. Most of the acting was poor, the accents pushed me to the wall and all the really thorough parts of the book were removed, leaving us with only an empty shell, like Enkil after it was sucked dry. /> <br /> If you want to see a good modern vampire movie, take Lost Boys, the original interview with a vampire or even some old episodes of Dark Shadows. Let this piece rest in the piece, with a stake in the heart, cloves of garlic around the neck and a vial of holy water in the mouth. <br /> <br /> Finally, remember that before Aaliya was killed, this was destined to go directly to the video, there was no scheduled release. It is obvious now why it was so. It's just sad that someone as talented as you will be remembered for this dog of a movie, instead of something where it could really have shone. <br /> <br /> I consider this a 2 on a scale of 1 to 10.
