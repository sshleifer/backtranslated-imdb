I was also the wife of a violent husband, although in my situation the attacks were psychological, not physical. He presented a respectable, responsible and generous personality to anyone who has seen us together, which, unlike myself, has led others to consider me boring and unstable. Initially, I was so incredibly flattered that someone like Gus (who worked in a bank and was generously confident) would also give me the time of day, and I fell completely upside down for his IDEA, rather than for the person was. If I had my head straight and had known him much better before, I could never have married him. However, this is my mistake. It was not my mistake to be abused. I didn't deserve it, nor did I see it until I got involved in mental games, criticism and isolation. He acted as if I had no intention of keeping an opinion different from his own - in fact he went further. If I didn't agree, he thought he had misunderstood, and always simplified his wording ... when I finally lost the self-respect, I wasn't able to recognize the situation I was in, and I had to be jolted to reality by external influence. My father said that Gus called me a whore. Well ... it was still a year and a half before the anger that started at that moment finally blew up and I did some stuff while he was at work, and I left. .. and it was still another several months before I could understand the fact that I had been abused, and that it wasn't my fault if he was doing the things he was doing. ..... so please, anyone who thinks it's the victim's fault, THINK !!! If a puppy is kicked by a cruel owner when, in an anxious situation, he has an accident on the carpet, blame the puppy? when the abuse in a relationship reaches an obvious violent level, the goal of the abuse was so hurt and depersonalized (just like in the Nazi concentration camps) that it is almost impossible to judge the circumstance accurately, because at that point the victim believes the horrible things spewed by the abuser. Have a heart, folks. To label the victims of abuse as stupid idiots is like kicking someone who is already terribly defeated. -------> and this helps like ???
