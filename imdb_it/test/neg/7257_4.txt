I got a discount copy of this. I saw it several years ago. My only recent experience was "Mystery Science Theater", where it was profoundly falsified. One never really gets the chance to get into these films because of all the byplay. I love the beginnings of the fifties horror movies. They give us a pompous conference on defense systems near the Arctic. These were there to protect us from the expected Soviet invasion, but they should come in handy, given the threat of very large insects. <br /> <br /> This particular flies. For some reason, despite its exoskeleton made of things that locusts are made of, they can still defend themselves from air-to-air missiles and disable combat aircraft. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's more fun - in the first place, the obligatory unbalanced case that saw the flying thing, cooling the heels in a hospital (only one teaches it - see an insect as big as a house - keep your mouth shut). I wonder if the poor guy came home after finding the insect. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a fairly ordinary effort. He follows the usual efforts to find a way to deter the stubborn insect - and leaves us open to other possibilities - the Russians next time. I still have a kick from these movies and this is useful.
