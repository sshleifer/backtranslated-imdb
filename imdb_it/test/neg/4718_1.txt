In this horrible attempt at a Blair Witch mockumentary, a group of people travel to Africa to investigate a creature called Half-Caste. It is quite obvious that there was no script to talk about, and that everything was improvised. This can work if you have good actors, which this movie didn't do. <br /> <br /> This film seeks to gain points for originality by exploring a darker myth and an exotic culture. As a result, there are many bush scenes where the characters make "African quirks" like eating elephant dung. There's also a nice movie of lion eaters (from a National Geographic perspective), but there's no single scare in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Cannibal Holocaust or the Blair Witch Project, this movie has no surprises for you, and you can probably watch better lion videos on the Discovery Channel. <br /> <br /> Definitely a half-auction effort. <br /> <br /> A note for the filmmakers: guys, let's do us all a favor and next time save the movie "How I spent my vacation in Africa" ​​for your family and close friends. No one else wants to see it.
