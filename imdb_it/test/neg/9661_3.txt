wow, this movie was sucked. <br /> <br /> This film was embarrassing for the original sandlot. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie was horrible. <br /> <br /> The acting was horrendous. Every part except the "Mexican" sandlot manager part was terrible. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry, although only some parts were absolutely horrible. This was the worst role ever. Even the child actor who played him as a child was someone you wanted to punch, even at the end, lol. <br /> <br /> This film reminded me of those children's movies that do that little bit more by playing a silly part beyond the funny stage. Humor was for 6-year-olds. <br /> <br /> If you are over 12 and want something worth watching, skip this movie and watch a sitcom.
