This film is essentially a "how-to" on how to be a well-connected pedophile. I am stunned by the fact that so many people, especially other gays, have seen this film and read the book and no one has pointed out that if Weber was not an influential photographer, he would be in prison, making time for child abuse. Poor Peter Johnson. Weber took this poor, naive (though incredibly beautiful) teenager he found in a training camp for high school wrestlers in the Midwest, took him to live in his home and took thousands of homoerotic photos of him, many of them full-frontal naked, for all of Johnson's adolescence. That is not art. It is an abuse of minors. And what's worse, Weber has made a lot of money and poor Johnson will have serious "problems" for the rest of his life. Weber's lascivious love for the boy is downright disturbing, as are his chatter about famous (and not-so-famous) people he knows while trying to complete Johnson's education. Disturbing, and then simply boring. The only redeeming thing I can say about the film is that it is a fascinating study of self-deception. But I can't help but wonder why no one has ever considered the effect he was having on "Chop Suey" (Weber's nickname for Johnson).
