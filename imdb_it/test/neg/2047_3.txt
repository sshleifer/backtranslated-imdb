As Americans, we expect crapiness to be "par for the course" when it comes to HORROR and unknown directors who direct unknown actors who act as unknown writers. We really expect this to suck and when it doesn't suck, it becomes a night success. <br /> <br /> NOT a nightly success, nor is it a success over the weekend or during the month. This blows from the beginning to the end and my only recommendation is this: GO THERE TO KNOW THAT SUCKS, enjoy it for what it is, for what it is not and if you have something better to do, keep this on the back WAY BACK burner . It's fun to entertain seniors as they cross a busy road during rush hour, but don't expect much: they are hardly ever hit by a real car, it's just a fair bit of fuss.
