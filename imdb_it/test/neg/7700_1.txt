There is nothing good to say about this film. Read Revolution For the Hell of It or one of his other writings. Abbie was often fired as the prince clown of the 1960s, but was a man of ideas who used his intelligence, his sense of humor and pop culture and his flamboyant personality to draw attention to his ideas. The media too often focus on the man, not on the ideas, and this is also the problem with this film. Later in his life he suffered from depression. But this film is like a National Enquirer version of Abbie. He deserves better. If you don't know Abbie or his times, this movie doesn't help. <br /> <br /> This movie lies. I give him a zero. <br /> <br />
