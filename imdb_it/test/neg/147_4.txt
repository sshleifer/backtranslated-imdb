I usually like to watch Laurel and Hardy, but this is obviously one of the films they made while they were about to become a successful comedy. <br /> <br /> The plot is too simple, and is based primarily on a joke; how strange are kilts and scottish. And this is all. Ok, there are other jokes, but I didn't find them funny at all; they are obsolete and (I imagine) not very funny when the film was released for the first time. <br /> <br /> Yet the film has two of the most fascinating faces in history, and they get the best from the embarrassing story (which I expect to have been shot without a proper script) and the scenery is beautiful to look at. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, watching this is only useful for Laurel and Hardy fans, other people should stay away from it.
