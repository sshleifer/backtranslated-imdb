The return to Frogtown was a difficult film to track down. Well, I did that mission and had been sitting on the shelf for quite some time. I wish he was kept that way! First, Sam Hell is obviously not Roddy Piper. He is replaced by a boy with a big face, less charisma, and this poor actor is very kind to the part! Sam Hell should be rebellious and fantastic. Here it is captured THREE TIMES! What kind of hero is he? Spangle is also replaced here by another actress. Why didn't we have different characters here? This was stupid! Lou Ferrigno is the protagonist of this film and he is not even the hero. Common sense says that Lou is the hero of the movie! Bad effects, poor acting and just a forgettable movie. Funny while shooting Ninja Turtles 2 with the whole concert scene in this movie. At least Ninja Turtles 2 was fun and not a bad movie! I really wanted to go back to Frogtown, but I gave up when the fight scenes started. This movie makes turtles look like gold! Avoid this or you'll be singing "the meanest, greenest, talking turtle TV dinner!"
