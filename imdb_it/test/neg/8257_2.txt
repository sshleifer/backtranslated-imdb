It is a pity, in reality, that the script of this film had more holes than those you could shake a stick (intentional mixed metaphor), because Kinski and Coyote - both very talented artists who are capable of great subtlety and nuance - they have a wonderful chemistry together and the always provocative Fairuza Balk didn't even damage the mix. Jeremy Piven would have been great here too, if his character (and all the other supporting characters) hadn't been written as a plot device. As for the main proceedings, the writers didn't know how to create the right innocent or guilty tension for the character of Kinski - instead they gave us confusion, contradiction and, from the final, decidedly let's-hope-the-viewers-don't-notice claptrap .
