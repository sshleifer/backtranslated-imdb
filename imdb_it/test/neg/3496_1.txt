Through its two-hour span, Crash traces the emotional anguish of his 10-odd group of characters to the sometimes overt and sometimes latent forms of racism behind American society. This is the emotional anguish of one of his spectators sitting close to the front and trying desperately to make sense of what the films have become these days. <br /> <br /> The era in which we live has become so complicated. Not only do we reject modernism, even the not very enthusiastic waving of flags of postmodernist ideas is always overthrown by what post-post-modernism that aims to destroy all these ideas, all in no way thanks to the great destructive ideas of those great 'thinkers'. But I digress. This doesn't have much to do with what the film is about, but rather about the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, it seems difficult to make a living in a Hollywood that has to satisfy a market that is so post-post-post all that cynicism has become more than just a motto in life. It has become part of everything we do and part of everything we think whether we like it or not. And so a new studio product is born! The indie films, which were once energetic and idealistic in his provocative experimental, now seem just as irrelevant as Hollywood movies to sell to indie film markets. An independent film must be sold at Sundance before becoming "acclaimed". And therefore nothing is simpler. Even what constitutes a good film becomes so murky. While in the past filmmakers only wanted to entertain people and tell a good story - and in these seemingly simplistic attempts the greatest of the films - today's filmmakers have to make films that are good first of all; films must make one think, they must be meaningful, they must be provocative, raise questions, yadda yadda yadda. What it all boils down to is a subversion of the Hollywood film system, but this subversion seems strangely similar to the formidable similarity of Hollywood films, the innumerable ways of essentially differentiating oneself from being the same product. <br /> <br /> And I haven't started the film yet. Maybe I became too fussy about the movies I see these days. Maybe it's because of my primary need to be entertained, rather than, for example, being probed when I see a movie. But hell, this movie is a big pile of shit. And I am disgusted by this film, not only because it follows the guidance of the T - characters who speak of eloquent lines and are so witty as if they were endowed with the discourse of God; raises questions about racism and life that confronts racism in America; has "touching" moments in which everyone discovers more about themselves and more about other people; not to mention the fact that once you listen to the ambient / new age soundtrack of women singing in high registers in foreign languages, you know you have all the traits described above. <br /> <br /> And something about the aforementioned point - about it raising questions about immediately convincing issues like racism - it pisses me off big time. Like all post-post-post-post-movies, it is not enough to have a message about this problem. Because oh, our audience is very smart for this these days in the post-post-post-post world. Our audience wants us to reflect, does not want us to put things so simplistic (and then they will go into existentialist shit and they say) because life itself is not simplistic. Hahaha. What other common drill we do here then the public must think about the problems rather than feed them with them. Okay, okay, and that's fine. So the film is a point to beat the public with these non-messages and since they are not exactly a message, it is so decidedly thin and subtle means good right? So we are struck again and again with this well-written subtlety with the eloquence of rhetorical prose. And as if the irony were not steep enough, we have the character of Ludicrous, the only character who does not seem to take all of this bullshit on racism seriously, being 'converted' into one of those irritating and significant characters where he learns something in the end, giving significant looks and pauses in which the public should "learn something about themselves". Um, yes. How I wanted to see an incredibly racist movie right after this man. <br /> <br /> To cut the long bullshit, I think I wouldn't have challenged the film if it wasn't so bloated in its self-importance. The anguish that makes up the entire film seems more like a whimper than the white boy than Spike Lee's anger. That's how Tim Robbins and Sean Penn, the guy who wants to wave the flags on humanitarianism when the only thing they don't realize is that the flag they are waving is their pierced underwear. It has also become so fashionable in the post-post-post-post world to be completely thin about it. Nothing is simpler. In his best efforts to actually be good, provocative and ultimately human, he has become neither, imho, just another indie shit of an independent director who wants to make a name for himself as a credible indie-director. Now at least Hollywood is simpler and more sincere in its manipulation.
