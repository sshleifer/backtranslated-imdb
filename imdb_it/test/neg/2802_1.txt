I was in Blockbuster and saw a movie called "Dark Harvest". The cover was fantastic, the plot wasn't so bad and the tagline (Collect what you sow) made the movie pretty good. But that day I was stupid, because I did something I should never have done. I rented a movie "Straight To Video Independent Horror", going out with my best rentals, I went home, I found Dark Harvest in the DVD player and it all started. I thought I would watch the trailer after the film was finished (IDEA BAD), but I went ahead and watched it anyway. NOW for review. * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * First of all, the acting of the "boys" sucks, and the scene when the 2 (main characters) talk, the lighting sucks, and the buildings seem fake! Now they go to this house, where Sean Connel's relatives live (I think he is the main character, I don't care). Suddenly one by one, they all start getting killed by ... (panting) TO KILLER SCARECROW !!!! AHHH !!!!! The scarecrow is obviously the definition of low budget, and the scenes in which the scarecrow is computerized seems so fake that it's fun. Makes dinosaur noises and everything! And then in the end ... they shoot the scarecrow with a gun (which is red for God's sake and looks like it was bought in a local dollar) and stops for a while and then ..... (panting ) BLOWS UP !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Save yourself some time, I'm telling you this movie sucks. if you need to spend an hour and a half, look at the wall, because looking at the wall is more fun than this disaster. It's pretty fun though. <br /> <br /> Overall grade: F If there was something lower ** F - ** I would answer that.
