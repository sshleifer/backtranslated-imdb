Having had problems in Chicago, the Solomon family moved to a remote North Dakota farmhouse to start over, but their idyllic life attempts were interrupted when their teenage daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her 3-year-old brother Ben , they begin to see and be attacked by supernatural beings who will not allow them to live in peace. <br /> <br /> Messengers start decently even if in the end it becomes a generic horror movie that is much more fun than scary. After reading the premise, I thought this could be a decent movie since it sounded scary and had potential. Unfortunately, the film did not live up to its potential, although I would have had to wait because the trailer was horrible. The script was probably the worst part. It was full of silly sequences and bland dialogues. The characters were not developed and most of them behaved like a group of idiots, so it was difficult to feel sympathy for them. The directors did a horrible job of creating suspense. They were based mainly on economic fright like loud noises and random jumps. The music was really exaggerated and made it easier for the viewer to wire the next "scary" moment. Also, I don't like how they practically used a position for the whole movie. The house was the centerpiece of the story and this is where most of the shooting took place, so it became a bit boring after a while to see the same area. Besides, I didn't like the close-ups of the actors. During a conversation, the camera continually switched from one character to another within five seconds and became really annoying. The directors created a decent atmosphere and got some points to make their film elegant. However, since we have come a long way in terms of style and effects, it's not really that hard to make your movie look good, especially if you're working on a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was atrocious and if this film was released in December, I'm sure it would have received several Razzie nominations. Kristen Stewart showed some talent in the Panic Room but you wouldn't be able to say that she has talent watching her performance in The Messengers. He was good at playing fear and nothing else. For the rest of the time it was dry and unconvincing. Penelope Anne Miller was simply awful when it came to everything. He seemed to be reading his lines and she had some of the worst facial expressions I've ever seen. Dylan McDermott was just very wooden and showed almost no emotion. John Corbett gave the best performance and had a couple of good scenes. Even the twins who played Ben were decent and managed to put many adult actors into action. Overall, this limping horror film is not worth looking at for being bland and lazy. Evaluation 4/10
