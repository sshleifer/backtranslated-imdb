First of all, and above all, I consider the title of this film. 'Chupacabra' is not a Spanish word. The name to which they refer is "Chupacabras". I imagine they have abandoned the "s" because it sounds so in the plural, but I assure you that it is singular in Spanish. <br /> <br /> Then, I thought this movie was made years ago. It turned out to be one of those B horror movies I saw when I was a teenager at home when my stepfather was out of town. Then it would have been pretty scary. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about special effects. The most important effect is the costume used for the Chupacabras. Since he is the main character, you would think there would be serious money, but it is not. The shape, color and texture were all as silly as a stupid haunted house in Disney World. <br /> <br /> There were times when the Chupacabras were walking where no man could walk. His movement was jerky and strange in those moments, but moving on the floor looked like a normal man. Another thing that I take into consideration is that there is no animal in the world that turns to butcher everything it sees without any regard actually eating it. The Chupacrabas would kill one, then the next, but he never actually seemed to eat the victim. You say, "It's just a movie" and I agree. But the idea is so far away that it's stupid. <br /> <br /> Which country is Dr. Pena from? It looks like some kind of Jamaincan / Hawaiian / British / Something-Else, but I think it should be Latin. The problem is that his accent is so serious that even a Russian could say that he was not Latin. <br /> <br /> The soldiers shot this thing round after round, and they weren't bruising, yet the continuous firing I'm not a soldier, but the soldiers, especially the special tactical forces like this, must have some of spirit on them to carry out their duties? Wouldn't they understand that it was a waste of time to shoot and try something new? They didn't. They continued to shoot while the Chupacabras continued to slaughter, not to eat them. <br /> <br /> Should they kill the little dog? :) Anyway, my vote was 3 for this movie, because it was bad. Why did I see it all? I'm sure you've done the same on a few occasions, so don't give me an excuse. ;)
