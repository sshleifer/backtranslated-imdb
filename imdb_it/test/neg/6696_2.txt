A poor basketball movie. A grumpy coach with a dubious background arrives in a small Indiana high school basketball team in the 1950s and instructs the boys to win "first he knocks them down and then builds them". <br /> <br /> Not a bad subject. Photography OK. But the plot is completely predictable. No real sub-plot. Nothing has been added to make the film exciting. You know what will happen from the beginning. Suitable for 4th Grader.
