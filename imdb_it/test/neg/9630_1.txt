No thanks in this terrible, boring snooze-fest, reminiscent of "The Ransom Of Red Chief"! <br /> <br /> Although there are some big stars in this film, the acting is almost uniformly terrible. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, usually a relaxed type of boy, sums it up with forced emotion. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed is so exaggerated as to be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielson is woefully mixed and it's terrible. <br /> <br /> The son is a little repulsive brat, I found myself rooting for the kidnappers. <br /> <br /> The only decent performance in this mixture is the relatively minor role of the butler. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too strict with the actors, after all, all they did was to read the lines given in the script. Ah, the script, that turgid piece of dishonesty invented that would pull the strings of your heart, but it just turns your stomach.
