Mel Welles, you could remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman's Little Shop of Horrors, directs this rather interesting but twisted story of Dr. Frankenstein's daughter who continues her father's work after his death and creates a creature not for his intellectual ability or his likelihood of being / doing good, but rather of his sex appeal. See, Tania Frankenstein, although a full-fledged doctor and scientist, doesn't care about anything more than satiating her primary desires for the stable boy and making a super-sexual slave using her body with her excellent brain of a man who does not love. Here the plot is very thin, and you get what you might expect: a lot of mischievous and suggestive comments (surprisingly more from the female protagonist), special effects that are not so special, acting that lacks depth of characterization, and not much action or suspense. And while this film is almost barren with regards to good storytelling, Lady Frankenstein strangely has some aspects that make it invisible - not highly watchable but still watchable. Italian actress Rosalba Neri AKA Sara Bay / Bey plays the baron's daughter with a little aplomb and lots of sex appeal. Exudes enough desire and seduction. His performance is rather one-dimensional, but it's pretty nice and sounds a little too good. She is also very open with her performance if you get my attention. Poor Joseph Cotten, now regulated for European horror films for money, plays his father in a brief but competent performance. It's the main attraction, but it was before the movie really took over. As for the rest of the cast, Paul Muller is somewhat effective as Dr. Charles Marshall, the baron's assistant and an admirer of his daughter for some time. As the crimes and missing persons begin to take place in the village, policeman (I wasn't buying it), Mickey Hargitay starts pumping Tania's answers - despite what you might think not to his satisfaction. Where the film really loses credibility is in the last third of the film where the suspicious script, weak performances and lackluster direction head further south. The creature is revealed and looks quite ridiculous. The film ends somewhat bluntly with one of the very common hasty resolutions of the 1970s. Although not as bad and repulsive as some may wish you to think, Lady Frankenstein is indeed a very imperfect film with some perverse, even if intriguing nuances.
