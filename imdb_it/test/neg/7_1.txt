The legendary Blake Edwards fiasco begins to seem pointless after just 10 minutes. A combination of The Eagle Has Landed, Star!, Oh! The beautiful war! And the Pink Panther films of Edwards, Darling Lili never engages the spectator; aerial sequences, musical numbers, romance, comedy and espionage are all buzzing. Where should the viewer stand? This disaster falters in tone, never decides what it wants to be, and apparently thinks it is a parody, but is pathetically and exquisitely squared. Formerly in the worst sense, the public was understandably in droves. It's horrible. James Garner would have been a great improvement over Hudson who is just cardboard, and does not connect with Andrews and vice versa. And both Andrews and Hudson don't seem to have been involved in the joke and behave with a wrong boldness. Blake Edwards' SOB is not much more than OK, but it's the only good that has ever come out of Darling Lili. The expensive and professional appearance of much of Darling Lili, only makes it even more difficult to bear what has been lavished. To quote the head of Paramount, Robert Evans, "$ 24 million of film and no image".
