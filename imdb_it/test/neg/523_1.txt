This film was one of the worst I've ever seen (not including anything with or with Pauly Shore). I couldn't believe that a movie could be really that bad! <br /> <br /> Coolio must be the only worst actor (again, not including Pauly Shore) to ever be a "star" in a film. The temptation to press the STOP button during this movie was enormous (in fact, if there was a THROW IN THE TRASH button on my VCR, I would have been inclined to press that). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and do something more interesting than watching this movie, like watching the grass grow or watching golf on TV.
