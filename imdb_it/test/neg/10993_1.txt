One of the worst films I have seen so far in 2009: the story hesitates between a stupid thriller or a stupid comedy. <br /> <br /> As soon as nothing happens, the void is full of long and boring dialogues that make no sense! <br /> <br /> The cast is famous but brings no excitement except to quickly advance the game! <br /> <br /> And it happens in a luxurious seaside hotel that looks really gloomy. In comparison, the "Shining" is the fun fair! <br /> <br /> NB: many users think that they are on the French Riviera! They are wrong! It is not the south of France (Nice, Cannes) but totally the opposite: Cabourg and Normandy, to be simple the D-Day beaches! That's why the sea is gray like the sky and there is no sun!
