Ron Hall pulls a triple threat while writing, directing and acting in "Vampire Assassins". Derek Washington (Hall) is your clich√© cop on a mission that finds its neck in a bad vampire action. He throws his badge away and looks for the last vampire killer (no, not Buffy!) To take back the streets and defeat the bloodsuckers in the grave. <br /> <br /> 'Vampire Assassins' is a horrible film. It tears so many other films (can you say Blade?) That it doesn't even try to establish its own identity. The script is non-existent. The action is horrible. Who says a micro-budget stimulates creativity? There is nothing remotely interesting here. You will get nothing from this except for a headache. Stay away at all costs.
