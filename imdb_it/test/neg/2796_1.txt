Now, I'll do it without putting spoilers if I can. My cousin and I were renting movies the other weekend, and we ran into it, with the scary scarecrow on the cover. It looked nice, so we rented it along with Kungfu Hustle. <br /> <br /> Wow ... Only ... Wow. <br /> <br /> To start, the film was horrible. Now, box art, opening scenes and music were decent, but the film itself is horrendous. The acting is sub-par (Sean, the protagonist, shows very few emotions and / or efforts in his character), the scarecrows do not resemble the one on the cover (false advertisement, perhaps?), And the camera angles and angles were the one of a bad wrestling event. <br /> <br /> And believe me, I'm a wrestling fan. I KNOW bad shooting angles. And honestly, this is right there with Gigli and Pootie Tang. It is so bad that it AMUSES me. It makes me laugh. So, somehow, this movie takes the place of a good play for me. <br /> <br /> But to be honest, it serves as what to do and what not to do in movies, especially the genre slasher. I recommend that people look at it, just to have a good understanding of what to avoid.
