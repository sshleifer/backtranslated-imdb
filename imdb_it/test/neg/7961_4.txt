If there's one thing I want to distinguish from all the other great reviewers here, it's that I'm the queen of finding weird movies in Thrift and Dollar Stores. That said, you can't imagine how happy I was when I found this. <br /> <br /> I can also remember that Saturday morning when * every * station has simulcast, so you got stuck if you wanted to look at something else (then again, I think it was the idea). As a child, I didn't know if I liked the way all the different characters were joined (there are some crossovers that work * and * don't work). But I imagine the special had the desired effect. Don't take drugs because you have nightmares about the Muppets. <br /> <br /> Now, if you look at this as an adult, on the other hand, you will be treated to the more strange anti-drug film this side of "Reefer Madness". I think I'll just do it before it gets me in trouble.
