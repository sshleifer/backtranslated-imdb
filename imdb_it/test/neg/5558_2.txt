Of course, all this nonsense raises the question: "Does such a self-referential genre like adolescent comedy really need another film about parody?" The painful movie "Scary Movie" (I and II) took the formula as far as it could - "Not Another Teen Movie" really has nothing clever or overly excessive to add. <br /> <br /> The plot, based essentially on the "She's All That" goblin, walks between parody and homage ("John Hughes High School"). Everything from 'American Beauty' to 'Varsity Blues' is extracted by reference. The result is ultimately an unsatisfactory viewing experience. The downside of giving us a plot of "She's All That" is that we all know where to go anyway. And if we didn't, then the jokes would be meaningless. <br /> <br /> There is very little to recommend here. The coarse token scene (an erupting toilet) seems misplaced out of all the "feel good" references. There are moments of humor - the song is quite funny and the strange good line is to send the way to the public. It stinks, don't look at it.
