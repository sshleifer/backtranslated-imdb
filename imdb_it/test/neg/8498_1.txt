This film is a gay love story disguised as a tale of graffiti and friendship. NO review has described this film as a gay love movie, and this is the weight of the plot. I don't know if this was to deceive people who otherwise wouldn't be interested in sitting down, expecting the film to be as it was marketed ... The film is out of the world of graffiti culture, abuse and defame graffiti culture, and acting it is abysmal. Oh yes, graffiti also sucks. This film was a smart way to hide the agenda of portraying young boys who become gay. Just look at the rest of the films with which the director was involved, they all contain the same topics. Boring to die for, not what I expected.
