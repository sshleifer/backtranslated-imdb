Camp Blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher film. We're mixing Friday 13 with the Blair Witch Project and adding ... a killer in a clown mask. <br /> <br /> The budget for this film must have been very low, some of the actors have played parts several times and the camera used has produced a photo equal to the colored version of the original Night Of The Living Dead, which someone saw that version claims that it is poor. <br /> <br /> This movie was just so bad. There is nothing in the film that is worth looking at. The very fact that I observed him stunned me. Just take my advice and don't buy or rent this movie. It's scary.
