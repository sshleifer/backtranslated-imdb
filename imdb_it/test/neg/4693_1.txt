First of all, IFC manages City and Country, and now this. The difference between that stinker and this Pink Panther scam is that City and Country were watchable. This is not. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the cast has signed up for this so that they can escape to Europe with someone else's coin. Belushi is particularly irritating. His scene with Candy (making a Z-level Dom DeLuise) was torture. Speaking of torture, five minutes of the innocent Shepherd, and I bet Gitmo's prisoners would break like nuts! <br /> <br /> The real "crime" (besides being illuminated by greenery) is the character of Shepherd: a mousy wife who takes a Monte Carlo casino for half a million dollars! If you buy it, I have some oceanfront properties in Arizona that might interest you!
