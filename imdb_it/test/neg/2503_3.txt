Wow. I felt like I needed to take a shower after seeing this, but maybe there were other reasons I will leave to your imagination. I felt used and abused after wacking, I intend to watch this movie. Hairy combs, thick mustaches, and well, all hairy describes this porn / horror movie, but hey, it was 1981, you can't call it "porn" in the 70s and 80s without the hair. <br /> <br /> Like a horror movie, this one bites. But as a piece of exploitation / porn of the rich Italian film history, it certainly has a place in my library. The copy I have is in Italian with English subtitles. I would have liked to have very little known English, I think it would have added to the sleaziness factor that already existed. The only white guy that is portrayed in the film is "Mark Shannon" - he is the mustachioed man he wears, a piece of hairy machismo that he tries and gives a performance whenever he "comes forward to beat". It was at the end of an era when porn producers were actually trying to do something artistic. Nothing like panning the camera from a tropical background to a hairy man who has a "dog" sex with a woman. I can't help laughing. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that I pray my future wife and children will never find.
