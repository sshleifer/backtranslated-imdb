sdiner82 had clearly not seen the film in decades, and its memory is frightening. His attempts to paint Mark Lester's shaving scene as a suspect are completely wrong, as are his erroneous comments about the bad "peeking at the baby's peeks". Lester is dressed the whole time the man is in the room, and the man barely looks at him. <br /> <br /> The scene is a crude attempt to show Lester's innocent curiosity about the man's body. > <br /> Like everything in this film, it's badly done, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> Also sdiner82's comments on the character of Savalas who "randomly sent a German family to death shoving their trailer from a cliff" is an absurdity (she was a single woman, she was already dead, and she was in a car). <br /> <br /> I suggest that the review of sdiner82 says much, much more about his, far from the liberal mentality, rather than on this worthless film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I even bothered to look for it, was out of curiosity to see if it had been created before or after Kojak. <br /> <br /> The film is a useless piece of junk from the 70s, but sdiner82's review is the worst kind of slander. It contains its review in pseudo-intellectual "facts", but the only fact is that it is wrong on almost all the "factual" questions it discusses. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that sdiner82 has seen exactly what it was looking for, which is disturbing. Now he can go back to burning copies of Catcher in the Rye.
