It is one of the imponderable factors of low budget independent film production that so many with so little real talent can imagine. The lack of talent shown by these dull wannabees is there for the whole world to see. Case in point: FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (or, as I quickly knew, SHITE OF THE LIVING DEAD). There is nothing wrong with paying homage to your heroes. I've done it many times over the years, myself, in many different ways. In fact, in Xlibris' book THE NIGHT RIDERS, written in collaboration with M. Kelley, I dedicate it, in part, to "the six writers whose work still inspires me: Richard Matheson, Harlan Ellison, Shirley Jackson, Edgar Allen Poe, HP Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard. "If it had been a film, I would have dedicated it to directors whose films have inspired me over the years. High on that list would have been George Romero. It is nothing less than a shame that the producers of this film were not really inspired by Romero as their title suggests.
