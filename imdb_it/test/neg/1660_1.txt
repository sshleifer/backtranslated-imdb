Have you ever thought, like after watching a horror movie with a group of friends: "Wow, it's so beautiful! We have to make a horror movie splatter from us a few days soon. I bet it's not as hard as it seems"? Well, this must have been what crossed the minds of the young Campbell brothers in 2003, presumably right after seeing "The Evil Dead" by Sam Raimi or a similar classic horror classic. This "summer of demons", however, is so ugly that it's embarrassing! These young amateur directors obviously adore the horror genre and know their classics, but this almost doesn't make them talented. I've seen quite a few B-movies in my years as a horror fanatic, but this honestly ranks as one of the greatest shit pieces ever made. And it's pretty sad to be so generous, because the whole cast and crew clearly had good intentions. There is virtually no script. A duo of thugs simply steals a mysterious book from a tramp and, while he reads some passages, one of them turns into a horrible demon who starts killing members of all the different groups of teenagers: big cocks, hot Catholic girls, drug addicts stone and troublemakers. That's all, except of course for all the obligatory cliches, like the sexy girl who falls in love with the biggest idiot, etc. Etc. The performances are really painful to listen to and none of these annoying teenagers use mimicry! They remain motionless until the script says it's their turn to interact. I hate that! Some make-up effects are remotely decent but not yet spectacular and the soundtrack contains some of the most terrible punk songs ever. This film should never have been published ... I can very well imagine that it was fun to be part of the production, but it is absolutely stupid and does not present the least ransom. Not even a little amateur nudity, damn it!
