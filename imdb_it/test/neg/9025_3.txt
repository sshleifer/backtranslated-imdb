Even John Wayne fans will have to die to believe this movie is a disaster. Wayne's character, John Tobin, is in search of the band that killed his parents, led by half Apache, a white negro half Pandro Zanti (Earl Dwire), posing as a Mexican. <br /> <br /> There are almost too many plot points to count, but the ones that stand out include Sheriff Williams (Jack Rockwell) who attacks a captured Zanti around his boot, so all that Zanti has to do to free himself is remove his boot! Tobin Dusty's friend (George pre-Gabby Hayes) takes a knife thrown in the back, and returns as new for the rest of the story. In a chase scene, Tobin rides a plume of luck through a drainage canal surrounded by log walls in the middle of a desert, and misses his mark, chases (actually he walks behind) Zanti walking through the desert. Zanti seeks relief and drinks from a pool of water, but OOPS! Has not seen the sign above the pool of water that reads "Do not drink poison". While Zanti collapses dead, Tobin resumes his hunt after the rest of the gang, and captures the whole lot by blowing up a cliff that seals a secret passage in Dusty's cabin: how comfortable it is. <br /> scene, the new sheriff Tobin is seen on the phone talking to the new Mrs. Tobin (Sheila Terry), the daughter of Dusty, Ruby, who previously was a kidnapped target of the band of Zanti . Apparently, the studio was intent on getting Wayne to take the girl in just about every movie they did with him, as this kind of ending is completely predictable for almost every Lone Star movie.
