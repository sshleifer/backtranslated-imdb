Ok, now I'm pretty sure my summary has caught your attention and my comment that Zazu Pitts is Satan is not without some basis. Let me explain. The film initially looks like a dandy B-movie about an evil organization called "The Crooked Circle" and their vow of revenge in the form of murder on a rival organization dedicated to solving crimes. While this is very strange (especially the idea of ​​a private club that solves crimes) and MAY have been interesting, this film falls apart despite a rather impressive list of family support actors. Why? Well, because Zazu Pitts (never one of my favorite actresses) spends most of the movie complaining like Olive Oyl with a bad toothache !! While the murders are committed, people are kidnapped or whatever, you can always count on Zazu whining at full volume - almost like the hateful 3-year-old girl who wants everyone at a party to pay attention to her! At the same time, it is NOT an integral part of the film, but has received the best billing. Because she's also there is beyond me - I assume it's just for whining and screaming. As a result, I found the movie practically unwatchable and was completely ruined. Now you probably know why I referred to this actress with a questionable talent as "Satan"! I'm sure that when the actors in this film saw the final product, they too felt more or less the same way I did it for its horrible exaggerated and amateur performance. <br /> <br /> This film is public domain and can be found for free download on the Internet. I can understand why.
