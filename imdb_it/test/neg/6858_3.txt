Maybe it's unfair for me to review this film because I came out very well before the end. It's weird, because I usually like Shakespeare on the screen and I enjoyed Midsummers Night's Dream once, many years ago, when I saw him on stage. <br /> <br /> I think two things have done to me: the shrill twerp with the Shakespearean name, Calista Flockhart and Michelle Feiffer sitting in a giant clamshell. Well, I suppose you could say it should be a comedy - but when the scenery is fun and the actors aren't, I'd say we have a bad movie in our hands ....
