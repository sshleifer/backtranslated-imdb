Eliza Dushku is a very talented and beautiful actress. He manages to be the stable center of "Tru Calling", but it's not enough to save his television series from mediocrity. It's a real shame that an attractive and talented woman like Dushku has to move from a substantial supporting role on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" to this clunker. <br /> <br /> Not original and desperate to be fashionable, "Tru Calling" fails to excite at any level above the hormone. The eponymous heroine spends much of her time running here and there for what must be a very small city, to prevent the death of the good-looking corpses she has already met in the morgue where she works. Despite all the racing he does, he always arrives with the air of having just come out of a portable air-conditioned dressing room. <br /> <br /> In each episode, Eliza Dushku and the rest of the cast have difficulty breathing life in bland and unscripted situations, but it is a useless exercise. "Tru Calling" lies right on the plate, fixing the ceiling without life.
