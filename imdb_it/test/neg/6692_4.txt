The strawberry blond has a fantastic script, but I just wish there was in Errol Flynn instead of James Cagney, she's not the person for the part. I think Olivia did a great job. This film is also a daytime dream, so it's hard to follow. I don't like the attitude of the male character; the way Cagney introduced had just arrived. I give him a 3 for the poor acting of the main male character. (If you like petty men who like to fight all the time and argue then this is your movie). The blond Strawberry would have been better if the main character had a more positive attitude, and changed the script to be happy to be with Oliva. <br /> <br /> This film emphasizes that money does not bring happiness, women are right jokes. Simple and simple is not the best film, but everyone has to decide for himself.
