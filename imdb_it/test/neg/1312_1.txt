This horrible effort only serves to show what happens when computers are not used only to generate effects, but also to allow them to process the plot and write the script. Someone somewhere has obviously come up with new software that asks some questions and produces four hours of vaguely connected clich√©s, bad dialogues and a series of characters that end up wishing they were all drowned in the first five minutes. <br /> <br /> Tom Courtney won the prize for the worst performance. To say it was made of wood would be an insult to the trees. It is difficult to criticize Robert Carlyle in almost everything he does, but the odds were also attributable to him in this, especially because it was for an inexplicable reason that required a catchy London accent. <br /> <br /> A complete washout.
