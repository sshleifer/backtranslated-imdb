Hi, everybody, oh boy ... This is a lulu. It has really bad background music whenever they manage to compress it. There are three villains that, I imagine, are the protagonists of this. They affect people and break people up and crash people into trucks and bulldozers. Usual things. <br /> <br /> The woman who is sending them on a mission is unable to move her mouth when she speaks. It's like watching a bad ventriloquist who is his dummy. He walks as if he were balancing an egg on his head. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe is a lifestyle of the 70s for men and blah for the female protagonist who should be a good nurse. The bad mouth of the novocaine wears red. A silk dress perhaps, or maybe just a too large poplin amphibian. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the ending though it didn't make much sense. It makes us understand what happened before in the film. <br /> <br /> The cops are OK. Some bad, some good, all stupid except two. The two brilliant could have worked in Hollywood again. <br /> <br /> The film starts out pretty interesting and ends with a surprise. The medium sucks. The guy in the diner giving a free hamburger to the star does a good job. He is like a protagonist of the 40s. Excellent voice. <br /> <br /> This is a little too long. The lady with the marbles in her mouth could only have had a couple of lines and the rest could have been told by a parrot. It would have been easier to understand a bird. <br /> <br /> His scene with a sword could have been handled by a trained woodpecker. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
