Ok, it's a movie for children, and it's not one of those movies that adults will like. However, there are some involuntarily funny moments, many of which involve holes in history. For example, the child needs a computer to bring his father back to normal and doesn't have the money. So he asks his father for pasta? No, STEALS IT is captured. Guys, if I ever become invisible, I will advance your allowance, okay? Also, while this guy is at the police station (undoubtedly accused of criminal acting), his beautiful blonde teacher arrives, announces who he is and where he works, then BUGGE THE SON OUTSIDE THE SLAM IN FRONT OF THE POLICEWIPS! To make matters worse, instead of making a quick getaway, then SEATED IN THE PARKED LOT OF THE POLICE STATION AND RESOLVED ON THEIR ACHIEVEMENT. You know, I hate to choose, but the boy has stolen something and should face the consequences, but maybe being in this movie is enough punishment. You avoid it all!
