I've seen worse, which is a backward way to say how crummy this film was. The plot is ridiculous: does a student shoot a police officer and five others take him hostage? In a poorly lit and smoky New York school - and somehow this clich√© hostage situation takes 24 hours to resolve? Are you serious? A one-day hostage situation - with a New York police officer wounded no less, does he take all day? I realize that this film was made before 9/11, but still. I looked at the clock and wondered how they could drag this excessive plot for another hour and 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> The acting was mediocre at best and the characters were designed by the seventh graders. The child who abuses children, the scared pregnant girl, the would-be violent band, an unfortunate confused victim, the wise-faced white boy. Please. <br /> <br /> Looking to transform this hostage situation into a mission for "more textbooks" and better school conditions? Please - this is a weak attempt to justify writing a film about a child shooting a cop. They are confused and ignorant idiots who are involved in a stupid situation. Not trying to paint them, suddenly, as a noble, the most laughable is Ziggy, who lives in the attic of the school and admires Michaelangelo so much that he paints these suggestive scenes on the walls. You are making a fool of me. <br /> <br /> The "no racism" signs in the protesting crowd? A black kid shoots a black cop and a black negotiator tries to fix it. This is a random message. <br /> <br /> I understand the general message, which has been badly portrayed, although some actors have taken respectable careers. <br /> <br /> Was this a sniper red sniper laser on the roof? The worst scene was the boy, the fake snow falling, dying in the arms of his friend on the roof, "promise me" etc. How original. <br /> <br /> The epilogue of "I went to jail but now I am pre-sworn at XYZ University" ... an appropriate way to end a movie joke.
