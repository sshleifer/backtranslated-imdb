Above all, you don't have to take this movie seriously. Unfortunately he takes himself seriously, but he can't be helped. This anime ninja flic must be the crowning glory of having ruined what could have been a captivating, if not original, story with negative twists, ridiculous scenes that kill time and an outrageous guest appearance that will make you laugh or moan (or both , like me). <br /> <br /> Although I am generally a fan of the ninja / samurai anime (Ninja Scroll and Rurouni Kenshin to name a few), this must be the exception. For the record, from a technical point of view of his time, this film was very well animated and built. It's just the plot that smelled. The authors of this film have clearly decided (for what rational reason I don't know) that they could somehow make up for the lack of a script if the character is halfway around the world in search of a treasure that (learns) his father fought and died for In the trial, saves a black slave named Sam, meets a French girl who lives in an Apache village, befriends a ninja clan whose members then try to kill him, meets more family members, then knows he has in more strange places and circumstances (and that all will subsequently die at some point in the film). <br /> <br /> Again, these ridiculous twists could be justified, but then the two "guest appearances" arrive. # 1: After serving a ridiculous showdown with two cowboys, Jiro meets a man who looks like "Mark Twain". At this point, you're probably saying "What the ****? !!" This "meeting" has a purpose: it completely discredits a film that tries to add to itself a historical cultured background. I found it disappointing that the authors met all these problems in US research in the 1860s and failed to understand that the real name of "Mark Twain" was Samuel Clemens. # 2: When Jiro finally finds the treasure, it turns out he belonged to Captain Kidd. I can hear the moans of disgust now. <br /> <br /> Finally, there are the scenes running. These scenes show various characters running, with the landscape moving statically behind them, for several minutes, and there are many. These are the scenes that make this film, 2 hours and 12 minutes, to seem to last a week and a half. <br /> <br /> If you and your friends are looking for a subtitled movie that just asks to be made fun of, this is. Feel free to make fun of every aspect possible and have fun. Just don't take it seriously. 3/10
