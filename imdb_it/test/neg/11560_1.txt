Some movies are simply stupid beyond explanation. This is one of them. Words cannot do justice to acting in wood, to stupid plot and to the always predictable result. About the only thing that makes this movie halfway worth watching are the poorly dressed women (and the dumb guy for you women) in it. The head of the female warriors and Valeria are quite attractive to the eye. But that's all that this movie has in store. <br /> <br /> A bit of stupidity: a scene, when they begin to travel to the dark lair, are moving away from an apparently destroyed land. But we clearly see a New York of the 1980s behind them. About 2/3 of this film looks like it was shot in a high school basement. The puppets of deadly calibers seem as scary as a sesame street monster. I have to say that I agree with Latronic that many 50s garbage films have done a better job than this. The only one I can think of was not Teenagers from Outer Space.
