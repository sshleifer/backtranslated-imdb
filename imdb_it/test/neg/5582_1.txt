It's amazing how a movie can take so much time and effort and end up being still abominable. For those of you who appreciate the meticulous special effects and inconceivable details in every shot you will watch this film in awe. Simply because Predator Island does not contain any of this. It's a redundant remake of every horror monster movie in the last two decades. Now I appreciate the bad horror films, they have a certain glow of humor in the most dramatic circumstances. However, if your goal is to create a memorable work that will be so swallowed up in the Cult Hall of Fame, my first suggestion is to find some imagination / creativity and get some talent. Oh, and some extra money to put in your photo. <br /> <br /> A tradition of horror films has been to shock the public with violent deaths and cold blood. However, the shock is not delivered for more than a few seconds. To really evoke a satisfying reaction from the paying crowd there should be character development, some identifiable traits. I know, you're probably saying this guy isn't providing anything smart to the directors, he's just stating an amateur remark. Well, this will show you how beloved these directors are. <br /> <br /> While having to go through the horror of watching this film, there was a positive side. The performance of Dan Gordon as Chris is splendid. He is not given anything to work with in a script, yet he is able to get out of that movie that looks like a star. Of all the actors he is the only one who believes in what he is acting. He not only provides the public with someone we can identify with, but we also have someone we look forward to watching so we can go through the rest of the film. Gordon shows a genuine talent and the ability to perform quality jobs and overcome a huge obstacle, being the rest of the cast. Dan Gordon will be a star, hopefully sooner or later. That is to say if he will be able to escape films like this that hold him back.
