This is so provocative a DVD rental movie. I'm a big fan of the cast members, but the plot never won me over. Don't expect "Oh brother where you are" in some form or shape. The funniest part for me is when the war hero explains what happens in the Argon. It looks like they were trying to copy some fun Clooney facial expressions from "Oh brother where are you" but you could tell they were rehearsing for that. John Krasinski was the bright spot and he was solid everywhere. Renee Zellweger plays the part of a zealous reporter willing to do anything for the story. Overall it's a film that is worth looking at home.
