This film is really BAD, there is nothing interesting or valuable about it, except for the beautiful settings: the Chilean landscape. I know I have to provide four lines as a comment for this film, but the fact is that it's such a bad film, that I can only say that it's actually BAD. Michael Ironside is the only one who saves money in the film.
