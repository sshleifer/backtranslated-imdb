When film buffs hear two popular scoundrels / characters they fight, they will crowd into theaters to see how the battle ends. There's Freddy vs. Jason, in which two very popular horror icons try to kill each other. And, more like this, there is Godzilla vs. (Enter the name here). But the very generic Komodo vs Python is just a horrible title, and an even worse premise. Obviously, the film is a D-list photo, but, at least, it has a more convincing name, perhaps something that can deceive the unconscious viewer into looking at it. With a name like this, you know what you're participating in. <br /> <br /> A group of military men / women, including a sexy 20-year-old female scientist, is left dead by the military an island inhabited by a giant Komodo dragon. As long as they can leave the island and the boat, they'll be fine, but ... no ... there's a giant python guarding the ocean and on. We hope that all these guys can get rid of the island, and that Python and Komodo don't meet in a kind of horrible special-effect battle. <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie is bad in almost every way. The acting is pretty bad, or maybe it's that the special effects are so poor, that the acting is incredible because nobody believes that these people are in danger with creatures that seem to be made on a computer from the 90s. However, this movie is actually pretty funny. The creatures look so lousy, and the actors really pretend to be in danger. <br /> <br /> I'd like to say that this movie is a steaming pile of sh * squawk! * ... but I can not. This film classified as PG-13 actually emits an acoustic signal. Whenever a curse word comes, a parrot noise beeps. Even the words that can be said on the television network. How * cackling * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * cheap emitting words and with a parrot no less In the end these parrot noises struck me and I couldn't help but laugh at the incompetence. <br /> <br /> This movie is awful, from the silly start to the ridiculous end of the Night of the Dead living style, but it's also kind of fun. Like a horror movie it fails miserably, like an action movie, it fails slightly less, but still quite badly, and like a comedy shines. <br /> <br /> My rating: * on ****. 95 minutes PG-13 for some violence and Squawked cursing.
