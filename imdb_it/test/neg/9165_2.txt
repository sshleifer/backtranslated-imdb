I went to this film with almost high expectations after having loved the cartoon series of my childhood, and this almost destroyed that love for me. Jason Lee, David Seville in the film, is horrible. I understand that it can't be easy to act with CGI characters that aren't really there, but I really found his performance atrocious, along with all the other non-animated characters. The squirrels were adorable, but sometimes clearly obvious in moving the plot of the story, and so they didn't tempt me to stay in the theater for more than half an hour in the film. If you feel you have to watch this movie, rent it to the maximum. It is NOT worth the eight dollars to see it in theaters, unless you like a good laugh at the horrible acting.
