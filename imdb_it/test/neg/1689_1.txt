I hate, disdain and hate this movie with a passion that makes the hot doors of hell look cool by comparison. it is nothing but a country journey, terrifying and completely poor along the way of memory at that time so horrible, the 70s, a decade I'm happy not to be part of it if this absolute trite is all that was on offer! <br /> <br /> the animation is dated smelly, not least with its sticky, missing frames and characters with huge bulbous heads, this film is a nuisance to the eyes. from the wise, hello to parents with the strangely gay sea horse, and it is hand movement camp and kenneth williams-esque voice, for the openly innocent hymn, High Cockalorum, this film, I am sad to say, is one who has been forced on me as a child and I have never fully recovered from the terror that caused me .... <br /> <br /> This horrible display of total fitness should carry an R certificate, so it's disturbing in its content!
