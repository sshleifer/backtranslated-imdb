Jesus Franco is rather inconstant in his films and I would say that it was a lack, that is, unless you are taken by a total stupidity. I will say that man has an eye for a good dose, even if he involves topless women with machine guns standing out against the ocean. This is overall quite ridiculous and the acting is horrible, but acting is the last of what it is. And what is it? Well, it's about 102 minutes of lesbianism, the women who collect and shovel under the scorching sun for no apparent reason, and almost everything that can be endured and maybe even a little. The most remarkable (?) It is a scene that involves a young woman who is tied to a chair and a seemingly loving German shepherd, and while what is happening is simply implicit (fortunately) it is probably a scenario that I could have done without. I would classify it with Tender Flesh as one of Franco's films that I would rather not have in my collection, although the music is jazz and fun. 4 out of 10, yecch.
