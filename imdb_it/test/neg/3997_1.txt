I realized before watching this film that it would be a low budget gore film. But even with those low standards this movie doesn't cut it. <br /> <br /> The problem is not so much that the filmmakers had a low budget or had bad acting, writing, directing, sound, music and editing. I expected this to go wrong, and it is. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this film is that it has not even done a good job on the liver and blood. Most of the "action" takes place off the screen and all we see are the side effects, which seem very fake, even for low-budget film standards. <br /> <br /> There is really no excuse why the blood is so badly done. At the same time, Peter Jackson made the "Bad Taste" just as low budget and somehow was able to create guts and gore much more convincing than those shown in this film. <br /> <br /> A failure on almost every level, I can't recommend this movie to anyone. Avoid it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
