I'm not really sure where to start. From beginning to end, bad, bad-smelling, like entering a port-john on a 100-degree day. If you force yourself to look at this as I did, keep some Vicodin handy for the pain. I'll never understand how bullets of this type can get past the cutting room without the entire reel ending up on the floor. The film is a cross between Gumby rides Pokey, meets the terminator, meets Wally Beaver playing cowboys and Indians without the cowboys. I saw a better animation in the original Blob cut. You will get more fun from looking at Gone With the Wind while suffering from vomiting and poop. Bad acting and hockey lines will make you squirm and wish you had rented Peewee's Big Top or watched every Gilligan's Island episode back to back. UGH ... Now I cut my wrist.
