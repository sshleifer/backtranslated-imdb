I hated the book A boy meets an intelligent dog, gets a virgin girl, and all the time they are chased by an assassin and a monkey beast (both want the dog). Dean Koontz can't really write (I read the book on my sister's advice, I should have known better). When I saw it (mostly due to a morbid curiosity), in reality I found myself criticizing him for the fact that the book was not true, even if this is a book that is impossible to make a good film. I thought that at least if they were going to make a film adaptation of the worst book I've ever read, filmmakers might even be accurate. They turned the boy and his virgin love interest into a boy and his mother, for some reason that bothered me more than anything (although I seriously doubt to keep him a boy and his chick wouldn't improve). Simple enough; bad book, bad movie, I don't see it.
