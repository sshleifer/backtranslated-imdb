Ridiculous would be a good term to describe this film. But since this film does not deserve anything good, he said that I will use the term god-bad. <br /> <br /> Centering around the adventures of a group of eco-warriors investigating a semi-tropical island in the infamous actions of the army, the lack of a budget quickly becomes evident. Michael Pare (a real actor! But only in the sense that Pinocchio was a real boy ...) leads the group of madmen through a series of chase scenes and monster-madness victim. There is a vague attempt at pseudo-science to explain the presence of giant reptiles, but it convinces both the spectator and the acting. <br /> <br /> As if this did not insult the viewer enough, the film also presents what I will call "Infinite ammunition guns". I've never seen Mickey Parrot or his side kick change clips once during the whole movie, yet I can positively report that they cover at least 40 shots each in every scene where they are forced to shoot their weapon. Forty rounds might not seem so many, but we're talking standard guns here. 15 round clip calculation, top. And remember, they never change clips, nor do they seem to carry extra ammunition. <br /> <br /> It is nonsense like this that delivers films to the eternal fires of celluloid hell, and rightly so. The third category CGI does little to help things and acting is better to laugh, otherwise you will start crying. Because the SciFi Channel churns out this mush repeatedly, no one knows. <br /> <br /> My advice .... from one to the other ... a very wide anchorage!
