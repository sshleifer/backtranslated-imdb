Two stars <br /> <br /> Amanda Plummer looks like a young version of her father, Christopher Plummer in drag, starring in this film with Robert Forster - who really should have put a black shoe over that bald spot. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Amanda Plummer in a good movie. He always plays these characters a bit extravagant in films that don't add up, and he still does it in this. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have two young women, sisters, who do not resemble each other in any way, who let themselves be taken, separately, by questionable men along the streets. <br /> <br /> The character of Amanda, Sandra, has at least a good reason to allow Dr. Jake (Robert Forster) to take her in the first place. She was taken astray, apparently by a maniac, and her car is practically destroyed. <br /> <br /> Notice - Spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> However, as we move forward, we realize that Dr. Jake is not playing with a complete deck any more than Amanda is. It takes every decision based on a coin toss. <br /> <br /> When Dr. Jake and Amanda arrive at a motel, who do we see if not the car of the maniac, and what does Amanda do if she does not enter her wagon station and start looking around. It is never clear what his motive was for doing this, considering that the man is apparently dangerous and could try to kill her. One might think that the last thing he would do is put himself in such a precarious situation. <br /> <br /> Not just snoop around, but find some money and take it. <br /> <br /> Shortly after we have several other things that do not add up. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jake, with Amanda as his passenger, runs out of gas, and the two of them leave the car and start walking. One might think of crossing a desert, he would have checked his gas meter - this seems a very unlikely thing for him to allow to happen. Then later, he is seen driving the same car. When or how did you recover the car? <br /> <br /> Dr. Jake tells Amanda that he knows he took the money. Now how would he know? He didn't see it done as far as I know, and she didn't tell him she did. <br /> <br /> Then later we have a character named Santini (David Thewlis), the man who was driving the station wagon, I would give them a ride and I'll be damned if he doesn't know that Amanda took the money. How would he know? <br /> <br /> Losing credibility at an alarming rate further we go. <br /> <br /> When Alice, Amanda's sister (Fairuza Balk) enters the killer's clutches and decides her destiny on a coin toss - one would think it would be very, very careful that the currency she exchanges for Made-up coin would surely be the trick money - but apparently it is not. <br /> <br /> These are strident things like this, which destroy any credibility that this film could have had.
