If you look at the series and love the championship, then prepare me to be disappointed. I went to the movies with a group of diehard league fans and we all agreed that this movie wasn't as funny or obscure as the three previous series. In my personal opinion, it was a spinner of money. The writing was invented and the plot confused - there is no confusion only confused with what he was trying to do. It was the worst kind of self-indulgence by writers who are far more talented than my pitiful criticism. I hope the championship can be quite honest with itself and recognize this film as inferior to the superb three series. I won't buy it even though it has most of the league's memorabilia.
