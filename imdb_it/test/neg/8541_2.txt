A group of adventurers goes to the "dark continent" to try to identify a lost heiress named Diana, who disappeared years earlier in a plane crash, and who now believes she is alive with a savage tribe who considers her their goddess. <br /> <br /> Once again, my search for squalid European cannibal films took me deep into the territory of Jess Franco, a seemingly endless film region teeming with sub-par screenplays, crawling with movie-camera , and abundant with a terrible recitation (Franco's regular Lina Romay this time won the prize for her painful performance of a sick elderly woman). It is here, in this hellish place, that I finally stumbled upon Diamonds of Kilimanjaro, an abysmal jungle-based exploiter so stupendously bad that it took me three consecutive nights to finish watching it. <br /> <br /> Tawdry and unstoppable boring, even by Franco's standards, this arduous piece of garbage fails at almost every level: the story is a terribly boring derivative of the Tarzan of Edgar Rice Burrough, albeit with a feminine touch; the film seems to have been filmed in local botanical gardens, although the grainy images are poorly integrated into the film in a useless effort to convince viewers that the action is actually taking place in Africa; and the scenes of death are practically bloodless (usually Franco can be invoked for some splatters, but despite the initial appearances, this is not a cannibal film and is not so bloody). <br /> <br /> Where the director happens, however, in his casting of the young and sexy Katja Bienert as jungle-bait Diana. Running and jumping through the undergrowth in nothing but a neat little shirk, his sinuous body that dispenses with the fact that he was only sixteen at the time, this unmarried beauty makes an impression. Franco also throws some other nudity courtesy of Mari Carmen Nieto as traitorous traveler Lita (who gives us a taste of her wild regions), and Aline Mess as topless warrior woman Noba, thus avoiding getting another rating of 1 / 10 from me (although I'm sure he will receive many more in the future ?? I still have a lot of his films to see).
