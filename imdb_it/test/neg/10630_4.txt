I'm a big fan of Amy Adams and have been for many years. I'm also a big fan of musicals. That said, this is not a good movie at any level. It's rather boring and the acting is very poor overall. Amy Adams is embarrassed to watch acting with Scott G. Anderson due to the fact that she is in another league when it comes to acting. All the performances are very amateur. Musical performances are pleasant, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Scott G. Anderson is just a bad actor! I thought it was included in this film because it has a great voice, but it's not the case. He has a medium voice and sings in key, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I think I can understand why Amy Adams made this film with the song element, I just wish she hadn't. I could complain about other poor elements in this film, but I'll leave it to this.
