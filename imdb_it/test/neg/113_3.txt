A group of heirs of a mysterious old villa discovers that they must live in it as part of a clause in the will or be disinherited, but they soon find out from his story all those who lived there before they died strange accidents or killed each other. <br /> <br /> You have seen it all before, and this is too low budget and slow to be scary, and has no surprise in the climax. No special effect or gore to talk about, in fact the only really funny thing about the whole film is the quality of the English dubbing, which is sometimes as bad as a cheap martial arts film. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10, quite low in the order of the 80s ghost movies.
