With an interesting premise (in conflicts between Europeans and indigenous peoples sometimes the battle lines were not so clear), this should have been a good movie. But the story is sabotaged by the director's overwhelming infatuation with his twin intelligence with a very poor script. <br /> <br /> Yes, the natural setting is beautiful and, yes, the film is authentic for its historical setting of the 19th century. But the filmmaker continues to gild the lily over and over again, adding layers upon layers of exaggerated musical accompaniment, not to mention a completely useless voiceover to the soundtrack, which will eventually flood the viewer and, drawing attention to If you do, take away the story. <br /> <br /> For me it was clear that the director, with his microscopic close-ups and the infinite recurrence of the musical motif of "Danny Boy" (of all things!) was trying to make a New Zealand version of a epic film by Sergio Leone, something about the order of Once Upon A Time In The West. But given the seriousness of the plot (most of Leone's westerns were ironic), not to mention the fact that it is no longer 1968, he manages to make a parody of one. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
