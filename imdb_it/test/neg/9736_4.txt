Despite working for the worst government of the 20th century, Erwin Rommel is generally considered by historians and fans of the Second World War as a gentleman, soldier of a soldier and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare. If only Hitler had given him the troops and material he had wanted in Africa, the discussion was going, things would have gone very differently. And it's probably true. Rommel was, in effect, a military genius and, by all accounts, an honest and honest man. <br /> <br /> But this film goes out of its way to portray him as a saint. He does his job, trying to win the war for Hitler, but constantly the Fuhrer interferes and gives him ridiculous orders, which Rommel (James Mason) expresses astonishment, but rarely actually questions and never, never disobey. Only when it is evident that Hitler is bringing Germany to ruin, Rommel thinks of treason against him; this dilemma is the main theme of the film, a good man in bad condition tries to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> Mason is as good as Rommel, but it is certainly not a memorable performance along the lines of, say, George C. Scott as Patton. Of course, Rommel was not as colorful as Patton, but this film is so intent on making it look like a decent human being who forgets to make it interesting. Occasionally drops in some heat when with his wife Lucie (a young Jessica Tandy, well cast), but usually Mason is called to give a severe British performance ?? as if the British were trying to claim Rommel for themselves (although in all honesty all the Nazis have English accents except Hitler). Cheaply made, with scenes of battles flowing through footage and the beaches of Southern California doubling for Tunisia, there is nothing to recommend particularly in this film. A remake could be interesting (I would choose Ed Harris only for a slight physical resemblance and, well, Harris can act) if he was slightly flavored, but this film showed me mostly how much we are more demanding as spectators in the last fifty years; such a bland biography would no longer cut it.
