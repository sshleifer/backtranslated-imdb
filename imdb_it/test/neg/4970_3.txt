I saw the trailer for this film and found the cinematography and what was presented interesting. I saw the evaluation of IMDb and 6.8 confirmed that it was an above average film. So he went to see it. <br /> <br /> The story is about Mandy Lane (Amber Heard) ?? a beautiful girl in high school who is a subject of male sexual desire. The provocation of Emmet (Michael Welch) of Mandy to another fellow student to show his love for Mandy, leaves the fellow student drunk and jump down to death. Nine months go by and Mandy was invited for a summer weekend on a ranch secluded by her teenage friends ?? there are three girls and three boys! There is a Garth security guard (Anson Mount) working on the ranch. Do the killings take place during the first night? one by one the members of the group are killed. Who is behind the killings? I will not say here to ruin the sport ?? Did I like the movie? NO. After the usual interesting opening ?? the film takes a downward turn with every event. At the interval in which the killer is revealed, all interest in the remaining proceedings is lost. There is a last turn in the story that upsets the spectators, but rather it made me shake my head in disapproval and laugh! All this for suspense? Eh ??! Amber Heard plays and plays her role well as a shy and conscious girl ?? who is aware of her beauty and the desire of men for her. Is the remaining cast usually ?? nothing to say There are so many movies made of teenage boys and girls going to a secluded place and slowly someone kills them one by one ?? that I don't care anymore. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Levine tries to make the film interesting by using contemporary chat dialogues of teenagers, full of sexual nuances, but does not allow the film to rise above the banal. <br /> <br /> The only and most attractive saving grace of the film is your cinematography by Darren Genet ?? who captures perfect images with perfect images!
