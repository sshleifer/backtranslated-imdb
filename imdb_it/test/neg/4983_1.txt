God, I've never felt so insulted in my whole life than with this shit. There are so many ways to describe this piece of shit, which I think if I had said everything that came to mind, I would have been banned from this site. <br /> <br /> How can I start? Well, first of all, it doesn't take the knowledge of the original series to know that this film is a slap in the face to those who saw it. Here, from a metal version, to a terrible RAP VERSION, the biggest slaughterhouse of an unrealized acronym, what were they thinking? How does Underdog and an electronically heavy musical style coincide? The story is so elementary, that I will do something I don't usually do and I don't even make a summary. Think about this: a dog gets super powers, complete the rest. This film is so predictable. And then the jokes arrive ... please kill me now. This style of humor that might not even make children laugh is so bad, well, wait for that joke after sneezing. It was a little strange. <br /> <br /> But what surprises me most is why Jason Lee (Ny Name Is Earl), Patrick Warburton (Emperor's New Groove) and Jim Belushi (according to Jim) are all here. In the shows / films I mentioned, the actors, in my opinion, do a good job and, excluding Lee, they are the best actors in this film, but this says very little. The rest deserves the Golden Rasberry nominations for this shit. I am very sad to see these good actors buried by this disaster. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's just as bad as Doogal, which I've reviewed too, and again, my head would explode if I saw something worse than this
