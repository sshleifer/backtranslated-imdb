My mother and I rented this movie. I mean, we love that kind of science fiction movie, whether it's big Hollywood movies or Indy's films. <br /> <br /> But oh, we have been deceived !! Two journalists are investigating a UFO abduction in a small Texas town. Halfway, all the sudden things become all Christian about us. My mother and I believe in God, Jesus and the devil, but the way this movie preached him made it boring. All I have to say is that we are Christians, but we also like to have fun. So don't blame the Christians as a whole, only blame the Christians who need to suck the fun in this movie. <br /> <br /> In fact you can clearly understand the position of the directors on UFOs, and that is that he believes he is all demonic. Now I could say a few words, but I won't. All I will say is, DO NOT WATCH this movie unless you want to be preached. In fact, many times he claims that we must be perfect to enter heaven. Well, the last time I checked, the only perfect person died on a cross.
