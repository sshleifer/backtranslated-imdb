This film was, among the 67 of the 71 best photos I saw, by far the worst. First of all, I found the plot a bit absurd - the absent husband for 25 years / still in love / not even a letter! Give me a break. And why is the guy who was absent for so long working by coincidence with an oil platform next to the congress women's day? This film has also exhibited some of the worst stereotypes of African Americans I've ever seen. Gone With the Wind (see Prissy) looks decidedly progressive! I just saw a movie that I didn't like very much. UGH!
