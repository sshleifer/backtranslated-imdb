You know I've only seen 15 minutes of this movie, so I can't really describe how beautiful it is. I mean the concept alone is so original and intriguing that it didn't let me go. Then there is the mass of people who reward the academic award and the director nominated for the academic award. YOU CAN NOT miss. I mean, I guess it's in the middle of the night and you don't sleep yet. This film turns on. You look at it and you're shocked. It's so bright, so original that it's so BIG. It will seem like you turned off the screen half an hour later, but as you go to bed you see that it is only 15 minutes past midnight. HAVE FUN !!! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
