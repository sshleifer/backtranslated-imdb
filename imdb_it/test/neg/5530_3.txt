I'm so glad I took this movie for $ 5. The anime is expensive, no doubt. I kept an eye on this for a while and finally saw it for sale. I grabbed it immediately and took it home only to soften my head. This movie sucked. I've heard people talk about how bloody and violent this film is. It is not really so bloody or violent. I looked at it three times and I think I've wasted enough of my life on this. Demons get a point to be unique and a little cold at times. Sex gets a point because it's almost non-stop. The horny old man is half a point to get excited and still have sexual desire. And the main character (the name I deleted from my mind) gets a half point for the fashionable design of his gun. I've seen important connections between this film and Demon City Shinjuku. Both have an animation of the same style, it's obvious because of the director, they both have limping soundtracks that suck like the Antichrist, and both have a terrible end. Avoid this movie unless you like anime sex.
