I hadn't planned to look at O12 because I didn't like O11 so much. I thought O11 was a nice but a bit boring film of bank robbers with a sensational arsenal of stars. Anyway, I talked to O12 one night and regretted it a lot. The plot is not only boring, but also senseless. I honestly don't even know what it was. I left the movie after 3 quarters and had a coffee with another girl who didn't like it. Much more pleasure than I can tell you. But even the boys who stayed until the end later told me that the plot continued to be horrible and useless. My advice: don't look Go see the America team (hilarious btw ;-)) and forget about Ocean's Twelve. <br /> <br /> In my opinion the most boring and senseless peace of shit to be on the screen for years.
