It's not just that the film is lame. It's more than that. This film is not necessary. Do we need another westerner? How about a western with African Americans in the title roles? Seems stupid, implausible and a lame attempt to modernize the genre? IS. Incredibly lame and simple. It's like that lame movie by Baz Luhrman "Romeo and Juliet", where he set it in modern times to attract young people and create a bit of hype with his revamping of a classic story. Well, Baz Luhrman has failed miserably and so does this mess. The story is actually not bad, but the idea of ​​removing racism from a racist genre with the cast of an African American cast is racist in itself. He is also childish and simple (as Baz Luhrman-man is a bad director). Hey (I hear you say) this was directed by Mario Van Peebles! It's also in the movie! How can he be racist? It is not. I said that the idea of ​​merging all African Americans instead of Caucasians was. The film is not racist, it's just useless, stupid and very very boring.
