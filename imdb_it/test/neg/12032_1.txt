A low budget can be an excuse for poor acting talents and pathetic fake gussets. However, it is not an excuse to write badly. It is a talent to be able to write a dialogue without making the sound seem forced and mechanical. The dialogue in this film was on par with most of the instructional videos shown to the fast food staff in training. <br /> <br /> I also understand that you have to make some exceptions when it comes to acting talent when you only have $ 20 to spend on it. That said, no serious director would have watched these scenes and said "it was perfect". I see a better character acting on Canadian television. <br /> <br /> This film has a subtle plot, bad acting, poor dialogue and contains no intelligent ideas at all. This just shows me that some independent films are like that for a reason. If you're looking for a quick scare, rent something else. The "Cable Guy" was also a scarier movie. After watching this movie, I think it would have been better to watch a new X-files execution.
