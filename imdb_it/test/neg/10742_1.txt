--------- SPOILER NOTICE ---------------------------- <br /> <br /> This was the the worst of the series, is the horror disguised as political satire and is as thin as a mallet, not very scary and not very perceptive. Michael Moore has something to do with this piece of Garbage.? <br /> <br /> I'm really sick of Hollywood that uses entertainment as a political campaign against George Bush and constantly repeating the same discussion points over and over again. This film wants to be DeathDream, but unlike that film that subtly addresses the problems of soldiers returned from Vietnam by making sure that the main character returns as a bloodthirsty zombie and slowly built on this theme: it was a true horror film was also a good social commentary, because it was not honest, exploited and beloved. I think Joe Dante thought this was trying to make a horror film to scare republicans, conservatives and libertarians and that I'm the last on that list found this film totally ridiculous, manipulative and exploitative at the same time and I don't mean the good kind of exploitative, which you often find in "drive-in" films, I mean exploitation in the most disgusting and vile way: using the death of our soldiers as a manipulative political declaration masked by a horror film. <br /> <br /> This film assumes that all the soldiers who died in Iraq would have voted against a conservative president if they returned to life as zombies, which is a mistaken premise, because as I remember for the most part and following the rules of George Romero; zombies are senseless creatures, they eat meat, they work with pure impulse and even if the zombie Andy, in DeathDream, could talk, he couldn't hold a conversation and was driven by his dependence on human blood. Ok, zombies are mindless creatures driven by impulse and not intellect and of course they are dead, so why would the dead be allowed to vote in the first place? My interpretation of this film is that the only war that a liberal democrat could win is to have beggars, the dead vote for him, I imagine they mean that the people who vote for presidents like George Bush are the mindless zombies , while the true mindless zombies are actually the ones who make intellectual decisions. Yeah whatever. Dawn of the Dead approached this idea much better, but had the idea of ​​senseless consumerism. This film is not Dawn of the Dead by any effort of imagination. <br /> <br /> The film addresses the problem while the soldiers are alive that the majority of them voted for a president like Bush, but after death they would vote for a Liberal Democrat after being zombies, who are normally considered brain creatures death and ridiculously destroyed them after voting. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a zombie movie, Mr. Dante and invoke the name of George Romero in it, it is better to have brainless zombies who like to rip people off and eat their intestines, not zombies that vote . I also like the way the zombies make the "bad" conservatives who support the war. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie with social commentary, skip this piece of badly done and favorite garbage and watch DeathDream instead. <Br /> <br /> The worst of the Master of Horror series is speechless.
