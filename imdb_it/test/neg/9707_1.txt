If you've never heard of Jane Austen, seen the original film or the BBC adaptation of 1995, or even seen a pop-up version of the book, then this farce attempt to show this classic love story can be vaguely considered bearable. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene, this film must be remembered for its terrible acting, abominable miscasting and complete lack of Jane Austen's classic genius. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has decided to cast actors (except the excellent Judi Dench) who obviously has never heard of Jane Austen, let alone read it, should be punished! Keira Knightley makes faces and smiles through every scene, and realizes that she is so hateful that nobody would want to marry her! Darcy looked as if he was trying to remember his lines throughout the film and the rest of Bennet's girls were interchangeable in their lack of portraying their characters as they had originally been written. <br /> <br /> This version failed to show the right Pride and Prejudice suffered by both Darcy and Elizabeth and, at the end of the longest two hours of my life, who cared whether they joined or not! Absolutely abysmal - even the few minutes of Judi Dench cannot save this garbage. I can't think of anything good to say about this movie other than the fact that it's finally over!
