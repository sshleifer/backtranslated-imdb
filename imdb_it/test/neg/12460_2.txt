SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 2 out of 10 for 2 scenes that I will never forget ..... by the way, my husband rented this amazing non-em up almost chick looking for a movie ... but I guessed why when I saw the cover ... girls in school uniforms .... duh .... lol .... ah well, men if you can't beat them with them. .... ;-) <br /> <br /> Bijou Philips, one of my favorites on the independent screen ... too cute ... not only enters into the bestiality (his toy dog ​​is the best lesbian in town according to his sparkling and outrageous character .. .. would be the first scene worthy of being .. <br /> <br /> Then he goes into a bathroom in a nice dressing gown and goes to a stall .... after a while she gets up, goes out to the party where she and the pathetically sad character of "Cat" are, and hands a bucket of silver ice to the party guest ... the guest looks in his precious silver bucket and says "oh the my god is poop ". <br /> <br /> I love Bijou Phillips for his creativity and his unusual film choices, this would surely be one of them .... er, I would rent it for the poop scene if I were in you ..... I'm not a big joke fan of jokes, but surely it puts the "people in celebration" in their place (it doesn't seem that they had fun anyway ..... lol) ... You will never forget these two scenes ... hmm, but is that what we want in our databases? .... Maybe you shouldn't follow my advice to everyone .... lol <br /> <br /> Dominique Swain is kind of furious and sad in his confused absurd role in 'Tart'. I don't know, I can't decide if I like her because she's like that in indie movies ?? The independent films are fantastic and all, but have they failed to pick some good ones? I'm going to take a look at some of his films and judge the judgment ... but this was (sorry the reference to the beasts) a dog .....
