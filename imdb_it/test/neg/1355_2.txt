As a Spanish tourist in Los Angeles and a fanatic fanatic I made a terrible mistake. I went to see "The women" The remake of one of my favorites ever. I've seen the original many times, in fact I own it. My hurry to see the remake was based on Diane English, the woman responsible for "Murphy Brown" My thought was: how bad can it be? You must know what you are doing. Well, I don't know what to say. I don't understand what happened. Botoxed women are a rather depressing affair. Meg Ryan or whoever played Mary - it looked a bit like a grotesque version of Meg Ryan ... another actress who maybe wears a Meg Ryan mask - doesn't bring to the character anything that Norma Shearer did in 1939. The new is a tired prototype, unconvincing of what has become a farce within a farce. The "friends" Annette Bening, Debra Messing, Jada Pinket Smith are disconnected like anything else I've ever seen and if this wasn't enough: Eva Mendes in the role of Crystal, the character created by Joan Crawford in one of her best shows and funniest . The casting of Eva Mendes is actually the manifest sign of how wrong it is, how ill-conceived this commercial attempt turned out to be. I have not given a 1 out compared to Candice Bergen and Cloris Leachman
