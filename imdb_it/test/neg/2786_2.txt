I woke up and it was a beautiful day; the sun was shining, the birds were singing and I imagined I had a movie, something new, a horror movie maybe? Like many other reviewers, I came across what can only be described as a piece of poop√© in a gold wrapper. The cover is fantastic, and the comment on the back is mesmerizing - "I'll scare the harvest" ... oh, like giggles looking at naivety and ignorance. <br /> <br /> One of these the many scariest things about this film are the acting skills of these "actors". I think, no, actually I rejoiced when they were cut by these "scarecrows", who wore some classic masquerade costumes. I used to drive cornfields pretty quickly, because I found them pretty scary at night, but having seen this movie, I almost got wet (laughing so much) just by sight. <br /> <br /> I honestly saw the scariest omelette, not mine, but I'm good at cooking omelettes, and if anyone associates this movie with my omelette, let's say I'd like to create a situation where they would be forced to watch this movie 3 times in a row. <br /> <br /> If anyone has good corn films (crop non pop) that they can recommend, feel free to inform me. It's a great comedy if nothing else, OK, it's nothing else. Have fun, but a little advice: before pressing the play button on your DVD player, throw it out the window.
