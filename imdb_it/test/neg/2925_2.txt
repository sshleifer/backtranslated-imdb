33% of the nation's Nazis who still support W. Bush would do well to see this film, which shows the consequences of the French revolution and the terror of 1794 as surprisingly similar to the post-9/11 socio-political landscape. Maybe then they might stop worrying about saving face and taking the ** a whupping they deserve. It is really a pity that when a politician ruins the country, those who voted for him cannot be denied the right to vote again. They have clearly shown that they have no sense of character. <br /> <br /> What stands out in this film is the ambiguity of a disrespectfully doctrinal character like Robespierre; a man haunted and emptied that a simplistic and reductive ideology cannot help him to clarify the boundaries between security and totalitarianism. Execution and murder. Self-defense and patriotism. His legalistic litmus tests add to the desperate situation he helped create. Does she look like any belligerent, overpriced, retarded Yale cheerleader you know? <br /> <br /> Wojciech Pszoniak wipes the Deparidieu off the screen. As nice as Robespierres is, it is comforting to know that, shortly after the film ends, he will be ejected from the jaw and sent to the guillotine.
