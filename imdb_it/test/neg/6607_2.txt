There are three main problems with the film. Or rather there are three reasons why he is not even a competitor worthy of more serious consideration. <br /> <br /> First of all, and this will always be true, it's not nearly as good as the books. However, at least we could expect to reflect Sapkowski's intelligence or depth. <br /> <br /> Secondly we have the production. In my opinion, fantasy films are the most difficult to produce well. Everything from the props through costumes, sets, acrobatics and (above all) CGI is below standards. <br /> <br /> Finally, and this is very subjective, I can't take acting seriously. I was not raised in Poland, so I can't really judge - it could be my lack of familiarity with Polish films. In the same way the lines seem very amateur ... The casting could be even better. <br /> <br /> In summary, the only redeemable feature of this film is the rest of the plot that shines through: not unlike a diamond ring on a rotten corpse. <br /> <br /> In a separate note I heard that the books are coming out in English. I haven't seen them yet, but I can't imagine how we could even begin to translate them ... I would like to ask the English-speaking reader to make this clear in his mind when he judges the book.
