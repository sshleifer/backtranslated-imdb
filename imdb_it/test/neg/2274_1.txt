Well, Anne is really too old. Wentworth looks younger than her and he shouldn't. Louisa is too young and too cheerful Oh sister Mary is too cute. It should be average, not pretty. When this actress complains about how Mary should think all she is, she's too cute to be a whining. Lady Russell is too old. This is crazy. If you read the novel, it is Anne's most mature old friend, perhaps as old as Annes, who would be about 18-20 years older than Anne- so about 50 NOT 70! It's crazy, it's not good. Why is Anne so damn happy at first? He smiles when he says "oh, the worst is over, I've seen it, now the worst is over", yes right. OK if anyone saw Roger Michell's 1995 version of how you can't compare these two. That's right. This is far away. Read the novel and you will understand what I mean.
