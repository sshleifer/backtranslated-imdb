It is tempting to see this film as a daring avant-garde experiment. I like to think that the director was trying to figure out if it was possible to take all the conventions of the comic film and produce something that was completely, absolutely, completely not funny. <br /> <br /> The answer, to be judged by "Da Venere", is a resounding "Yes". This may not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but my brain seems to have repressed all the memories of others. This horrible blow just lingers to the limit: bad enough that the thought still causes pain, but not so bad that my internal censors have erased it from my consciousness. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to imagine what the director and the cast thought they were doing when they did it, or because they went ahead and released it once they did. I doubt anyone involved with it has gained much, but surely they could have put together enough money to buy all the prints and burn them. <br /> <br /> This is a film that has absolutely nothing to recommend it. It's not even pleasantly bad. It's just a non-movie where nothing interesting happens. I seriously thought about taking it back and asking for my money back, which I've never done before. <br /> <br /> Don't even think about renting (much less buy!) This horrible non-movie!
