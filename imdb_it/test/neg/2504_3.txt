One of the few movies shot at Coronado High School in Scottsdale, AZ in the late 1980s, as well as Just One of the Guys, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and Just Perfect (which was a segmented movie played during the Mickey Mouse Club.) Movie it's definitely for kids, as the previous comments have quite well. <br /> <br /> Coronado has undergone a revision in the last two years and many of the buildings seen in this film have disappeared. The field in which they are playing is adjacent to the soccer field, one of the few areas still there. I think the interior scenes near the lockers were in the old building from the 200s. <br /> <br /> Unless you're playing late at night on the Disney channel, it could be a difficult movie to find. How they made the sequel to this is beyond me.
