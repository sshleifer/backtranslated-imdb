Should it be fun? This is one of those movies that simply doesn't work. The first, Bruce Almighty with Jim Carey, had a lot of fun. This one had none. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrell, who was brilliant at Bruce Almighty, fails to deliver here. His performance is very ordinary and he can't carry it on like Carey did. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing is that I only paid $ 1.95 to rent it. It is a film for children ... very young children who have only seen about 4 films in their short life. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that Jim Carey is the protagonist of a movie and make a sequel without him which is usually a huge turkey. Does anyone remember Son of Mask? (IMDB The 100 worst movies of all time) Avoid the lovers of this film.
