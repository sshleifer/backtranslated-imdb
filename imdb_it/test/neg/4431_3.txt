When I think of Bollywood. I think the quarrels feel good numbers of musical dance, with wonderful clothes on men and women. And catchy reasons. Horror, Thriller, Mystery and Suspense, it doesn't come to mind though. And this, in my Western eyes, is like an abstract comedy. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been a better film, even a shorter one, if the writer and director had made a final choice. Or he went for pure Thriller-Horror, Comedy-Mystery, Supernatural-Suspense or Musical-Romance, instead of an embarrassing mixture of all of them. <br /> <br /> I have to say more than once that I thought the director must have seen "I know what you did last summer" and tried to give him a twist in Bollywood. My first film was Bride & Prejudice. Which I thought was played well <br /> <br /> It seemed to me what a Western audience would consider a video festival directly to cheese. <br /> <br /> The acting was exaggerated, sometimes it seemed that they intentionally wanted to parody Western thrillers, but when you saw them try to inject the dramatic crying, screaming or fear, it seemed out of place. <br /> <br /> The viewer was left wondering when one of the actors would wink at the camera. More than a couple of times when the public had to be horrified, we could only laugh at the absurdity. <br /> <br /> I watch a lot of foreign films, and even if I don't know Hindi, I have to say that they did a poor job subtitling the movie. It was sometimes difficult to read the white letters on the bright background. <br /> <br /> The villain was particularly funny, at least for me, because he came with his atmospheric music. The supposed unexpected twist, actually looked like a cop. <br /> <br /> The leading couples were pretty / pretty nice, and the musical numbers were worth it. I would suggest it to someone as a musical comedy, but I would tell them to quickly go ahead with the rest of the film, because it was not worth reading. If you are determined to read an entire Hindi movie with subtitles, then take a look at the romantic drama "Namasteay, London". <br /> <br /> But I wasn't scared ... apart from that, in India, they're really terrifying. 1 in 10 for what is advertised as. 6 out of 10 for the involuntary speed and the ability of illicit laughter, and it's musical / dance numbers. To enjoy :)
