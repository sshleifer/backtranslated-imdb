Eddy Murphy and Robert De Niro should be a combination that translates into a great comedy. Great expectations often lead to disappointment, and this is the case. <br /> <br /> When Eddy, as a police officer, wins a drug deal made by Detective Robert, they do it so badly that they end up doing a live reality TV show. Logic is not a big component of this film. The super-gun that spends the second half of the film to follow him confirms it. A twelve-die machine gun that leaves large holes in the sheet and three will destroy a house in about a minute (without reloading) is more a fantasy than science fiction. A five-pound gun, firing hundreds of shots per minute without any recoil, is certainly the weapon of the future using the technology of the past. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this film was designed neither for adults nor for children, so if you are in the middle, this is the movie for you.
