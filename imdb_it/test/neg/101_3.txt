I gave this 3 of a possible 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Unless you like to waste time looking at an anorexic actress, in this film it's Carly Pope, behaving like a ditz, don't worry. /> <br /> Carly Pope plays Sara Novak, a young university student, who remains intrigued by a game of riddles, which leads her into the underground tunnels under the city - a dangerous thing even for a well-armed man who must enter film there are various intrigues: a strange classmate who seems to be stalking Sara, a cynical shopkeeper who runs a sort of unusual bucolic structure that seems to be in the blind alley of a ghetto, a nerdish darkness that revolves around the cynic's a woman named Emily Gray, who is back in prison. <br /> <br /> Sara's father is a lawyer who is managing Emily The Gray's case. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, Emily Gray tried to drown a 12-year-old boy. Emily has been admitted to a psychiatric hospital for 5 years, and for some stubborn reason they have released her again, although it is obvious that she is still dangerously unbalanced. <br /> <br /> The only explanation Emily has ever given for the crime is: I've never sinned. <br /> <br /> It's all part of the design. <br /> <br /> Well, my friend, never expect a better explanation than that, because you won't.
