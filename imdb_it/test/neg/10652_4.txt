I just bought this film because I like to donate to Operation Smile, the charity on which the film was based ... but I found the writing of the film very strange. Not much focuses on Operation Smile or similar organizations like The Smile Train and their herculean efforts to alleviate the suffering of children born with facial deformities in third world countries. No, it focuses on an American teenage volunteer, Katie, whose "excessively privileged" life in Malibu, California, includes a mother who takes her to a doctor so that she has birth control pills in her house before going to bed her boyfriend. What should this absurdity of birth control do, titillate the public? It's 2005. I'd be more surprised if in 2005 a Malibu teenager wasn't on birth control, and even if he was, so what and who cares? In contrast, Katie is the character of Lin in China, a girl with a facial deformity who lost last year's chance of getting an operation and doesn't want one this year. Neither character is written in such a way that the audience can really identify, not to mention the motivations of both girls. On the other hand, actors do an adequate job of trying to play the bad hand they were treated by whoever wrote this ridiculous script. The best interpretation was of the gentleman who plays Lin's father, although much of his dialogue is in Chinese and subtitled. Operation Smile deserved to be honored by a much better film than this!
