I saw it on Mystery Science Theater 3000, and even that show couldn't really make this movie bearable. I could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures. Of course, you expect terrible special effects with a film so old, but I saw that the silences were better. The plot has huge gaps that let you try to understand why I'm also in certain scenes. Apparently the cameraman doesn't know what a tripod is, and he drank too much coffee, or maybe something more difficult, because the camera is ALWAYS getting excited. I couldn't even follow the plot, but suffice it to say that this is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: I saw "Epic Movie" some time ago and I decided to give this movie a 2. It's NOT the worst movie I've ever seen anymore!
