CANNIBAL FEROX (1+ outta 5 stars) Sorry for a miserable movie ... you might like it if you like the boring and meaningless jungle movies seasoned with scenes of graphic violence. A couple of drug traffickers fleeing the crowd travel to the Paraguayan jungle to look for emeralds and cocaine. They meet with another young traveler and his two hot babe sidekicks, one of whom is an anthropologist who tries to prove conclusively that cannibalism does not exist and has never existed. One of the two drug dealers turns out to be a psychopath and tortures and kills a couple of natives to tell them where they hide their jewels. (And how could they even tell him when he doesn't seem to speak their language in the first place?) Well, the natives are suddenly not too enthusiastic about the white people in their jungle and catch them all for some retaliatory torture. Poor acting, poor plot and bad direction. Not a decent moment of suspense in all the sad 90 minutes. Even the special effects are not particularly convincing (although a couple of shots will still make most viewers shudder). The only positive scene of the whole film is when the two women are imprisoned in a mud hut and seem to touch the hearts of the natives with their interpretation of "Red River Valley". The following is a quote from the movie, but I wouldn't be surprised if many viewers didn't say exactly the same thing at that point: "Oh God, please let her die soon Oh, let her die soon. Please die soon too."
