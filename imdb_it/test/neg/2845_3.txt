Low rent version of Ashley Judd's Double Jeopardy. Sutherland is too professional to be bad, but what did Brigit Fonda think?!? The curse of Penelope Ann Miller continues (Think about it, when did you ever make a good movie different from other people's money? And I'm not saying it's bad, but all your movies fail in some way).
