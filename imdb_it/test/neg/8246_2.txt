This film is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: doing nothing, being a loser and then suddenly ... whoah! You are a genius and a hateful one and the world is kissing the ground you are walking on. <br /> <br /> And surprisingly all the other smart people are losers. They know nothing and are embittered when our wonder solves problems so easily. And what kind of problems? They are so difficult but still these professors can analyze the results in less than 10 seconds. <br /> <br /> Every movie has something good anyway and Robin Williams is in that.
