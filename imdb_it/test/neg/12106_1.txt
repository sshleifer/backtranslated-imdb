I don't even know where to start. I did not like it. He didn't behave like a story and so much was injected into the film (the brownies of the dish, the son was gay (?) The murder was justified, what possible reason could there be in the script of the existence of Linda aka Penelope) which was ever explained. It was all fluid poured on a table and left to drip from the counter until everything became a big mess on the floor. <br /> <br /> Why did Vanessa Redgrave make a five-second cameo? Why did Diane Wiest use her Bullets over Broadway character without the fun of the field? Because Jane Birkin was in the plot to begin with. The list is endless. The film is finished and we looked at each other - how - did you understand all this? <br /> <br /> I'll tell you something, if I looked at my long-dead murdered dad I certainly wouldn't do it I won't hug the killer. Say something else, if "Bob" broke with "Bob" what purpose did he hide his son in the closet? Would Bob have sex with Bob in front of his son? How did the killer contact his son so easily? <br /> <br /> If this review seems confusing, it's because it was a waste of film, talent and time. What the heck does the moron have to do with anything !! <br /> <br /> Jezz, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen because it should / could have been better, stronger and should have made some sense. No sense. Instead we are given a "Diva" watered down (the movie of the 70s complete with a murder) and tired shows that read boring words from a completely insane script. <br /> <br /> Pass the people. Or maybe me and the rest of the people who reviewed this movie are too stupid to understand it - I mean it's a French film after all.
