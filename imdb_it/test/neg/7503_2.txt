In the 1950s, a gay photographer named Bob Mizer (Daniel MacIvor) founded a male modeling agency, releasing a muscle magazine called "Physique Pictorial" and a film of men, and many of the models became prostitutes. "Beefcake" shows the rise and fall of this pervert. <br /> <br /> Alternating footage from the 50s, testimony of many models and Bob Mizer himself today, director Thom Fitzgerald used this subterfuge to show naked men and a lot of penis 93 minutes long , in complete bad taste and very silly disgust. I've never heard of this morally corrupt Bob Moritz, and I don't know what AMG is. In my opinion, only the very specific and gay public could appreciate the theme of this boring and pretentious film. My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fresh Meat" ("Fresh Meat")
