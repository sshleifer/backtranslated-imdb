As a resident of CA, I'd like to see jackals turning off power plants to raise prices and even get some jails. <br /> <br /> I thought the film was pretty good and had some very instructive pieces. While staring at how Enron got up and crashed, I found it really interesting. However, when the film focuses on its anti-Bush inclination, I wonder if they were really accurate. <br /> <br /> It's okay to point out any links Republicans have with Enron, but the monster was created while Clinton was president. The CA's energy crisis occurred under the supervision of Davis. Both were in charge during Enron's abuse, but neither is held responsible in any way. Rather, many minutes are spent on how Bush was a friend of Lay. So? Lay played golf with Clinton and spent the night in Lincoln's bedroom. Why did the Democrats give such a free pass in this film? I think most politicians are a waste of our tax payers money, so I'm not partial to either side, but I hate feeling subject to someone's political agenda when I watch a documentary. Yes, politicians deserve some guilt, but I really doubt that the only culprit has Rs after their names. I found no value in portraying the Bushes as lovers of Kay when the Democrats received as much money from the Enron campaign as the Republicans did. As I said, it weakens the rest of the film because it makes me suspicious of the rest of the facts they expose.
