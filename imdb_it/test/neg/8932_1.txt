I just wish there was a lower rating than F to give it! I got a score of 1 in the vote. I'm evaluating this not just as a regular movie, but as a T & A movie, and this is the worst, most stupid, lousy and most horrible movie I've ever seen. The acting, the story and the music is terrible, not to mention the fact that the T & A connisuer.it speaks of a male cheerleader and the viewer is forced to sit through many painful scenes of him making cheers. Avoid this piece of junk at all costs! this is the worst 80s teen of the 80s.
