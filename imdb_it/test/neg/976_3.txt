Watching Showtime I had the impression that the producers had the idea of ​​putting Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy just to have a film that co-starred them. In addition to this, I cannot think of a reason to justify the existence of the film. Not that it's not funny in commercials, it certainly is, but the concept is so ridiculous that laughter is a bit muted. The thing that really struck me was the character of Eddie Murphy. I can't explain the concept that someone is a police officer like a day job. When I worked at the New York State Crime Victims Board, I had to deal with all kinds of policemen and they managed the range among real slugs, but I can't think of anyone who thought it was just something. I do it until I have my career in a distant area. I mean, can you really see Eddie Murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real Police Academy, not the screen version, just to get a day job? <br /> <br /> In any case, DeNiro is your basic detective for hard work, who is on the trail of an important gun dealer. He's undercover and Murphy is part of his backup. So what the Murphy showboy does, he calls a reality-based TV series like COPS to film the action. <br /> <br /> So the bust of DeNiro blows up, but the show's producer gets good shots of Murphy and DeNiro and decides a new reality-based television series. So these unwilling come together and try to keep working with the DeNiro case with all the cameras around. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is a funny guy, I loved him at Beverly Hills Cop and in Doctor Doolittle movies, but he's done better things than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly has. <br /> <br /> I imagine that Murphy wanted to have the opportunity to work with DeNiro and DeNiro must have earned a considerable salary to make this film.
