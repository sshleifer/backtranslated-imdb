I have seen comments from Turkish people (who are not) who say that this film is fantastic and accurately portrays Turkish life. All I have to say is that Turkey must be one of the most boring and depressing places in the world, because, in my opinion, this is exactly what this film was for me. If I were Turkish, I think it would have had a greater impact. But if you don't come from Turkey, I would advise you not to waste two hours of your life on this. <br /> <br /> "Distant" seems to stay behind forever. Many scenes are laboriously long with little or no purpose. I don't understand the director's goals even by including many scenes. It is emphasized that the director used his car, apartment and friends to make the film ... Well, guess what? Exhibition. It looks like a low budget. The acting is poor. If it is a cultural thing, so be it. I simply don't understand the purpose of basing a film on this story. It's incredibly boring.
