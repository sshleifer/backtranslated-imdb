The characterization of this film is among the worst I've ever seen. The dialogue is trivial and clich√© to the point of extreme distraction. None of the problems faced by the characters has been developed - they are just superficial details that want to get a point of view without actually having to present a credible dialogue to support the point indicated. Furthermore, the depiction of Chinese characters leaves something to be desired - I find it hard to believe that the Chinese father will learn impeccable English from a book (or so it is implicit in a scene) so he can teach his daughter. Etc. <br /> <br /> The Smile Train is a great organization and it is a good idea to make a harrowing film about the impact that a program like this can have on children's lives, but overall, I found this movie to be more frustrating than anything else.
