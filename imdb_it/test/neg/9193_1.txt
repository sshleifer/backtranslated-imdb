Wow - Thank God I was on a plane and could look out the window. Bad Hollywood fire scenes, predictable, terribly recited (who the hell was that horrible woman who played the wife?), Castamente abused, written terribly. This film was apparently made to appeal to the kind of person who is willing to kneel in place of both firefighters in particular, "Heroes" or gods in general, I suppose. I don't have enough bad things to say about this movie. It couldn't even be cheap, with all the stars that were there besides all those special effects and fire scenes. It had to cost a fortune, yet it still sucked worse than any movie I can remember seeing. Funeral scene? Surprisingly bad. Courtship between firefighter and horrible woman mentioned above? Corny, invented, banal. Firemen jokes? We don't all want that we could be both masculine and hurried at the same time.
