A mediocre horror film at its best that deals with stupid, not-so-horny guys who discover an evil video game (GASP) is killing those who die in the game (DOUBLE GASP). This film is the prolonged mystery of the mysterious gang in "Scooby Doo". I was waiting for them to pull out a mask of one of the bad guys. I could deal with this problem for 40 minutes, even as a science fiction movie, but get to the theaters, come on people. The effects were very mediocre, the whole scenario is something poor, but the director Uwe Boll, as this would be his cast. As always, the beauty of video game systems is the glorious power button. I would suggest using that intermediate vision. * 1/2
