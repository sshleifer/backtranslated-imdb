What's up with this movie? Does Mr. Lyne and his writers think that a sado-masochistic adventure between two screwed Yuppies can bring a feature film? Maybe if he had some comic elements (which he isn't, at least intentionally), or there were some additional dramatic elements (which aren't there), or maybe if it was hardcore. No, it is simply the history of the business; a chronology of a group of R-rated meetings. Ho-hum, who cares? "Nine Â½ weeks" deserves every Razzie nomination. He's a loser. <br /> <br /> And by the way, what's up with Roger Ebert and his enthusiastic review? Where was his head in 1986?
