Trite and not original. It is as if someone had looked at Immortal Beloved and Amadeus and decided to mix them and, in the process, steal other parts of the plot formidable from other films to create another. As with most historical films nowadays, there are some inaccuracies in that the story is manipulated to better fit the story, which is understandable for the most part. For example, during the remaining days of Beethoven's life, it was necessary for other people to write what they had to say in order to understand them. This, of course, would have been a nuisance to show on the screen. The screenplay, although full of some quotable lines, fails to capture the atmosphere of that period and, along with bad acting, seems rather contemporary. Diane Kruger is pretty enough to look at but still has a lot to improve on her job. Ed Harris does not work for me as Beethoven and for the most part I blame Gary Oldman. Overall, it's not a good interpretation of the life of the musical master. Better just find you a copy of Immortal Beloved. <br /> <br /> http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews
