Of course I saw the previews for this at the beginning of some other Lion's Gate extravagance, so obviously it was just the best part and therefore seemed intriguing. And it is, at some point. A young college student (Sarah) is discovering puzzles all over and is becoming obsessed with answering them, and in doing so is involuntarily involved in some game. Now it is quite intriguing, but unfortunately everything becomes rather confusing and it becomes so complicated that the viewer (like me) will most likely become frustrated. The characters appear with a small introduction and you're not really sure who they are or why Sarah knows them or is around with them. All this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown a boy years ago and her reason is that "it's all part of the design". In reality, it is all part of the "very sketchy script" and when the film is finished you will find yourself thinking that you have lost about an hour and a half of your life that you want to come back for more productive uses of your time like cleaning the bathroom example. 4 out of 10.
