Anyone who has filled this stupid idea of ​​reciting and producing a film in Himesh's head, which is always hidden under a cap, covering almost half of his face all the time? I just hope this is the first and the last, for God's sake! From Assalam Valekum to Gayatri Mantra, Himesh has tried everything, to create an aura of his so-called singing talent, which is nothing but atrocious pronunciations of words like Tanhaiyya, which completely kill the beauty of the terms, so commonly used for love songs . Why doesn't Himesh smile? Simple, because he doesn't use toothpaste close-up! Now there is this friend of his, who pawns him everywhere, and this lawyer number one in the city, who has a sexual grimace for himself and tries to seduce Himesh, of all the handsome Germans he might have met before, perhaps the male lawyers in this part of the world could curse their fate, to be destined to manage the rigid and unattractive lot every day! The action scenes are shot so funny, like the event planner attacked by the thief, the cars flying over the cars, and so on. The bride's father seems to be in a hurry to get rid of his daughter by marrying her, flying up and down. The most hypocritical, he praises the human resources for having distributed love among the people of the world, as if they were sweet, and on his back, he gives a cold lesson to his daughter about these men of the show. when Himesh is tried innocent, he unloads the other one again, as if it were a musical chair game! I couldn't even see the poor boy's face, did I? Hansika in the role of Ria, looks like she needs an eye check, for the tension in her eyes! The friend in the role of a friend is good, who has acted quite naturally and should be in better films, like Sharman Joshi, for example. The child artist in Trishu's brief appearance is sweet, but wasted. It seems that today's young generation has gone mad, since they prefer this kind of derision of texts and musical scores, and associate the gossip with it, for example, if you sing ek bar aaja, the ghost would come. this is a strange taste in music, and quite funny. I'm surprised, as those classic lyricists like Gulzar, have opted for Himesh of all the people, to give music. There is a story in Panchtantra, which a crow includes so many peacock feathers, to appear beautiful and appeal to the birds; but the feathers fall to the end and the true dark crow is revealed! Hope Himesh takes a hint and refrains from making such insignificant things, and wastes precious money, which he has earned by taxing his short nose so much! His friend tells him, if your nose is cut, how will you sing? Thank you for showing us Germany, Himesh, at a reasonable cost to rent the DVD! and correct those spelling mistakes, right? an extra and in film, and no and in love! There is also a famous issue of the old film Sholey, Mehbooba, on which Mallika Sherawat squirms again, but this time with Himesh, winking at her, and conveniently, Ria, his so-called true love, and his new bride is not around! This was very clever, Himesh! At least one thing in this film that you did elegantly, to justify the presence of Sherawat. But doesn't it seem a bit watered?
