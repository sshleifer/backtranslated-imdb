Feeling Minnesota, directed by Steven Baigelmann, and starring Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio: The tense relationship between two brothers, Sam (D'Onofrio) and Jjaks (Reeves), is pushed to the breaking point when Jjaks arrives from Sam marriage and marries the bride, Freddie (Diaz), a former stripper, marrying Sam to repay a gambling debt due to the owner of the Red nightclub (Lindo). Baigelman's screenplay and directorial debut is a frustrating mess, full of hateful and inconsistent characters. Putting Keanu and Diaz in the same film should at least provide some pleasure for the eyes, but Baigelman even comes to terms with that score, raising his actors with little positive effect. Very poor.
