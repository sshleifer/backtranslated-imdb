My mother, my cousins ​​and I are big fans of Jane Austen. We know all the words of the 1995 Pride and Prejudice masterpiece and we saw Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma an embarrassing number of times. I've read all the books and I've even tried Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion a few times. So my mother and I thought it would be nice to see Northanger Abbey in a movie. Bad idea! This is just the worst movie I've ever seen. It's even worse than the 1998 version of Alice Through the Looking Glass, or the 1939 Nancy Drew movie I bought at Wal-Mart for $ 1 (my previous "worst movies"). The first thing wrong, that you notice in the opening scene, is that the "heroine", Catherine, has a horrible and bizarre imagination, inspired by sad novels that a heroine of Jane Austen would never have touched. Throughout the novel, he has dreams (day and night) in which he is kidnapped by a hateful man with a greasy wig, dragged through a field directed to God-knows-all-everything, and suddenly saved by a fiery boy on a white horse . <br /> <br /> The second thing any viewer of the film will immediately notice is the high-pitched and saxophone music that should be the soundtrack. No delicate classical music or English country dances here! It is also evident, almost at first sight, that the actress (for lack of a better word) chosen to play Catherine is completely out. First, it is rather unattractive and is rendered even more by its non-Austenlike behavior. His looks and movements are simply extravagant! Moreover, they are completely affected and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> This sad lack of acting skills affects virtually all the actors in the film. Not even Mr. Tilney, the alleged "brave young suitor" is decent. <br /> <br /> As more and more characters are introduced, a strange taste in costume by filmmakers becomes evident. Huge Marie Antoinette style hats clash with (for the most part) empire dresses in perfect style. A French woman, apparently friend of General Tilney, is all black as a sort of ancient Gothic nightmare: she has a striking resemblance to Michael Jackson in a black suit. His appearance is made even more foolish by a HUGE half-moon sign of beauty on his cheek. I also had to ask you about the historical accuracy of the bright red lipstick that almost all women wore. <br /> <br /> Another anomaly that prevented my mom and I from laughing for about ten minutes was the "bathing" "scene. The first thing we noticed was that men and women were taking a bath in a large bathhouse together - probably not very probably in the early 1800s. Then we saw that all the women seemed to be wearing large china or plastic plates, worn around the neck with ropes, the plates floating horizontally on the water, containing some mysterious pieces of ... something. We guessed that it was soap, then aromatic herbs, and finally, when the mysterious substance began to disappear between the shots, we deduced that it was food, but I'm not sure yet. <br /> <br / "And it's not even half of what's wrong with Northanger Abbey. My warning to anyone considering renting this movie: hold your hand. And if anyone is thinking of BUYING it - well, I don't even know what to say to that." <br /> <br /> Pense remains that when the actors and others make this film they take about 1/4 of the way to the end, they realize what they were creating and they stop. Unfortunately not, and Northanger Abbey was released into the world.
