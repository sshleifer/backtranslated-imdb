Simply unfortunate vehicle Lana Turner-Ezio Pinza. Pinza had a beautiful voice but rarely uses it in a film that reminded me of "The Student Prince" with adults. Even Pinza is not a guide man. He looks like an old man ready to collect social security and go fishing. <br /> <br /> The plot is extremely thin and the supporting cast of Barry Sullivan, Marjorie Maine and Debbie Reynolds has so little to do. Sir Cedric Hardwicke comes to the end to announce that our king Ezio will do better to return to his people. As far as I'm concerned, the faster the better. Is Lana Turner really singing with Pinza? Not bad if it's you. The image also reminded me of the 1960 film "Prince and the showgirl" with Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier.
