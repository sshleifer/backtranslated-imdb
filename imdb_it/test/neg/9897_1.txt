Well, for a start I said to myself, wow, this is new, so when it's the film that starts, and out of this between things. But it's never finished. The film is just a big one in the middle! And after 10 minutes of waiting for something to really happen, apart from the water that splashes around, I just started to get angry! There is nothing in this documentation and nothing will be learned. Completely BORING and RUBBISH!
