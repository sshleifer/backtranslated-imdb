There should be some sort of accusation to punish the producers for financing such stupid scripts. I feel that a kind of criminalization of the bad movie could prevent other such idiotic films from being made. Sure, he has an interesting cast of characters, but I don't think I've ever seen a cardboard performance from an entire cast like this piece of shit a bit crappy. That director should be punished in some way so as not to arouse at least some kind of performance by these people. So posting is a theme, (not really, they'll beat you in the head with this), it doesn't mean that every character has to play their lines like they're on NPR. Did I say this movie was lousy? Finally, I'm not sure what connection their memories would have with terminal bone cancer, but I'm reasonably certain that if you were completely cerebral, your cancer will continue to grow independently. This film is an insult to cancer patients, medical professionals and non-retarded people. Oh, and finally, the bumblebees fly because they produce a sufficient amount of lift for their mass by flapping their wings just like every other flying insect. I absolutely despise people who present false knowledge as facts. Next time, do a little research before using idiotic misunderstanding as a premise for an entire movie. JUST KIDDING BELIEVES IN JESUS!
