A forerunner sadly inferior to "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf", this film drags back and forth, occasionally reviving your interest just to let you pass through more self-indulgent and obvious plots but obviously too exaggerated plot points. <br /> <br /> Can list as 111 minutes, but feels like three hours of painfully wasted time.
