The contemporary chapter of the US Navy's elite underwater demolition team is called to do ... what they want, apparently. Charlie Sheen has been appointed official. The plot is already incredible. Michael Biehn is his immediate CO, but he keeps Charlie on a leash rather long and one of the boys pays early to be killed thanks to Charlie's patented stupidity. The rest of the team spends their free time committing judicial-martial offenses. Primarily an exercise in random shooting and extremely subtle ethics, these particular Seals could be better suited to serve as crash-test dummies. <br /> <br /> Some good action scenes counteract the stupid procedures.
