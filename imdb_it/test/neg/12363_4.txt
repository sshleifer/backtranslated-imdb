I won't tell the story of the movie like some people do. I'm pretty sure the people who read this will know what the plot is. I'm not going to keep talking about everything wrong with this movie, because I'll be here for years if I do. The plot is typical and the special effects are below today's standards. This is not a movie to watch if you're a fan of film buffs (as many of us are here) the little things annoy you the whole movie and ruin the experience. If you are a movie buff, who likes to have fun while watching a movie, this movie is perfect for you, very funny. It would also be a good movie for a partner. Not just for us film buffs. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 10
