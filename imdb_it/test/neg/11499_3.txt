Frederick Forsyth's books are always so complicated, with twists and usually a great surprise ending. This adaptation had none of this. <br /> <br /> Much of what was great in the book (the story of Monk and the betrayed agents, the plot to influence the outcome of the Russian elections) were completely missing in this adaptation. Instead, there is this completely new plot on bio-weapons that was a yawn. <br /> <br /> The protagonists of Forsyth have always operated in the shadows, forever just beyond the reach of the antagonists. The joys of his books have always been the machinations of completing their mission. The film resigned to the shootings and car chases. <br /> <br /> The Swayze monk would also hang a sign around his neck saying "I AM A SECRET AGENT" for all the attention he called to himself during the film. And with all that attention, the amount of time it took the bad guys to reach it was amazing. <br /> <br /> Assuming that there was a bit of energy in this film, and that's why I'm giving it a "3" instead of a "1". It was also nice to see some underutilized professionals like Patrick Bergin, Ben Cross, Michael York and Barry Morse. <br /> <br /> I hope that one day someone will still do justice to a film adaptation of Forsyth as "Day of the Jackal" he did.
