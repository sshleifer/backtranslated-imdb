Scarlet Dawn launches Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as a Russian baron roughly displaced by the forces of the Russian revolution and must now defend himself in a world not very hospitable to the former aristocrats. Furthermore it is not particularly suitable for any kind of real work. <br /> <br /> Doug may have been captured by the Reds, but due to the fact that his former server Nancy Carroll did not betray him. Nancy has a great old crush on Doug and they get married once they get into exile in Istanbul, which throughout the film refers to her ancient Christian name of Constantinople. They get married and settle in with Doug, now reduced to washing dishes. <br /> <br /> But Fairbanks' former lover, Lilyan Tashman, who always plays bad girls in a sort of movie, sees him and offers to get him back to the style he used to play scam against father and daughter of American tourists Guy Kibbee and Sheila Terry. <br /> <br /> Luckily this movie has an incredibly short run time of just 57 minutes, usually those were given to B western because it's both boring and melodramatic. The finish is pretty incredible. Doug knew he was at a Thanksgiving special and really tried to cover up the flaws of an incredible story. <br /> <br /> What I didn't understand was that Fairbanks was trained in the military profession, why didn't he just become a mercenary soldier after leaving the new Soviet Union? This made no sense to me. <br /> <br /> I would only see it if I were a passionate fan of all the major players.
