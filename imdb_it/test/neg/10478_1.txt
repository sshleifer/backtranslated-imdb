First I must confess that A Separate Peace is my favorite book. So obviously, I have some prejudice against any attempt at adaptation for a film or a film. But as I started watching this movie, I was more than willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. The original version of the early 1970s, although filmed at the Phillips Exeter Academy where the author of the book attended school, and although he remained as faithful to the book as possible, he lacked any real depth of feeling and could not capture the essence of the characters. The original simply seemed to go through the motions. Reading the curiosities about the film, you discover that it was chosen mostly with non-actor actors. Thus, the original looks amateur and ultimately fails. <br /> <br /> This new version, although I will grant that it captures the appearance of the best period of the original, seems to have thrown the book out all together. The scenes are reorganized, the imposed characters they don't belong to, the characters created that weren't in the book, and no attempt was made to delve into the deeper conflicts that make the book so compelling. And the cardinal sin of all: the tree is not treated as the vital, almost central character that is in the book. This is an unforgivable supervision by the directors. How could they minimize the role of the tree? Why wasn't it presented immediately? Why the beginning of the Dead Poet? And what name of God had Gene's accent? This film is, to be blunt, junk. A separate peace should not be a difficult book to adapt for the stage or the screen. John Knowles wrote it in a perfectly refined and linear style. The directors should have trusted the story as it was written before; make changes, of course; embellish here and there, of course; take a light dramatic license, of course. But destroy one of the pearls of American literature in the process? What were they thinking? In their corruption of the plot, they cut off any possibility of suspense or drama. The whole film falls flat and fails miserably. <br /> <br /> If you are a high school or college student assigned to read this book and are planning to skimp and just watch the movie ... don't even think about it. This film will not help you. <br /> <br /> Alas, we will have to wait before a version of this story arrives on the screen that really does justice.
