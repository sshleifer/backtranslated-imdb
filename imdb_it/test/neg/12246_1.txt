I blame The Comebacks on everyone who has enjoyed Date Movie and Epic Movie. You people have encouraged Fox to continue to churn out desperate films about parody, and now we are faced with what could be the most lazy and desperate of all. The Comebacks barely qualify as a parody. Heck, she barely qualifies as a movie. This is a comedy in theory, but not running. No one, not even the people involved in this mess, could have fooled themselves into thinking of making a funny movie. Director Tom Brady (The Hot Chick) has done something really unfortunate here. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you can even call it, focuses on a man named Lambeau Fields (David Koechner). Just when I heard his name in the first two seconds of the movie, I knew I had to do a long film. Funny names are rarely fun and become even less fun the more you hear them. Lambeau is one of the worst coaches in the world, but he was given another chance by his best friend, Freddie Wiseman (Carl Weathers), to coach a secondary school football team called The Comebacks. Lambeau must not only lead the team to victory, but also teach them how to inspire clich√©s about sport. He expects his children to have poor grades and alcohol problems, and ridicules them when they don't. When it seems that the team has the chance to play at the big WC Bowl championship (The 10 years have written this script?), Lambeau is shocked to discover that Freddie is the coach of the great rival team that his team play against. It turned out that Freddie only encouraged Lambeau to do the coaching job because he wanted The Comebacks to lose. <br /> <br /> The Comebacks is a film so forced and pathetic, I almost had trouble believing what I was looking at. Spoofing films have recently turned into a "spot the movie reference" game, and this continues the tradition. Try to squeeze as many references as possible to other sports films, but do absolutely nothing with them, just expecting to point to the screen and laugh out of familiarity, or try to be funny and collapse on his face. Some of the films mentioned include Field of Dreams, Bend it Like Beckham, Rocky Balboa, Friday Night Lights, Stick It, Radio, Miracle, Remember the Titans, Gridiron Gang, Invincible and Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. But wait, wasn't Dodgeball already a parody of inspirational sports movies? So, in other words, we are looking at a parody of a parody of inspirational sports films. If this makes sense to you, you're just the audience this movie is looking for. Some of these films are mentioned in the plot, and some (like Rocky's) are simply thrown out for no reason, because the filmmakers wanted to try to refer to as many movies as possible. There are some that the film also feels the need to explain to us in its dialogue, in case we have lost the obvious reference. You know a movie is in trouble when it has to tell us its lines. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the screenplay by TV veterans and early writers, Ed Yeager and Joey Gutierrez, we don't even know the first and most important rule of parody: you have to play straight. Actors must pretend they are not involved in the joke. The reason why the classic Zucker Brothers films like Airplane, Top Secret and The Naked Gun are remembered so fondly is because they chose serious actors like Leslie Nielsen (yes, he was a serious actor before turning to comedy) and Robert Stack, and then threw them into ridiculous situations. What made it fun was that they behaved as if they weren't in a comedy, and kept a stone face to the strangeness that surrounds them. Those films wouldn't have worked if they played their roles widely. The Comebacks proves it, since all the actors are forced to play their roles so silly, it's like they're yelling at us to laugh. David Koechner continues to wave his arms, puffing his eyes, and screaming at the top of his lungs, to the point that he looks like someone who knows he is trapped in a comedy with no way out, and tries just too hard to pretend he's having fun. The film also does not include the art of cameo celebrities (also an important factor when it comes to parody movies). What kind of cameo do we get in The Comebacks? Andy Dick and Dennis Rodman. <br /> <br /> When the film throws a useless and extremely useless musical number of the cast to Journey's "Do not Stop Believing" for absolutely no reason, I was almost ready to go out the door of the theater. I was the only person at my projection, and I liked the thought of this film going on its pathetic way towards a completely empty house. I sat through the rest of The Comebacks, and I wasn't rewarded for my efforts. The sad thing is that Fox has not yet finished killing the spoof genre. They have a parody of 300 coming out next year called Meet the Spartans. I would say that it can't be much worse than this, but I've seen the trailer, and I wouldn't want to have your hopes.
