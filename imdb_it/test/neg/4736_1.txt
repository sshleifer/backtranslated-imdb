I'm not even willing to vote for a single star for this shit, but IMDb doesn't have zero as an evaluation option ... the worst movie I've ever seen .. Movie story 1. The predator ship crashes into the earth 2. A stranger and some face huggers are released and start killing humans. 3. A predator arrives on earth and begins to kill aliens and humans. 4. So a human jet releases a bomb and kills humans, aliens and predators. 5. Some humans find the predator's shoulder cannon. 6. The final administrators should consider repaying the money to the spectators. If you still want to see this movie, download from a torrent site and say thanks to me for saving you .. the whole movie was shot in some dark corner of the earth, you only see dark shadows even in the action scenes .. too much violence. I didn't expect it from a fox movie
