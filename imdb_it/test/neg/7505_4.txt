Zombie Planet seems an example of good ideas and a laudable ambition that exceeds the budget. I thought the explanation for the zombies was authentic and original, and I loved the dog crunching the show scene. The rest of the blood was effective in a low budget way, but too spaced out during the film. The problem was that it was too long and anti-climatic. Sure, they had an intriguing plot, even if derived, and an equally familiar but interesting environment, but a low budget zombie movie really needs to be goretastic to make an impression and there haven't been enough red moments in this for me . I think there was a surplus of low-cost, bloodless combat scenes, especially given the slightest lump. Also, for a two-hour movie, in the end there is a very small closure, and although it makes me want to track down Zombie Planet 2, I felt a little cheated. So it's probably worth looking for both of them.
