When a movie called Hell Ride comes out, you expect a certain amount of motorcycle clich√©s. With names of characters like "Pistolero", "Comanche" and "The Gent" I prepared myself for the worst and I was punched in the face by that one. Dialogue, soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker films. The dusty desert is blurred by the heat as the bicycles approach the road while "CC Rider" plays and talk about sex and violence. Yawn! The three derivations were simply ridiculous and incredible. Seeing old men like Bishop and Madsen (in a bloody ruffled shirt) ride a dusty strip of desert highway reminded me of two men desperately trying to relive their youth. Poor Eric Balfour has done his best but with such a poor material he is lost. Even an appearance by Dennis Hopper in Easy Rider's full swing couldn't save her. And let's talk about the store bought tan, right? Many have compared this to Tarantino's work. It's not even close. What makes Tarantino's work so brilliant is that he knows it's exaggerated, so he just pulls the balls and brings it as high as possible. Bishop took this film so seriously that it has become nothing but a poor copy of the exploitation genre.
