This film is a terrible attempt at parody. His attempts to parody various sports films are half cooked and not at all funny. <br /> <br /> Even the things that should be fun - like the Indian female footballer who always wears traditional clothes on her uniform - are not very funny. The fact that the football team studies and gets good grades, which makes the coach angry, didn't even make them laugh. <br /> <br /> The plot to have a traditional loser has another chance to train to a losing high school football the team really had potential. It is a classic and banal sports theme. But alas, the script was too weak for ANY cast to get it out. And this cast is no exception. <br /> <br /> There is a free use of women in bikinis and underwear, so it's not bad at all from this aspect. <br /> <br /> But Animal House or Talladega Nights, this is not it.
