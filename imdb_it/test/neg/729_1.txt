Usually when I don't see a show in an original run, I find it later on cable and I realize it's a gem. "Gimore Girls" is one of those rare exceptions. I'm glad I lost it. <br /> <br /> I really despise the shows that fill every minute of the actors' space with rambling, stupid and boring jokes. This is an hour of this. The mother, Lorelei, made me ask if she was bipolar and without her lithium. He never stopped talking; every minute, every second, talking to every person he interacted with. Worse, his speech is childish and really, like, Valley Girl. He talked about boys, his hair, his mother, his clothes. Like, what's the point ?? (by situation). I saw this show three times and I still didn't understand the meaning of this series. It is not a comedy, it is not a drama, it makes no sense but to make three generations of women in a family look like Planet Mars "Girls". By comparison, the males are intelligent and make the show a little watchable. If Lorelei had ever existed and attempted to intertwine with the conversation, I should have taken her to mace to get rid of her. Obviously he doesn't know how to take a hint to stop talking and start listening to someone else. Moreover, he does not know how to really notice the existence of others. <br /> <br /> In a show, Lorelei returns home from a date close to 10pm. He got the date after persecuting a boy he met at an auction. She goes to her daughter's room where her daughter asks how it went. He complains about how boring that guy is. His date somehow had a few more words. Lorelei complained about how the man didn't stop talking (suffocate). I hope the date has learned how lucky I was. <br /> <br /> Another person here commented how the mother behaves as a teenager and the daughter is the adult personality. Lorelei also dresses as her daughter. Obviously this 40-year-old mother dresses and seems to have hit the mall with her high school friends in tow. <br /> <br /> I thought this show should have been followed by "Just Shoot Me", because that's exactly how I felt.
