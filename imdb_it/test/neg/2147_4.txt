I don't know which one was first published in 1970. Cannon for Cordoba is a "Europen Western" made in Spain. This means that this is quite inferior to the so-called #Western spaghetti and the true American masterpieces of John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Howard Hugues, John Sturges and Anthony Mann, in my order of merit. This order should not be interpreted as all John Ford Westerns are better than any of Sam Peckipahn's. I think IMDb's 100 order them pretty well. <br /> <br /> The worst of this company is Casting. George Peppard is suitable for the role of sergeant, Raff Valone for a "Maffia Capo" and Giovanna Ralli for a "whore" in "Piazza Vennezia" in the 60s in Rome.
