"Fate" brings Walter Sparrow into possession of a mysterious novel that has strange similarities and connections with his life, all based on the number 23. While the story takes place in real life and in fiction, Sparrow must understand his link with the book and how the story will end. <br /> <br /> The number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is canceled out by a weak performance. The film has failed on many different levels, which is rather disappointing because it has had so much potential. The script was probably the worst part. It was full of silly sequences and ridiculous dialogues that just killed the atmosphere of the film. It seemed that the writer had a good idea, he simply didn't know how to develop it to stretch over ninety-five minutes of time. The second part of the film was short of ideas, the turning point was quite obvious and the ending was horrible. <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is in charge of one of the worst movies ever and redeemed himself a bit with Phone Booth and some other films, but The Number 23 reminds me that he is still able to make a stinker. He has a film full of style but he can't get a good focus. It moves the film at an awkward and slow pace. Move from reality to what is really happening in the book that has become annoying quickly. The real book in the film called "The Number 23" is a terrible detective story and the audience hangs up listening to Carrey telling it and boring me to tears. When Carrey has finally finished with the book, we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. At this point, the public has lost interest and there is no real tension. We look forward to the film reaching its horrible ending and an unconvincing explanation before celebrating that the film is finally finished. <br /> <br /> The acting was mostly average and rather forgettable. Jim Carrey was clearly just a sleepwalker during his performance and didn't even seem to try. It was completely over the top in some scenes or just a lot of wood. His narration was a nuisance to listen to and did not put his personality inside. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role, but she needs to choose better screenplays. Logan Lerman was rather bland as Danny Huston was. Overall, The Number 23 was a terrible thriller that offered more laughter than suspense or chills. Evaluation 3/10
