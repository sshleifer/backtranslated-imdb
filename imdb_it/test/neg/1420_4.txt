Interesting and short television films describe some of the machinations surrounding Jay Leno's replacement as a Tonight Show guest. The film is currently very topical given the public drama surrounding Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno. <br /> <br /> The film does a good job arousing the spectators' interest in the events and showing some of the concerns of the stakeholders, in particular of the NBC leaders. The portrait of Ovitz was particularly compelling and interesting, I thought. <br /> <br /> However, many of the characters were only very briefly limned or touched, and some of the actors seemed treacherous. However, an interesting story.
