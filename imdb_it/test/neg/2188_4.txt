The film is in place. It means I don't regret watching it! I found the acting purely and most of the stupid dialogue ("oh no, this was my grandmother bible!"). It's a kind of ugly U-turn remake. A man arrives in a deserted city in nothingness, meets the wrong people and falls in love with the wrong woman. And because of what's involved in something, he thought he could leave it behind. The film is quite predictable and there is really nothing new in it. When it was over, you didn't really care. Most of the characters are stereotypes, especially Brian Austin Green !! All in all just another US movie, but ok fun entertaining the boring Wednesday night. IMDb votes: 4/10
