I know that Trey Parker and Matt Stone really hate celebrities and ruin them in every single episode of South Park (if not the monsters, then the mentions) and they love to tease and joke and make fun of themselves, but I heard this fake documentary has gone too far. <br /> <br /> First of all, the most common recurring theme in the "documentary" is that they are episodes that are useless pieces of shit that put off just for the money. Obviously, this is completely false if you worry about watching any episode, and the constant "You know, I learned something today ...", is said at the end of almost every episode of the main characters. The creators are also portrayed as pompous and arrogant donkeys who only care about money, including an allegedly fun-but-not-scene that involves Isaac Hayes delivering lines to Chef (on the phone) and Trey Parker who screams and yells at he to suck and hang up. I guess it should be fun, but the claim in it really did ... cringe. <br /> <br /> The way they interview employees working for Trey and Matt shows the duo as tyrants pushing their employees to the limit, all for money, in the end. Completely false, of course, and all a joke, but it's not funny at all. It's disturbing, even if it's just a joke.
