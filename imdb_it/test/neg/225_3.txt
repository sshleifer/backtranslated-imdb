After reading Fool For Love in a Drama class of mine, I couldn't wait to see how the splendid Sam Shepard show would be translated on the screen. To my dismay, it wasn't nearly as funny as the show. The film seemed to drag, the music was inappropriate for the tone of the film, and all the raw energy of the game seemed to have been sucked out of this film version. It's a shame to see him come out this way even with Shepard's involvement, playing the role of Eddie. Do yourself a favor ... watch the play the next time it is performed in your area or just read the book.
