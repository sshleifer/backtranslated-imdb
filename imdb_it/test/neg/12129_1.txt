John Waters owes me back 2 hours of my life. I saw a preview preview of this way way back in 1990, and I'm still in pain. Not since or since I saw such a terrible film waste thrown up on the screen. There is nothing positive I can say about this film. Act - terrible; plot - ridiculous; music - atrocious. After the movie, my friends and I asked for our money back from the theater manager. He explained that since it was a free screening, he couldn't give us anything in return, no matter how much suffering we suffered. How Johnny Depp's career has survived this shipwreck, nobody knows.
