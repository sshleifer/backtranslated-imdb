4 realities are my game iz mad tite yo I can't wait 2 get show and roll up in by club n you make real style 905 with crazy models n bottles, son! <br /> <br /> No, I'm just kidding. This is a sad sight, created by, and for the fun of, sad men. Men who are so castrated by modern existence that channel their frustration into clubs, where they emit a fleeting self-validation preying on chicks in hopes of getting their little pretzels touched to try to blur the feeling of loneliness and make them feel, even just for one night, as if their place on the Board of the Sausage Party in Toronto was a little less permanent. <br /> <br /> I have read some comments here saying that this show represents Canadian TV that is finally getting up to be on par with American TV or something else. Well, this is not a goal at all. It's like, yes! Get a pat on the back, Canada - you finally broke the elusive formula of revolutionary content like "Studs", "Change of Heart", "Elimidate" and "The Fifth Wheel". See, the real genius here is tacking "... meets Candid Camera" on the field. Genius. And there is nothing that straddles that thin line between the fraternal camaraderie and latent homosexuality as a group of grown men touching each other on a hidden camera, admiring the "game" of the other in the club. The man-love on display here is so palpable that they should really consider renaming it "Keys to the Steam Bath". <br /> <br /> On the side, how interesting is the fact that the people who gave this show such brilliant reviews seem to have registered a IMDb account with the explicit purpose of doing so (I guess I'm guilty of using the same way to do the opposite here.) My favorite is the only enthusiastic reviewer who claims to call "United States" "It is clear that talent in Canada has the capacity to produce American quality television." <br /> <br /> Smooth. <br /> <br /> But why bother producing buzz online? You can't really be canceled, after all - you're on Comedy Network in Canada, baby! The visitor public will continue to ignore your show for years to come. In all likelihood you'll be fine, comfortably skirting that proverbial plain of mediocrity with most of the original Comedy Network programming.
