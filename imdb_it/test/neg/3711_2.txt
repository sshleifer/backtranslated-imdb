It is difficult to find something worth praising with this film. It's not the worst picture ever made, but it's not saying much. The plot is quite incoherent and incredible; it seems that the producers wanted to make a space movie, but decided to do it underwater to cash in on the success of The Abyss. In some scenes it seems that the story was initially set to external space; the submarine has a landing gear, the technicians are worried about a tear in a rubber diving suit at depths of several kilometers, where the pressure would have crushed the diver and the suit like an empty beer can. <br /> <br /> The film starts right, with the planning of a recovery of a lost naval submarine. After that the movie takes a dip with the siren 2. <br /> <br /> The effects are so-so. The navigation screens are all made on the Commodore 64 (remember, this is 1990, not 1983), the sub is controlled like no other sub ever seen; instead of control consoles, the officers have keyboards with which they insert sequences of long numbers to control various functions of the ship. Even the inside of the ship is not too convincing. <br /> <br /> The final scenes jump from awkward to absurd. Welcome to the fifties, you can check the suspension of disbelief at the door. <br /> <br /> I can't see the fun factor here. The film is neither good nor exhilarating in MST3k style (up to the final scene), it's like eating a bad apple.
