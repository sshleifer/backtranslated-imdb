My hypothesis is that the producers of this low budget space / horror film wanted a serious film, but the director had his heart in a parody. So ... this is what we get. Set in a spaceship abandoned 1000 years into the future and populated by characters and props since the 1990s. The set is an industrial complex, maybe an oil tanker, whatever. They use is as is, so the controls consist of racks of old TV equipment. One position is obviously the employees' dining room and showcases an old television and video recorder as well as a water cooler with plastic carboy. Tiny Lister and Coolio get the best jokes, arguing throughout the story. The dialogue is full of fairly dated terms ("A-OK, Daddy-O") but maybe the 30th century is very retro? When the captain declares that the cargo of the ships is a load of coffins from "The Transylvania Station", you know this is all a put-on. It's a bit of Alien, partly JasonX, a shameless scam of all the best science fiction and horror titles. At one point Casper VanDien even tells his driver to "make it" with a straight face. This movie would have been better if they had let everyone run with satire, but they keep trying to make the story serious ... maybe the supporters were on set that day. However, he is not a bad killer of boredom if you are not too picky. FXs are good as sets are bad.
