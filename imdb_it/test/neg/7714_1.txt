When one of the stars in a movie is called Sticky Fingaz, you should know enough to stay away from it. Stay away. HOUSE 2 is more or less the same, this time with zombies that exceed a university campus (man, as he must have saved up money). As usual, the "zombies" are given no direction for which you speak, and they provide very little trick or costume. They look like the zombies of one of those endless Italian zombie zombies from years ago. Which means they don't look like the kind of zombies we know and love from the films of George Romero and Dan O'Bannon. The people who fight with the zombies are all the non-actors who manage to shoot with guns and do little else. Some who have written here believe that the sequel is slightly more focused than the original. All I have to say is that I'm glad the sequel director has eliminated the 360-degree pan-shots that helped ruin the first movie. HOUSE 2 is still more or less the same, which means that nothing happens for 80 or 90 minutes. There is a unique piece, involving soldiers armed with a zombie soccer team, which could at least have been fun. It is not.
