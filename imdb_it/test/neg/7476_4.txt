Once again, we are getting a mix of themes well covered by so many previous films. The story of the good and bad son, courtesy of East of Eden. The story of the American marine hero, who does not consider himself one because of what he knows. And the grieving wife could potentially fall in love with another story about a man. <br /> <br /> The mere fact that those stories are so ubiquitous is not a problem. Because theoretically they could still be presented and treated better each time. No luck this time though, as all three discussions end up falling flat anyway. <br /> <br /> Since the bad son never really talks to his father, so the conflict is never properly resolved. Apart from the type of father who begins to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter who renews the kitchen of his grieving wife. Now how satisfying it is. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, the sailor surprisingly returning home who suspects his wife of conflict of infidelity is never resolved. Because he never really talks to the suspected man, his brother. So once again we are given a free end here. <br /> <br /> And finally, the theme of American military hypocrisy, where the marine is publicly considered a hero when, due to the dirtiness of the war he went through, it should not be called one like his standards, that the third theme falls flat the same. Because the film ends just when, for the first time, he is only able to talk to his wife about what he went through. Where the real story would actually have started at that point, that is to say its recovery process, how it would have been and how it would have dealt with the family, would have had some serious fault to admit. All this, all really interesting pieces have passed and ignored. <br /> <br /> So, with regards to the plot, this film is a serious one, and I mean seriously, disappointment, I would still give points for the impressive die-cast. Although no film should use Maguire for a voiceover, because it belongs to Spiderman. Above all, an adult Gyllenhaal seems to satisfy all the expectations he has aroused as a young and aspiring actor. So much so that I would really like to see him entrusted to a very deep and demanding role of appropriate profile. <br /> <br /> So, while the cast really seems to be doing what it can, I consider this film totally forgettable otherwise. A superficial and ultimately pretentious, absolutely unsatisfactory press. Message of the trip to the writers: we already know the wounds, we see the guest of the films of Vietnam. Want to earn some credit, show us a credible healing.
