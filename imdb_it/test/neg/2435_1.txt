I don't usually write reviews, in fact, I never write reviews. This film was so atrocious that it actually inspired me to start. Virtual Sexuality tries to be a light and brazen adolescent comedy regarding the usual traps; virginity, boys etc. except that the main character apparently turns into his perfect boyfriend who she created using a car at a technology fair. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting? Well, it's not. Acting is the most spasmodic and terrifying I've ever seen. The unfortunate thing is that they really seem to support the script and the film, which probably explains why I've never seen them in any memorable production since. I didn't bother to learn the names of the actors, nor their characters. The lading lady doesn't kidnap you or fascinate you and, therefore, you don't care about her. The protagonist's male friend does not sympathize even when the script screams loudly for you to pity him. The only upside that will come from you is one of extreme anger and sudden violence. The only half-decent actor was the man who led the blonde, who, despite his miserably weak role, had actually given all he could, which was not much in the light of such a horrendous job. I won't even talk about the abominable acting that are the "bad guys" of the plot. But then again, what plot? <br /> <br /> I saw this movie unfold incredibly, because I had absolutely no idea how someone would have had the foolish audacity to write such a script, not produce, act and direct it. I can only ask myself. The only reason why my partner and I kept looking at such a movie example was the incredulous laugh that came out of us when the plot, logic, class and even the helpless plot were neglected in the half an hour later. I have absolutely no idea why anyone wanted to violate the film industry by releasing this to the public. This is a joke of a movie and it is better to leave to collect dust in the stores for the rest of eternity. 1/2 on 10. If that.
