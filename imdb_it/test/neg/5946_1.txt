Folks! it's a "comedy" about a man whose parents beg him to kill them because they're becoming senile and want to be put out of their misery. He tries to kill them several times and then changes his mind, saving them from death traps at the last minute and losing one of his body parts every time he does. The film seems to hate his main character, which makes it even more painful to watch. There is also the usual attachment to love and the predictable ending. <br /> <br /> This film was also the first time I saw Tom Selleck without a mustache, and I remember that his shaved upper lip looked strange and I feel a bit slippery. But this may have been only because of the terrible premise and the lame execution of the film.
