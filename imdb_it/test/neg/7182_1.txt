Another example of the fact that we should avoid trying spectacular action films in Sweden, does not work, except for Widerbergs still unsurpassed MANNEN PÃ… TAKET. Stormare does the best it can, I suppose, and some scenes are slightly effective, but the plot is complete with holes. Why does Hamilton continue the attack on the base, knowing that his wife is being held hostage? It was fun to see Mark Hamill, but his part of Bad Guy was very written. I am constantly amazed that relatively large Swedish films like this are made without a sensible and functioning script. 1 out of 5.
