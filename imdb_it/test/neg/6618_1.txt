Why was this not voted the best film of 1998? This must be the best film ever. It makes something like Citzen Kane looks like crap, come on, Citzen Kane wasn't even in color! I love this movie, it must be the best film I've ever put my money on. I'm still shocked that he wasn't nominated for NOTHING! <br /> <br /> If 10 is the maximum you can give him, I give 20!
