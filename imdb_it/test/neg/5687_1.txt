I knew it would be a bad movie when I rented it, but I was hoping for a good bad movie. Oh well, I had fun teasing the endless sand that was trudging, eating camel dung (well, actually eggplant) and strange acting that made us think they were five actors. The DVD needs a director's comment to find out what he was thinking ... or if it was. I can't believe they actually went to England, Australia and everywhere to film this ... ANYWHERE could have been done. It would have been better if they had managed to get her naked. The best line of the film? "Wait for his updates." "Yes, I'm still waiting." Now that was FUN! If someone had more than 3 pages of dialogue (besides the narrator .... SHUT UP ALREADY), then I will look at it again.
