A horrendous film, poorly conceived and raw. The acting of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan is so inferior to that of Perkins and Leigh in the original version that they must be seen to be believed. There was no reason to take this picture, which only shows how complete and brilliant Hitchcock was and how inimitable it was. Furthermore, there is a creeping and pervasive insensitivity in the film that is not there in the first film. Hitchcock's Psycho was scary and shocking, but it could be sincerely proved for all concerned, even the pitiful Norman Bates. There have been moments of pathos, irony and mad humor that the remake does not have. One of the best things about Hitchcock's film was his incredible and intuitive depth and sense of nuances, of when to cut and when to show something, whether to use a close-up or a long shot, whether to make an actor sympathetic and when to scare him, etc. The remake has none of these qualities nor does it test for them. It is an idiotic exercise that I am amazed even though it was released.
