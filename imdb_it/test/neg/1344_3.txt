I've never seen the original version of the 1930 film, but this remake is one of the worst I've seen from a major production studio in years. Seeing actors like Meg Ryan and Annette Bening, once near A-level talents, their sleepwalking through poorly written roles is painful. There seemed to be no desire to be in front of the camera for anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Jada Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing interpret worthless roles that have no impact on the plot and add no entertainment value. The character of Jada Pinkett Smith is used as nothing more than a ploy to appear modern, having an African American lesbian character, but in reality she is there to simply look cool. There is no real reason why Messing in this film besides filling the amount of women in the original I take. <br /> <br /> The secondary characters played by Eva Mendes and Debi Mazar are stereotypical female characters, with Mendes portraying the fox who tries to steal the rich but bored and slightly neglected husband and Mazar who covers the roles of the gossip. <br /> <br /> The film is boring, lacking in charm, humor or sympathy for any character. It almost seemed that the film was a punishment for all the people involved, both in front of and behind the camera. <br /> <br /> There is a sparkling hope in the film, no matter how little it can shine surrounded by darkness and the dying stars around it are Cloris Leachman. Leachman is still an incredible talent who brings his remarkable charm and humor to the film, in his small role.
