'Take Fame' and 'You've Got Served' and roughly unite them and what do you have? This horrible film about God is tailor-made for dull teenagers. The plot closely follows 'You've Got Served.' Three Afro-adolescent boys from the ghetto, this time living in Baltimore, in the John Water area, not far from the Peckers' home, spend their time at school and dance in crumbling 100-year-old buildings with infernal mothers. To finance their expensive extravagant hip-hop outfits, they steal cars and deliver them to the local chop shop, not unlike John (Tony Manaro) Travolta who worked at a Brooklyn paint store to buy his disco clothes in polyester. /> <br /> Tyler Gage, one of the three black musketeers, is captured while transporting the local Fame High School and is forced to perform cleaning duties. He meets Nora Clark, a 26-year-old white schoolgirl who discovers that she is Irish-American, to the great regret of her black friends Mac and Skinny. <br /> <br /> Like in "You're Got Served" crime doesn't pay and Skinny, the youngest member of the trio is hit by a bad guy Bad Leroy Brown ?? but that doesn't stop the music ?? and the touching ending.
