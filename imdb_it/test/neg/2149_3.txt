Hell to pay was a disappointment. It had nothing to do with the substance of a western B movie, and it should in no way be compared to a fantastic film like Silverado. The dialogue was boring, the plot was dull, the soundtrack was overwhelmingly useless and the acting was horrible. Professionals could also have taken lessons from Sunset Carson School of Acting. The only positive thing about this movie is that it has some of the best cowboy shooters in the nation on display, but you can see them in a better light on any SASS video. The packaging of this feature makes it very tempting, and the preview is decent, but it's all over later.
