I don't understand how this garbage ended up on the movie shelves, it's not even a real movie! It was incredible, me and a group of friends decided to watch this night and it was the stupidest thing any of us have ever seen, I couldn't believe it! We watched the first 15 minutes in total amazement that someone actually thought about it and then it became a movie. I'm on the crack? My hypothesis is yes, in large doses. I strongly doubt that anyone would ever like this garbage. This should be science fiction or comedy or what? It is not me that the idiots who imported this, have just decided to make a film about nothing and see how many suckers could be fooled into watching. Well, let's put something on the film so let's get it to the cinema and see if they actually put it on the shelf: no, no, no. This is not a movie. Acting is like watching wooden puppets moving and reading from a book, it's so bad. I want to go to the movies and complain and get my money back, nobody should put up with this shit. So I'm here to warn you - DON'T RENT THIS FILM, it's the stupidest thing you've ever seen!
