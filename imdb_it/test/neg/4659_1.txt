This 'schlock-buster' should bring a warning about the health of the government. If you play it in your DVD machine, you run the serious risk of opening a gap in the space-time continuum and disappearing without a trace of it - so bad is this "movie". <br /> <br /> The fact that this film was such a success is proof of the real desperate state of modern Hollywood cinema, and the continued commissioning of films that appeal to the "lowest common denominator" - even though I have really afraid to think of the "lowest common denominators" that this movie actually appeals to !! <br /> <br /> I think Hollywood is conducting some sort of rehearsal when they made and screened this movie! I can imagine the meetings of the board of directors in the studio ... "How bad can a film manage to make it - and STILL make a lot of money! ??! Sacred cow, I didn't realize we could go THAT bad !! Woooo hooooo! ! "<br /> <br /> The only films worse than this that I can think of (and believe me is close) are Die Another Day (the franchise of RIP the Bond as I knew it) and Independence Day! <br /> <br /> AVOID - AVOID - AVOID !!!!
