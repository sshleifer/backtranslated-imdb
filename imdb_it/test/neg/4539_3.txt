Anyone who sees this film will notice that the producers have thrown a lot of money into this film. It's interesting that they called it "The Hole"! Production values ​​are good for a short film. The hole tries to look like a big budget and somehow it does, but it's hampered by the video format in which it was shot. I imagine that if it was shot on 35mm it would have looked incredible and would have raised the content a bit. Many Hollywood movies look good and that's enough for the public, regardless of the story and the content. <br /> <br /> My sincere opinion, 3 out of 10 for this effort. Perhaps the next Ishimoto film will deliver.
