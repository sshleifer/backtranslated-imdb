This film started as a discreet-looking film, but it never really started, but instead it became predictable and even a bit silly. Some scenes were quite well done, the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and the like made the vision a little more interesting, but since the story was rather slow, it could not keep the interest alive. And more importantly, it's not scary at all! It should be a horror movie, but there wasn't a scene that was close to terror or even exciting .. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the actors weren't even that big, no colorful character will remember you for the rest of your days .. <br /> <br /> Overall, a watchable movie, but it doesn't add anything and once you've finished watching it, it won't last long until it's already forgotten. /> <br /> The reason I looked at it was because I had read some reviews giving it the best scores, but I disagree and instead would rate it 4 out of 10. If you still want some Japanese horror, I suggest you watch Ju-On instead! <br /> <br />
