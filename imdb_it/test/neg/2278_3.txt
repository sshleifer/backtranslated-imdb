This is what was once called "female painting" and later a "chick film" when times and films became more youthful. The plot is just soap operas for women and will appeal to those guys only. The only appeal for most guys is if they want to see a Mary Thyler Moore too thin in tights. (If you're of a certain age, like me, it might still be enough to give it a try.) Otherwise, MTM offers another of its typical exhibits from the number it has held since the early 1970s when taken for the heart that she was America's Sweetheart. Christine Lathi offers another one of those unpleasant and unpleasant performances that seem like a real part of her as a person and that probably interest only those of that type. (Sorry, but it seems true.) Ted Danson is too young as a husband of MTM and usually makes a somewhat disturbing appeal unless he has an acting partner who can soften him. And it doesn't happen here. Allan Burns wrote and directed and probably understood everything because he worked with Mary in the past, wrote it as a project for her, and at this point he had the gist to do it. There seems to be no other purpose.
