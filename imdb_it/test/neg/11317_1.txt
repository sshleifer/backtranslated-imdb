I saw it with my kids, they loved it, but it's not like she's been overwhelmed by a reindeer in the song, but what the hell in this lousy movie was hit by the sled, it's like hell because why, when my kids have felt sinking they thought it was beautiful, but we saw this they were like this "dad because he made the grandmother" this is the way my children say grandmother, anyway my children said this "dad because grandma is been hit by a sled "I told them that the movie was lousy they agreed, it's sad because someone would call the dog" Doofas "which is just stupid and when everyone dressed in black looked so so I mean Daphne looked like a goth emo dang girl every one looks like Goth and in the song they found the grandmother on the floor I think she died in the song, but in this weird lousy movie she was gone I think they had to take this show OK, everyone would love that I give this 1 on 10
