The action scenes were pretty good. But the plot of the film, I should give a score of 1 in 10. It seems that the producers and the director of this film have not thought carefully? <br /> <br /> It does not give its viewers much value and value, except for violence. The whole story was about revenge. A boy witnessed a rape and murder. I would even recommend being banned. Those who looked at it, you just lost money. If you're thinking of watching it, look at something else. I would ask for a refund if I were in a cinema. So for you guys and girls out there reading this article. Please don't waste time.
