In the event that you dear readers have never heard of, this film was the main inspiration for Samuel L. Jackson-Eugene Levy, the clunker The Man. This comic 80's action comedy soaked with couples matches the billy Billy Crystal and the late Ethiopian Shim-Shammer Gregory Hines along with witty Chi-town cops who don't respect the rules. This is practically the extension of the film. Interest is somehow reached by Hines' delivery line, which is spectrally similar to that of Will Smith and cameos of now more famous actors such as Joe Pantoliano di Memento and Jimmy Smits of NYPD Blue. My favorite scene is, I don't know, the car chase on the tracks, I guess. Basically, I just saw this movie as an important hand in demolishing action movies. Well, this is Lethal Weapon 4 ... and Rush Hour 2 ... and The Man ...
