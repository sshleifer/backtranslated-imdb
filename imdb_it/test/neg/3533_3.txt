A scientific experiment designed to create a superhuman being has gone wrong. The creators were trapped in a remote desert outpost, persecuted relentlessly and mercilessly by their own creation. James Stockton, the scientist whose research was used despite his protests to create the monster, is called the outpost to help undo the horror that now lurks somewhere within the dark halls. James, along with his son and daughter, soon find themselves trapped inside with others, trying desperately to survive. And with the outpost sealed from the inside, there is no way out ... "The Outpost" / "Mind Ripper" is very unoriginal. The sets are rather claustrophobic and there is some blood. However as a horror it fails miserably on almost all levels. There is no suspense, the script is weak and full of big holes and the ending is extremely predictable. Master Wes Craven has produced this, I wonder if he is happy with this basket. Joe Gayton directs without style. The acting is horrible, only Lance H enriksen can behave completely. OK, I'm a big horror fan and I was bitterly disappointed. Avoid it like the plague: it's always the same old and boring shit!
