The main premise of this film is the fantasy of every woman: a vagina that kills and eats men. Well, at least it's a fantasy for every woman who has ever had a fight against a man. What is 99.9999% of women? But don't worry, it's not a type of eating men. It's more like a comedian who deceives them, like a drain plug. There is no blood or parts left behind. So for the blood, the courage and the gore fans, forgotten about this film, there is not much blood here. <br /> <br /> The two main characters in the film are somewhat unrealistic. Helen is a good girl who becomes a prostitute. Meanwhile, Dennis is a good boy chasing Helen. <br /> <br /> The story is already a bit silly at this point, but then they insert two other equally silly sub-stories that send this film into the evil B-movie territory. The first new subplot concerns Dennis who finds a new love with a pair of Siamese twins; and then eventually killing one of them and becoming a runaway robber. The second new subplot talks about Helen finding a new love with a nice cop who saved her from a bad prostitution date, and decided she wanted to marry her. Dennis and Helen eventually meet again at the end of the film in unbelievable circumstances, and magically the murderous vagina of Helen is healed!
