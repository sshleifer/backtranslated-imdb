I participated in a screening of this film. Travolta came to do a Q & A at the end of the film. It was a small screening room in Tribeca. To his courtesy, I didn't leave the house I wanted to do. This is the worst movie. The script was poorly written to start. The writer writes in one voice. The dialogue was drafted and clich√©. How this director / writer got Scarlet Johansen, John Travolta and Lions Gate Entertainment to support this is the only brilliant thing he accomplished in this fiasco. In fact, I recommend this film to all aspiring screenwriters, directors and filmmakers. Because when you are told that you are wasting your time and it will be impossible for you to reach your goals. Hey ... look at this shit and tell yourself ... if they can make it all possible. <br /> <br /> PS- Travolta did a great Q & A even though ... he was at ease, spoke freely and was a good guy. The director / writer was on the sidelines. When John tried to get her involved in the conversation, she pulled back like a piece of wood and never joined. I looked at it and thought ... how could this person "successfully" launch agents, studio managers, top talent ... when he can't open his mouth to a screening of his film. Some of us have concluded that he must have strong family ties in the business world. <br /> <br /> After watching this, you should follow him with Guy Ritchie's zero-star masterpiece "Swept Away" with the most unintentionally funny and worst performance of his wife Madonna. She's so bad and it looks so bad in this movie that I imagine she was her way to get her back for all the abuse she took from her at home.
