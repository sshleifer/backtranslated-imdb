Potential spectators must be notified, IMDb's current IMDb rating for "Tomorrow at Seven" is a low turnout anomaly. He has an interesting premise, a killer leaves an Ace of Spades calling card on the scene of his crimes, while warning the victim in advance. The execution is still flat, and to say that the film has its share of holes in the plot would imply that there is actually a plot. <br /> <br /> Chester Morris plays the mysterious writer Neil Broderick, who intertwines elements of royal murder from the Ace of Spades assassin in his latest novel. Broderick intends to interview a wealthy businessman for his book, but first he has to get past the eccentric secretary of the man - "If you take his relatives, you would have enough nuts to hold a Ford together." That phrase ceremoniously takes him to his daughter "nut" Martha (Vivienne Osborne), who offers to do introductions. <br /> <br /> Broderick meets Thornton Drake (Henry Stephenson) just as the latter is about to complete a jigsaw puzzle delivered by a courier that morning. The only remaining pieces, as we learn in the following scene, form the bold and black form of the Ace of Spades containing the words "At Seven Tomorrow Night". Now, which person who puts together a puzzle doesn't use the pieces with contrasting colors BEFORE! <br /> <br /> Initially I was fascinated by the appearance of Frank McHugh and Allen Jenkins in their roles as police detective couple summoned to Drake's residence. In general, their characters are colorful enough to offer real comic relief, but here they are simply annoying. In particular, McHugh's Clancy ends up shouting objections to the inane comments made by his partner Dugan, and both usually go in the opposite direction when real problems might arise. <br /> <br /> Now here's a question - in light of the ace assassin's identity, why would he invite a novelist and a couple of cops he had just met, on a flight to his Louisiana plantation? Especially when at seven o'clock, all parties would be a captive public aboard the plane when the first murder is committed. However, it is not Drake who died, but his secretary Austin Winters (Grant Mitchell). The first suspect falls on the Henderson pilot (Cornelius Keefe) after a scene of lights out, but Henderson has not yet reported the murder to his supervisor until he arrives at the Drake plantation with all the others. Can you imagine someone trying to get away with it today, unless your name was Ted Kennedy? <br /> <br /> With the cause of death still to be determined, the local coroner is called, but the first one showing up (an accomplice of Broderick) is a fake. Yet when the real coroner shows up, he simply disappears immediately! In a second dark scene, a letter from the victim of the Austin Winters murder is about to be read. It is lost when the lights are turned back on, and since it could indicate the murderer, it becomes a clue that must be recovered. So where was the letter? Winters' daughter, Martha, grabbed her and put on the cloak in the living room! How much was thought of in this? <br /> <br /> Obviously, the whole thing is so silly that the Morris character solves the case quite easily. Even if the film arrives in about an hour, it becomes almost a task to watch with all the nonsense going on. There is really only a humorous moment that is worth repeating; while aboard the plane, the detectives have this exchange: Dugan - "Hey, Clancy, how often do these things fall?" Clancy - "Once!" <br /> <br /> With the exception of McHugh and Jenkins, I can't say I saw any of the other actors in the films of the time, even though I'm a fan of most of the "B" mystery movies from the 1930s through the 50s. Fortunately, the couple says much better about the backup of Humphrey Bogart in a silly 1938 gem - "Swing Your Lady", where laughter is intentional. The best I can offer of "Tomorrow at Seven" is a quote from Martha Winters about this turkey - "This is just a silly waste of time".
