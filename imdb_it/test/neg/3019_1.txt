This is probably the worst thing I've ever seen on television. First of all, I'm pretty sure it takes everything seriously, and I tend to be pretty good at recognizing satire. Second, it shows the Aristotelian levels of chauvinism; in one of the advertisements for it, one of the "playas" describes women in terms of "quality". Thirdly, every competitor I saw on it (six, I think) was a meathead mroead of the variety that probably has a Facebook with "BONING U" or "WOMEN" inserted under "Here For". To paraphrase Roger Ebert, this does not scrape the bottom of the barrel, nor does it deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as the barrels. The closest thing to a saving feature I experienced about Key to the VIP was to have a friend reassure me that the male cast was really the opposite of attractiveness, both in physical and mental terms.
