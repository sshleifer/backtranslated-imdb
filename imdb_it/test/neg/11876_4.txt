After an undercover mission in Bucharest to reveal an international band of arms traffickers, agent Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) is in charge of protecting the Romanian Nadia Kaminski (Silvia Colloca), the widow of a Romanian mafia accountant. However, the CIA's secure home is interrupted by criminals and Sonni realizes that the information has been leaked from within the Agency. Alone, trusting only his friend Michael Shepard (William Hope), Sonni fights to survive and protect Nadia. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes' career is downhill. I've just seen this movie, and it's another disappointing film by this actor, whose career is currently very similar to that of Steven Segal. The film has many explosions, strokes and car chases associated with a horrific story and horrible acting. First, the African-American Wesley Snipes is chased by the Bucharest police, but they never find a black American man. I have never been to Romania, but I believe that there are not many African Americans in this country. His character does not like to bathe, he wears the same clothes for many days. There is no chemistry between Sonni and the sexy Silvia Colloca, but she freely has sex, falls in love with him and shares her fortune with him. The boy who plays Nadia's son is horrible. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Detonador" ("The Detonator")
