My hypothesis would be that this should have been at least two parts, and therefore at least a quarter more, because otherwise how can you explain its confused and abbreviated plot. I was never completely lost, but I was often partially lost and usually unclear about the character's motivation. The film seems as if to unite the points of the plot was abandoned to insert it in its time slot. <br /> <br /> If it were longer, it might make more sense, but it wouldn't be very good anyway. The most interesting idea of ​​the film is the war between Zeus and Era as a war between male and female, but the film drops the ball on this, making the followers of Hera quite horrible while it is not clear on what the followers of Zeus do or believe. The film is also interesting because the gods are not seen and there is no certainty that they exist. So he has a couple of intriguing ideas, but he doesn't do anything useful with them. <br /> <br /> Bad dialogue, cartoon characters and an interesting scene involving Hercules and his three antagonistic children. Not unwatchable but not worth looking at.
