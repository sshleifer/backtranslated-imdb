This film as a 1st KSA movie should be active for their people and show the good thing about them. Otherwise, we see in this as the cast of Rotana that wants to show the inhabitants of the religion in Saudi Arabia terrorists and fools, in reality they are not very peaceful and intelligent. About the director is not even less good. The grandfather in the film is much younger than his father, everyone notices him. And the girls who are not Saudis, by the way, show our girls as pitches looking for the man to satisfy their needs. Hasham was just another part of the furniture in place he did nothing to imagine only when he told his lover that I love you and scream to his friend not to talk to strange girls >>>>>>> really funny or really stupid < br /> <br /> The Father did not move so just to set them and he watched this film as if it were not one of the only cast words he said "A5zo Al Shai6an". The Weird Thing in this film is when the girls were put into the restaurant by the family, there the voice behind the young man talks to his friends "kiss me" many times >>>>> It happened in Saudi Arabia when the girls and the boys grow well and Muslem not bitch and adulterous. Every Saudi has a patriotic heart in his heart he will not allow to see this stupid movie
