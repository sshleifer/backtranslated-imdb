I've never seen a B movie like this ... on the side that the nanny Sofia is killed ... a woman's hand appears on the tape that handles the stick ... what's wrong ??? LOL, I laughed seriously and wanted to stop watching the movie, but I kept looking at it to see if this movie could get worse ... LOL ... it's bad for himself ... poor Pinocchio ... the only beautiful piece it's the first time you see any special effects on Pinocchio's face that move ... apart from the fact that the whole movie is terrible ... it's not really worth your time if you don't really have much to spare! But if you have nothing to do ... come on ... give some "Z" movies because B-movie is still too good for this ... LOL
