Well, I'm a big fan and follower of Elizabeth Berkley. I bought it on DVD from eBay for my boyfriend's birthday. We sat down to watch it and it was so boring. I don't remember laughing once. It is only for about an hour and a half and it seems like it will take forever to finish. Elizabeth is fantastic in this though. Maybe it's just because I'm a big fan of Elizabeth Berkley though. If it wasn't there, I wouldn't have looked at it, but every time it came into my face it lit up. Unfortunately, neither Elizabeth could save this film. Only the general story and the horrible comedy make this film a movie you'd rather lose than an hour and a half of your life. It is a very forgetful film.
