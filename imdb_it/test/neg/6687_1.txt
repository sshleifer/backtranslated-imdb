Seriously, I didn't find anything that constituted rational human thinking in this film. For some reason, the writer decided to have a group of actors in random places that grunted, screamed and screamed like Cro-Magnon bipeds. I understand that it was gymnastics, but seriously, what's all the roar and the human bleating? I have also seen at least five actors with hyperactive terror syndrome and stage 10 syphilis. <br /> <br /> Although this film has real human acrobatics, I must say that it is surprising that you can make a film like this without have no intelligible form of human speech patterns. This is truly a milestone in the history of cinema because there was no conscious decision to make the characters express something more than a timely Urrrrr! or RFFF! sound. <br /> <br /> Incredible.
