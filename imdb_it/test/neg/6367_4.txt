This year's Eurovision was a great disappointment for me. I've seen the Eurovision Song Contest every year since 1986 (well, at least that's the first I can remember, and I was only 2 years old at the time). Like every other year, this contained good, bad and horrible songs - nothing new there. However, this year's show was the worst I can remember. Only very few songs (probably probably more similar) and a lot of absolutely terrible songs. <br /> <br /> The winning song of Turkey "Every Way That I Can" seemed to me a rip off of the Turkish singer Tarkan hit "Simarik", it looks much worse. He didn't deserve to win from my point of view. The Belgian song "Sanomi", second place, was a song that did not speak. I wonder which one will be next? Animals that sing? However, the music for the song was quite catchy, giving the song a sort of dreamy feel, to which the "lyrics" seemed appropriate. One of the best songs, but it's not saying much. <br /> <br /> After one of the closest races in the history of Eurovision, the Russian duo t.A.T. ended in third place just three points from Turkey and behind Belgium, with "Ne Ver ', Ne Boisia" ("Don't trust, don't be afraid"). For me t.A.T. it was one of the very few highlights of the show, surprising almost all of them being among the most covered girls of all female competitors. They let their song speak and if we ignored the fact that they failed to sing a few times in the first chorus, they let the song speak very well. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise when you look at the scoreboard was Austria. The bookies here in Denmark had the greatest chance on that song - a song that was really beyond horrible - but ended up in eighth place. Could it be that the ass of his being shaken to the rhythm of the song? That performance was what made me and my family laugh, not because it looked good, but because it seemed so stupid that it was actually fun. <br /> <br /> Sweden did what it did best; ABBA. In 1999 they won with "Take Me To Your Heaven", playing as ABBA. In 2001 they made the top 10 with "Listen To Your Heartbeat", still playing as ABBA, and once again this year they did it in ABBA style, finishing again in the top 10. <br /> <br /> England has finally been punished for making those songs absolutely horrible and non-catching, which have been in recent years. <br /> <br /> Ireland has snatched the winner since 2000, "Fly On The Wings Of Love". And I could go on talking about how bad the songs were. <br /> <br /> I feel a little sorry for the Australians, who this year finally had the opportunity to see the Eurovision Song Contest. They deserved better than that. <br /> <br /> I was not surprised by the show. The Eurovision from 2000 to me stands out as one of the best in recent years. 2001 was quite good, but not as good. 2002 was fine, but certainly no more. This year was simply disappointing. <br /> <br /> We hope you get better next year. If it weren't for us, at least for the Australians. <br /> <br /> 4/10. One for the t.A.T., one for the closing race, one for the agitation and one for the rest.
