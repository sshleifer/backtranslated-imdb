Six students in a convent make the unthinkable: kill a nun who was overbearing. Now, eighteen years later, the spirit of the nun is back and takes revenge for her murder. <br /> <br /> Yes, in practice it is the short. There's more, but I still have no idea what it is. The only really interesting thing is the effect on the spiritual nun, as I was very impressed by the fact that it is a low budget film. I am also confused as to whether it is in English or not. Most of the actors are Italian, and even here the title is in Italian, but in the film they speak English (I think, or may have been nicknamed, I don't know yet). <br /> <br /> In any case, the real premise of the film is rather idiotic, and the ending not only makes no sense, but ... well ... it doesn't make sense.
