A vehicle for Michael Caine. It's pretty well written and there's a bit of acting, but it's actually a disaster - not funny enough, not scary enough. He is a modern cockney flamido thriller. <br /> <br /> I like the premise: even in East London's inland refugee, people do things for the right reasons. A surprise result for the first real fight that Caine's old school Billy Shiner promoted ignites his paranoia. The second part of the film leads him to chase shadows to face the disappointment of the outcome of the first. <br /> <br /> My biggest disappointment was in the inability of director John Irvin to do more than the relationship between Shiner and his lieutenant / subsidiary Frank Harper. Harper's, a British Tom Sizemore, understands his role well while those around him seem to have ignored him. Pity. 4/10
