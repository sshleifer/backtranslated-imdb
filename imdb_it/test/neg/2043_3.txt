Among the few alternative titles in English, "The Sexorcist" is certainly the most appropriate, since it is basically a shameless rip-off of William Friedkin's classic horror film in which they replaced thirteen year old Linda Blair with 19 Stella Carnacina , old only because she could show her naked and fascinating body for free. I'm not sure what exactly Satan is trying to accomplish here, but it seems like he only owns the girl to play sexual tricks on her! Poor Danila masturbates all day and tries to seduce priests and even her father to have sex with her. The girl is presented as an intelligent and ambitious theology student with a strange-looking boy (driving a stupid yellow car) and loving parents, albeit adulterers. When he takes a particular house to renovate, the ancient relic comes to life and none other than Satan himself (played by Ivan Rassimov of "Jungle Holocaust" and "Planet of the Vampires") begins to torment her. The long masturbation sessions and some bizarre nightmare sequences cover about three-quarters of the film, and finally the director Mario Garriazzo starts with the actual exorcism. That last segment is even more embarrassing and amateur! The priests do nothing other than say a few vague prayers, but somehow, Danila seems to have recovered suddenly. There is not much blood, the dialogues are horrible and the producers seem to compensate for every little flaw by adding more sleaze! This is one of the strangest attempts at Italian exploitation in the seventies (why the hell are they referring to "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"?), But certainly not one of the best. If you like clones of "The Exorcist", I recommend "Demon Witch Child", "Beyond the Door" and "The Antichrist".
