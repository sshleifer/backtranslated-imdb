On the way back from a day at the beach, four young men seek refuge from a torrential downpour in the house of Lord and Lady Alexander after their car ran out of gas. They do not know it, but the house they are staying in must be the place of a satanic ritual. Jane (Camille Keaton), the only female in the group, must be sacrificed. While his male companions run to his aid, one of them accidentally kills Lady Alexander. Things are really out of control and all the others who are watching the black mass are also killed. The four try to escape, but soon discover that there is no escape from what they witnessed. One by one, they meet their destiny. <br /> <br /> Gong in Tragic Ceremony, I was sure I would like it. My gothic alley is slowly growing. I also like some other Riccardo Freda films like The Horrible Dr. Hichcock, The Ghost and I Vampiri. The tragic ceremony seemed to be a sure thing. Unfortunately, things don't always work the way they should. The biggest tragedy compared to Tragic Ceremony is the time I spent watching this mess of a movie. With a few minor exceptions, nothing about the movie fascinated me or worked for me. The characters are unlikely, the plot is inconsistent and schizophrenic, and the pace is terrible. There is a subplot of cursed pearls that goes nowhere and only serves to further confuse things. Furthermore, nothing interesting happens for most of the film. By the time the four drivers realized they were in danger, I was well beyond the point of interest. And I don't understand the reviews I've read that praise the acting of Camille Keaton. I suppose it is an exceptional performance if you consider it an emotionless stunning to act. The three male protagonists are the very definition of anonymous. They do nothing to stand out. The supporting cast includes some favorite genres like Luigi Pistilli, Luciana Paluzzi and Paul Muller, but nobody is given anything to do. In fact, Muller's main contribution is a two-minute monologue at the end of the film that attempts to explain what happened in the last 80 minutes or so. It is a weak attempt to provide a summary of a very weak film.
