Close but without a cigar! - this is what my opinion about this movie is! TAG PURVIS wrote and directed this script that should have been rewritten before shooting. Sometimes, ridiculous because or a trivial script, the star of this film is Dan Mongomery Jr and the director of photography. Both of these talents are the ones to watch out for in the future. My recommendation is to wait until it hits your local cable car station and use the rental money on a classic!
