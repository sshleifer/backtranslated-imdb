Do you know that mouthwash commercial where the guy has a mouth full of Listerine or what he is and is really trying hard not to spit it in the sink? This is a great metaphor for this film. I kept looking, even if it was really difficult. But keeping the mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a fresh mint feeling. This film left a bad taste in my mouth. I would have to spit it out when I had the chance. <br /> <br /> The premise is trivial enough to be fun. For the first time in a thousand years, the Gargoyles have returned to Romania, and all the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things have long died. It is up to Michael Pare and other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the Gargoyles break out. Unfortunately, the premise is completely lost in a bad dialogue and less than an enthusiastic acting by human protagonists. The best acting is done by the CG Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie looks like a poor Van Helsing. If you check the brain at the door, this could get you through a sad Monday night. I gave 3 stars out of 10.
