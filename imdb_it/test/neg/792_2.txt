I thought about seeing this movie while I'm shooting a film about a mysterious box, so it would be nice to see how he took this film and developed the idea of ​​a mysterious and unexpected box. <br /> <br /> I had a great expectation for this film before going to the cinema. with actresses, like Cameron Diaz, you'd expect the acting, especially hers, to be fantastic. the acting was a kind of disappointment for the film, the accents of the characters changed throughout the film that made it incredible. <br /> <br /> the whole idea of ​​a strange box that can make your dreams come true but destroy others is such a brilliant story but I feel that the director has disappointed, this film had the potential that could have been a lot more beautiful than it used to be. <br /> <br /> this film had no meaning. he was too confused and needed a constant plot. no one wants to go to the cinema and go out thinking what I just saw 'I didn't understand it at all', sometimes it can be exciting and make people want to watch it again, but this movie has meant that people never wanted to want hear the movie again. during the observation I noticed that half of the audience remained before the finale. I feel that every single person has been disappointed watching this movie because of the high expectations and how slow the film was. <br /> <br /> let's put the negative points aside ... but I like the scene where the son is in the bathroom at the end. it was unexpected, it reminded me of a horror movie and the way it was put together made me imagine and how devastating and scary it would be to be in that position. the lighting and the effects made it excellent, this scene seemed slightly more than the 70s compared to the 70s that this film should be. <br /> <br /> this film was confused because it had so many different bits. parts that you would expect to summarize in the end where everything seems clear but are not, went totally against the expectations of the public, even if they left the film on a hanger, not giving the public a reason why things could happen and work do really well, but no, it was a creative film, different and unusual, I thought it could have been better, disappointed he didn't, he wouldn't buy it on DVD to be honest.
