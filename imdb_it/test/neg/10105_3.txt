OK, the box looks interesting, the opening has good music and its appearance is original, that's all right. But when the movie starts ... well it's not my first videoville, I watched Ghost Lake, and it's very similar to this movie, except it's getting worse here. The story seemed interesting at the beginning but the whole film looks like a film made by a group of university students, with special effects that make me laugh, the blood looks like a mix of red and white paint, the fire effect on the demon's face it looks like it was made with a program that I could buy in my local computer store. The whole film is shot on the day (very nice for a film that should be horror) and there like no gore (1 scene only and it seems so homemade and not credible) and almost without blood (it can be considered a great thing considering the 'appearance of the Blood Show) and 1 demon for the entire movie. The story is not going anywhere, it gives you the impression that it never starts, there is so much useless scene made just to give the film the average duration time (when the demon looks for the boy in the dog thing for about 4 minutes ...) Too many things in slow motion. Well, let's just say that this film is a Z series and very poor. The whole beautiful idea has been lost and a film of cheese is obtained. I was bored for a long time and I'm not the type that gets bored very easily with the horror film, I even like the house of the dead and alone in the dark by Uwe Boll and you probably know the name for being one of the worst directors but here it looks too much like some guys who want to make a movie for fun. Also for us French speaker (I soon understand English I prefer to watch movies in my native language) there the usual videoville ugly translation. In the normal movie you can barely see that the actor doesn't talk (you have to check your lips etc.). Here you just have to listen to it and you know it. Much cheese
