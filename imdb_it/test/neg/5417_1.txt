Wow. I thought, Eskimo Limon was the most horrible and embarrassing first sex movie ever. But I had forgotten that Germany always tries to compete. In this case, the well-known German film producer Bernd Eichinger was successful in producing even worse bullshit. Harte Jungs is stupid, not credible and predictable, and above all: it's not funny. It is almost a tragedy that so many children went to see him in Germany (and, I fear, also in Austria). <br /> <br /> Tobias Schenke, 19, looks too good not to have a girlfriend and is too mature to be 15 and his character is too stupid to be true. Schenke really tries to make us believe he doesn't know anything about sex, but that doesn't help. Harte Jungs seems to have been created by someone watching Al Bundy and taking him too seriously. <br /> <br /> The best actors in the film are Sissi Perlinger and Stefan Jürgens who play Schenke's semi-liberal parents. Perlinger and Jürgens are cabaret comedians who are not particularly talented in film acting. However, their performance is the best and the most fun in comparison. <br /> <br /> A complete failure.
