I always think it would be nice if you could somehow get a preview in some of the old movies that have been reprinted on DVD before buying them. This way you could save yourself some time, money and a certain level of aggro when you feel so completely disappointed. <br /> <br /> "The Buddy Holly Story" is such a film. <br /> <br /> I don't want to go into the characterizations, or the holes in the plot, or the chaos with historical facts that this film contains, since I had already reckoned with them twenty years ago, when I started looking at it first time. <br /> <br /> I recorded it on the old Beta (mono) machine in the early 80s, and I liked it so much, that it became a regularly played favorite. The best part, in my opinion, was the performance of Gary Busey as the young Buddy, and his almost perfect voice and guitar. <br /> <br /> I looked forward to the day when I could have it in ... STEREO ..., and this is where the disappointment comes. <br /> <br /> This DVD version is (apparently) remastered in both audio and video, according to shell information, but I'm afraid it both left me sadly disappointed and looking at my watch, wishing it would end. <br /> <br /> The sound is murky, bordering on the incomprehensible, and so unprofessional that made me want the crystal clear voice of my old Beta tape! <br /> <br /> Despite what you think of the images, or the plot, or the characters, the real drawing paper here is MUSIC ...... and if you can't hear the main voice because they drowned from the plates, or from the accompanying harmonies, or from other environments, so there isn't much left, right? <br /> <br /> I will convert my old Beta version into (Mono) DVD for later visualizations, and put this where it belongs, with the garbage! <br /> <br /> "Extinction is the rule, survival is the exception ..."
