During my childhood I saw the first three "Critters" films and enjoyed them. They were fun and funny horror comedies perfect for adventurous children and horror lovers. I have never seen "Critters 4", so in the end I decided to try it. My verdict: a forgettable and rather nasty flicker with an extraordinarily low body number. The script by Joseph Lyle and David J. Schow is both predictable and clich√©, the plot rips away "Alien" and "Star Wars" and the sets seem dull and dark The tone of the film seems to be deadly serious making everything slow and boring. "Critters 4" was apparently so low budget that the directors could not afford any optical effects, those taken from "Android" seem seriously dated.4 out of 10. One to avoid.
