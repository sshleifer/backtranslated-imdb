The limited panoramic views were the only thing that saved an otherwise non-trivial and boring film. The acting was rather absurd and I blame the script and the script. Nicole Eggert didn't look the part, she didn't play the part, and she was totally unconvincing as a mountain guide. After seeing this, I had the feeling that some friends had free time and decided to make a movie. It must have been produced on a budget. The plot was thin to the maximum and with the low caliber of acting sometimes asked the question, "Why are we doing this?" I managed to sit down throughout the film, but I also asked myself, "Why?"
