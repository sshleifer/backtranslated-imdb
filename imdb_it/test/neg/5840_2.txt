This film has a premise that is good enough to make anyone talk and a safe conversation starter. "Would you sleep with someone you don't like or don't know for a million dollars?" While the film had great potential, the bad performance turns it into a level B soap opera. The film has a great advantage, and after the proposal is made, we are really in the film, but then it falls dramatically. The last 3 quarters of the film are spent by characters who complain, complain and regret what they did! The ending was so trivial that it made me cry! This has a premise very similar to "Las Vegas honeymoon" which is much better. See that instead.
