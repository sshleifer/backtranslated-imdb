Very strange, this seems to me a very mediocre film, if not slightly inferior. It is shot in a big way, but, along with the R. Lee Ermey performance, it is the only saving aspect that I found in the film that consists of two separate parts. <br /> <br /> The first part deals with the basic marine training that, observing it in 2007, comes off as something I've seen a million times before in dozens of other films and series and isn't particularly exciting. After 30 minutes I had the idea and I wish they could go on. The instructor sergeant is the only credible character while all the others look just like cardboard cutouts. The general acting is staggeringly distorted and the script is devoid of anything interesting and consists little more than the screaming sergeant. The boys pass their training and end up in Vietnam. Oh, and the fat man shoots the sergeant (what a surprise ...), probably in the mistaken belief that he was actually the screenwriter. <br /> <br /> So, an hour has passed and nothing remarkable has happened. Nothing ... <br /> <br /> Then we have the part of Vietnam. <br /> <br /> It opens with a bunk scene where the stars and stripes journalists are bored and are making small talk to pass the time. At first I thought they were reviewing some movie scenes from old movies, it sounded pretty bad. But no, they were actually muttering their lines. So the field is besieged. About 20 Vietcong enter the camp through the main gate. Too bad for them that they are dropped like flies because they simply walk in different cannon positions equipped without any means of coverage. Is it normal behavior? Were all Vietnamese suicides? If so, why did the United States not win this war during the first two months of engagement? The rest of the film continues with even more completely illogical war scenes. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the whole plot is completely useless. None of the characters inspires much sympathy and the plot is frankly rather quiet. It shows little more than some war reporters joining a platoon with some guys fired because they are dishonest defects and they also seem to think that somehow a gaping hole in a wall will protect you from bullets. <br /> <br /> What was the message of this film ... that people died in Vietnam? Are those people animals in war situations? What if you want to get rid of really stupid people, send them to a war zone? Or that somehow in Vietnam concrete can actually burn? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if this movie deserves an 8.3, then Apocalypse Now deserves a 38.3 <br /> <br /> 5/10
