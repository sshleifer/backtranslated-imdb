I saw this short film on the DVD for Ridley Scott's The Duellists. There was no introduction of Scott before the film, it has just begun. <br /> <br /> Boy and a Bicycle is hardly an example of Ridley Scott's other works, he has no resemblance. The film shows a boy, played by Tony Scott, who goes around on a bicycle. Guess what? This is all that happens. The boy goes around, wandering back and forth with useless and confused dialogues. The film was shot in black and white, and since it was directed by Ridley Scott, I was expecting some nice cinematography or visually striking sets. Instead, I was treated with nothing. This film is not even good for a first effort. Anyway, I advise all Ridley Scott fans to try it at least once.
