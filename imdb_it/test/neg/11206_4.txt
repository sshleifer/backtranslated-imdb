This could have been a really good movie if someone knew how to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> The story was going well and was heading towards that point in every movie like this where the "gray" characters become "good" and "bad" characters get their desserts and * boom * ... it's like they're short on screenplays and the cast has just started to invent things. <br /> <br /> What wouldn 'have been so bad ... if the cast had just continued with the development of the character they had already implemented. But this is not the case and the film soon becomes a mess. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch this movie until the last 30 minutes ... and then turn it off. At this point, imagine how you will think the next 30 minutes will be based on what you have seen so far. <br /> <br /> Believe me, the ending you will come out of it will look a lot better than this movie really ends. Trust me on this.
