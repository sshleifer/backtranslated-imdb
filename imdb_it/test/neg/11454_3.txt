Like many early films, Cimarron must be considered more for historical interest than for irresistible entertainment. The recital still of the protagonist Richard Dix, nominated for the best actor, can be excused as a relic of the acting school of silent cinema. However, even giving benefits of the doubt, Cimarron is a malformed dramatic piece - an inflated film that moves from a sequence unrelated to an unrelated sequence with little dramatic impact. Offico, the film is two hours and four minutes; there are four hours you're watching it. There is no reason to waste your time on it unless you want to see each winner of the Best Picture or have a keen interest in the early days of sound. In my opinion, Cimarron is the worst choice for the best image in the history of the Academy and the prize should have gone to City Lights or Little Ceasar. Cimarron is barely remembered today, and everyone would have been reminded except for his Oscar win.
