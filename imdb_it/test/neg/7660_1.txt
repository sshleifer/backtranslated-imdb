The Concorde: Airport'79, is, for now, the last of the drama films, Camp Airport series, at first glance in the TV guide or on the DVD cover you would simply think that the movie you are about to see is as exciting as the movie L previous airport think again! The one you spent 2 hours and 3 minutes of involuntary laughter courtesy of the worst script I've ever written was even written by Eric Roth, who brought the world to Forrest Gump! well, one thing is certain that the script is not worthy of an Oscar, it's Razzie worthy! The Executives at Universal in '79, did the right thing by marketing it as a "comedy" Apart from Charo! the film has an impressive list of casts, it is certainly observable to say the least
