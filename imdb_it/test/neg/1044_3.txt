I saw this movie as a preview before something else I rented some time ago ... and it looked decent. I saw some good things from the Full Moon video, and I thought it was worth shooting ... Unfortunately, it wasn't good stuff. <br /> <br /> The story is about a bed possessed. A couple moves into a new apartment, uncovers the bed and strange things start happening. Strange things like the woman discovers perverse sex. And the man discovers vicious sex. And the woman draws images of vicious sex. And man photographs vicious sex. Both begin to dream of dead people who have a vicious sex. You'd think a movie with a lot of vicious sex would be nice, right? <br /> <br /> Well ... No. The problem is that this should be a film of fear, or at least a thriller and simply not deliver. There is little tension, no suspense and no fear. Apart from some disquieting dreams and visions, there's really nothing for this couple to worry about. The whole film is basically both with these visions and playing in the bed. Sure, you have a monstrous fight at the end ... and a bit of bloodshed ... but nothing spectacular ... There's just a murder and a good scare, and that's it. <br /> <br /> And the vicious sex? Don't have your hopes (or anything else for that matter). Their idea of ​​vicious sex is the woman on top, fully dressed, trying to strangle her partner with a tie. It's not exactly my idea of ​​a good time.
