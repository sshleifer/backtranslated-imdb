not many people outside Poland have had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with andrzej sapkowski's brilliant writings. it is very popular in Poland for its fantasy stories (I believe none of them has ever been translated into English. alas!). In short, wiedzmin - the main character of sapkowski's books - is a travel vampire slayer, a man of extraordinary strength and skill: he's practically your cool tolkien favorite guy. unfortunately, nobody would understand him after seeing the film. 'wiedzmin' the film is nothing but a collection of random scenes, with wiedzmin and other characters taken from the writings of sapkowski, but not that it looks like the plot and the dramatic rhythm of the original. event the fact that some of the shots in the movie show attractive naked women does not add any quality to it. the film gets worse day by day, and does not even meet the requirements of the "so bad is actually good" category. if you are really in the imagination and want to learn something about wiedzmin, read the books instead.
