I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews. This must be one of the worst films, especially considering that it has been recommended. I have to admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this film made it worse because it tried so hard to be intelligent that it forced me to watch it. <br /> <br /> The concept of the film is comparable to an audition week on American Idol. Look why people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew that this movie had no bad actors. So, how fun would it be to have good singers trying to convince you that they shouldn't approach an American Idol audition? It would be useless as this film was. <br /> <br /> The use of improvisation is overrated. We have all been in that environment where a group of friends is falling apart and everyone is making tears in their eyes. I feel he is improvised. Improv cannot be activated just because the camera is rolling as this film demonstrates. If you like Drew Carey to host improvisational shows, you'll probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall the lines were poor, improvisation was sophomoric, and Guest and company over-acting was campy. ..and those are my compliments for this drivel. If a guy playing a trumpet and the kettle drum at the same time is fun for you, good. For me, I prefer more intoxicating things like "I Love Lucy" or "Hee-Haw". <br /> <br /> But remember, I think SNL has lost its humor in the 80s, so maybe you'll like this G-red humor I kept waiting for a person to identify himself as the keeper of the zoo and then he told us that there was no zoo in the city. This is the humor you expect. <br /> <br /> My only wish was that I could give a negative rating.
