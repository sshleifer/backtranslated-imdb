Well, it's the classic Hollywood schmaltz that you can see just a mile away. It is pleasant in some parts but only so predictable. I must confess that I didn't like it very much, but I'm pretty hard to please and many of my friends loved it. <br /> <br /> It's pretty sweet, and the actors perform well. It is a beautiful backdrop and the pleasure for the eyes is quite good. But the irritating, predictable, unoriginal and really boring plot holds the film back. Personally, I can think of better ways to spend a couple of hours of my life. <br /> <br /> The filly genus makes a bit of a bad press, but there are some really good chick movies out there; this is not one of them.
