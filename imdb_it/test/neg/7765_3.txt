All my friends and other colleagues think this show is really cool. First I hate this show !!!!!!! I think I could be the only living female !!! I only saw him because my best friend loves him and imagines he's the character of Charlotte! <br /> <br /> First the whole plot (if one can call it that) is about four women Superslut Samantha (Kim Cattrall) who most likely any STD is available and muscular, brown and green genitals considering that she is three-sex (he will try to do anything). Samantha is not like most of the 40 women, even in New York, but the show would not have had any kind of entertainment since Samantha (along with some beautiful landscapes in New York) is the only reason to watch and those are not a sufficient reason. <br /> <br /> Charlotte (Kristen Davis) is a well-dressed upper-class idiot in New York who still believes in the myth of Pince Charming! As sweet as it is, don't be fooled, it spreads quite often. <br /> <br /> Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) now this woman is a stereotyped and angry feminist. I think in an episode he thinks he's a lesbian, but apparently he's not ... Too bad it's almost interesting. <br /> <br /> Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) the most annoying character. I swear I thought I was looking at Twisted Sister Dee Snider's front man is more virile, cross dressing, sissy boy, brother! This is a girl who tries can not live without you love .... Heard about a puppy? <br /> <br /> This show is stupid and I like to make fun of it because I've heard it's a bit of a new awakening for women. It's sad if you're looking for slutty, pathetic and engaging people in expensive clothes that drink cosmopolitans and look like an annoying fifteen-year-old in cocaine that a show for you ............ Just use the protection.
