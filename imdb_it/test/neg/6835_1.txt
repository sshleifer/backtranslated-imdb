The "Day of the Jackal" of 1973, directed by Fred Zinnemann of the novel by Frederick Forsyth, although not a masterpiece in the general scheme of things, was nevertheless an above-average thriller, written and realized with remarkable verve, spirit and style. It is a pleasure to rent and watch from time to time. <br /> <br /> Adapting the one for the 1997 "Jackal", it seems that at every turn writers and directors have made the worst possible choice, making everything rather leaden, exaggerated, senseless, not surprising, ineffective and unpleasant. If we put together a catalog of all the specific aspects of this film, large and small, I could give you a mini-essay for each topic on how the 1997 adaptation was published. <br /> <br /> Article: the weapon. <br /> <br /> In the original, there is a considerable intrigue on how the killer will smuggle him into the scene, how he intends to hide it and why he needs a personalized work by his underground craftsmen. In the remake, they apparently thought that today's audience with the action movement would not tolerate a small rifle whose point is precise and would require the dismal machine gun out of the black market, which needs a minivan to carry it, and whose point is to shout Macho. All the involved and interesting work on the concealment of its components has been reduced to show us (repeatedly, how is this a difficult point to follow?) That the joystick for its absurdly high-tech remote control system was in his pocket like a pen. <br /> <br /> Subject: the conspirators and the motive. <br /> <br /> Without resorting to the dry lesson, the original still manages to give us a good understanding of the historical situation of the "pieds-noirs" ["blackfeet"], the Franco-Algerian irredentists who could not accept that the century was moving away from colonialism and forming the opinion that De Gaulle had betrayed them. This gives the entire plot a certain historical weight. The remake seems to leave it as a story of revenge by gangster-shootout, minimizing its complexity by making them become Russian gangsters. Please note that I am not against updating: they could have done it intelligently and found something more current but not trivial. Certainly Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union have undergone enormous changes in recent times, and an updated story could have been there in a way that would have made us feel * important *. <br /> <br /> Subject: the relationship between the killer on the run and the police who hunt him; and the complex guide of the spectator's sympathies from bad boy to good boy. <br /> <br /> Above I hesitated a bit to call the original a masterpiece in the complex; but in this respect it was really one. We follow the murderer for most of the early parts of the film, and after seeing his intelligence and resourcefulness we begin to admire him, and we don't want to see his foiled plan or see him caught - at least, not too soon! Then we meet the policeman who is pushed to direct the investigation / protection efforts, and we gradually take them, and we see that it is not the sad bag that his domestic problems might have suggested. The moment it is important, we have been conquered on its side. <br /> <br /> In the remake, perhaps Poitier could have handled this type of development, but Gere cannot. And the absurd "48 Hours" trick of the swindler brought out to help the police should have been left in those comedies where it came from. <br /> <br /> The remake has the killer and the hunter-assassin * speak * of how they are as players on a chessboard, communicating indirectly through their moves and only able to * infer * as is other. This was achieved superbly in the original. But in the remake, in fact, they are brought too soon into a face-to-face fight, so they can make a face at each other, bloody the place and go through fairly standard chase scenes. <br /> <br /> Subject: photography and "scenario". <br /> <br /> The remake has some beautiful images, particularly in the snowy Finland in the opening section. But the Washington, D.C Metro cannot really compete with the streets of Paris for interesting perspectives and spectator faces.
