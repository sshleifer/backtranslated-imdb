*** MAY MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS **** <br /> <br /> I was really excited to go see Blood and Chocolate with my friends. I couldn't wait because the book is one of my favorites. But as soon as the film started, I couldn't believe how different it was. At first I was like, ok, so both of his parents died ... maybe it'll be all right. But then the rest of the film arrived. When it was over I was furious. Nothing was correct, but their names and the fact that Vivian fell in love with Aiden. At the end of the book, Gabriel was my favorite of all time ... and then the film goes and turns it into a perfect heartless idiot ?! The film also showed shapeshifters, or werewolves, as these evil and evil creatures were like the book shows them as simply wanting to adapt and keep their pack safe. They would never have killed humans for the sake of it. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a film like them, they would have to give it a different title and name different characters. Because then I would go out and look at it again and buy it, but when I think about it, all I can see is the villain. You couldn't pay me to go see it again or buy it.
