Carlos may not be the most original comic, but the first series was fun, his comments and comments were cool. I lost a couple of seasons, but after all the material theft charges, I captured a couple of episodes of the Mind of Mencia at the end of July 07. A little change I see! Carlos is much more interested in humor and sex jokes than race observations. In one episode, he implied that he was in the same league as Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle. I do not think so. Perhaps Comedy Central will give him another season, but the episodes I saw seemed tired and the same with more mocking words than the Osbournes. Carlos, back on the field for a couple of years, get some fresh material and try again.
