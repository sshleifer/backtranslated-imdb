If it hadn't been for the Jennifer Jostyn attraction in the lead role, I would have turned "Milo" off after the first 30 minutes. However, as easy as it is on the eyes, it is not enough to save this film, not for a long time. <br /> <br /> Milo leaves with a group of girls who accompany a "presumed boy" in a yellow plaster to a house in the woods where he shows them embryos in jars. Apparently, the agreement was that if he showed them the jars, old Milo will undergo a gynecological exam on each in return. One of the group's volunteers is Milo's "first patient" and he leads her behind closed doors. Moments later the blood gushes out from under the door and we are taken to the present day. Enter the delightful Jostyn who plays one of the girls all grown up today. A replacement teacher with a superficial trust whose closest friend appears to be a goldfish, receives an invitation to return home for a friend's wedding. Yup! You guessed. Return to Miloville. Milo, who allegedly drowned years ago, appears to have a dilemma that remains dead and begins to terrorize and kill girls who failed to "examine" all those years ago. <br /> <br /> Milo, the character, reminded me of one of Cronenberg's "The Brood" mutants. It could have been scary, but how scary can a villain be who wears a yellow raincoat? The plot also confuses itself and the conclusion left me behind my 90 minutes. I'm sending Milo, an inept slasher film, to stand in the corner!
