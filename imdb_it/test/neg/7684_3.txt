Well, I'll be cleaned up and I admit that I was forced as a part of my story to watch this movie, and then write a review of a short film as part of my vote. <br /> <br /> Yet even if I had watched the film alone, I found it extremely boring and absurd at my discretion. The style is dated beyond his years and the acting is farcical. Instead of using dialogue, they glance at each other, or sometimes in nothingness. For me, such an important acting does not convey any greater emotion, and after seeing for the hundredth time an extreme close on Ivan's face I prayed that the film would end. <br /> <br /> But the most disappointing is how wrong Ivan's character is. This man was bad, his thugs murderers of his bodyguard and his cowardly character. For me the film was nothing but a piece of propaganda by Stalin, inaccurate and boring.
