I was looking forward to it, being a big fan of the book. However, when it came out, I remember thinking it was one of the biggest waste of time and money I've ever spent in the cinema. <br /> <br /> In principle, the acting, the sets and the music were excellent, and are the main reason why I vote this for 4. <br /> <br /> In this version, Sara is a little too selfless for my taste. In no way would he deliberately lie to Miss Minchin just to prevent her from punishing the other girls; in the book she strives to describe lies as "not only wicked, but vulgar". <br /> <br /> Even for me it's a Disneyfied ending too; Sara's father returns from the dead and all of them launch into the Indian sunset. While the book has a happy ending (and the criticism could say just as unlikely), it doesn't let you think, "Oh puh-leeze." <br /> <br /> The only real things about the book were: <br /> <br /> 1. Sara's father is a soldier 2. The lines between Sara and her father ("You're learning me by heart ? "/" No, I know you by heart, you are in my heart ".) 3. Sara's friendship with Becky, and her" adoption "Lottie (although the latter was not developed as much as she could have to be) 4. The change of his room with the addition of various luxury items. That part was brilliantly made. 5. The basic core - a rich girl who is suddenly thrown into poverty - is there, but that's all. <br /> <br /> People might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience. Possibly. All I can say is that I have two cousins ​​- 7 and 12 years old respectively - who were big fans of this movie until they read the book. <br /> <br /> If all you want is a "feel good" family movie, then this offers. If you're looking for a movie that tells the story of A Little Princess (in fact, if you've read the book) don't waste time with this. It is a pity; with a cast like this, if they had remained true to at least the basic story, it would have been fantastic. <br /> <br /> I'm talking about "reading the book" this and "read the book" that a little too much? Most likely. But if someone tries to adapt a book - especially a classic - in a movie, it should at least have done the same thing. Preferably more than once.
