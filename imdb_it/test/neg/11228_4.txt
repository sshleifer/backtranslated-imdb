"Crimes of Passion" is a film that is disappointing in many respects. Where should I start from? The plot? It is hopelessly simplistic and full of gaps. The direction? Remember an economic B-movie. The acting? John Laughlin is absolutely terrible in his role as "a well-meaning-for-frozen wife" Bobby, Annie Pots is not convincing as Amy's "frozen wife", and is just Kathleen Turner (above average), and Antony Perkins (excellent ) that gets passable acting signs. More specifically, Antony Perkins offers a great performance like Reverend Peter Shayne, while Turner succeeds in satisfactorily interpreting the roles of sexy China Blue and fragile Joanna Crane. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the performances of Turner and Perkins alone are insufficient to help the film get a vote above 4/10. Watch it if you want to see Turner in some sensational scenes (although on this point the film can easily be combined with his competition - "Basic Instinct" for example), otherwise avoid.
