I saw this movie years ago about 8 years ago when it came out, and the only memories I have of it are: 1. That was terrible. 2. That in one scene Linnea Quigley applied the bronzing lotion to her arms and legs repeatedly for about 15 minutes in a row (it still seemed long). 3. A scene in which a character receives a club rammed in his head. In this scene, when the hammer connects, the head crashes like glass. It's pretty ugly.
