Another test, another miss. France could be destined to not be able to produce a good horror film. I mean ... the least they could do was shoot the film in the forest of Broc√©liande, but even the forest is fake! It was shot near Paris! The subject is useless, the actors are really insignificant and the text makes you want to be deaf. Nothing could save him. <br /> <br /> Bad ... to the bone. I had not been warned. I want my money back.
