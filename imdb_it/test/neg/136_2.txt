I'm trying to find something of value here. The best I can collect is that Truffaut wanted to make a film tedious, painful, childish, annoying, illogical and brainless like the experience of being in love. If that was his goal, then he succeeded, but the solution for his exercise is really a breath to watch. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that screams for a parody: Belmondo compares the features of Deneuve's face to the features in a landscape. All I could think of was "glacier", "ice floe", "two solitary fishermen wearing army surpluses on a frozen lake in Minnesota". <br /> <br /> The only other point of interest was the resurrection of Buffoon's theory of climatic determinism. The tropics are presented as paradise, and things get progressively worse as they get colder, hell is Calvinist French Switzerland. It was fun.
