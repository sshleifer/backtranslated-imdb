George Zucco was a good actor, who often played the villains with perfect eyes with lascivious intensity. However, he also failed to save this film B boring and flat. <br /> <br /> Zucco plays the usual mad scientist, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron, who believes that the blood of the wolf, injected into humans, can create an invincible army of wolf men who can win World War II (go to understand!) By experimenting with Pedro on the handyman (Glenn Strange) Zucco creates a werewolf that looks like the ones Dave Allen used to play in his comic sketches! Pedro is obviously based on Lennie from Of Mice And Men, and you almost expect him to say "Duh, ok, George!" There is a surprising moment in which the werewolf kills a child by reaching out of the window and grabbing it, but for the most part this is a routine and pedestrian, very pedestrian path, which covers all the old cliches made much better in other films. We also got the revenge motive from the Devil Bat, a Son of Frankenstein loan in itself! <br /> <br /> Zucco is wasted, and you just have to see it in movies like Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes, The Mummy's Hand and Dr. Renault's Secret to see how wasted it is. Some striking swamp scenes are all it has to offer, really. And the scene in which Zucco demonstrates his man-wolf technique to those who doubted it (yet the nuances of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde) is unintentionally exhilarating. <br /> <br /> Not one of the best films of the 40s.
