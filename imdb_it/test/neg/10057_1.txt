Nightkill plays Robert Mitchum as a weary private eye of the world that examines the case of a missing industrialist (Mike Connors). He is hired by Jaclyn Smith, the anxious wife of the missing man. What Jaclyn fails to inform Mitchum is that she knows exactly where her husband is. After all, it was she who helped her lover James Franciscus get rid of her rich husband. <br /> <br /> What more would you expect from a rotten movie with Robert Mitchum? Mannix goes to the west, the monkeys are abused, the models lean on classic cars, and Smith is constantly overshadowed by Sybil Danning until a yellow-style shell bitterly completes all the sorrow. This is a BAD movie. And this film is terribly poor. Makes it look like Halloween mixed with Trick or Treats. Avoid this. <br /> <br /> R rating for graphic violence, nudity and sexual situations.
