Chapter one: Once upon a time ?? At A Table (1941) <br /> <br /> in which a German Nazi and a French milk farmer talk at the table for 20 minutes; first in French, then in English. <br /> <br /> Chapter two: three years of inglorious bars in sixteen minutes ... without tables (mainly) <br /> <br /> in which an American lieutenant talks to his new Jewish commando unit American made up of 8 men. There are no tables present. Cut to Adolf Hitler, three years later. He is angry at the inability of his men to take care of the bastards. Hitler has a table. Let's go back to the Basterds in a flashback. Once again, distinct lack of table-based content. <br /> <br /> Chapter 3: The German night in Paris ... At a table ... Speaking <br /> <br /> In which a Jewish woman who fled from under the table in Chapter One has somehow managed to become the owner of a cinema. The Jewish woman talks to an actor at a table in a bar. Later, the Jewish woman, the actor, Joseph Goebbels and a translator speak at a table in a restaurant. The actor and Goebbels speak in German. The translator translates German into French. The Jewish woman answers in French. The translator translates French into German. Goebbels decides to hold a film premiere at Jewish women's cinema. The actor and Goebbels leave. The Nazi arrives (who spoke to the milk farmer at a table for twenty minutes in the first chapter). Talk to the Jewish woman at the table. He leaves. The Jewish woman breaks; overcome with emotion for having spent so much time talking at a table. <br /> <br /> Chapter Four: Operation Table Talking <br /> <br /> In which Austin Powers sends a British officer to join the Basterds and an actress on a mission to speak German at a table in a tavern. After 21 minutes of conversation at the table, they shoot each other. The actress survives but spends the next 5 minutes lying on a table talking. <br /> <br /> Chapter 5: The revenge of the giant table <br /> <br /> In which, the Basterds decide to continue the operation by speaking in Italian and a suicide bombing at the cinema. The Nazi takes the actress to a small room where they sit next to a table. A hoe she found under the table in the tavern fits her so he kills her. Then he brings two of the bastards into a large room, where they sit and talk at the table. Meanwhile, the cinema burns, Hitler is full of bullets and the two Basterds blow themselves up for no good reason. <br /> <br /> The End
