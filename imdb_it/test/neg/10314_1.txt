The DVD release of this film hopes you will buy this film on the name and face of Sandra Bullock. His image (of the years following this film) is basically the cover ... and the art of the back cover ... and the inside cover ... the same image. His name is clearly visible on the cover, on all 4 edges and on the disc itself. She is the first name on the list of stars. His biography is printed inside the case. This film must revolve around his character, right? MISTAKEN! It is his first film and plays a secondary role. After watching the film, each role seems a secondary role. The Dog character actually shows a certain personality. Less than an hour after watching it, I don't even remember the names of many characters. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I had looked at it several times, I could understand the plot, but I don't know, I think it would be worth it. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait, I just remembered some fun! Fans of shooter video games will enjoy the "Doom-cam". It looks just like a first person shooter game. Hands and gun point towards the camera. <br /> <br /> Generally I'm not a critical person in movies, but it could be the worst movie I've ever seen. I kept thinking that some shapes could cross the screen, sit down and start to make fun of it. <br /> <br /> I'm glad the money spent on this (used) went to charity.
