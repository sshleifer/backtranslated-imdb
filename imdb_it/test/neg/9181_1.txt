By far the most racist and ghettoized cartoon for 7+ children. Children who watch this cartoon will probably try to dress, talk and act like the characters portrayed. I'm disappointed by Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. for agreeing to broadcast this terrible program. The Wayan brothers can be good at movies for young adult viewers. They should stick to the movies and not create other episodes for this cartoon. Usually young celebrities start working in movies and do voice-overs for cartoons and then move on to programs for young adults as they get older. A good example is Nick Cannon. He began his first appearance in All-That, later starring in MIB II, then Drumline, and now on his television program, Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out, in which comedians challenge each other by telling inappropriate jokes. This comment was originally for Thugaboo, but I wanted to show examples of how celebrities that children watched on TV not long ago can become those who get involved with programs not suitable for children. It is very sad that this happens, but all celebrities change and grow. It is exactly the opposite of the new Wayan's Brothers comic. It is bad enough that we are dealing with all the bad people of the ghettos, allowing the younger generation to watch this program, convert children only with possibilities to those who do not have the chance to live well. Just my feelings about this cartoon and my beliefs about what will happen to our children if they watch it.
