I can't believe someone actually paid for this movie. Stupid, unrealistic and stereotyped. Since the takeoff of the 747 massif the pilot pulled back the levers to increase speed. then you have 5 people armed with semi-automatic weapons that shoot without even a bullet that breaks through the walls of the pressurized cabin at 38,000 feet. Then, once down in the belly of the plane, a stray bullet hits a line of FUEL and we see the fuel coming out of the side of the plane. The acting was just horrible and forced. There didn't seem to be any direction. I've seen some pretty horrible B movies in my life but with the names of this movie I was extremely disappointed.
