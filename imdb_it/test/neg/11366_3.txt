There is not much more to say than a lot of Sholin monks and alleged Sholin monks who run into the ego for kung-fu and the caricature of the Japanese who plots to conquer China. All this wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the completely false Japanese sword fighting. If you watched a Samurai movie or two you can say that the "Japanese" fights in the film are simply the same "Kung-fu" stunts (circus acrobats) that do the same things except with a Japanese sword. However, there are a couple of fun moments like when a Japanese Ninja woman tears her clothes in mid-air to disarm a monk and capture him with a fishing net. On the level of stories, there seems to be a bit of schizophrenia regarding the fact that the Japanese should be shown as absolutely contemptible or if there might be exceptions. The "Japanese" protagonist is shown as widely honorable, but not beyond unjustified cruelty, as when he kills a sedated monk so that he can have his duel. Quite disappointing with a very silly ending. Nor does it evoke the appearance of the idea of ​​an epic battle for a moment.
