This short review does not contain spoilers because the film fails. It is wooden and pedantic. He has no saving grace. If someone invites you to his house to watch "Mr. Imperium", don't go. Even the film's title is terrible and portends what's inside. The whole plot is so ugly that it could push Mother Teresa to despair !!! It was not a stroke that led to poor Ezio's first end, it was having to act in this clunker that did it. He must have haunted the rest of his days. Perhaps he was an enemy alien and wanted revenge on the Americans for his confinement. He found a perfect vehicle for his wrath in this parody.
