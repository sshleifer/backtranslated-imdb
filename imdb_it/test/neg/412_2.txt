I went to the movie expecting a bit of action mixed with a strong plot. I understand that the changes between written works and films must be made ... for many reasons. <br /> <br /> The change in the relationship between scientists (they were father-daughter in the book) The director of CERN was eliminated thus eliminating the change of scene between the Carmelengo and the Director of the Carmelengo and the head of the Swiss Guard in the Pope's office. <br /> <br /> Ron Howard made sure to have his father inserted as a Cardinal with a frowning accent but he missed all the symbolism. Both Lagdon and the Carmelengo climbed into the sky in the helicopter with the character of Hanks landing in the river and the priest landing on the chapel in what was described as a Christ-like image. <br /> <br /> At some point this film needs to be redone by a director who is up to the job
