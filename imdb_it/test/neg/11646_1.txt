Stay away from this movie! It's terrible in every way. Bad acting, a thin and recycled plot and the worst ending in the history of cinema. I rarely manage to watch a film that makes my adrenaline angry, in fact the only other film that immediately comes to mind is another film "people in a aircraft in trouble" (Airspeed). Please, don't look at this as it is completely and totally pathetic from beginning to end. Helge Iversen
