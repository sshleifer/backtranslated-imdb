I usually love these movies. Give me a good old B movie every day, but this was just awful. Acting (?) It was terrible almost to the point of completely turning the film off. I thought I saw the worst of all time, but this is right there with Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! In all honesty - it was the acting that made this film for me. <br /> <br /> I found the clumsy actor and the male / female protagonist was extremely boring. This film has absolutely nothing to say. I could ask a ridiculous question here, but why the nudity and the sex scene? Did the producers think that no one would watch if they left them out? I think they were probably right! Oh where is Price and The Tingler when you need it?
