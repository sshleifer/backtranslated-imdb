I can't believe there are people out there who voted 10 for this junk! Have any of you had access to a computer in the asylum where it was undoubtedly held, or is there a special colony in which above all crassissime people are imprisoned in secret of which I know nothing? <br /> <br /> If I were to say what I really thought about this movie, none of this would have been published. <br /> <br /> To start with his "star" he is an idiot without talent who acts like a bad imitator of Jim Carrey who has vacuumed enough angel raises his nose to re-emerge in the Sahara desert. His name will be an absolute guarantee that I will not watch a future film with him, even if he plays a rock hidden by a crowd. <br /> <br /> Regarding the "plot". Another crime that we can confess to the Nazis is that they were so terrible that they could be considered a fair game as "bad guys" in tripe like this; only criminals and murderers would have the public on their side in the blink of an eye. <br /> <br /> To the people who made this film - Give up making movies and if not then just advertise, where your efforts will be At least have the merit of being ephemeral in duration. <br /> <br /> Finally, a criticism of IMDB - Why can't you vote "Zero" for a movie? Or maybe not. To express my contempt for this tripe I should therefore vote for double zero, or something like that.
