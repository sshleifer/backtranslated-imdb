Like most other people, I saw this movie on "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Although it has received some well-deserved lace, it is one of the best films to show on that show. <br /> <br /> The premise is even better than your average Hollywood blockbuster these days; poses some interesting moral dilemmas. Although the score is sometimes intrusive, it also provides some delicious moments when Richard is walking along the river. Watching the movie, you can see where a lot of plot developments look very good on paper. Richard's discomfort in modern society is an interesting problem to meditate on, and the ending would probably have been a pretty '70s style mess if previous affairs hadn't been so stupid. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is visibly cheap, making the flaws even more obvious. The "clone farm" is obviously a university campus, and a beer can serve as the main point of the plot. Lena and Richard have zero chemistry - we should believe that this is a meeting of like minds, but there doesn't seem to be a brain cell between them. Even the schtick of the "irritable old couple" gets really old, very fast. There are also some errors that can be attributed to bad management choices, such as the decision to hold a climate conversation out of the reach of any audio equipment. <br /> <br /> In all, a noble effort, but it is still better seen on MST3K.
