Maybe I missed something, but I found GOYA GHOSTS to be a boring melodrama in costume. As for the story he was trying to tell, I discovered that a mixture of mixtures has spread in all directions. And perhaps it should have been done by a Spanish director with the appropriate languages ​​subtitled rather than with unconvinced English. I cannot judge the historical truth of the story, but it seemed to me to go hand in hand with the plot of a similar "tragic destiny of the artist's model" as GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING. The film was a commentary on the religious injustices of the Inquisition, the false pity, the torture of then and now, or what ???? I've never been able to figure it out. Natalie Portman's various characters also seemed ridiculously stereotyped. And at the end the film was crowned with the concluding melodrama of the head and body of a disorderly Bardem hanging on the edge of the carriage headed for sunset ?? with Ines and Goya following behind ?????? Can not Milos Forman do better than that?
