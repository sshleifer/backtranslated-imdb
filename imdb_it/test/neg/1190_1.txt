In the first 25 minutes it became clear that the writers really wanted to make a feature film and probably enjoyed the whole process, but then they seemed to forget that a decent storyline was needed! If the best they could do was have 3 of the most boring characters enter the real world and have "all kinds of funny capers" then they should have left them alone! I didn't laugh once, and the whole "Adventures of Baron Munchausen / Time Bandits" thing going on in the middle was very, very poor! Evaluated, artificial and very loose. It just seemed like a stop to whatever they thought "might" only work to drag it into a function. <br /> <br /> Filled with holes, for example: the characters of Royston Vasey needed the writers to continue writing To save them, Jeff managed to write himself in the subplot / time that fills William and Mary and the was. If he could do it, why didn't they keep writing Royston - duh ?? And the hearing of Herr Lipp? What was that for? I mean what was the point? Did it and we didn't hear anything else about it? <br /> <br /> My main point is that, while I loved the series, this was a poorly conceived, seemingly rushed project. In this way, the plot was so scarce that if we hadn't already known the characters (and as a fan I had a certain loyalty to keep watching), and we relied exclusively on the story itself, this would have fallen flat on his face! At best it would go straight to the video, and in the worst case it would never have been realized in the first place! Or maybe it should be the other way around? Really terrible ....
