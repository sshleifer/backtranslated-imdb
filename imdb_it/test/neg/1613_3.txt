This film takes the plot behind the sci-fi movie "Doppelganger" (an astronaut of our Earth that crashes on a "counter-Earth" on the opposite side of the Sun, and the totalitarian vibrations of the Cold War on that world) and tries to turn in a pilot for a TV series. However, the whole thing sank without a trace, and TV is probably better for it. <br /> <br /> Everyone here is perfectly adequate in a "TV made" way. Cameron Mitchell turns into his usual solid performance. Thus does Glenn Corbett (who appears to be a sort of John Saxon of the poor man) who plays the robust individualist whose very existence represents a threat to the founding of the "World Order" on the counter-face. <br /> <br /> But the low budget and low energy and incoherent script and lack of real imagination in set sets and filmmaking keep this science fiction adventure firmly tied to the launching platform. <br /> <br /> I will give an example: in the original model for this pilot ("Doppleganger"), the astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm and make their ship collapse in a truly terrifying sequence ( it was obvious that their ship would never fly again). Then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle amid howling rains and winds, only to be slapped and overwhelmed by faceless men screaming through the speakers. <br /> <br /> In "Stranded in Space", the astronauts are sitting in their seats when the bells ring, things start to shake, and the camera gets mixed up in a blackout (and as one friend pointed out, it was quite obvious that the actors were simply shaking on their seats, the director was not even shaking the camera or the device). I saw episodes of "The Twilight Zone" and "The Outer Limits" which took more effort to establish the atmosphere and setting of this mediocrity made for TV. <br /> <br /> And that, in essence, is what's wrong with "Stranded In Space". No budget, no time, no imagination ... just doing symbolic gestures and hoping that the imagination and enthusiasm of science fiction boys will fill the rest. Sorry, guys, it didn't work. <br /> <br /> I'm sure everyone here has just finished their work on this and they left, and they never thought about it, except as a list on their C.V. And this is what you, the viewer will do. You will remember, if pressed, that you once watched a TV movie called "Stranded In Space", but it didn't leave a lasting impression, and you can't remember too much about it.
