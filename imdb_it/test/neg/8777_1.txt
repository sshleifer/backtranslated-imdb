I guess it wasn't the filmmaker's fault. The film suffered from the unimaginable decision to tell Clayton Moore (who played the role in the 1950s and it was the Lone Ranger that we adults grew up with) that he could not wear the mask in public. Now, mind you, the poor guy wasn't making all that money to do it, and it wasn't like he would take anything from this movie, but the whole thing seemed ... free. <br /> <The other thing the film suffered from (apart from a leading man whose voice was so terrible as to overdub) was the fact that Westerners weren't so fashionable in 1981. John Wayne was dead and we had just been subjected to a long journey of ten-year liberal conscience about how the West was built on the genocide of Native Americans. (That and Blazing Saddles sent the whole genre!) The bonfire scene, it was enough!) Hollywood avoided Westerners, because science fiction was COOLING. <br /> <br /> The only scene that emphasized him was when, after saving the drunk president Grant (and seriously, I would let Grant stay with the bad guys. The country would have been better!) Grant asks Tonto which it should be his reward "Honor your treaties with my people". Yes, right, how that would have happened!
