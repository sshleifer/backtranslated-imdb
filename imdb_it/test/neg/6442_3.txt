I spent three months living in the East End of London in the second half of 1987, when the show had been broadcast for almost two years. It was considered a joke going on there. <br /> <br /> Why? Because he had an all-white cast. Every member of the cast and extra in the first two years was white. <br /> <br /> The road I lived in was long, with over 800 houses, and as far as I know I was one of only three or four white faces living on that street. We were at the corner of the Indian and Turkish "neighborhoods", and even if you excluded those two races, Asians and Afro-Caribbean people far exceeded the whites among the twenty-one. Also, of course, of the very few whites * living * in the area, the vast majority were Scottish like me - a "Cockney" accent was never heard. <br /> <br /> That was not a racist rant, just a simple statement of fact. The BBC could not be bothered to cross London to do its own research before writing this soap, or they only had available white actors and decided to bluff. <br /> <br /> In both cases, as I say, in the East End of the time, we considered it a comedy show. :-)
