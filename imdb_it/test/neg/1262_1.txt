Have you ever wondered what the worst movie ever made? Stop asking. I'm telling you, Michael is! <br /> <br /> It is not "moving", "funny" or "Travolta at its best". It sucks. If I had children, I'd show them Deep Throat before Michael! <br /> <br /> A sold-out John Travolta, a exhausted and bald William Hurt, and a man about to die at any time now Jean Stapleton highlight this movie asshole. <br /> <br /> But wait ... you'll hear Andie McDowell sing! Yes. Hollywood really dreams of this!
