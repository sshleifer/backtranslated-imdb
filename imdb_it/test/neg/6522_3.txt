This script was slightly original when it was written in 1935, but the poor performance and the level of inconsistent quality make it impossible to recommend. Some of the cartoons are absolutely terrible and the dialogue is never natural. Some of the twists and turns were creative, but I was very surprised to see it so appreciated here at the IMDB. Some scenes are worth it, it's like a movie that if you can't completely entertain. If you like this type of editing, run, don't walk and you get "Tales of Manhattan" (1942) a wonderful film that follows the life and times of a coat.
