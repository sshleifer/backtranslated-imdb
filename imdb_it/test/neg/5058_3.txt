This is not a terrible movie, just bland. The plot is deeply imperfect and implausible. Try to be a number of genres and fail at each. It fails as a comedy, as a suspense thriller and as a horror movie. It happens almost like science fiction. The direction is not inspired and Katie Holmes, a pretty cherub face that she is, should be the model to dress up as a teenager, not to act. The only thing that prevents this movie from being a 1 in 10 is Helen Mirren. His performance is fabulously ominous and it is worth (almost) worth to suffer for the rest. His ability to transmute from imperious to feigned compassion to manipulate and subtly control his prey shows a masterly range. In addition to Marissa Coughlin's delightful interpretation of Exorcist, Mirren is the only reason to watch this film. A solid 3.0.
