I'm a chess player and I wanted to love this movie. The problem is that the content could have been included in a 30-minute documentary. <br /> <br /> There were many shots of corridors being stepped on and Kasparov looking into the hall where he won the World Championship. There were other Kasparov shots that were shot around the 1997 game site and he was told where he sat and where Deep Blue was. This also seemed to fill me up. <br /> <br /> Also, I didn't find it interesting to see in detail where Deep Blue was and to see an IBM techie attempt, unsuccessfully, to "open it". What would we have seen of interest anyway - a little grandmaster? <br /> <br /> Also, the recent game against Karpov. I no longer follow professional chess enough to know when and where it was. Would it have been nice to be told: it was a "one for the money"? Was it part of the world championship cycle? What was the final score? The core of the film was the game of the second. Could / IBM allow Kasparov to see "inside" the car? That's where the attention should have been.
