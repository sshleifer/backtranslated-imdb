Pete's Meteor. I saw this indicated as "authentic" and a "gem". I took this movie Saturday afternoon. I hoped not. <br /> <br /> Apparently this was noticed as Mike Myers' first dramatic role. Unfortunately it had to be this movie. The first thing you'll notice that Pete's Meteor suffers is a complete lack of plot. Or rather, a bunch of little subplots that aren't really connected and aren't going anywhere. The young orphan Mickey lives with his younger brother and his sister with their grandmother. A meteorite lands in their garden and is eventually picked up by a scientist named Hugh. Despite the film's title, Mickey is the one who claims the meteor, and the "plot" actually has little to do with meteor in any shape or form. From here on out, many other characters and subplots are introduced. But as I said before, they really don't go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Things range from the cute family movie to the rather fast dark thriller, when Pete (Mike Myers) is presented and starts playing a role. Micky blames him for the death of his parents, even though we are never told what happened or why. Hugh has romanticism problems because his girlfriend can't get over his cosmic charm. And Pete's drug-related past begins to reach him and temporarily draws his girlfriend and the rest of the cast into the mix when the shady characters start trying to kill him. This would seem to be the main plot, until you realize that it doesn't even have a role until the middle of the movie, making everything else seem useless. The problems with Hugh's girlfriend, Mickey's bad behavior, the meteor ... what does EARTH have to do with this? Not much. <br /> <br /> So the "plot" is disjoint and half is useless. But a good cast of characters can save him, right? Keyword: good Most characters are terribly unlikely people, most of whom you'd like to see die horribly. At least, I know I would. Despite the title, Mickey seems to be the main character, which is a really bad move once you see him in action. He is one of the worst children I've seen in a movie, with an extremely negative attitude problem. "Borrows" a car, harassing and talking to garbage to Hugh (an adult) for taking the meteor, actually trying to burn the man's house when he can't reach it, and even tries to stab Pete with a knife. You'd think a guy like him is on his way to prison. Unfortunately, one of the worst things about this movie is that Mickey never gets what's happening to him. I'm not sure which point you should sympathize with his character, because he's always a nasty brat. He is the ringleader of his brother and sister, so, predictably, they end up taking and going back and just following what he does. Surprisingly, they were turned away so far that they couldn't even remember their names. They might not even be there. <br /> <br /> Their grandmother is practically a border alcoholic. He tends to be just as bad with Hugh as Mickey, and he likes to push people out of his house and give them evil looks when he's not drinking liquor bottles and drinking himself silly. Rather ridiculous when one takes into account the fact that she should take care of three children. Her problems with alcohol are never really addressed, even if she collapses from time to time in the film. <br /> <br /> Hugh is one of the few cute characters in the movie, but it's only because he is the punching bag for most characters and takes their mess without returning it. Children treat him badly, but he always comes back and tries to teach him and do nice things with them. He has a girlfriend of taxi drivers who seems to take every aspect of his life as a scientist, trying to leave him in the movie several times when he goes into his cosmic jargon or does something to show that he is not exactly on the same wavelength as the rest of the characters (thankfully). <br /> <br /> Then there's Mike Myers as Pete. Pete, despite having the sole purpose and plot usual in the film, is extremely underutilized and plays no role whatsoever until the second half. It is unfortunate that Myers was stuck in that position for a dramatic role. Even when Pete gets time on the screen, half of that is just Myers running through dark alleys and hiding in the little corners. And even though it was the only real strength of this film, when its plot passes on the film, it's a strange, unsatisfactory conclusion, which has all the characters laughing on a good note with a quick and strange explanation behind the title of the movie, making you wonder if they were just acting in the movie you were watching. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth seeing in Pete's meteor is the role of Mike Myers as Pete, and this if you can go through this messy mess long enough without attacking another human being at because of the extremely unlikely characters and the non-existent plot. No sir, I didn't like this at all.
