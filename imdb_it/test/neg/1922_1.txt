*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** HERE ON EARTH / (2000) 1/2 * (out of four) <br /> <br /> "Here on Earth" by Mark Piznarski holds the movie record containing the most recycled material in 96 minutes. Literally every plot, cliché and familiar plot element is somewhere in here; there is simply nothing unique, original or fresh about it. God, what a distressing scene to sit; I'd like to have seen the film during its theatrical release last year, so it could have earned me the worst list of the year. This is the kind of film in which the story immediately becomes obvious, and goes down from the opening credits and, worst of all, takes itself seriously. "Here on Earth" is clearly one of the most horrible and painful films that have come down in pike for some time. <br /> <br /> "Here on Earth" is a teen thriller, so it must contain some of the very popular young Hollywood movies that are attractive and inexperienced enough to take a role in such a bad movie. Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett adapt to this description and take on the main roles. Klein plays Kelley, an arrogant and insolent student with a rich father (cliché number one). He has to graduate as a monedictorian and attend the Ivy league college following in the footsteps of his father (Stuart Wilson). This creates the cliché "I don't want your life", in which the father tries to control his son's life, while the son resists the rebellion. He throws Kelley's dead mother who committed suicide a while ago. When his father brings another woman home, he brutally questions his intentions (the cliché "no one can replace his mother" counts as number two). Josh Hartnett plays Jasper, a character from the opposite side of the company to Kelley. His family owns a local restaurant. Enter his long-standing love interest, Samantha Cavanaugh (Leelee Sobieski), a restaurant waitress who covers for her sister (who has no purpose rather than checking the next scene) when Jasper and Kelley act like childish idiots running their cars and (oh no) crashes into the diner, making it explode in flames. (The conflicts between the rich and the poor are counted as clichés number three.) <br /> <br /> The chase in crazy drive sets both Kelley and Jasper for an artificial and plausible conflict. They get themselves into trouble with the law, but since this film feels the need to exist, the local judge orders them an alternative to serving time: they have to work together to help rebuild the dinner. <br /> <br /> The two guys work hard during the summer growing strong and tanning. Samantha's eye catches Kelley and the romantic sparks fly. Jasper is jealous, but he wants what is best for his true love (cliché number four). His parents (Annette O'Toole and Bruce Greenwood) disapprove of his little romantic triangle (cliché number five), but he goes on with Jasper twice without thinking twice. His father is also the local sheriff, what a surprise (we count that number six melodramatic cliché). <br /> <br /> The romantic feelings invented between Kelley and Samantha count as clichés number seven. But Samantha's relationship with Jasper is never defined, so how can there be a romantic tension? If the film is about to involve Samantha's choice between the two youngsters, then we need to see both characters from both sides. The film describes Jasper as a distraction for his "true love", Kelley. It is clear that Jasper really loves her, but it is also clear that she will not love him again. This completely tears the romantic tension at the beginning of the story. Leelee Sobieski doesn't hurt here; however, his charm and his kind performances do not fit a two-stroke character like Samantha. John Hartnett is also right for the role of Jasper, but the film gives him nothing to do but fight with Kelley. Chris Klein has to make a name for himself here; passes most of the film shirtless, sweaty and overworked. Unfortunately he does not show his acting skills, perhaps because he has very little. The supporting cast is much more talented. Bruce Greenwood provides the best performance of the film, but he doesn't have enough time to save just a few brief moments. I also liked the performance by Stuart Wilson, who perfectly adapted to the role of rich and controlling father of high social status. <br /> <br /> So we take care of Samantha's knee problem exactly one hour and ten minutes into the movie (another spoiler forward). What it is, she has a serious incurable illness (yet another gimmick in the picture, about the number eight). His terminal illness brings the two young men into competition as friends, well, at least I think that's what the film intends to show, that the loss of one loved by two nemesis can bring them both together (cliché number nine). <Br /> <br /> Klein repeats his valedictorian speech to show that his character is more than a superficial stereotype, but we have seen it so many times before I preferred a rich character rather than a deeply sentimental one who hides the feelings royal (cliché number, um, was ten)? The conflicts between Kelley and Jasper are desperate and senseless; a comment from "your mother" triggers a fist while they rebuild the establishment. There is a reconstructed from "Armageddon", while Samantha and Kelley expand into an open field, horny as hell, while slowly moving her fingers around her body, naming the areas after the cities of the United States (why not call that number eleven). The film uses alcohol as a means to increase romantic tension: a drunken Kelley makes a fool of himself after he clashes with Samantha's date, Jasper, but the next day only acts to dance (cliché number, oh no, I'm losing the bill).
