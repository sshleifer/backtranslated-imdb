I rented Dark Harvest (the first) because it looked like a kind of thrilling ride on the monster. Even the scarecrows make me crazy. The film had an effective sequence of titles, but what followed was rather lame (flat lighting, bad lighting, acting, editing, direction ...). Recently, I noticed that DH 2: The Maize had a rather large advertising campaign. I thought maybe the first one had had a marginal success, so they raised the stakes on this a bit, probably offering a bit of fear and a bigger budget from the assassin scarecrows. Well, there are no scarecrows in the video ... Not a problem. The problems begin in DH 2 with a title sequence that seems an unfinished concept, with strange shapes and bars that erase titles and so on. As for the real photography ... every time the sun shines in one shot, you will have all these whites turned off, confirming that you are looking at a very low budget mini-DV project that some Midwesterners have filmed at Uncle. farm. Acting didn't work at all. The economic fraud of the twin Shining girls was below the standards of film students. The editing was extremely amateur and lazy. The sound was loud and choppy. (for example, every time the editor cut a new shot, you would have here the prospect of changing the sound with it). It's like someone picking up their friends and relatives (actors), carrying a video camera in a wheat field for three days, putting a light on it for nighttime sequences (it's no joke - that's what they actually did), burnt through some tape, paste the movie into their computer, cut out a (very) rough version, throw some music, ignore any work or mix of imaginative sounds, burn it directly to DVD and throw it on the video store shelf. Any horror fan should be insulted by this type of video-directed work that lacks ANY skill or style. Just because a person owns a video camera and is able to get a bit of a tape image, doesn't mean it needs to be released to the public. If I could score lower than ONE, I'd do it.
