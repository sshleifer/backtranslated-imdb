Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men I've ever seen, and has a big influence on my life. <br /> <br /> This film is floppy and horrible, and its memory has no credit. The script is cluttered and retains too many lines intact from the book (the jokes on the leg here are incomprehensible). The actors' performances are uniformly ineffective, a great wasted cast, and the protagonist, Sean Hughes, delivers Milligan's belligerent hostility in a plaintive lament, which completely misses the point. <br /> <br /> The gentle rhythm is a killer as well. The farce should accelerate towards the end. The Goon Shows has done it often, the novel "Puckoon" has certainly worked, but this film, if nothing else, slows down just when you want the various elements to come apart together in a final climax. <br /> <br /> Milligan told an audio recording summary of "Puckoon" in 1980, with TP McKenna, Dermot Kelly, Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. Now, it's fun. Ten minutes is more fun than this whole movie. I think the LP was transferred to CD, but I don't know if it's still in print. <br /> <br /> There is a film by "Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Fall" with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe. This is also a huge mess, but it's more fun than this. <br /> <br /> It is possible that the spirit of Milligan is too turbulent for the screen. The other reviewers here are devoting themselves to courtesy and wishful thinking. This film fights virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint.
