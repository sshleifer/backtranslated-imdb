I saw this movie shortly after seeing Moonlight and Valentino with Elizabeth Perkins, Gwyneth Platrow, Whoopi Goldberg and Kathleen Turner. There are many similarities between the two films. Both have great casts and good acting. Both have reserve characters of very different sisters, an offensive stepmother, a friend / confidant, an emotionally unavailable father, a dead mother and a surprise lover. Both films have life-changing realizations as protagonists and both films suffer from a sort of sentimentalism that "conquers all". Both add a bit of titillation to Cameron Diaz in black underwear and a partial back shot of Gwyneth Paltrow naked. <br /> <br /> Both films seem to be invented, as if the authors of the works on which the films are based are doing market research and said: "Ok, there is a market for stories about relations between women, so will I write about two sisters with an offensive stepmother ?? " In other words, instead of the drama that emerges from the truth of the relationship, the relationship is invented to adapt to the dramatic situation. It seems forced, the characters don't seem real, the relationships are incredible. <br /> <br /> Resolving the tensions between the characters is simplistic with simple excuses that wipe out years of acrimony, leaving everyone to feel warm and blurred from then on. It is not real. Romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> The characters of In her shoes are a little more exaggerated than Moonlight and Valentino, in particular of the stepmother. Sydelle Feller is so evil that it's hard to believe that her father can be with her, or even marry her in the first place. <br /> <br /> If you liked Moonlight & Valentino, you will probably like her shoes well. Pleasant performances in both, in fact, the actors bring depth to their parts that go far beyond the artificial sentimentalism of the screenplays.
