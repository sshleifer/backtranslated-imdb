I'll start by blowing up the movie first. Remove Abbott and Costello from the cast and you have a brightly colored film, stiff cardboard from the casting department, sound badly nicknamed (especially during singing!) And annoying dialogues (for example, listen to the line "Mr. Dinklepuss" infinitum). Obviously some hacks thought they could cash the Disney CLASSIC presentation "Mickey and the Beanstalk", but perhaps the public was more naive (unlikely) or stuck in a dual function (more likely). Even children should feel insulted by having this movie shown to them. A total waste of celluloid. Now, about the acting of Abbott and Costello. Bud Abbott has always played the straight man and, by all accounts, was the nicest person on the set. On the radio, his character was usually the quick fast talker, and he was especially funny when his speed forced him to flop his lines and mitigate errors. In the movies, he still plays the straight man, but he is more of a scammer. Not that he's bad, but that character was played perfectly by Groucho Marx. The real parody of the movie duo is Lou Costello. Again, it was fun on the radio. He played a character that was a little slower than Abbott, but not too slow! He was also casual with jokes and made me laugh when he turned to Abbott's mistakes. At the movies, I don't know if it was his decision or not, but in the movies his character becomes a lousy impersonation of Stan Laurel, which in turn was done even more badly by Jerry Lewis. Why change? he was funny on the radio when he was a smarta--, but here he becomes a child character that seems to be attacking cameras in every shot. this characterization is shown in every movie they make, and only brings a stain to the reputation they have had on the radio. What remains of their film career is a poor (very, VERY poor) copy of Laurel and Hardy. The movies would have been a lot more fun if they played their radio characters instead of rebuilding the cast of titles.
