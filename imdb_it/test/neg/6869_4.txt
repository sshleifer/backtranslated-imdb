Visitors are a difficult film to see. He is so slow and leaden in his rhythm that I was sometimes drifting during the film. It was about 11 in the morning on a warm and sunny day, I might add, not at midnight on a cold winter evening, so you get an idea of ​​how slow this movie is. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that it is not long. At 100 minutes it's only ten minutes longer than the average for video, and it's only fifteen minutes longer than the superior Darkwolf that I had happily observed the day before. It only transcends a lot of money, enough to make you lose interest. <br /> <br /> When you're not wrong about the development of S-L-O-O-W for the atmosphere, visitors are pretty good at the action to make it almost excusable how slowly things happen. While flashbacks are both cheap and annoying as a way to round up Radha Mitchell's boats, ghosts / aliens / whatever is actually quite terrifying and effective, especially when the suicidal mother shows up and starts moaning in the night. Full marks for not making makeup all over the store. The single boat is a disturbing place and, at times, the film exploits all the power of the location and the deserted sea to scare you to death. <br /> <br /> However, I find it difficult to recommend visitors. I came out not only feeling like I had just seen a 4-hour movie, not a 100-minute one, but I also felt that I had been cheated in some way, while offering many explanations about ghosts (mind games? Real ghosts? Space aliens? ) Visitors do not choose one for the final. Anything that looks at Radha Mitchell talks to her cat and Dominic Purcell hatches without reason for obvious reasons about a horrible unexplained event in the past, for nothing? Say what you like about Shyamalan, but at least it tells you what happened, no matter how crazy / stupid you may think it. If you don't watch many of these films, your new perspective will probably improve things a little, but I found this slow, boring and highly derivative. If you want to freak out, there are better places to do it, if you want a smart thriller there are many smarter ones.
