Good attempt to address the unconventional theme of the May-December novels. However, the treatment is totally unrealistic. Of course, sixty-year-old men can and do fall for younger women, but usually they are adult women with whom they share common interests, values ​​and points of view ... not neurotic, immature, underage girls. Obviously there are exceptions and they come close to being called pedophiles! Sorry RGV, but it is not credible that a sane and accomplished sexagenarian can throw away a comfortable family life and become a joke to his peers ... all for an eighteen year old who has no practical thought in his head and who behaves like an unstable fugitive from a mental institution. You don't have to have a doctorate in psychology to see that Amitabh's character is seduced by sex, and that the young woman has unresolved abandonment and father problems. <br /> <br /> Concerning the recurring scene of Vijay perched on the edge of a cliff, contemplating suicide, he is as close as he gets to have something in common with Jiah, behaving like a little boy in love. <br /> <br /> A positive note: the actors did a good job and good cinematography.
