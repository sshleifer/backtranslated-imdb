Italian filmmakers love tearing up American films. All our films are as often as possible. <br /> <br /> I am not saying this as an insult against Italy as a whole, but I would like to further observe that the Italian film industry behaves in a very harmful way, allowing disguises like this to go overseas to be seen by the world at large. That's all I'm saying. <br /> <br /> And no more serious damage to which the Italians submit is not to apply severe punishment to those who have made the world look "Red Shark in the ocean" - which is, of course, a hoax of the "jaws" far superior (as if you didn't know). <br /> <br /> Let's take a dip in the plot (Get it? Haw-haw ...): this huge monstrous swimming creature that looks like a cross between an octopus, a shark and Steven Tyler attacking many innocent Americans ( that is: Italians) off the coast of Florida (that is Italy) and the intrepid sails of Peter (Sopkiw) who blasts beer out with his anorexic girlfriend, who has sex with beer and other people who drink beer, whose main purposes are to be eaten by the creature, killed by mysterious forces that want the creature left alone or simply stand up and be otherwise useless (and beer) .. or be the doctor in this film that repeatedly defibrils the dying patients (20, maybe 30 times in a row) without waiting for his paddles to recharge (must be a hell of a good battery there, doc). <br /> <br /> Then there's the monster ... brother, if you thought the "Jaws" shark was fake, look here and change your mind IMMEDIATELY. /> <br /> This is a film that was directed as an afterthought (from a Bava!), edited with an onion helicopter, produced by walking walkers (beer-beer) and written by (PRESUMABLY beer-swilling) people who it should never, ever, ever be left near a typewriter, a movie studio or the big cities of the world. If this is how the people who made this film think that real people are acting in such a situation, they obviously made too much of those zombie movies. Or drank too much beer. <br /> <br /> Do I need to say that this film is bad? It is: as bad as green ricotta; bad like a Hawaiian shirt at a formal wedding; bad as the "Bad Theater" scenes that Dan Aykroyd hosted on "Saturday Night Live"; bad as Calista Flockhart Weight Gain Tablets - got it? Well. <br /> <br /> Mike and the SOL band slap this drunken beer beauty repeatedly and reveal this horror movie for what it is: horrible. However, with a certain European charm: it is fascinating, if looked at by a European - preferably a beer one. <br /> <br /> There are no stars for the dead, water-impregnated fish known as "Red Shark in the Ocean"; six stars for the MST3K version. ... and now, someone for a beer? <br /> <br />
