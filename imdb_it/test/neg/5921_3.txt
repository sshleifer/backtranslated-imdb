I will write only more because it is required. However, the summary I put on top is too verbose for what this film was. You know pretty much who's in it from the beginning. Despite his attempts to weave twists - making sure that the "talent" tries hard to get looks of shock and dismay when a twist happens - you never really need to ask me "whodunit" in this "mystery". <br /> <br /> The more I write, the more I feel bad that I have to write so much to get a comment, but the rules are rules. I feel really bad about saying it, but this is the lowest I've ever considered a movie ... I think. I wonder what I'm saving votes of 1 and 2 for. However, I thought this film deserved a 3, because I believe there was talent in the film. Johanna Watts (or is Watson) did a good job. He was crying and upset in one part and I thought he conveyed that emotion well. Even the man who played the character who was "the drummer" did well, for his short part. <br /> <br /> Many actors have done an "ok" job. But the main actor, David-forget his last name (terrible with the names) - was pretty bad. I think he must have thought of doing dramatic performances for "The youth and the restless" or "The days of our lives". If you try, you can simply imagine it in a white coat, play a doctor with more personality in "General Hospital". It doesn't help that the film is even shot as a soap by day. Although, I'm pretty sure I can shoot the same movie with a video camera; although without the obvious and wise sound editing. <br /> <br /> The first time I ever thought that the money to rent this movie was wasted. However, I wouldn't look at it again, unless they paid me a large sum of money.
