Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) takes a group of people up a mountain to help find her missing daughter (Erica Durance). What they don't know is that she was killed by a sasquatch (Taras Kostyuk) and is still out there ... waiting for them. <br /> <br /> It was a late night when I inserted it into my DVD player. I would seriously like to go back in time and stop. Most people will tell you that movies like "House of the Dead" or "S.I.C.K: Serial Insain Clown Killers" will be the movies you never would have seen. Mistaken. This will be. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of crap, but this is the only crap that haunted me. How I wish I'd never seen it! Actually acting is not so bad. I'm just writing and directing, rhythm and everything! I'm actually a fan of Sasquatch movies. But not this. <br /> <br /> Please, listen to my warning. Don't watch this!
