Once I felt that the largest and oldest preserved Germanic heroic poem was turned into a movie, it almost became my obsession to see it. The first glimpses of his appearance that I captured never disappointed me. A futuristic interpretation With Lambert our favorite mountain dweller and Mitra, the tomb robber, in aggressive protagonist roles, although some doubts came to life (an important female character in Beowulf?) ... Two hours ago I saw the film . After reading the director's name, my world collapsed. As I said, from that moment on there were not many surprises. First of all, the film has NOTHING to do with the original Beowulf if we ignore a couple of violently and unnecessarily stolen names. If they hadn't stolen the names and declared that it was a new story, it could have passed as a class F action stupidity with beautiful costumes and set design. In this way it is simply a crime! An attack on a legend and its ideology, as well as common sense. Ok, let me be positive for a second ... apart from the general electrogotic atmosphere that is beautiful, it also has good music. This was both for the positive part and for this comment.
