I'm not from America, I usually watch this show on the AXN channel, I don't know why this respected channel broadcasts such a prime-time sucking program. Creating the Hollywood Money Bank Jerry Bruckheimer, this time is spending a lot of money on the small screen. In each episode a group of people with two team members travels from one country to another for a large sum of money; where the photographic crews take their trips. I don't know who the hell gave this stupid idea for the show. He has nothing to look at, in all the episodes we see people running around like beggars, sometimes shouting, crying, beeping, it works like a jerky machine..and it's harmful to both eyes and ears. The most disgusting part of the race is that viewers finally know that each of the team members cannot enjoy their race / trip experience. Although, to add up the ratings, the producers had the idea of ​​including Gays on a show, sucking up the American reality show. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to look at, better switch to other channels. <Br /> <br /> The Amazing Race = The Disgusting Show.
