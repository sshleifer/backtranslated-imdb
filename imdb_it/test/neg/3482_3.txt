I'm amazed at the important comments here for this OK surfing movie. It really comes from the "California Dreamin" school of beach games with beach antics and is not really plausible. The idea that the protagonist child learns to ride a table so well in a concrete wave pool that beats the real surfers at their game in the real ocean is simply silly. In Australia, where most urban kids surf, this film was mocked by the public who took everything with a grain of sea salt. Made in the 80s but with its heart in the 60s, it's fun to watch, looks and sounds good, but it's not a classic at all. Even the actors did not survive this. We are seriously in LIQUID BRIDGE or RIDE THE WILD SURF or BEACH BLANKET BINGO land here. The stars of Oz like Occy and BIG Wednesday the hero Gerry Lopez were drafted to add a nod to the feat of our country boy's waves, but they only made the crowd in the cinema laugh. It is for the 10 years that they do not doubt much. It is not even in the hands of God and even that was foolish.
