The original story had all the ingredients to make a truly compelling film. But he failed miserably in this version, because even Cherie Lunghi was a pale imitation of what she would become - so much so that I suspected her to be an accomplice until the end. Was Sherlock Holmes transformed into a warrior quite unlike any other suggested by Sir Arthur Conn Doyle? In fact it was Dr. Watson who showed what little common sense was happening. The beefy midget of the Andomans seemed unable to get out of a paper bag and what the villain was doing by drinking tea at Baker Street for an epilogue was beyond anything the old Scotland Yard could ever have imagined. Then deliver this TV movie to their Black Museum please.
