"Submerged" is definitely NOT "the worst film ever". It has its flaws, like borrowed movies, crazy scripts and non-existent special effects (these are the worst), but it also has some positive points. Acting is surprisingly good, there are MANY familiar faces that you probably know if you're a b-movie fan like me. <br /> <br /> I was very happy to see Brent Huff play one of the heroes, knowing him mainly for his 80s action movies, and I have to admit, he's not a bad actor at all. Fred Williamson, Maxwell Caulfield and Tim Thomerson have limited screen time, but they are credible in their parts. The "eye-candy" in this Fred Olen Ray film are Yvette Nipar and Nicole Eggert, both very sexy and very bad. Michael Bailey Smith adds some muscle to the background like a Navy SEAL. Unfortunately the only member of the cast who (in my opinion) is completely out of place is Coolio. He does not act at all, he speaks as if he had not even read the script and, being a bit tough at the beginning of the film, he is filmed as a drunk one hour later. It is not a good choice. <br /> <br /> To sum up this film - this is not a bad choice for late-night entertainment. If you can get over the special effects thing (so many guns, so much fire, and not a single wound on anybody), the annoying performance of Coolio and the recycled footage from airport 77, you might like this without too much trouble.
