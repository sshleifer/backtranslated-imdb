UP AT THE VILLA (2000) ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> ATTENTION: YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS <br /> <br /> It is difficult to know what the meaning of UP AT THE VILLA is, a piece of a splendid but superficial era, one of those created with the sole aim of earning an Oscar nomination for the best costume design and art direction (one for cinematography and another for the soundtrack are welcome). She has the same basic idea of ​​thousands of vintage pieces produced every year: an intelligent and good-looking woman who tries to find love in a strange place for her. He has many difficulties but in the end he finds his happiness in the arms of a man who is not the one with whom he has had a result. In this case, our lady is in Florence, some time before the Second World War. She is an English widow engaged to a very rich man (who obviously does not love). One day he meets another man, who does not have a good reputation but falls in love with him. Of course there is her friend who will help her for better or for worse and a third man - who commits suicide here, in the lady's room, creating a risky situation for her. Guess how the story ends ...? <br /> <br /> UP AT THE VILLA is not a bad movie. I've always been very interested in history, but I never got excited. The problem is not the slow pace, but the script. Adapted from a novel, it needs something more spicy, exciting, twists and suspense. Whenever you think the story will get hot, it will cool down again. If you think there is a conspiracy involving the Florence police chief, well, there is, but almost nothing changes in history. Continue to come and go, up to the predictable end. <br /> <br /> As I said, UP AT THE VILLA is not bad. If it's a bit bland, it never gets mushy and too sentimental. Acting is half and half, but certainly convincing. Kristin Scott Thomas made some really bad choices after THE ENGLISH PATIENT (saaaaaappy romantic drama THE HORSE WHISPERER and the boring / irritating RANDOM HEARTS). UP IN THE VILLA is undoubtedly better than those pieces and Kristin is better too, but she can do more. Sean Penn is as good as ever, even if his character is a great guy. Anne Bancroft is a terrifying actress (THE GRADUATE, my God!), And here she doesn't let her character become ridiculous. Now, supporting actors are pretty bad (Jeremy Davies is so annoying!). <br /> <br /> The direction is good, but not daring. It was interesting to know that the director is the same as ANGELS AND INSECTS (also played by Kristin Scott Thomas), another dramatic drama of the period, but more daring than this. What matters here are the images. Florence is wonderful, the costumes are fantastic, the scenery, the music ... <br /> <br /> In the end, UP AT THE VILLA is an average romantic drama, but of course it could have been much better. It's watchable and interesting, but don't expect a suspense movie - it's not! This type of film fails because it wants to have some mystery, something to watch ... However, there is not much to say mainly because of the superficial script. Now, about the Oscar nominations, don't worry, it will probably take them.
