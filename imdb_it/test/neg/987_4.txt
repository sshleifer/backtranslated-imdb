*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS UNDER *** <br /> <br /> What a long and mostly uninteresting movie! Who were these characters? Why don't I care about them? If I watch a movie for two hours, I'd like to get interested in someone or something. <br /> <br /> We know that Salvatore has dreamed of the riches that are found in the new world. In addition, however, we have learned little about most hopes, fears, etc. Of his family, as they embarked on an adventure into the unknown. <br /> <br /> And why was Lucy also in this movie? She said little; we knew little about her or what she was doing (was she forced to serve the men in exchange for permission to board the ship?) or what her plans were when she reached New York. To those who might suggest that it was necessary to emphasize the point that a single woman, however educated, could not enter this country alone, I say this is not justified enough to give her so much time on screen. That point could have been made in five minutes, with Lucy as a momentary character. <br /> <br /> Other questions: Why was the twin brother not on the boat to meet the family? We have heard of his brother, and some closure on that point would have been useful to give the film some cohesion. Furthermore, how long did the journey from Italy to New York take? Given the conditions on the ship, it makes the difference for the spectator if the journey lasted five or 10 or 50 days. (Someone said something about seeing the earth a "week" at some point, but I think it was when they were already traveling.) I needed these kinds of details to better appreciate what they were going through. <br /> <br /> The only scene that I really liked was when the boat, full of passengers, left the pier. <br /> <br /> If you choose to rent this movie, do it with the remote control in your hand; you may want the Fast Forward button at hand. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can suggest that, with the right voice-over that provides useful information on the timing and circumstances for immigrants - especially during slow stretches of endless campaign shots, people walking, etc. .-- this film may have made an interesting public television documentary.
