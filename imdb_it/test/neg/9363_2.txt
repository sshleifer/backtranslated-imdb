<br /> <br /> I understand that people have different expectations in low-budget arthouse films. I also know that John Sayles has a sort of glow on him, that earthly and intellectual anti-Hollywood atmosphere, at Tim Robbins, the Coen brothers and Atom Egoyan, which makes him a treasure with critics from the beginning. <br /> <br /> But this is not a good movie. I'm sorry, it's not. <br /> <br /> It winds. He has too many characters. His tone is irregular, his point of view is confused, the acting is on the whole line, from naturalistic to over the top. It lingers for long moments with minor characters that we don't care about and cuts out the tense scenes just when things are going well. <br /> <br /> The brand is missing. <br /> <br /> The worst The weakness of the film is that the two things closest to a protagonist, the Desiree by Marly and Angela Bassett by Edie Falco, focus on characters who have no drive. Marly is drunk apathetic, immersed in her own inertia. Desiree is a woman trapped in her own repressed pain. When the visions of the world of your two main characters can be summarized with the phrases "I don't care" and "I want to leave here", why should the public give the rat pathos? <br /> <br /> I will be simple: Sayles writes funny dialogues. He is very adept at creating a scene. The problem is that these scenes go nowhere. There is no spine for the film. No guide The film does not create rooting interest in any of the characters. In my opinion, it's also too wordy for the big bad American companies that devour the little guy. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a "small" quality film, see "Straight Story" by David Lynch. Pass this on.
