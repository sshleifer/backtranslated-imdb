Okay, now I know where all those boring cop / murder shows come from. I think they can be traced back to this movie. "Scene Of The Crime" looks more like a television episode, or an episode of a serial. Complete with characters and situations in series - the undefeated cop who clashes with his superiors ... the old policeman who does not want a desk job, despite the failed sight ... the reckless rookie ... the double-headed lady crossroads, etc. <br /> <br /> I like many of the actors here, and they do a good job, but overall I found this movie boring because I'm not a fan of the genre. I kept tweaking when they were discussing the case ... something about bookmakers and informants. And oh yes, there was a stripper, played by the previous Gloria DeHaven. What I want to know is: why did you keep calling Van Johnson "Uncle Wiggly"? Wasn't that Uncle Wiggly a rabbit? A character from a children's book? What on earth does it have to do with something? I guess I'm not a bit hard on the Noir-ish movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, much of the dialogue made me murmur "nobody talks like that!" However, I could refer to a scene where the cop's wife (Arlene Dahl), who worries every time she goes to work, realizes that maybe she shouldn't have made her husband the center of her life. Yes, I know the feeling of loving someone so much, of being so dependent on them, that there is a constant fear for their safety. So there are moments of truth in this film, under the stylized dialogue and the atmosphere that is feeling so conscious that it is gritty and REAL, which seems really unreal to me. <br /> <br /> A bit of history: this The film was made when Dore Schary took over MGM from Louis B. Mayer and started putting an end to the healthy musicals that made MGM so exceptional. Dore Schary was determined to bring more "realism" into the movies. I hate Dore Schary. Perhaps we could blame him for all the pretentious and desolate films that are made today, wallowing in ugly "truths" about life, concentrating (and, in my opinion, helping to perpetuate) the worst of humanity, rather than the best. It no longer raised us in the way classic films were designed to do - providing a necessary distraction during the Great Depression and World War II. <br /> <br /> Well, dammit, we still need that kind of distraction today! There is still a lot of depression and a lot of war. And what are the people who turn to us today when they want to escape? Trashy, brain that grips reality. Thank you very much, Dore!
