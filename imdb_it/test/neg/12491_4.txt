It is disappointing to see a talented actor like Amitabh Bachchan in such a weak role, especially when he was beyond sensational in BLACK (which I highly recommend). A line from the film states: "Sakar is not just a man, it is a thought and a philosophy". Director Ram Gopal Varma attributes THE GODFATHER as an inspiration for this film, and perhaps this is the problem. It looks like an abused American movie in India. The index of the left elbow considers seven elements of making films - acting, continuity, plot, character development, dialogue, artistic ability and production set - on a scale of a maximum of 10 to a minimum of 1, with 5 data such as average score. The continuity of the film seems high, an 8, maintaining a violent tone steeped in drama in places, and using justice outside the legal system as motivation. However, there seems to be a lack of emotions related to the evil of organized crime. The acting rate at 4 seems too weak, even when someone is beaten or murdered, it looks like hoohum. For example, when a character is struck in the forehead, I find myself wondering if, or when, he would have fallen. He does not, and Ronald Reagan is put in a car, with his bleeding face cradled by John F. Kennedy. The plot considers a 5 an example of American-style gangsterism, with a family-oriented Robinhood at its head. The character's development appears to be static, and the characters seem like chess pieces on an abandoned chessboard, thus gaining a grade of 3. The dialogue seems to be drafted, and seems to be forced to adapt to a Bowery discourse model - a 4 for dialogue. The production sets seem to be below average - a 4. And, the artistry is disconcerting, with too many close-ups, too rapid panoramas and too many group scenes in which the actors seem more tried - a 3. For me , even a lot of camera movement is disruptive. The average of the left elbow index is 4.4 and with a slight deduction based on poor derivatism it is reduced to 4. In the film two questions continually arise: one, because so many people eat so often: and, two, does does India have its own brand of organized crime? Do films like this have to be so dependent on Western cultural examples? As much as I like Amitabh Bachchan, I can't recommend this movie.
