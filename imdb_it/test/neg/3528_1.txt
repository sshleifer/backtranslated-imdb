I don't know who funded it, or why, but this "wanting to be" vampire movie is really awful. Try to be fashionable and to appeal to the young public of the MTV generation, but it's simply ridiculous. The acting is horrible and the direction is horrendous. I heard the budget was $ 600,000. I want to know where all the money went?
