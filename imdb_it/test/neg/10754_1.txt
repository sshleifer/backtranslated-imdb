I went to see this movie last night at the National Film Theater in London as a birthday present. It was the first time I saw it, and I think it has now passed the terrible "Twister" as the worst movie I've ever seen. Decomposed for no reason, self-indulgent and full of images that oscillates from the gross and obvious to the dark and incomprehensible, not particularly beautiful or abruptly turned, I really don't understand why this is considered classic, gay or otherwise. Normally I like the films that push the boundaries or even the movies that are difficult to watch because of their length or their unusual cinematography. But this was really, really terrible.
