I found out about it in IFC last week and thought it was typical of the independent short film: heavy on style, little substance and originality. Isn't it surprising that an outgoing movie stars an unusually attractive boy (and blond on the boot) with shaved hair from the 70s and too cool clothes for school? Moreover, this film turns into the chic of the 70s, which works for some ("The Virgin Suicides" by Sofia Coppola comes to mind) but not for this director. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer compared this with the work of Harmony Korine and I agree. Yet I don't consider it a positive thing (what has HE done lately, anyway?). "Bobbycrush" is really just a waste of time and energy for everyone involved. If you happen to see it late at night on cable, turn the channel and look at something else instead.
