Sorry Randy. I love your play, but in this case you really put down a "Golden Turkey" egg. <br /> <br /> The texture was thinner than a single layer of my skin, the more woody acting of a Giant Redwood and I think the management was non-existent. <br /> <br /> Surely it seems that there have been pathetic attempts at take-offs in other films, Jaws and European Vacation to name just two. <br /> <br /> If memory serves me rightly Eric Idle has played the same kind of character in Nat Lamp European Vacation, but much better. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo have been contacted to make this sequel. If so, surely they knew what they were doing when they lowered their parts. <br /> <br /> In my opinion no one can improve Chevy and Beverley in their roles as the Griswolds and Randy Quaid have admirably completed them in the previous film. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid should have left National Lampoon while he was ahead.
