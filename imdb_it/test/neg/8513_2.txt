In my opinion, this film is not good. I can hardly find a good thing to say about it, but I would still like to explain it, before concluding that it's just another bad movie. I decided to watch it because Costas Mandylor is the protagonist in it, and this was the main reason why I watched it until the end. I like action movies and I understand that these films are built on action rather than plot. I know they don't go into details when it comes to the credibility of history and events, but even that doesn't explain why some scenes, just because they lack the sense of reality, seem ridiculous. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the film looks quite promising: a strong and good-looking specialist and his not so tough but smart and funny partner have to do a job, which is a bit different what they expected. The story takes place on a cruise ship. A disaster happens, the ship is overturned and only a few remain alive. During their struggle to survive they must escape from a shark, a professional killer and the rising water. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the film is rather violent. The main weapon (in addition to the disaster that has already eliminated most passengers) is the gun, which is used successfully in many cases. Personally, I missed a good man (or woman to woman if you prefer) to fight. Family fun? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think this film was shot in a hurry, without a true vision of what it is trying to say. Made with the usual tricks of the action movie, with a little something called love, and without a real meaning, it only translates into a bad movie.
