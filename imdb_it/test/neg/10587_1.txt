I expected this film to be absolutely terrible. Like "What Dreams May Come" or "The Truman Show" or something. Well, they were selling it for Â£ 3.99 in my local HMV and he had Giovanni Ribisi on the cover, you know you can't help him, but I love him, and so my friends dared to buy it. and I was sure it would be rubbish. maybe that's the only reason why I could sit in this film, because my standards were never so high.
