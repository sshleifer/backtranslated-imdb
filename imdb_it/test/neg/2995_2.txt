I should live this movie, but I don't. He has won international awards, he is a foreigner (I usually like these films) he is slow (again something I like) and he has no free sex or violence. the problem is that it is boring. We have two friends from the same village in Turkey, one "successful", the other not. the unsuccessful arrives in Istanbul to stay successful in an attempt to get a good job at sea. Both lives are unsatisfactory, useless and petty. <br /> <br /> Well, this is not the first time this type of film has been made. I have not seen anything new added to this tired theme. There are long breaks that are just someone standing and watching the sea or sitting in a bar or watching TV. I understand that this kind of thing is there to show the void of their loves, while it does I got the idea in the first 15 minutes. I don't need to be beaten in the head for the rest of the two hours. <br /> <br /> Symbolism is also a bit heavy. the fish-like live fish dish with one out of the plate and fluttering in its death throws. The symbols are the best when they are not obvious, but they are there, in the background, creating a mood just below the viewer's awareness. <br /> <br /> The film is so apathetic, that it doesn't even rate a score of 1, so I gave it to 2. Evaluating a 1 requires a talent for being bad. This film didn't have much energy.
