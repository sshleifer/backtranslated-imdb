This is the greatest example I can think of to prove the theory that when Hollywood runs out of good ideas, it makes a terrible sequel and ruins the former. Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely adore the first Beastmaster; I liked the third one too, but this film is atrocious. I'm a big fan of fantasy / sword and sorcery and I hated to see such a terrible sequel done to a classic like the first Beastmaster. So why do I hate this movie so much? Well, where do I start? First of all, the whole idea of ​​the film is ridiculous. Dar and his evil elder brother Arklon (which was not mentioned anywhere in the first film ... eh?) Cross our world through a convenient portal of time portal dimensions. See, the Earth appears to be on the same interdimensional plane parallel to the world of Dar. Considering that with the first film, you are led to think that the film takes place only in the past, but with this you are shown that it is completely another world ... it's just one of the many things I hate about this sequel. It didn't work with "Masters of the Universe", and it certainly doesn't work here either! Movies like this should take place and remain in their chronology and in their usual surroundings. For God's sake, what are the prospects? Hercules in New York ... er ... an example! Going up ... <br /> <br /> Arklon's after a device called a neutron detonator to use as a threat against his enemies to rule his kingdom. So it's up to Dar, his ferrets, his eagle and his tiger (not spray painted this time) to leave and save the world ... but along the way they have the help of a cool young man, and fashionable the daughter of Senator who gets involved in this mess and she shows Dar around LA, takes him around for his BMW and helps him pull him out of tight situations here and there. How cheap is it, right? And speaking of convenience, I found it terribly convenient and easy for Arklon to sneak into a highly guarded military base and get away with a stolen and highly destructive nuclear weapon ... even with half of the US Army and L.A.P.D. after him ... easy waaaaay, even for an evil barbarian sorcerer from another world. There are so many holes in the plot in this I don't know where to start; as if Arklon had gone to the zoo of L.A. for the end of the film?!? He has absolutely no reason to go there; And wouldn't it be like the last place you would attract your biggest enemy that just by chance has the comfortable ability to control animals? <br /> <br /> And you don't just love these types of movies where the police are portrayed as a total idiot and even with half a dozen cops shooting a guy, they still can't hit him? The police of this film is part of the "Police Academy" series! They are useful in this film because reading glasses are for the blind! Even the title of the film doesn't make sense: "Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time" ... they never crossed a "time" portal because the film is not set in the future of Dar's world, a long parallel world is set ours in the astral plane, so they have NEVER really crossed time, only a dimensional world along theirs; so there is NO real time travel! This movie tries to get funny and does it ... not because of humor, but because it's just so ugly ... and it's doing it slightly. The acting, the dialogue, the plot, the characters and the ending are all so funny that it's fun. What can I expect more from the guy who brought us "Return of the Swampthing" (another bad sequel)? Surprise here is the direction and the seriousness of Don Coscarelli of the first !! Avoid this smelly piece of garbage like the bubonic plague and stick which are the first and perhaps the third if there is nothing better on T.V.
