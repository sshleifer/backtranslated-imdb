Like many viewers of this film, I am an avid reader of books. The first two films feature Buck, Ray and Chloe, but in this second sequel they play in second place with the presidential effort of Louis Gossett JR. World at War is based on the meeting he has with Buck in the book series. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this film is as terrible as the first two. Amanda appears out of nowhere and suddenly has an important role to play (I won't reveal it if someone hasn't read the series). Other illogical features. I really want Cloud 10 to make a good Left Behind movie, but unfortunately this is similar in all bad ways to the first 2.
