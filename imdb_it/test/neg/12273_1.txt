It looked nice from the film's cover, but after five minutes we weren't sure if it was a homosexual documentary on the West Side story without any female interest. The quality of the film was mediocre, and there was not enough gang fighting to support even the most drunk person's interest for enough time to watch the whole movie. May God have mercy on the souls of both actors and directors responsible for what I can only describe as my new and unique reason why I never want to see (or trust) a movie made in Australia. I have to write more so I'll say again that the actors were so bad that I'm sure I could make a better movie with fifteen dollars and a box of Trojans. Please don't watch this movie for your own good.
