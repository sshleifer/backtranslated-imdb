This is a comedy / romance film directed by Andy Tennant, with Will Smith, Eva Mendes and Kevin James. <br /> <br /> It is a doctor in professional meetings - Will Smith - known as "Hitch" who helps men with the earth dates back to the women they are interested in. He is currently helping a shapely and clumsy Albert who is obsessed with a very powerful, famous and rich woman, called Allegra. At the same time, Hitch became interested in a gossip journalist, Sara, - Eva Mendes - who was assigned to write about Allegra. When Sara's best friend has a disillusionment of love with a man that Sara thinks is a client of Hitch, it complicates a revenge against Hitch and the misunderstanding brings the two couples into a conflict situation. This film is not one that men should see as it has a lot of masculine bravado and subtle and blatant male hatred. There are also two weights and two measures that you should be blind to not notice. Hitch and Sara are both highly guarded by the opposite sex, Hitch still likes women despite his burns from them in the past and is teaching men to make them happy. But of course Sara, is a sexist bigot who makes frequent sexist comments along the lines of "men want to have sex with all that walks". She is obsessed with herself and knows she looks like a goddess and knows that there are no "real men" out there. The thing that bothered me the most was the "bad" guy who wanted a quick confusion with Sara's best friend who is the classic example of a "helpless victim" and even after being physically rejected by Hitch, gets a shot from Sara's pills, after which she says "Now I'm satisfied." Add to that the vibrations of "women are still oppressed" that Allegra is not allowed to spend their money after asking permission from a table of men. Despite all the assumptions and generalizations of garbage - Can women always tell when you are not in line with them? - This film has the right point that in America, love simply does not exist. There are some fun parts in this film, like Albert and his dance habits, but this film in general, only beats the terrible film Honey of a marginal amount.
