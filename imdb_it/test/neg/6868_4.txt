I didn't like this movie. For me, it didn't make much sense. It was hard to understand what was going on. I also didn't think it was scary. Anyway, I thought it was silly, even absurd, but not in a good way. Ravha Mitchell is the main character of the film, which came out in 2003. It was also, coincidentally, in 2006 "Silent Hill" that I too found myself confused and useless. "Visitors" It's not so bad, but I think it's certainly below average. There is nothing special about this. The script is too confusing and there are things in the film that don't need to be there, in my opinion. I think Radha Mitchell is probably a good actress, if she has more things to work with. My vote for "Visitors" is 4/10
