Mockney comes to Brighton; despite the poor reception by the British press and state-funded British cinema in all this, I rather hoped we would get some of the filthy and chic damn London-by-the-sea by Graham Greene. /> <br /> It doesn't even aspire to this. The characters that come out of their cloned and crimped trailers reproduce the types of Guy Ritchie. The format looks more like a British television series than a film (Brighton is a gold mine in the background, wasted on plastic study work). I watched this film in search of a good performance by Famke Janssen ... it's a bit corny for this company, its big-screen brand is the must-have that belongs more to blockbusters like Deep Rising. As for acting (a role too!) The research continues. The circus is boring. 3/10
