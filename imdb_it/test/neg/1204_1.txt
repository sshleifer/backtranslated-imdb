A teenage boy, who is not in the army and has not been trained to become a jet pilot, leaves for a foreign country to save his father. If this isn't ridiculous enough, talk to an Air Force colonel to help him get his hands on a plane [wow!]. To make the image even more absurd, the colonel risks his career and life giving some spasms. Not only did they no longer make colonels like this, but they never did. This rich and corny film should be thrown into the air and swept away by a MIG.
