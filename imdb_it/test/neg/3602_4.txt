What we have here is the standard sequel to Disney Direct to DVD, in which I would expect the cradles to be cut in all areas, with the result of an animated film that goes very well with the original. This does not mean that this is a terrible film, it is just that it is a very mediocre film full of preaching messages intended to show children the virtues of friendship and to be kind to each other and if not done subtly (which is not here) can quickly become strident for adults. The film has a very subtle plot with Kronk trying to get his father's approval and ends up finding the true meaning of wealth and success. This has its comic moments but it's not even enough to bring a full length movie.
