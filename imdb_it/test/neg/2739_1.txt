A terrible film ... I won't bother you for the synopsis, put together The Core, Armageddon, an evil military officer and one or two Solve-All Nukes and you'll get the movie, if I can call it that way <br /> <br /> Seriously, nuclear weapons in this type of film are more useful than Swiss Army Knives: <br /> <br /> is the Big One approaching? Nuke some places and it's over ... A tornado wants to destroy "Enter the name of the important city here"? Nuke "Enter another important city here" ... Is a volcano bursting? Nuke it! Is an atomic bomb about to explode? Nuke it! The coffee is cold? Nuke it! Didn't you like Transformers? Nuke yourself, but I can't assure you that this will fix things ... <br /> <br /> In the end, how many other films like this can be made before they start copying each other? I doubt there are still many things to blow up with an atomic bomb ...
