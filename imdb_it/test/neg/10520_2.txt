A blatant "Air Bud" scam, this film is REALLY for parents who care too much about their parents. All the weaknesses of the characters (for example, adult coaches who do not know the game) are taken to the extreme - so much that they are absolutely incredible, not funny. <br /> <br /> There is no semblance of reality here, people and you will not develop sympathy for ANY of the characters. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is the beautiful (uniform) kits of the opposing team in the first game played by the dog. Perhaps chosen because the setting is supposedly near Arlington Heights, IL, the home of the Columbus Crew franchise, Brian McBride.
