"Escanaba in da Moonlight" is the first staging of Jeff Daniels who writes and directs talents. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse debuts, but this isn't great. <br /> <br /> "Escanaba in da Moonlight" begins as a decent parody of this part of American culture. We follow Rebuen Soady (Jeff Daniels) on the eve of the 1989 deer hunting season. He is approaching the record of the oldest Soady to never have a dollar. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the upper regions of Michigan and has all the normal clich√© characters. But there is a warmth that tells you, this is not mean. <br /> <br /> Well, Reuben is going to The Soady Deer Camp and before his wife (Kimberly Norris Guerrero) gives him a native American Necklace, his lucky hat, and two forms of liquid you probably don't want to know . <br /> <br /> However, she really is the only one who believes in him. Finally he arrives at the camp where his dad, Albery Soady (Harve Presnell) is waiting and his brother Remnar (Joey Albright) will soon be present. <br /> <br /> Okay, let's move forward quickly. Here are some laughs, some moments when I giggled loudly. But most of the jokes here are used a few to many times. <br /> <br /> But the biggest drawback is the spiritual / native American events. Just when you're happy with the characters, these strange things happen. But the special effects are so inexpensive all that is, it's a big flash of light and then they quickly head back forward. <br /> <br /> And the ending, well, it's worth nothing. <br /> <br /> The move itself was not bad, the bizarre character and the funny parody were good. But he should have stayed at that. Instead of having stupid spiritual awakenings that look like scenes rejected by a demonic film. <br /> <br /> I give "Escanaba in from Moonlight" to 4.5 out of 10.
