The only reason I saw this movie was because he had Giovanni Ribisi and it had to be "Horror". Don't be fooled, this movie must be the worst "horror" movie I've seen. These are people who go to a secret place that contains a "monster". The monster is a man with a deformed face who runs in pants of blue sweat that has a craving for brains. Some people die, some people don't. Eventually they throw the monster away from an airplane and then fly away happily. BUT NO! THE MONSTER IS STILL ALIVE AFTER FALLING FROM A PLANE! Go and spend 2 hours in another way, like looking at dry paint on a wall, trust me, it's more fun than this shit.
