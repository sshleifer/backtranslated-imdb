Ever wanted to see how low a movie could sink? Well, look no further! This movie has it all! <br /> <br /> Jokes about racism, handicapped jokes, overweight jokes, suicide jokes, drug jokes, animal abuse jokes, dirty jokes, old jokes, cancer jokes, gay jokes, jokes, flattened jokes face, jokes, excessive use of blood jokes, rape jokes, alcohol abuse jokes, alcohol eruption jokes, a lot of people joking about coffee, nudity, who can say the most imprudent words in a scene jokes, lesbian jokes, girlfriend abuse jokes and the list goes on and on people! <br /> <br /> The worst part is: none of this is fun! (Not that anyone can find most of the fun ones to begin with.) It seems that when it fails to get worse, it pushes your expectations towards a completely new background, since it always seems to find another to make the viewer feel worse. There was a scene that almost threw me up and almost completely depressed at the same time. I don't think I have to indicate which one, but again, I'm sure there will be other scenes that will give people the same feeling. <br /> <br /> There was a moment at the end of the film that actually made sense and was a bit realistic when suddenly one of the characters in the scene was stacked with the ugliest remnants of a garbage bag and he threw several feet on the ground just to have a bunch of smashed beer bottles in his head. All this probably when he least deserved it. So all the thought of another point of redemption was quickly considered. This is really a terrible movie. This is one that must be studied and divided into two parts in a film school to teach students what not to do.
