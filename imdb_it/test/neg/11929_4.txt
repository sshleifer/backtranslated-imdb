It's a bit unnerving when a studio refuses to project a film for printing before it goes into a large release. The fact that many films suck is not a surprise, but when a studio itself admits much earlier, the process of the film becomes a game of passion. Consider it a first Christmas gift from Hollywood, therefore, "Aeon Flux" is not nearly the affront to taste and decency that one might expect, given the above. Although he is ultimately overwhelmed by his flaws, he has at least some sort of idea to play with. Too bad the director Karyn Kusama seems to have the slightest idea how to do everything. <br /> <br /> It's the future. There was a plague. There is a dictatorship and there are rebels. The latter are known as the monks, and far from being a cult of caps or tennis racket worshipers, they are intent on overthrowing the first, called the Goodchild regime. The regime is occasionally bad for citizenship, which is more than Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) and her friends can resist. Through a kind of biochemical virtual reality technology, the monks receive orders from their dear leader (Frances McDormand), a mystical type of priestess who appears to have been crossed with a carrot. It is up to Aeon to wrap up some futuristic spandex productions that fit the shape to execute the orders of the High Carrot, which are obviously a version of "destroying the regime". Having years before watched his sister be liquidated by the Goodchilds, she needs little convincing. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, things get complicated. Goodchild may not be as they seem, and Aeon may have an unexpected story with them too. Although occasionally confused, the central idea of ​​the film (of which I will not reveal any more) contains some clear ideas about the nature of human existence and survival. There is room for many more exams of which the film does not take advantage, but the ideas are there, at least. The big problems of "Aeon Flux" are technical. Kusama has made the disconcerting decision to film almost all the action so closely that we can rarely follow what is happening. To make matters worse, it is modified into a series of jumps that leave us completely lost. The result is a serious spatial disorientation that takes over the film. The aesthetics of "Aeon Flux" is an elegant costume, an oddly angled architecture and agile characters. Much of the action occurs in minimalist open spaces that require some long, uninterrupted strokes that could convey the grace and athletics implicit in the above. Instead, we get split seconds of flying limbs, broken glass and sound effects that accompany them. <br /> <br /> There is a nice film that tries to get out of the quagmire of "Aeon Flux". Put this stuff in the hands of the Wachowski brothers, let's say, and the results could be very different. Anyway, I thought "Aeon Flux" was voluntarily moving me away from a movie I wanted to enjoy. This film is not attached to its strengths. As a novice, the poker player has distributed a royal flush, somehow finds a way to lose despite his potential.
