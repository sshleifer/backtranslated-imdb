OK, if you're a fan of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 and you love making movies, then you'll have a great time with it. Otherwise, it could be TOO really painful to see. <br /> <br /> Plot: The obsessed cryptozoologist has hidden a huge crate containing a Chupacabra on a cruise ship (apparently not having to declare it at customs, or even mentioning that he is bringing a live animal on board - "not really, it's research equipment, air holes are just an accident"). Some dipsticks he hired to open it open the box, imagining that he paid a lot of money, maybe there is something to steal. Once the WOOD CRATE is open, the Chupacabra breaks through the STEEL BARS inside and goes on a murderous rampage. <br /> <br /> Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> With a stroke of pure coincidence, a Marshall (I assume a US Marshall, since he was in the Gulf War, not just a boy named Marshall) is on board, investigating some money that they disappeared from the ship's safe. You're pretending to be an insurance salesman ("Madam, I'm the best insurance you have ..."). Other glittering characters include the captain (John Rhys-Davies, and sadly his dignity is the first victim of the film), his tae-bo instructor daughter (snicker - Tae-bo), an annoying old lady with a small dog who it should be given to a cat (guess what WHAT eats it ...?) and an incredibly unpleasant gigolo that could have been believable in a movie made in 1964, not something newer. Much of the acting was really bad, and the characters were right there so they could laugh hysterically when they died. <br /> <br /> Overall - SCREAMINGLY bad. Bad on many levels. EVIL EVIL EVIL What??? The bullets don't even beat Chupacabra, but the Tae-bo child can punch him and scare him away ???? Hey Sci-fi Channel, are you desperate for screenplays or what?
