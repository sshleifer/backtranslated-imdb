I'm not talking about IMDb's comments on movies but this ... this movie was bad. very ugly. I made a quick advance in most of it, stopping where I hoped the acting had improved since the last scene, only to continue with the fast attackers. Plot of the formulas - once the obvious killers were discounted, only one remained. And that was in the first five minutes. Scene after scene it seemed to me that I had already read the script before because there were no surprises, no mystery. The character Tori ... bad acting. A real waste of time on DVD and a definite option 'let's go to bed early' if that's the only thing on television. If you watch this movie, you will find that you will never be able to make up for the time you've just wasted.
