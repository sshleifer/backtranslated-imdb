The last sentence of this review is an important spoiler. <br /> <br /> I liked the work of Joe Dante after Piranha. He did a lot of different genre parodies that were both funny and honest. <br /> <br /> But this is pure shit. This is the kind of satire - in line with Thank You For Smoking - which is so literal and direct that it leaves nothing to) to laugh at and b) leave the audience to think about. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, because the plot and the material are so rich, punctual and mature for an intelligent comment. <br /> <br /> By the way, there is absolutely no reason for the main character to shoot the character of Ann Coulter at the end of the film. It's simply ridiculous.
