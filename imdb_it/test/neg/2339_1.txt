It's a joke, isn't it! Lynch could not produce it as a TV show. He was without money, so what to do? Well, he somehow received a few dollars and "completed" the pilot and created this mess by simply mixing everything together ... How can you see a failed TV pilot as a cinematic masterpiece? <br /> <br /> And now everyone is guessing the deeper meaning !? Well, wake up, there's nobody there! Like in that other Lynch TV series, what was the name again? Same procedure there. Build a mystery and then don't invent anything. I believe Lynch will repeat this concept until people realize, the emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> In Germany there is a comedian called Harpe Kerkerling. He disguised himself as an opera singer and "performed" some new "art songs". Sing nonsense like this: <br /> <br /> "The wolf, the lamb, on the lawn, Hurrz!" <br /> <br /> It's a classic now. <br /> <br /> In any case, later, he discussed it with the public. And they were seriously talking about the deeper meaning of the wolf / lamb relationship. <br /> <br /> People who give this film an 8.0 rating at imdb.com, you people could be one of them. <br /> <br /> So let's say everything together: "Hurrz!" <br /> <br /> 0/10 Macaulay J.
