I won't comment much, what to say ??? Stereotypical characters, absolute ignorance about the reality of Colombia, horrible mise en scene, poor choice of colors, NOT funny (it should be a comedy and expect you to laugh because relaxing music is next to meaningless scenes), Direction of very poor actors (if you see those people somewhere, I mean the interpreters, you will know that they are at least good, but seeing this so calls the film, it is impossible to guess it), you get tired of the music ... this "comedy" has no rhythm, the only good rhythm in it, it's the rap that sings in the credits .... pathetic, isn't it? etc ... etc ... It's a long time since I've seen a movie so bad !!
