I am a regular reader of Temperance Brennan's novels by Kathy Reichs. As such, I am extremely surprised that he even consulted this show. <br /> <br /> IS HORRIBLE compared to books. Temperance Brennan's character is, in books, a real alcoholic and divorced mother of an elderly daughter. In "Bones", she is an arrogant (rhymes with rich), who, in the typical fashion P C, is not a mother. The emphasis on his staff of assistants, complete with obscure details of those who have had as many sexual exploits, is totally at odds with the books. <br /> <br /> In total deference to the PC movement, it portrays the enemies of the United States as lovers of peace (!). Some information is not even correct, for example, having a character from Afghanistan as an active member of an Arab-American group of friends. Since when is an Arab an Arab?! I'm sure that if negative references had been made to "disadvantaged minorities", or women, or GLBT, the producers / writers / directors of the show would have to apologize. However, in the typical fashion on the far left, all the racist insults come to the most successful minority group: the Asians, like David Boreanaz's agent Booth, continually refers to Angela Montenegro as a "squint". <br /> <br /> Forget that stuff, and forget this show. After the episode "The Man in the SUV", I thought of trying a second episode to see if it has improved. It just got worse! I don't even care if the teenager in question has been killed or committed suicide, and I'll never watch the show again.
