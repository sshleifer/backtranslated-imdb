I knew perfectly well when I rented this DVD which could be one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. But to say that it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen would be putting it lightly. I wonder if there is any legal action against the individuals who allowed this film to be produced. I mean, the funding had to come from somewhere, someone had to put the money for it to produce !! ?? <br /> <br /> I would identify different production values ​​that led to the failure of this film, but this film violated every production standard in the universe. I couldn't do it through the whole movie, as I started to get dizzy from hideous shooting techniques. I can't even tell you how many scenes I've just finished zoning because of the inexplicably horrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> I feel like I've been permanently marked for life. If you watched this movie before receiving this warning, you should consider starting a support group with me for poor people who have seen this monstrosity.
