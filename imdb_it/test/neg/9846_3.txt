This film was, in a word, terrible. It was boring, predictable and utterly creepy. I kept waiting for it to end and when it happened, I was horrified. The finish left a bad taste in my mouth, to say the least. My advice to anyone interested in budding female sexuality films: stay away from this movie. Movies like this give classics like Lolita a bad name.
