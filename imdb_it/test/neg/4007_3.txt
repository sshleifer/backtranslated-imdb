At the end. Here is a film that does so much for the reputation of the men of Greece and Russia as "Gigli" did for those of Mr. Affleck and Mrs. Lo. FROM THE CITY EDGE recounts the sad and sordid lives of some young Russian emigrants who live in and around Athens and spend their time robbing cars, fucking, prostituting and emulating prostitutes ("But we're not gay because we don't wear I know , you know ... And if we do it, it's only once or twice, with the same boy. ") There's almost nothing here that you've never seen before and better; only the Athens venue adds a bit of novelty - even then there is only one scene or two that is scenic. Writer / director Constantine Giannaris ("3 Steps to Heaven") offers 95 relatively generic minutes, in which the highlights involve how most of these guys are stupid, sexist and (from the look of things) practically irretrievable. (Interestingly, the more gay the boy is, the more he redeems himself). What really is the treatment of women. Greek and Russian males would seem to give the Italians a run for their money for that famous madonna / whore complex. Has life in Greece improved a lot for women since the days of Plato and Socrates? One must wonder. <br /> <br /> If I seem to equate Russians and Greeks in this review, I apologize, but even the non-emigrants depicted here (the taxi driver, for example) are insinuating. According to another review on this site, the film (a hit on its national territory) was actually presented by Greece for an Academy Award for best foreign film. What this says about the state of Greek cinema, hesitates to meditate.
