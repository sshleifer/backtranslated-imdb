Whenever I see a video like this, I have to ask myself how it was funded. HBO or Showtime or anything else has to pay for the production company to go through the motions - hire someone who can or can't really speak English to come forward and hammer something that comes close to a plot, to pay strippers with terrifying jobs of boobs to bounce off and down the torsos of coarsely circled guys, to find people who design and illuminate sets, to buy good techno music rights, etc. But I have to imagine that this must be a vain project for anyone who serves as an executive producer ... He must have nailed all those girls, right? And he is not wrong for the "Spanish-looking" girl, but to call "stupendous" the police is terribly generous. In fact, I would go so far as to call them something much closer to "horrible" or "fleetingly". Watching these writhing women - sometimes * clearly * high on painkillers - was so far from the eroticism that my testicles had actually risen inside my body. Gross. <br /> <br /> Why waste time with this when there is so much hardcore porn available for free on the internet? I wonder if the disclosure of video on the Internet can slowly kill the softcore video industry ... One can only hope, right?
