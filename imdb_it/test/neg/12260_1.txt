I don't understand why this movie was released, it seemed like something you show your friends after borrowing your mom's handycam that you bought in 1987. I'm Australian and I work for a video store in the UK and thought that if a Australian film has entered our store can not be all negative ... boy was I wrong! <br /> <br /> If someone writes a good comment on this film, they lie or are the creators of the film. /> <br /> The image was BAD, the sound was HORRIBLE and the acting, oh the acting, was the WORLDWIDE acting in the HISTORY OF THE FILM. <br /> <br /> It makes me embarrassed and offended by the fact that they used the word "Aussie" in the title because I am proud to be Australian and this film is seen in other countries and can give people the wrong idea. /> <br /> Please anyone who reads this and has seen this movie, take the time to find other Australian films to watch because you could choose one of these and it would be better than that. <br /> <br /> I could have made a better film if I had taken a camera, filmed mine but for an hour, I ate the film waiting for it to pass through my body and then I threw what came out on television ... no offense. <Br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM !!!!!!!!!!
