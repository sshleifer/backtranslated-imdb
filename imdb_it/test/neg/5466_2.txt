Of course, I like some independent films. Very much, actually. I don't always understand them, and that's fine. Not everyone was meant to be understood, especially by people primarily like me. I'm probably showing my ignorance, but I'm still puzzled as to why "Book of Revelation" is called that. I love those end of the world stories and the only thing I could see similar to the end of the world and this movie was the torture needed to overcome this. I'm not talking about the subject; maybe I was subjected to all the other tortures / porn I saw. It was just the incredibly slow story, an hour and 15 minutes of material stretched for almost two hours. (The main spoilers are in front) The hetero dancer is kidnapped, seduced and raped six times from Sunday, or in this case 12 days, by three hooded women. Upon his release, after his somewhat distraught dancer / girlfriend just moved (as well as dropping a glass) after asking herself that he had lost more: he or the cigarettes she originally sent him for kidnapping. Still in a state of reasonable shock, he refuses to talk, and continues to work without a hug as if nothing had happened and had a nice shower. Problem. However tormented by the flashbacks to his "attacks", he is equally excited. Of course, I wasn't tied up and used as a toy, but I doubt that I would really be "in the mood". Oh, did I forget, and how are you trying to solve this crime? Sleep with as many women as you can to try to identify the cravings or tattoos that criminals have had. I see where they are going with it ?? shows a group rape from the male POV. Well, despite everything, you could never try for this guy. The only thing that saved was the good acting of the LifetimeTV Dancer / Cancer Instructor. But neither could she save the film.
