Interesting story but painfully boring. The script is missing ... the acting is missing. For me this film is comparable to "Made for TV" movies. I was lucky to survive the movie without falling asleep in my popcorn. I saw this movie with my family. It's safe enough to watch with your kids. (only 1 semi-sex scene) If you want to see a young Meg Ryan ... take a look at this movie. Very 80-ish. You will like this movie if you like the combination of depressed people at Christmas, alcohol, super glue and tar. Or maybe you're like me ... and you have a higher standard for acting in movies. However I liked the way the film started and finished! Brand name.
