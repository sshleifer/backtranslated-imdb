this movie showed me Paul W.S. Anderson's AvP1 and have fun! I have no intention of dreaming of comparing the Requiem to any of the films in the Alien or Predator series, this is a set of HORROR BORROR B-HORROR IN A SMALL AMERICAN CITY OF WHICH YOU DO NOT NOW. <br /> <br /> At least AvP1 had a lot of craft art carved into movie sets, had eye candy bags not seen previously in any of the original films - but it was ruined by unconvincing characters / actors. <br /> <br /> Requiem takes bad action at the lowest imaginable level, and even in every other department it lacks just as much ... it is a sacrilege to include alien and predatory clothes in this type of garbage.
