An exceptionally silly actor with a braindead leads into a story that fits a whole Spiderman number. Action sequences never fluctuate as they should, leaving some interesting orphaned pieces in a sea of ​​sounds and fury, meaningless. I really wonder how they will release this in the West. Sam Lee behaves like a madman, the newcomer Edison Chan still shows no talent as an actor. The robot is awkward and not very impressive, and the CGI effects (although made by the American people) are ridiculous, totally destroying any residual suspension of disbelief. I look forward to Gen-Z cops ...
