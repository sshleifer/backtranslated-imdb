The son of Native Chief was wrongly accused of his father's death. The evil wizard orders to kill him. Then come back as a killer tree (!), Tabanga. Well, what can you say about such a "movie"? If you thought it was a horror movie, obviously there was some sort of negative judgment. And for a comedy, it's still not funny enough. I don't know why people do movies like this. I guess you have to be really in a bad mood to watch it. Or you might want to see the incredible "monstrous" tree, which gives a new dimension to "a slow death". Or maybe you want to control the great acting skills of all the people involved. (Mrs. Kilgore!) Or the dialogue and the script, which strangely were ignored at that year's Academy Awards. <br /> <br /> "Shouldn't we try psychoanalysis on that tree? Perhaps its mother was afraid of oaks." 2/10
