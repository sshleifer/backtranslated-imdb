Yes, it's your typical direct video action movie. And of course they do their best to change it a little, but they fail miraculously. Snipes offers its perfectly bland performance that it always does. Colloca shows that you don't need talent to act in a movie but only for sex appeal. The worst part is that it doesn't cover my basics about bad movies that are: 1 ?? Bad economics. 2 ?? One-liner perfectly timed. 3 ?? Intense car chases with massive explosions. 4 ?? The hero who connects with the hot chick. 5 ?? Multitudes of naked women or poorly dressed without reason. OK, so I lied, covers those but it does so horribly.
