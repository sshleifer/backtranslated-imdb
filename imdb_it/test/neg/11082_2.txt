The Cavern: 2 out of 10: Blair Witch meets The Cave and gives me a headache. <br /> <br /> I have something to ask from all film schools, you could please teach future filmmakers how to hold a camera. Shaking the camera like Aunt Betty with 12 drinks is a headache. <br /> <br /> Even the cinema is primarily a visual director, directors may want to point the camera in the general direction of the action. The film also requires light to function. Perhaps you should use a light source so that you can see the action on the screen. I know it's a cave movie, but there's absolutely nothing scary about watching pitch darkness for minutes. <br /> <br /> If it is true that showing the film upside down does not indicate confusion on the screen it indicates confusion in the editing booth. <br /> <br /> A final note to the director I'm sure there was a good reason to have a fake CGI bonfire. I honestly can't think of one for my life. <br /> <br /> Now to the writer. Try to make at least one character nice. I would prefer two or more but a decent person who I could root or cure could help. Also, if you have flashbacks make them relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> If you have a surprise ending it is probably best if it does not contradict every single thing that comes first. And try adding some spelunking fantasy terms to a cave movie. You may have wanted to start with spelunking. <br /> <br /> The Cavern is a rather ugly film, badly shot with a confusing, unlikely and anticlimatic ending.
