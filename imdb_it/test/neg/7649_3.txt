I don't really consider myself a conservative, so I wasn't personally offended by this film, but it was pretty clear that the plot and characterization of this film were secondary to the message. And the message is that all conservatives are either bad or stupid (or both). The characters are one-dimensional: good Americans or lovers of freedom or conservative mindless, greedy and evil. There is nothing intelligent or creative, just anti-conservative. I don't care about the political bias itself, but it shouldn't be the only purpose behind the film. And clearly it is. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the cast is wonderful and the impression of W. Di Chris Cooper is fun the first two or three times, but then it's just the same old joke that is told and again. <br /> <br /> So if you really hate conservatives, you'll probably like this movie, but if you're looking for something with realistic characters and a less black and white story, then you'd be better off looking at something else.
