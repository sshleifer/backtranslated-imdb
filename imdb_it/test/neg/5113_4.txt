Orson Welles's 1974 documentary "F for Fake" examines deception and fraud, focusing mainly on two men who have been exposed as scammers themselves. Clifford Irving is a biographer who has written the alleged and fraudulent autobiography of Howard Hughes, yet, it seems, he claims his innocence. The other main subject of the film is the artist Elmyr de Hory, a man who spent his life painting fakes of famous masterpieces, sometimes sold them to museums as real works of the original artists. Scattered between these stories are fragments in which Welles does magic tricks to illustrate points, etc., and also addresses the fact that his career began as a fraud when he first lied about his resume and then created a radio sensation with "War of the Worlds" ". <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this movie and find it deep since I'm a devotee of Welles, but I couldn't bring him to do it. Part of the problem was that it wasn't only non-linear, it was completely scattered, while I appreciate the elegant editing and the quick jumps and zooms, particularly when used in an unusual format like a documentary, in "F for Fake" there was simply too much stuff. to the style of lending. If the story had been clearer and more complete, I think the editing would probably not have been so annoying. The scattered narrative was made all the more hateful by the fact that it was really interesting effects, in particular Elmyr de Hory. His artistic falsity traces the theme of fraud in the art world and who is really able to determine the authenticity of certain works; and if the works are not authentic, what does he say about those who admire the pieces in the museums? This is a documentary I'd say at least to give it a shot, but don't be afraid to turn it off if you don't like it. It is certainly the most disorganized documentary I've ever seen; it is a cross between a documentary, an art film and an experimental film, none of which is adequately represented or isolated. I have no lesser opinion of Welles after having seen it, but certainly, in my opinion, it does not stand out as a glowing specimen in his work. 4/10 - Shelly
