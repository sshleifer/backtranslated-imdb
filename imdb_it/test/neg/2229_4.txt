Some of my fellow writers have covered the plot elements of this film, so I will limit myself to some of the comments on the bracelet ... <br /> <br /> 1. This is fun, but not for the reasons you think. He is mischievous but somehow still watchable. <br /> <br /> 2. Tamra, Daniel's love interest must be about thirty. The Christian girl that Dan ignores is very pretty. <br /> <br /> 3. Muriel stole her shirt from Mr. Spock. Also, if my guardian angel looks like Muriel, I will have to apply for a transfer. <br /> <br /> 4. Ok ... so apparently ... Dan is responsible for his parents' divorce! What kind of horrible guilt is that ?! Muriel says that it was Dan's prayers to keep his parents together. I just thought it was absolutely ridiculous. Listen, I can pray for my parents as much as I want but the only way to be together is if they decide they will. <br /> <br /> 5. I will echo the comments of atheists on how this film portrays non-Christians. Apparently they are all sloppy bullies. <br /> <br /> 6. For something positive - David White is a decent actor. It gives the film some credibility, even if it is the only one. He practically keeps this film together on his own.
