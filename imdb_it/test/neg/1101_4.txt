After spending all his money to take care of his terminally ill spouse, recently widowed Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) moved with her two daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) into the run-down family home of late husband in the Pennsylvania countryside, where local legends speak of zombies roaming in the woods at night. <br /> <br /> Just look at the names of the writer and director of this film in the opening credits to make me shudder: Boaz Davidson is the "genius" is responsible for writing scripts for these STV titles like Octopus 1 & 2, Spider and Crocodile, while JS Cardone gave us the "video-ugly" who likes cheaters, The Slayer and the vampire deaf vampire The Forsaken. With such a questionable talent, I didn't expect much from Wicked Little things. <br /> <br /> And having just finished the film, I'm glad I kept my expectations low. <br /> <br /> Although the film looks good sometimes, with a pleasant use of the mysterious woodland environment, and the cast offers reasonable performance given the clich√© drivel they are working with, the plot is so laborious, poorly written and derivative that it is impossible to be excited about. More importantly, perhaps, the killers of the film, the undead children who get up every night from the mine they died of, are not at all scary, a tinge of makeup, black contacts and some horrible joke shop scar that they do a lot little to add to the sense of threat. The scout Taylor-Compton and the company do their best to seem frightened by the small terrors, shouting convincingly at every confrontation, but their admirable attempts to instill a sense of fear in the public are of no use: the little whiners have no what it takes to refresh the blood. <br /> <br /> There are some fabulous zombie scenes in a futile attempt to conquer the bloody dogs and the final killing, which sees the victim's blood soaking both Compton and Heuring, is properly bland, but overall , Wicked Little Things (AKA Zombies in the UK) is a must in the trash, just another clunker in Cardone and Davidson's filmographies.
