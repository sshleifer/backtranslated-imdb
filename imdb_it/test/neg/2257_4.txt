A VERY short not Tom and Jerry. Jerry tells this story that revolves around Tom, the cat who falls in love and loses it to his rival, Butch. Tom is Jerry's best friend here who annoyed me a little. The cartoon is also presented in Cinemascope. Overall I found this cartoon Tom and Jerry sad and depressing. He should just put "Puss gets the boot" on the DVD instead and I would have been happy. This experimental animated short can be found on Disc 2 of the Warner Brother Spotlight Collection 2-DVD set. It's the last one on the set and I hope that Warner Brothers will choose to publish a second volume soon. <br /> <br /> My Grade: C-
