Let me start by saying that I loved the original Grudge. It was none of the most terrifying and pungent experiences I've ever had in a full cinema. I'm not kidding. Being a self-proclaimed Japanese pro, even my eyes made me look better (if the setting had been changed in some American suburb I would probably have ended up hating the movie). <br /> <br /> Having said that .. this film is a complete mess! I won't say it sucks, because A) the film has some positive points, B) "it sucks" is the saddest put-down in the history of the bad words. So what does the film have in store? Well, for beginners it looks pretty cool: through filters and the use of bright and faded colors, Takashi Shimizu almost recreates the downbeat, anguished atmosphere of the original. Some scenes are really shocking and unpredictable. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is simply ugly. Period. <br /> <br /> The story is everywhere, unnecessarily called the Tarantino style, meaning the scenes are out of chronological order. This technique is useless in the case of this film and simply makes things more confusing. Frankly, a simple storyline would have worked better. Even the original lacked plot, but it made sense and the film more than compensated for its subtle texture with many fears and a really tense atmosphere. Grudge 2 has none of these elements and is only a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the acting skills of TV shows that make the cast of Original Grudge Emily Watson and Katherine Hepburn look like. In short, the film does not work. It's too slow, too boring, and not scary enough to compensate for the confusing plot (which adds nothing new to the story, however, so even Grudge fans won't be happy). <br /> <br /> Oh, and what's in the old man who plays the Japanese peek-a-boo on the bus ?? Should this be a comic relief? Art affirmation? Or what?
