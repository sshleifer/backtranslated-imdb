First of all ... I have to say that acting is not very good. Miranda Cosgrove is the main character, but she is not a good actress frankly. Spencer, his brother is a much better actor. Spencer is easily my favorite character because he is probably the only one who knows how to act. Carly on the other hand tries to play her heart but ... sorry, it's not good. Sam doesn't even get credit, I mean come on ... ICARLY ... rather self-centered huh? Freddy is not bad, I don't have a comment. I have to add that Carly and her puppet Sam change their attitude every time they go to shoot a webcast, they go and shout all their lines. It's a bad influence somehow because Carly has a web show and if the kids copy it, they could give their information and that's not safe enough. <br /> <br /> The only nice thing is that it has SOME fun parts of the show that makes it fun. At least this show is not boring, it has some pretty strong textures. Many kids will appreciate this because they don't look for flaws. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a negative show, but it's not boring.
