I'll start by admitting that I like many movies that have low ratings on this site. I find that if I can see what the creators are trying to do, I can find appreciation for their work. Sound of Thunder was a story that interested me. I wanted to see what are the angles that filmmakers would attack in telling the story. In general they tried to make a funny movie. The plot was invented, but most of the action film's plots are. Ed Burns does not know how to carry a rifle, but he still holds his leading role well, considering that he is not asked much. The main problem,! It destroys the whole movie !, it's the horrible CGI. It is absolutely unacceptable that animals and backgrounds look very fake. Apart from that, animal conceptions could have been really good, as were action scenes, but they failed because production failed. This could have been a truly memorable film if they had just finished it. It really looks like they wanted to go back and fix all the horrible CGI, but short of money and still released. Save your money because someone has failed this movie. I give him three stars because he could have been good but he was totally failed somewhere, I can't say enough.
