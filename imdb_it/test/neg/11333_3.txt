I can't understand why anyone should allow a subtitle director to put drivel like this on celluloid. This film has already been done at least two times better than this ("Here Comes Mr. Jordan" - 1941, and "Heaven Can Wait" - 1978). The only saving factor for figure skating fans could have been a nice ice skating done by a professional skating cast, but that doesn't happen. The closest thing to the public for skating is when Tara Lipinski's character takes a turn on the ice for a moment. Others like Nancy Kerrigan and Elvis Stojko are hidden in the background and are not skating at all. Not much real emotion is shown, and there really is no reason to tune in to this obviously Made-for-TV movie. My advice: rent the original.
