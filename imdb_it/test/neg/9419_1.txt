I had the dubious opportunity to watch this movie on TV. It's the perfect example of how to take a terrible script and turn it into one of the worst movies ever made. Not only is the acting bad and the effects terrible, the film has more logical holes than ten kilos of imported Swiss cheese. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film as an example of how NOT to make a movie and which director does not use in one of yours. <br /> <br /> I turned off the TV during the last ten horrible minutes of the show. To call it "pathetic" is a gross euphemism.
