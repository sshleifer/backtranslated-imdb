I love John's work as a singer, but the film was boring and "not worth" to see. <br /> <br /> I thought he had done an "ok" job by playing his part. When he says "you have a relationship with the old man", I almost laughed at his facial movements ... or his lack of it. <br /> <br /> I would suggest the film if you like John's music but not as a Saturday night video. <br /> <br /> If you love his music, then the video has a little music from him, but not much. <br /> <br /> So this way .. at best
