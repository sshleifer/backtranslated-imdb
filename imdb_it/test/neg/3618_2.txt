I usually like films about animals or reptiles that revolt against the old petty humans who threaten their environment, but I have to say that Snake Island was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> The premise is interesting, a group of people, including a writer numbed by William Katt, goes to an island called, duh, you guessed "Snake Island", and you have no doubt about what the island lives up to its name. This is something I will give to this film, there are snakes, lots and lots of snakes of all sizes and types. So that part of the film honestly lives up to its name, but writing, acting and directing are SOOOOOOOO lame, it's almost painful to sit down. <br /> <br /> The characters are so unlikely that I was pleading for the snakes to finish these horrible people to get us all out of our misery. There are a couple of scenes that are so surreal and ridiculous that they are seen to be believed --- snakes turning to horrible disco music while two women dance half-naked together and a scene with a snake holding an inan dialogue with one of the actors, beyond the absurd. I think the writer was trying to be funny but this just came out as a strange journey with the LSD ... <br /> <br /> I remember William Katt years ago when he starred in "Carrie", what a beautiful piece it was ... that I've never been an important star, but to be reduced to this garbage, I try for him. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague, unless you are really interested in movies that feature a lot of really horrible snakes and humans.
