A serious step back for the puppets in this boring and boring excursion. Guy Rolfe, as fantastic as Andre Toulon in the third part, this time it seems this time and the fantastic Richard Band song appears with the puppets in a few minutes in the film. For the beginning of the film we are presented with the custodian of Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Currie) and some of his young friends (many of the casts are Canadian and they are all very good at unfortunately not demanding roles - Teresa Hill is quite tasty). Totems, servants of the Egyptian god Sutek want the secret of the life of animation and the puppets (when they rise to the surface) act with an intelligence never seen before to try to destroy the ugly computer game that seems Totem. Totems simply complicate the series and distract from the things that previously made the series so unique - they don't share the strange beauty of puppets and therefore don't really fit. The main scene is Pinhead using a rag to wipe the blood from Tunneler drill bit, classic and more gourmand than this movie. The fifth film was filmed in conjunction with this, so expect similar sections of mediocre and a Toulon performance that seems to have been shot in a different era (or even in a galaxy). Guy Rolfe deserved better and certainly the fans of the series. Grrrrrrr.
