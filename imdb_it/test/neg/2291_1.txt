Actually, I feel like my review was that word. My friend, whose opinions I almost always trusted films, especially horror films, warned me NOT to rent this, however tempted or bored or desperate to see a new horror movie, because it was a complete waste of time. Unfortunately I never talked to him for a while, and I was in a hurry to choose a movie, and I thought, 'What the hell, how bad could it be? 'WHY don't I learn? What was I thinking? Did you think it would magically turn into a better movie while sitting there on the shelf for years waiting to be rented? <br /> <br /> The "plot" is about a guy editing movies for some company. His boss is an idiot. The guy who had the job before him went mad and blew himself up in the pre-credit sequence, so for some reason the boss chooses "Ed" nerd for the special film editing project "Loose Limbs". He never says what Ed should change, but I guess it doesn't matter. And he is upset by some of the clips, working on them in this house alone that the boss has decided to move to him for no apparent reason. He asks his boss if he can stop or do another project, but his boss doesn't care. He starts to go crazy slowly, presumably looking at the clips, and wants to carry out the bloody murders in real life. Or has it always been like this? Keep in mind that I'm making this plot seem much deeper, more interesting and more coherent than it really is. <br /> <br /> We don't care about the characters at all, or we have no sympathy for them, or even hate the bad guys. The plot is really, really boring and predictable. The splatter isn't even so creepy or creative - it's NOT worth renting just to see the blood, because what's there is not interesting or original. <br /> <br /> All the "tributes" of Sam Raimi come out as a real scam, and nobody in the movie is close enough to Bruce Campbell, so you can't distract yourself with that. I think an "Evil Dead II-Dead by Dawn" poster is displayed in one scene in the hope that Sam Raimi feels flattered and doesn't consider any kind of legal action. A trained chimp could have written a better script. Whenever I hear phrases like "We're having fun ... yet?" (that not even Bride of Re-Animator managed to tear without making me jump) I begin to feel myself taking a sort of deadly weapon. The characters appear out of nowhere without explanation, wandering only to be killed. This could be fine if the movie was even fun or remotely fun, but it was all I could do to avoid fast forwarding in most of it. Fortunately I chose to pay some bills and to balance my checkbook at the same time the movie was playing. Trust me, it didn't require my full attention - I still felt like it was over 90 minutes of my life just doing it in the background. <br /> <br /> Don't watch it, no matter how tempted you are-you will hate yourself for wasting your money. Horror fans will be completely disgusted by how incompetent they are. Even those who haven't seen too many splatter movies should stay away, since there are so many movies out there that you could rent that are worth a lot more. If you want something brainless, low budget and fun, rent something else. Complete waste of time without any quality of redemption. Be smarter than you were at that moment and don't be fooled by the "Warning-Not for the faint of heart" on the box. You have been warned! <br /> <br />
