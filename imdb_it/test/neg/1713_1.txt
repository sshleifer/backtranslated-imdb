Do the following: get a copy of this movie and a friend. Bet the friend $ 10 who can't sit during the entire movie. They cannot look away or be distracted by anything. Now look at your friend. Win or lose, get $ 10 entertainment. <br /> <br /> It makes me angry until the end when people see a movie and are ready to give it 1 in 10, or summarize their thoughts with "sucks". (And when asked "Why?", They answer, "Just because." Arrgh.) That's why this movie exists. My only purpose is to say: "Here! THIS is a horrible film! THAT is 1 in 10!". <br /> <br /> This film is absolutely terrifying. <br /> <br /> the recent trend of cinema parodies has forced them to become more and more formal, this film is not up to every single aspect. It's not funny. It's not funny. And for some parodies, it's completely inaccurate! Horrible acting. Unpunished dialogue. A story without spirit. Terrible "special effects". One gag of INANE after another. And to make matters worse, there is not even free nudity that somehow makes it worth it. <br /> <br /> This movie leaps ahead of an idiot, stumbles upon a fool, and lands morally face-to-face. Even I, who loves a good movie "check the brain at the door", I found myself physically agitated watching this. This movie isn't even "terrible hard ticket to Hawaii" - it's badly hurt ... IT'S ONLY BAD. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I actually challenged a friend to look at this as described above. Not only did she not make it all the way, but she had a headache and needed a couple of minutes later because she felt a little sick. The true story. <br /> <br /> I could not emphasize this evaluation anymore ... a resounding 1 in 10!
