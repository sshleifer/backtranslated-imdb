And Wood is rolling into his grave. He could have created a hundred cult classics for the price of this hole. The worst script in memory (makes "X-Men 3" shiny like "Citizen Kane"); the most amateur director; pre-K cinematography; the most mushy "special effects" (I'm talking about the territory of the sequel to "Friday The 13th"); and launch a useless, revolting, deeply disturbed maternity sequence. The lack of any talent or sensitivity that puts this junk on the screen is staggering. The fact that "the industry" can reward anyone involved in this pool of celluloid transfers with future projects should be a cause for serious concern.
