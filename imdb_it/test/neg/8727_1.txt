This miniseries / movie was so awful sometimes that I almost broke it off. I'm a big fan of the novel, but this film suffers from multitudes of problems. The costume is poor and many of the most emotionally charged scenes are blasba. The departures from the novel are poorly chosen, the significant nuances are lost or rewritten. <br /> <br />
