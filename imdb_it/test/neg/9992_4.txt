Some describe CALIGULIA as "the" most controversial film of his era. Although this is questionable, it is certainly one of the most embarrassing: practically every big name associated with the film has made an effort to distance itself from it. The author Gore Vidal actually sued (with mixed results) to have his name removed from the film, and when the stars saw the film their reactions changed from a strong distaste to strategic silence. What they wanted, of course, was for it to go away. <br /> <br /> For a while it seemed he could. CALIGULA was a big box office and a critical flop (producer Guccione had to rent cinemas to get a screen), and although the film was published on VHS for the domestic market, so many problems of censorship were raised that it was modified, and the modified version was the only one widely available for more than a decade. But now CALIGULIA is on DVD, available both in the modified version "R" and in the original version "Unrated". And no doubt John Gielgud is glad he didn't live to see it happen. <br /> <br /> The only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say that it is something like DEEP THROAT that meets David Lynch's DUNE because of Fellini who has a bad day. Vidal's script fell into the hands of Penthouse editor Bob Guccione, who used Vidal's reputation to finance the project and attract the stars of the big name - and then threw out most of Vidal's script and brought the director to soft -porn Tinto Brass. Then, when Guccione felt that Brass's work was not explicit enough, he and Giancarlo Lui photographed the hardcore material quietly. <br /> <br /> Viewers who watch the modified version may wonder what it is, but those who look at the original cut will quickly understand that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. There is a huge amount of nudity, which remains in the modified version, but the original is complete with XXX scenes: there is a very explicit gay, lesbian and straight sex, vicious sex and a big orgy with dancing Roman guards cast for good measure. The film is also incredibly violent and bloody, with rape, torture and mutilation on the agenda. In a particularly disturbing scene, a man is slowly stabbed to death, a woman urinates on his corpse, and his genitals are cut and thrown to the dogs. <br /> <br /> In a documentary accompanying the DVD release, Guccione states that he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome. If so, he missed the mark. We know very little about Caligula - and what little we know is questionable at best. Apart from this, orgies and casual sex were not commonplace in Roman society, where adultery was a crime punishable by death. And certainly ancient Rome never resembled the strange, slightly oriental, strange settings and costumes of the space age offered by designers. <br /> <br /> The positives, those sets and these costumes are often fantastic, and although cinematography is common, at least it does them justice; the score is also very, very good. The most successful member of the cast is Helen Mirren, who manages to engage our interests and our likes like Empress Caesonia; Gielgud and O'Toole also run off in a fairly good shape. The same cannot be said for McDowell, but in justice with him he doesn't have much to work with. <br /> <br /> The film has a dark charm, but in the end it is an oddity, more interesting for its design and flat strangeness with respect to the content. Some of the bodies on display (including those by McDowell and Mirren) are extremely beautiful, and some of the sex scenes work very well like pornography ... but then again, some of them are so disgusting that they could take you to abstinence, and to the bloodthirsty and the grotesque nature of the film underestimates its eroticism. If you're up to it, it's worth seeing it once, but once it's likely to be enough. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
