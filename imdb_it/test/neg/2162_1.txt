This film was given to me by my uncle who had released him with a DVD magazine. It's easy to see why he was so eager to get rid of it. Now I understand that this is a B movie and that it doesn't have the same size budget as the bigger movies, but they could certainly spend their money in a better way than making this junk. There are some pretty good shows, namely Jack, Beth and Hawks, but others are ridiculously bad (like the killer droid). This film also contains the worst fighting scene I've ever seen. The amount of nudity in the film sometimes made him look more like a porn movie than a science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> In conclusion - Terrible film
