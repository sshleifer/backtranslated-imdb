I saw the first 15 minutes and I can say that there was no consultation with any kind of military personnel. The character of Judith Light (an officer) has her hair gathered along her shoulders! One of the first officers who greets her as she walks into the medical facility where she works is so overweight that her trouser pocket! No - there were no military advisors on this film. Even a former military enlisted may have witnessed here.
