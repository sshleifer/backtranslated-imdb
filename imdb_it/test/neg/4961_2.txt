With my two stars, I'll probably make him the head of the hated IMDb series "-list for this seemingly hugely popular TV series. <br /> <br /> Not least for the enthusiastic comments on this site, I decided to buy a DVD edition of the series, because I usually find that British humor suited me well, I gave up halfway through the second episode and, according to other comments, the "funniest" bits had already passed. <br /> <br /> So Now I know, according to another comment, that I definitely lack the sense of humor, but then I had to laugh like crazy while watching (and watching again) Fawlty Towers to which Black Books is even vaguely thematically related Why the different reactions? It could be a simple Generation Thing, yet the differences can be highlighted. <br /> <br /> Both the Fawlty Towers and the Black Books are set in companies that aim to financially support their owners .In both companies are not successful, but they seem ?? by a miracle ?? to survive. Fawlty Towers is fun because the protagonists have to deal with situations they can't cope with. The fun is that they make a serious effort to succeed and even laugh at those who feel sorry for them. Black Books has no situations, it's just there and the owner spends his time feeling sorry for himself. If a situation threatens to be born, it is quickly rejected. It is extraordinary how quickly and how often a subject is abandoned and the protagonists turn to something completely different to produce an additional joke. Tell jokes ?? and not very good - it seems to be all about black books. Why a bookstore? A hardware store would do the job just as well. <br /> <br /> No, stop, wait. It is a bookcase because under the covering of rudeness, vulgarity and arrogance the protagonists should be delicate and CULTIVATED. They are not hurried gorillas but semi-intellectual losers. Hey, it's like you and me. The way the series makes this statement is the only way I can explain its success. There is nothing extraordinary in the actions of the protagonist, what is special about them are their economically unrealistic living conditions so many viewers may envy them. That protagonist who narcissistic and insipid conveys a sense of belonging and company seems to be a mark of the time in which the First World currently lives. <br /> <br /> I recently saw Tittybangbang, also a fairly new British television comedy. I found it incredibly fun. Often it is rather tasteless or xenophobic ?? but always with a purpose and striking the bull's eye in his social criticism. Humor is mainly created by situations or characters with a purpose. The low ratings in IMDb may indicate that this mark of humor is not in keeping with the times, but I am glad that he is still alive and well and I hope he will continue to do so.
