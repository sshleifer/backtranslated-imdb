I didn't expect much from this movie, but I was eager to try something that I initially thought was primarily a teenage horror of the 1980s. Although three teenagers are a rather critical plot, it is not at all a horror film for boys. <br /> <br /> 'The Power' speaks of a small Aztec idol who exchanges many hands as its owner (who must be adult and therefore "corrupt") becomes the ship to unleash all the evil of the idol, and often with deadly implications not only for the victims of the owner, but also for the owner himself. After having made several exchanges competing for control of this thing, three teenagers end up finding him and fail to understand what it is, except that from the moment they found him, strange and dangerous things are happening. They offer to explain the situation to a journalist who does not buy into the spiritual bologna. Even if it is his producer that he wants to deepen further, especially if it means he can get control of the idol (I assume that the boys are not yet corrupt enough to feel the dangerous desires encouraged by the idol). It is a story told a thousand times, particularly in the horror and science fiction films of the fifties and sixties. <br /> <br /> This was at least, for me, able to sustain some interest. Although on a low budget, it was not done so cheaply or loaded with bad acting, like many of the low-budget horror films, real horror films of the first decades (nowadays they have the same qualities of cheese, but more budget large). We have had enough of leaving at least an opportunity to become at least a little immersed in the disturbing atmosphere and so on, despite a history of clich√©s. And, although not terribly bloody, the special effects have been done well. <br /> <br /> Again, it's a routine horror story, especially with the ending (which by modern standards has become a device that's annoyingly abused), but one that's not so embarrassingly bad. It could be worth it, even if only for the laughter.
