I did everything to get this movie, and I was lucky enough to do it on VHS. Being a big fan of Gloria Grahame, it was an excellent addition to my collection. Besides that, I can't really say much to recommend this image. The plot is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is Sterling Hayden's vision in the deepest trouble with his own department. Mrs. Grahame is always fun to watch (if you like it, like I do), but the dubbing of her singing hurts this image a lot. Work on a dive, then let him use his own voice. It can only lend to the atmosphere. I must agree with a previous reviewer; the final borrows heavily from THE BIG HEAT. To the point of belittling the ending. I've seen worse movies with Mrs. Grahame (MACAO), but I'll never get the chance to see it on screen. If you have a movie night and you're looking for a second feature film, this is your movie. Enjoy the photo.
