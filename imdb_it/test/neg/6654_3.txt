Well, the plot is fun but it's full of goofs. To summarize things, policeman / dad wants to badly save his son from cancer, but the only way is to get the transplant from the criminal (Michael Keaton). <br /> <br /> Ben criminal agrees, BUT he fled to the hospital the transplant was happening and the police and policeman were not allowed to shoot the criminal to save his son. (criminal dead - no dead transplant child). <br /> <br /> Well, the police in this film don't have a brain, in case they've never heard of a TAZER to kill the criminal without killing him. end of the film, as simple as that. <br /> <br /> But when all the fools and the stupid ones including the death of 2cops and some doctors burned very badly.
