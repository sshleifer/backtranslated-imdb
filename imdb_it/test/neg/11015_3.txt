Humor is a very individual thing and the Wog Boy preview audience seemed to enjoy it more than I did. I found it an anachronistic affair, more representative of the old racial humor of the Australian cinema of the 60s and 70s. The boy meets the plot of the girl never takes off due to a lack of chemistry between Lucy Bell and Nick Giannopoulos while finding thin laughter on the ground. If you want to spend your money on this, wait until it's on video.
