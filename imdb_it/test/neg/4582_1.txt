Greyfriars Bobby was NOT a westie - Bobby was a skye terrier. A highlight of my childhood day trips to Edinburgh was to go to the monument to Bobby. I grew up with the story of the valiant and faithful little dog, like every child of my generation, and I remember to line up with my mother outside the cinema - with many, many other children from Dundee and their mothers - to see the wonderful Disney movie . How is it possible that a film based on such a wonderful story was made using a Westie, for heaven's sake. It's like making a film about the life of Robert Burns, for example, and portraying him as an Englishman. I say, give Bobby his race!
