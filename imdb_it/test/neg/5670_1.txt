I ... No word. No word can describe it. I will try for the sake of those brave few who put knives in their toasters ... after seeing this show. <br /> <br /> This ... Cosgrove person ... His acting is like watching a gorilla female dancing on the nest of very agitated insects. Perhaps I exaggerate. However, I have the feeling that the description fits a normal day of writing this show. <br /> <br /> The characters of this repulsive heap of raw sewer are useless as a small piece of space rock that flies towards the sun on any day of the week. Even if heart attacks were not experienced while watching them behave like fools in cheaply constructed sets, I have no doubt that it will happen eventually. <br /> <br /> The main plot of this * noises in the faces of the actors * is that of a crazy girl who hosts a live live webcast on iCarly.com with a creative title with her mindless friends, one of the which owns equipment that the producers of this show probably couldn't afford. His legal guardian is a kind of moron apparently his older brother. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this whole show for fear of developing cancer, or maybe a cold, but some of the plot points I have seen the brother get stuck in an elevator, the apartment doorman almost dead and the fattest priest in the world who comes to visit. No, really. <br /> <br /> Avoid this if you have more than one age not yet born or if you have a history of joining mysterious cults due to mental trauma. If you decide to watch it, laugh when it tells you the trail of laughter, as this will drown out the repetitive noise that will eventually get you into a coma if you listen to it too long. <br /> <br /> The show receives a star rating because the IMDb inexplicably has not adopted the use of negative numbers.
