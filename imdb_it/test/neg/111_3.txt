This low-cost, grainy Italian film is about a couple of heirs of a manor in the Italian countryside heading to the house to stay, and then they find themselves being killed by the ghosts of the people killed in that house. <br /> <br /> I was not impressed by this. It wasn't exactly that scary, especially as a cheap Italian movie should be. A girl, her two cousins ​​and a cousin's girlfriend, go to this huge house for some reason (I couldn't understand why) and they stay there, cleaning and checking the place. The characters come in and out of the movie, and it's pretty boring in the points, and most of the deaths are rather rushed. The girl is hit by a car while fleeing home after dreaming of her death, and the scene is pretty good, but then things slow down, until a confusing end, when male cousins ​​are killed together in a strange way , and this weird guy (I couldn't understand who he was during the movie, or maybe I don't remember) follows this girl alone, attacking her, until finally this other girl kills him. I hate giving away the ending, but oh well. The cousin decides to stay at home and watch over it, and show scenes of her life there years later. The end. You really don't miss anything, and anyway, you probably won't find it anywhere, so you're lucky.
