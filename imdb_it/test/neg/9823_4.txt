Hellboy revolves around the classic plots of comics / actions / superheroes. Essentially Hellboy is a kind of demon that has found its way onto the earth. He is raised by a child by a priest and within a government society and has chosen to protect the earth's people from the supernatural, rather than being a threat (the normal career path for a demon). <br /> <br /> Setting the story involves creative uses of history, combining Nazi experiments with the occult. It is absurd, but so is the idea of ​​a demon wandering the streets. I find the explanations of the characters, who they are and how they were managed very well. The sequences are at the point and very funny. In reality, opening is the best part of the film, which is the problem. <br /> <br /> Essentially Del Toro, who writes and directs this piece, bottles it. The film is absent from any tension or from any major conflict. Hellboy is essentially said to be invincible in the first act and therefore the rest of the film includes scenes in which each conflict is automatically rather gross because we inevitably know that Hellboy will be OK and the bad guy will die. I hear you cry that this is the case with any action / hero movie. Well yes, it is, but once we're involved in a good action movie we can't help but feel the hero die. Die Hard works because John Mclane seems destined to die in all its parts. Escapes death with the thinnest margins. The stakes have increased as even his wife is in danger etc etc ?? Terminator and Terminator work twice because in both cases the villain is far superior to the hero. The threat and tension are constant. <br /> <br /> Some of the other main weaknesses are: Del Toro is also guilty of using deus ex machina. The characters generally disappear and reappear as their skills are needed within the story. The villain is described in perhaps three scenes. He has no reason. It occurs unexpectedly and inexplicably. In the one scene where Hellboy seems to stand against a real threat (groups of monsters) a character frees his abilities - the screen fades to white and inexplicably the monsters are dead but everyone else lives. A minor character established in an irritating and underdeveloped love story becomes the key to the conclusion of the film. His character is so thin, the relationship so underdeveloped. It is clear that she is nothing but a sort of prop to push the plot and make everything more logical. I don't want to ruin the end of the film, but essentially a character who died is miraculously and incredibly brought back to life. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from poor dialogues and liners that are not smart or funny. After a while, everything starts to grate. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Del Toro makes action scenes explode with some uninspired images. And anyone who has made the creative decision to turn Hellboy's primary weapon into a gun instead of his clunking arm should be fired. Essentially the use of the gun weakens the concept of the film, degrading the fighting to nothing but a shootout on one side <br /> <br /> The few positive aspects include: Cinematography is very good. At all times a sense of humor is established by the dark lighting and the palette of darker colors. As well as the use of interesting places. Yet maybe it's all a bit equally. <br /> <br /> The use of cgi and Fx is well done. We never get overloaded. When the effects are used they are used well and the sense of realism is maintained. Rather similar to how Nolan used FX in Batman. I much prefer this method to the overtop effects we often see. <br /> <br /> All in all this is a rather poor movie. The real pity is that (despite not having read the comics) I found that the film wasted a lot of potential. Hellboy as a character has a lot of seemingly instantaneous fascinating dimensions that are completely unexplored. The film has a capacity to look, in the sense that if it comes on TV and there is nothing else on it it might be worth seeing. But in any other situation I wouldn't worry about doing it.
