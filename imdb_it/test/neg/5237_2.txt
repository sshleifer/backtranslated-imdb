Christophe Lambert once said that he was still making films just to make good and easy money. When I see his latest releases, I can believe it. <br /> <br /> Beowulf is, all things considered, in the "good" part of the shit movies: there are some thrilling scenes, indeed. The actors themselves are not bad. But the plot is stupid, the music of "Mortal Kombat" has nothing to do here, the ending is really s **** ... <br /> <br /> Actually, the only positive thing is that my friends and I could laugh at how uninteresting it was. I also hope I wasted my money on something else. <br /> <br />
