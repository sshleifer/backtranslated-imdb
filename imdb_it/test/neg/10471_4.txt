.... OK, small town, clueless sheriff? Check. The sheriff's hot daughter? Check? Boyfriend boyfriend of the sheriff's hot daughter, who hates the sheriff? Check. The corporate land developer who earns people greedily? Check. The developer file randomly triggered a primordial monster, so was he forced to cover it? Check. Native warning of mass death and destruction if things are not returned as they were? Check. CGI amateur special effects that could have been produced by a Commodore 64 computer? Check. Seriously, practically all the clich√©s of your typical original science fiction movie have been incorporated into a classic movie, so bad to see. The only one missing is the scientist / expert who tries to communicate his knowledge; there is a paleontologist with three students who ambushed The Bone Eater soon enough in the film, but they are basically extras in the film. And I can honestly say that I have foreseen practically all this; up to who survives and who doesn't (although I have to say that I got the real time of death of one of the wrong characters of about an hour). I swear I could have made this movie by myself if they had given me all the characters. In spite of everything, the movie is fun to watch, if only to play with your friends with MST3K. If you want an unreasonable entertainment, it's a fantastic movie to watch, and that's why I give this film a surprisingly respectable 4, even if in effect it deserves a much lower score. But again, don't tune into an original SciFi movie if you were looking for a movie with a real storyline, concrete characters or good special effects, right?
