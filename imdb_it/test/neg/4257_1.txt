Good photography, good acting good direction ... cannot justify a story that is not and cannot be acceptable for any company. Amitabh has often used the media to make junk sales possible by saying that - if an accident happens ... then what? I would like to ask him if such a thing happens to your son or grandson (for example a child) then what will you do? I think every parent will have to pay special attention before interacting with any neighbor of 60 years if he has one - jia - with you. Such films should be banned and discouraged otherwise more Nithari cases are inspired. Such acts are evil and criminals in films are punished ... which should be the moral of the story and not glorify their act or them.
