This film begins with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward, with two attendants participating. The unconscious main character is heard in a low voice, saying that the attendants are gay. Orders kiss. I saw this in a DVD version and I suspect this should be fun ?? he said "comedy" on the DVD, after all, it goes on like this. If I had seen this in a movie theater, I probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter, why is it so funny ?? and why they should sit in a comedy, while it is fascinating to think about what is funny and what is not, this film unfortunately only provides arguments about what is not. <br /> <br /> Bright brains can DO Something fun, people like Ernst Lubitsch, Billy Wilder or Mel Brooks have proven this, but you have to know the "mechanics", I suppose. The director and screenwriter Dani Levy doesn't care about those mechanisms, she thinks that some things are just funny, the fact that two assistants are gay and they kiss for a man in a coma, for example. Don't get me wrong, some people can make it so funny, Dani Levy can't, not for me, anyway. <br /> <br /> The main problem I have with this movie is that I can't see a reason behind the way the main characters behave. I could not understand why the two brothers, an orthodox Jew from western Germany, a third-class carbon copy of Fast Eddie Felson from the former East Germany, did not feel so uncomfortable. They are both rather bland characters. Their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other (well, one is a lesbian now but he raises the daughter he has with his cousin). But even these incestuous relationships ?? if anything, they are embarrassing - it's just an excuse because the writers couldn't come up with anything better. <br /> <br /> Acting is not bad, Udo Semel actually liked it a lot although he remembered more than former Chancellor Helmut Kohl (a lighter version) than a venerable Orthodox Jew. The direction itself is not so bad, but maybe Levy should just direct films, leaving the script to someone else. Now I heard he did a comedy about Hitler. Oi, go!
