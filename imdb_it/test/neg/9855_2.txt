Looking at Enterprise for the first time, as we all no doubt do with all the shows, I entered with an open mind, enjoying about half of Star Trek's past efforts and not loving the other half. <br /> <br /> The company failed, but this episode "Night in the infirmary" made me seriously doubt why I bothered to play the Monday night shows on Sci Fi. <br /> <br /> Masking some ideas that are one of those A The episodes of Day In The Life, in which we learn what makes certain characters work like humanoids, the writers seemed to forget that this had to be a starship, not the Ricardoes and the Mertzes. <br /> <br /> A planet, especially one whose people had previously been offended by the crew of the Enterprise (to eat in public), was not a place for a dog. As an animal lover, I would never have brought one of my pets into an environment that in the past had proven to be tense. <br /> <br /> But what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem with all of these ST shows, which consistently depict sacred and offensive things to other cultures, as if they were offering some inspiration to the American religious zealots. <br /> <br /> The aliens were now offended when the dog was urinating on a sacred tree and yet the aliens were quite capable of getting the dog to urinate as an insult. Strange how the dog's urine was not considered a form of worship. I wonder how it was obtained by the writers of the show. <br /> <br /> From there, we are subjected to a captain who has been misled by his duties. In looking at the episode, I found it very easy to forget that Bakula should have been the captain of the ship. <br /> <br /> He chose to sleep in the infirmary and from there we are given other inanities of behavior (sigh) that we should not understand and this makes us frown. <br /> <br /> The doctor does not accidentally cut his long and hairy nails and feeds them with hungry caged animals. Ewwwwww! Then a white bat creature escapes. <br /> <br /> Oh, how someone is supposed to sleep with all this! Cutting the toenail, for crying out loud! I was waiting for something that feeds on vomit to be presented. <br /> <br /> Then we were inexplicably given the idea that the captain was in love with T'pol, and that perhaps he was masking those feelings with his concern over the dog. <br /> <br /> unlimited amounts of garbage. <br /> <br /> "your dog is sick, so go have sex. You will feel better." And, of course, the captain had to apologize and we humans had to consider his excuses as completely ridiculous, because we are like this (everyone smiles very sarcastically) with a narrow mindset! He saw performances like this endlessly buzzed on TNG. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the only thing missing from this terrible episode was that the Trip person who offered his smiles and his proverbs, Bakula seemed to cover all this with the silly dog. <br /> <br /> Oh, the dog survived, so now go play and pick up.
