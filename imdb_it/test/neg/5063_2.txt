Clossius states that "Baltic Storm" is banned in Sweden. It's incorrect! Instead you can buy the film almost anywhere, like at petrol stations, in shopping centers, the internet (of course) and so on. Often at a very low price because this film is so BAD and nobody wants to see it, despite all the tricks to keep the interest alive. The film appeals only to conspiracy theorists, psychopaths and other people living in la-la-land and to those who "know the truth". <br /> <br /> Working in a museum with the disaster of Estonia as a theme I met them all! I have heard of every theory that exists such as cocaine smuggling, arms smuggling, biological warfare, nuclear smuggling, red mercury, aliens, Russian, American, Estonian, Swedish and Finnish intelligence, often in combinations different. <br /> <br /> Some normal people asked why we don't show the movie? A question asked only by them that they have not seen this terrible film without meaning. <br /> <br /> Once again, "Baltic Storm" is not prohibited in Sweden. He has fun qualities, but what the hell is Donald Sutherland doing in this movie?
