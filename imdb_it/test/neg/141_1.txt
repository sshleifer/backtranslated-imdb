Her small part as a masseuse, in the filthy sequel of the original 'Emmannuelle', evidently gave someone the bright idea to put a wrench in the work of the gambit of the French soft-core series by reversing the Caucasian carnality and driving away the Gemser stunner in a starring role in this, the rather tame first in a series of sex plushers that has become increasingly depraved as more sleazier directors have started sequels in a single name. <br /> <br /> Someone (and certainly not the English over-haerers Warner?) was also anticipating an "A Star Is Born" type that raised the results, judging by the way the actress is credited simply with the eponymous moniker of heroin on the screen, although with a couple of consonants sacrificed as insurance against litigation. <br /> <br /> The assignment of Gemser in the series saw her as an "intrepid" photographer, obviously allowing all sorts of subsequent adventures. But, although she may have been one of the most beautiful actresses on the screen at the time, any theatrical talent that might have been there to discern becomes bogged down in the same kind of cogitation in an unpleasantly easy way ("I must confess that since I have been in Africa, I find the white skin less attractive ... ") which was found in French films. <br /> <br /> And in this particular entrance, to the great consternation of the waterproof brigade the essence of carnality on the screen is as present in childish symbolism (pumping of engine pistons!) as in prosaic couplings - although of course these include generous "exploratory" lesbian dolls. The connoiseurs of kitsch are however guaranteed by a continuous flow of aural delights, which with such epithets of ethnographic wisdom as "I do nothing to be a perfect black, she does everything to be a perfect white".
