The film's title makes it look like porn but it's not even a sexual comedy. Instead, Hot Summer in Barefoot County talks about an official sent from a southern state to a small town to locate and arrest machine guns. But the moonshine comes from the farm of an old woman with three beautiful daughters. Hardly anyone can guess what will happen next, but strangely, the film is very gentle. It hardly qualifies even for a PG assessment. Moreover, the reduced budget is evident in almost every shot and the acting is tremendously amateur. This film was probably intended for the drive-in audience, but it is unlikely to have met them, even in 1974.
