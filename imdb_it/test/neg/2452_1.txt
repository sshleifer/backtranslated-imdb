When I think of TV movies, I always think of this film, I saw it a few times on Sky Movies, it was terrible. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I saw this movie, I was just browsing, and I found it here: -S. <br /> <br /> A microbiologist (Linda Flemming), goes on vacation, with his son (William Flemming), in this vacation spot a little with Paul Johnson (taxi driver / bar owner?), and Kathy Johnson. <br /> <br /> It's a strange romantic thing, William starts falling in love with Kathy and Paul falls in love with Linda. <br /> <br /> A guy passes in a street, has some marks on his arm, Joseph (Joseph was a deep-water diver, who in some dive, saw a light, or something like that, and converted to religion), says you take care of this person, there is a gap in my memory, then there is a large interruption of the virus, I think Linda offers you her help, to find a cure, Kathy gets infected (William note a sign on Kathy's arm), with the virus, Joseph also does. <br /> <br /> Paul says a few lines to Joseph, then Joseph staggers away, the next time you see Joseph, he's healed a bit like, that information is used to treat the infected, then there's a party on the beach at the end.
