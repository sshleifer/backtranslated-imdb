Too bad these guys, the so-called judges, are such idiots, even those nominally "sensitive". It is the tone of self-satisfaction that really makes me sick; these kids have no perspective on their behavior. I think the real problem, however, is the quality of the competitors. Not a smooth single or really fascinating in the lot. They gather the most pathetic girls from the crowd because they are the only ones these guys have a chance with. We see some real players looking for a really unattainable girl, and maybe you have a show. Otherwise, you have a disgusting half-hour of self-respect. And real sexual tension takes two.
