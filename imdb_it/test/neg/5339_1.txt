I've been watching a lot of Asian horror movies lately, but this has to be the worst so far. It started off quite interestingly, but lost momentum after the first 15 minutes of the film. The "dramatic" scenes added, flashback sequences and serious holes in the plot have left me hanging. What really happened in the tunnel? Only "something terrible" ??? Who started all the killings if it wasn't the ghost? What did you want her to return ????? No reply! Overall, it's not scary at all and filmmakers need much better ideas than this ... <br /> <br /> One positive was the beautiful actress, but that's all. <br /> Not recommended.
