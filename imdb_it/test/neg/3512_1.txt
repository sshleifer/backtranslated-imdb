This film was horrible and eventually made me wonder why someone bothered to do it. Now it was not bad, I studied film and this film was put together very well and had a great kinematics all with interesting angles for a very beautiful lighting and an excellent photographic work. I wish I had seen him at school because he would have made a good film on which to write an article. BUT ........ Since I graduated and lost most of my cinematic pretentiousness, I realized that a movie should be fun especially, this film was long and boring and I'm not sure I finally reached the indicates that it was worth my time. <br /> <br />
