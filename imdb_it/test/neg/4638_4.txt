The First World War obtained a shiny sepia-colored remake in the constant and extravagant "A Very Long Engagement" by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Jeunet's trademark style consists of a mechanical narrative construction almost similar to a clock, garnished with sumptuous values ​​of production of chocolate boxes and seasoned with fake-naive humor. It is an approach that has worked very well with his previous photo, the romantic fantasy "Amelie", thanks in no small part to the incomparable contribution of Audrey Tatou in the title role. Applied to a much darker material, Jeunet's method turns back rather badly. <br /> <br /> Tatou returns to resent here in a variation of the same kind of softly off-beat character from Amelie. It is Mathilde, an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural setting, determined to track down what became her beloved child Manech (Gaspard Ulliel), some years after he disappeared during the war. Manech was one of five soldiers subjected to court martial for self-mutilation in 1917 at "Bingo Crepuscule", and sent as a punishment on top of no-man's land. He is presumably dead by all but Mathilde who has the hope of finding him. The film follows Mathilde's passionate quest to find out what really happened, and as she digs deeper she finds a sad, even shocking story of high-ranking corruption and inhumanity. Mathilde must filter the facts from the fictions that derive from various contrasting, overlapping or incomplete accounts of what appear to be the last hours of Manech. <br /> <br /> All this should be moving and compelling, but is more often simply confused, thanks to the visual and verbal confusion with which Jeunet hits its audience. There is simply too much going on at any time, including an intrusive narrative that does not add anything exactly to our appreciation for the story and the characters. Without a moment's respite from the information overload, I felt denied the space to reflect on Mathilde's research or on the room in which to engage with my conditions. The cameras and the gyrations of the Jeunet camera multiply incessantly, caressing every surface contour of its exquisitely designed production, but individually it cannot penetrate the soul under the skin of history. The result is profoundly inconsistent and, worse, grotesque. World War I was a particularly dark hour in human history. Imagine being recreated as one of those picturesque spots for a famous Belgian lager, and you have the size of this movie.
