Unimaginable he starts in Los Angeles with Jim (Roger Cline) and his wife Alice Fhelleps (Tamera Noll) discussing while driving in the pouring rain, unfortunately Jim crashes the car and his daughter Heather (Leigh Silver) ends up dead while Alice is turned into a wheelchair bound vegetables. Devastated by the death of his daughter, Jim starts to visit prostitutes, then kills them because of the voices in his head. Um, that's right. <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Chad Ferrin, hate Inexpressible as a movie. There are some movies that sometimes you see the "goal post" move with regards to everything you look at from then on, some movies are so brilliant that everyone else will be judged by it while others like Inexpressible, for example, are so bad from a new cinematic minimum. This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I'm seriously surprised by the broadly positive comments on IMDb, although the low overall score on the main page doesn't surprise me, I'm not sure I missed something but to start with, Unspeakable has no storyline , it has no history and many seem almost random. There was nothing invisible to maintain my interest or entertain and as a result it became a resistance test to get to the end. The film tries to be shocking with some soft scenes of sexual abuse of a boy rented by a priest, there is a scene where a disabled person slaps himself, crashes to the floor and his male nurse doubts he starts to feel dirty genitals, legs & underwear. If someone can find such a funny shit then I'll cut my wrists now, the characters are among the worst I've had the misfortune to know, the dialogue is hilariously bad with someone who seems to come straight out of some filthy porn fagot of the worst kind. It doesn't work like a horror as it is not scary at all, it is absolutely amusing and frankly insulting to say that it is trying to be a serious drama about someone who is suffering a great loss and is trying to deal with it and on the whole I think it's just a useless, lousy , poorly made piece of Troma shit. <br /> <br /> Director Ferrin films as a poorly made documentary, the special effects are terrible and are of 'let's pour ketchup on the face of our actor & the public will be convinced that a variety of bloody death has died, not there is no graphic violence apart from a suicide in which someone sticks a knife in his mouth. Considering the amount of prostitutes in Unspeakable the nudity levels are reduced to a minimum ... <br /> <br /> Apparently inexpressible has a budget of around $ 20,000 and all I can say is where did all the money go? Oh, a short note for directors, if you're recording live sound make sure you don't have your actor able to deliver their lines next to a main road that seems to be driving in the middle of Los Angeles ... Acting sucks, period. <br /> <br /> The unspeakable is, in my opinion, a total crap. Probably not the worst I've ever seen but it's right underneath and I can't remember seeing such a terrible movie recently. One to avoid unless he is a masochist or an insomniac.
