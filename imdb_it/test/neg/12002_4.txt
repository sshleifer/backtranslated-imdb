I couldn't help but watch the time every 5 or 10 minutes because I found this film a total resistance. Childish humor, economic-looking sets, economic-looking effects, a plot that makes Legally blonde look like "The Usual Suspects" and many coincidences that I can now officially say that Robert Rodriguez has undergone brain surgery for some part after 1996. The only thing he left as his brand are some fantastic moves, but that's where it ends. OK, so the guy decided to do something new to change, a spy movie for kids. Well, if I was 12, I'd feel insulted. The best thing about this movie is the incredible Carla Gugino who stole every scene she was in. Unfortunately there were not many. 4/10
