I recently went to the movies to see the new version (2007) of Bridge to Teribithia. Later, I went to the library to rent the previous version to see it again without paying again. I must say that I was extremely disappointed! I found the older version to have horrible acting and sad lines, including Jessie who said, "I know Daddy, but it hurts me a lot" after Leslie dies. It was done pretty horribly and the casting wasn't much better in my opinion. I watched with amazement all the time I said I didn't wonder if they had done it again. The story is great, but trust me, spend the money and see the new version, if you see the old one you may never experience the real magic of Teribithia.
