I can't believe this movie has the rating that is here on IMDb. Of course, I came to the conclusion that IMDb is somehow useless to find out if a movie is good or not, given that 99% of films are rated between 6 and 7. It's the conclusion and failure of crowd-sourcing on the Internet. For this purpose, an average of most people is taken, and unfortunately most people are simple idiots who easily enjoy fast food. But I digress. The film. I really don't want to waste my time writing about it. Let's say that I found that it was tailor-made for apparently two groups of people, young adolescents, at the time when violent action films of any kind simply hit the spot, and goth guys who simply love to stifle any gothic fantasy of vampires who can get their hands on. If you are not in one of these categories, you will find this film absurd. I liked the first Underworld. At the time it was cool and had an angular quality. The second was a bit of a try in the plot, but sometimes I liked the direction and the cinematography. But this whole movie looked like a production of a science fiction channel or even a TV series. I found the actors too direct. Their body language stiffened into unnatural idealistic poses that seemed artificial. The lines were spit out as if the young actors spilled Shakespeare's lines, enjoying their own selfish glory of being in such a role, but doing so, roughly ruminating the role. The plot was dry and predictable from the start. I found myself wishing things would just "move" because it was so easy to tell what was going to happen. At first I tried to worry, but my brain was forced to go out. Towards the final apex, I really fell asleep. There were so many parts that were inconsistent and it made no sense to even list them all. If you are a teenager with a pimple face or a chronic goth, of course, try it. For the rest of us, forget it, as I am going to do now.
