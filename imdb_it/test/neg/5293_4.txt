Travolta, Thurman, The Rock, Vaughn, Keitel and so on. One should think that this parade of great actors could really warm up this film, but no. Travolta again takes on the role of Chili Palmer, but this time we have already seen the gangster who seeks fortune in the difficult world of cinema, it is no longer fun. This is a typical Hollywood problem, they think that if the first was good, the second would double the double, NO, the first was original, the second could not be, Hey Hollywood tries to understand originality cannot be duplicated, you have to give us a new twist, not just the same movie made again with a bigger budget. I constantly found myself laughing with difficulty when watching this film, but I had a lot of fantastic actors like Harvey Keitel, James Woods, Vince Vaughn and The Rock and for that and only that! <br /> <br /> 4/10
