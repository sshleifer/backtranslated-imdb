So let's say you are a producer, you have some money, and somehow you have the equipment of Richard and Bruce Willis, so now all you need is a script ... but, why bother? you see, this movie is really terrible, the acting is pretty good, but the cast is a horrible march and Willis did his best to play these characters that they simply can't play. now, this film has no plot, or rather, there is something it tries to pass on as a plot: there is a bad man (Willis) who is cool dangerous and sophisticated (in reality it is none of those things, but for some dialogue between the other characters, you should have this impression), so this killer is on a mission to kill someone, now there is an ex IRA prisoner who is kind, nice and very nice (gear) that the FBI released from the so prison will help them. so now the FBI is "investigating" to find this killer, the investigation consists of a series of unlikely information - how a random person lost his wallet and someone used his name to buy a car - which is always right in the money. since there is no real plot and the script is so lousy, you can't expect any real development or tension, so instead of creating them through history, they simply add some disconnected dramatic music, which tells you that something very dramatic is going on, instead of creating something dramatic .. <br /> <br /> the bottom line is that this is a very bad movie, and a complete waste of time that somehow got an incredibly high score for his level, probably because of the cast - and that's exactly what the producers count on.
