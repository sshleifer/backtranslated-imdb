This film was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This film goes on and on and I almost turned it off, but I gave it a shot. I didn't expect anything exceptional, but I expected more than that. Good thing I work in a video store and I saw it for free, because I wouldn't have spent a penny in this movie. I gave this movie a 2, just because I saw worse. If you were able to stay away from this, far away.
