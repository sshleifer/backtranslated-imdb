It is very sad to see someone like George C Scott in a low-budget thriller that would have been better if the original novel had been written by Graham Greene and directed by someone a little more experienced in the genre. DO NOT MENTION A BETTER CINEMATOGRAPHIC. There are so many missed opportunities with the scenery and the carnival simply glided over, rather than captured to locate the film solidly in the exotic setting of the novel. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere in the visitor's comments on this site, a very astute observer complained about the variety of devilishly bad accents in this film. Since I saw George C Scott as Rochester in Jane Eyre, I prayed for him never to accept a role that required him to take on a British accent. Only from time to time could he possibly pass for a British or a South African with a very British sound, obviously played by an American actor. I can sweeten the extraordinarily hard-working accents of Meryl Streep (both English and Australian) - at least she manages to do it well even though with every expression, she demands that we marvel at her abilities. Well, I'm sorry that Mr. Scott is not Meryl Streep, and he only destroys the illusion - as if Michael Yeoh spoke an unbearable mandarin with a strong Singaporean accent in Crouching Tiger, etc. <br /> <br /> Peterson does not act differently from what we see on CSI. Except he is still very handsome and more or less skinny in this movie. He is the Harrison Ford of TV. The same old expressions for every emotion, every situation. Don't think twice, Ford has two - perplexed / pained and happy. I've never seen a smile on Mr. CSI!
