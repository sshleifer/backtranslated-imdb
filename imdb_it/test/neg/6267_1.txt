I normally finish every movie or book I start, even if I'm poor, just because I hate giving up on them. He was so badly done, I was incredulous. <br /> <br /> I'm not just looking for Spielberg's magic - I entrust foreign films, and very old science fiction rentals (the most recent Soylent Green - worth the rent). I like both the Hollywood action and the slower development of moving characters. Different films must be approached differently to be appreciated. I could not find any saving element for this ... The action was so wooden that I was not in the least offensive. The development of the character was practically absent: you did not feel sorry for anyone, or even identify yourself with them. Finally, there were so many pieces that were not added. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time - better watch the dry paint ...
