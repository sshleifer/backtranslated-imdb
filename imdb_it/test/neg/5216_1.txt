This is another of those fundamentalist Christian films that hit you in the head with religion like a hammer. You know you're in trouble when the story configuration is completely ridiculous. Three men are flying to Mexico to deliver Bibles. This makes no sense since the church is Protestant and most Mexicans are Catholic. Protestant and Catholic Bibles are not the same thing. The Catholic bible contains books that are not in the Protestant Bible. I also find it hard to believe that churches in Mexico do not distribute bibles to them. I can understand if they were going to a place where Christianity is in the minority. But Mexico is far-fetched. If you can't believe the development of a story, then not even the rest of the story. A film about religion can be fun, but not this movie.
