I imagine my biggest mistake was to watch this remake of the '95 "Piranha" with the original '78 by Joe Dante. I did the same last week with "The Omen". Strangely, looking at the remake immediately after the original '76, I really appreciated the 2006 version quite a lot for various reasons. <br /> <br /> But this kind of approach failed on the 1995 Piranha version. It has reinforced the fact that it is really a minor image. Basically, the '95 version is more or less exactly the same film, as it tells the same story and follows it practically a scene by scene (only the character of Barabara Steele and the military intervention were written). But cinematography was not good. Even the acting was worse. Especially Alexandra Paul (playing the character of Heather Menzies) showed me again what a horrible actress she is. Bradford Dillman (from the '78 version) had his own way of playing Charlton Heston, which was fun, while in the '95 version William Katt does a good job of being William Katt. So I didn't care for him, really. But the whole cast is practically inferior and the only useful event was to discover James Karen ("Return of the living dead", parts 1 and 2) in a cameo. John Carl Buechler's makeup effects are not as accurate as those of Rob Bottin. The musical score had a certain sound, but the soundtrack of Pino Donaggio was much more memorable in the original. So all these shortcomings have really awakened the fact that they have just reviewed the original as part of this double bill. <br /> <br /> Given that the Scott P. Levy remake follows Dante's original, I imagine it is fun enough to sit on, even if the spirit of Dante's original is missing. But what really made me dislike Levy's version is the fact that a lot of footage from the first movie was reused during piranha attack scenes. I never like it when directors do this (and I'm not talking about using flashback movies or other good reasons). I mean, if you don't have the budget (or imagination) to invent newly filmed material, then for Pete's sake, don't do a fucking remake. But Roger Corman produced this remake (cheaper), so I think I shouldn't be so surprised by the re-use of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch "Piranha", make sure it's been a while since you've seen the original. You could enjoy this remake a little more then. And oh yes, that little cool-stop creature from the original is nowhere to be found in this film, as can be expected. But what is worse, even in this there is no female nudity (the original really had some titty shots, and that blonde girl from the opening scene also accidentally pulled her underwear a little too much towards the low when he removed his jeans!). The figures, like this '95 version, were made for TV.
