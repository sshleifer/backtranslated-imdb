This film is none other than Christian propaganda. It started as a good science fiction movie and then worked with a syrupy sweet Christian theme in history that has nothing to do. I had to turn it off halfway because I felt I had to rent it. The Catholic Church has officially announced that the aliens do NOT contradict faith in God. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit funny despite this, but the dialogue is incredible, writing and acting are mostly garbage and all in all, this film is mostly a skunk to avoid. <br /> <br /> There was obviously some research on the phenomenon by the filmmakers, but then we immediately realize that it is only for the purpose of unmasking and injecting their own paranoid religious opinions into a valid interesting topic. If you are a zealous religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels, you will love this movie.
