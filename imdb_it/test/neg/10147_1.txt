Now I've seen it all. Just when I thought it couldn't become more pathetic and mischievous than "Woodchipper Massacre", just when I thought that dialogue and acting couldn't get worse than "Nail Gun Massacre", just when I thought "Don't go to The Woods" will keep the title of Lousiest Slasher Film Ever, and "THE LAST SLUMBER PARTY!" will arrive! Somehow, this cheap and miserable dung succeeds in avoiding indecency, but it remains terrible! I couldn't believe my eyes - for once I can't complain about excessive (or, in this case, no) nakedness in a slasher film, but it still managed to make me crimson for being embarrassed about having rented it. Never before have I seen such horrible acting, dialect, direction, writing ... I could go on and on with this list! Here is a brief run-down: <br /> <br /> A mentally ill somehow escapes from the asylum, dresses like a surgeon, somehow discovers where his doctor lives and bursts in while the doctor's daughter is having friends for the night. Then begins the most stupid series of murders (torn away from other films like "Slumber Party Massacre" and Halloween) this side of the universe. The characters have negative IQs, which suggests they are not human, not, since they have the tendency to bleed Kool-Aid when they are cut, as the slasher likes to show when he uses his scapel to the camera in WAY too many scenes. It is only 80 minutes ... how many times we have to look at that scapel like that before it consumes the whole movie? ... which I suppose wouldn't be so bad in this case! There is a moment when I thought that maybe, just maybe, the director would make it interesting (a second killer was added), but alas It didn't have to be! And then, to further insult, there is a stupid super-cop subtitle and a final conclusion even more stupid, it makes a lot of sense, but I'd hate to give away those most stupid scenes in the history of cinema to those two or three crazy women (like me) abbast anza stupid to rent this sewage. <br /> <br /> I really hope that by writing this, I have saved 80 minutes of someone's life. I put myself on my hands and knees to ask anyone who is still thinking of renting this: PLEASE, PLEASE, DON'T PLEASE! This is a fan of the slasher genre he talks about; I know what's good for you! The only real victims in this absurd and asinine nonsense are the poor idiots who have passed through the entire tank of the toilet! The Zanatos score ... since there is no negative point scale, I have to give it a 1, but a value lower than the average of 1 at that. Avoid it at all costs .... please !!!!
