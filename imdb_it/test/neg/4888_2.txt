There is no shortage of female meats but they are still not interesting! Lenzi is at least able to reach a peak with Spasm and start with Kiss Me Kill Me <br /> <br /> The DVD version of Hard Gore R2 could be cut to 86 minutes, but this film contains an act of cannibalism and a victim - a scene with a native girl who is brutalized and gutted by the cannibal tribe we were warned about and who later set fire to huts. Arsonist holocaust? Firestarter Fernox anyone? <br /> <br /> Certainly not a cannibal movie but has there ever been a decent one? To avoid.
