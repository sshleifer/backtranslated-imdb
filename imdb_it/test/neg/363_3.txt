Planet Earth has suffered a terrible environmental disaster, so humanity now survives the underground division into several religious cults. What caused the disaster? I have no idea ? why is humanity divided into different ecclesiastical factions? I have no idea . Since the surface of the Earth can no longer sustain human life, how are humans able to cultivate crops to feed the population? I have no idea . What kind of producer did he think this script deserved to receive funding? I have no idea <br /> <br /> SHEPHERD is one of these films that creeps in late at night on cable channels. The type of movie in which you consult the IMBb to see if it has any value. The number of people who have commented on SHEPHERD on this page has not yet reached double figures and this is a film that was released nine years ago. Perhaps the people who have never seen it are the lucky ones? <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the plot it is very routine. The surly ex-policeman Boris Dakota, whose wife and daughter died several years before, meets a woman and his son and it's up to him to save their lives, almost like a futuristic western. Throw a former wrestler who now runs the God channel, a Christian fascist who is trying to turn off Boris, a ventriloquist, a T & A for taste and you have a mess of a movie. I believe that after seeing this DOILSDAY by Neil Marshall it is perhaps a masterpiece of cinema in comparison
