Perry Mason: The case of the glass coffin finds Raymond Burr defending David Copperfield / Rick Blaine as the magician Peter Scolari from a murder charge involving one of his assistants. A trick involving a glass coffin suspended in mid-air goes wrong and Nancy Grahn's body comes out. <br /> <br /> Nancy was one of six assistants who work with the act and learn two things about her. First in a moment of drunken weakness, Scolari was seduced by her and she claims to have been impregnated. Secondly, she lives under a false name and has a secret from her past. <br /> <br /> Billy Moses who probably never thought he would do such crude things at school by law will intertwine with a couple of good old men when he searches for truth in Grahn's hometown. A little more action than usual for Ken Malansky, it almost gets killed. <br /> <br /> A great flaw in this mystery is the simple forensic analysis. The coroner's report should have provided concrete evidence that the victim had been killed in such a way that Scolari could not have done the deed. The police should have looked in another direction for the killer. <br /> <br /> When you see who the killer is, you wouldn't blame the individual, but you'll also see how investigator James McEachin was wrong from the start. This kind of ruins this particular Mason movie.
