Out of boredom and great curiosity, I decided to check this show today since my four-year-old granddaughter loves it. I should have known it was a show that only a four-year-old could enjoy. The show was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the show wasn't fun. The laughter took place in the most inappropriate moments, which was very annoying, especially since none of the lines was fun. The laughter died down at one point when the only guy who is the cameraman said "I'm going to polish my lens". How the hell is it so funny? The parts it contained (such as meat drumming) that were supposed to be fun were just silly for anyone over eleven. <br /> <br /> Now I have the feeling that four-year-olds are not the target audience. However, since I have a four-year-old granddaughter looking at her, this kind of thing worried me as I watched it: it doesn't show very good behavior. In the episode I was watching, he shows Sam stealing Carly's sandwich and pushing her to the ground, just so Carly can get up and do the same thing to her. I would not like to see my niece acting so rude. Also, I don't like the idea of ​​two young girls who have a web show where they give personal information ... If it were true, there would have been monsters everywhere. <br /> <br /> This show would probably be good and fun with someone who is eleven or younger, but whoever is older than that, just stay away from it. I will give these two stars since I imagine I can see how fun it can be for a child.
