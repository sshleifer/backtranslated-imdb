After all the hype I had heard about the Jane Austin novel and the different film versions of the book, I found myself very disappointed with the film. I expected a classic drama, but it wasn't. First of all let me anticipate my review with the fact that I love old movies, especially mysteries and dramas, but not woman-oriented films. This probably makes a big difference, so take my review with a grain of salt. I thought the acting was a bit exaggerated, but it's very common in movies of this era. June Allyson was as good as Jo, but I found that each sister was stereotyped and guided by form. There were no surprises or excessively dramatic moments. I hate writing bad reviews, but the film left me very cold. It was always my intention to read the book, but after that it seems unlikely. The only common thread was between the old gentlemen and the younger sister, who was a very welcome bright spot in an otherwise disappointing viewing experience. Again there are others who love this movie, I'm not just one of them.
