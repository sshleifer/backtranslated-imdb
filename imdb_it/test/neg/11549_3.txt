Sure, I tuned into this in the hope of seeing some James Brolin beef shots. Unfortunately, there was only one in the early stages, and the rest of the film was very domesticated, and in the end it made little sense. <br /> <br /> The story, what there is of it, is centered on Nick and Julie Atkins, a couple whose marriage for many years is starting to get old. Nick, a successful businessman, is focused on work to the point of neglecting Julie, who tries to fill the void by going back to school. Julie's desire for the passion she and Nick had at the beginning of their marriage begins to take shape in the form of powerful sexual fantasies that block reality for a few minutes at a time, making her do things like burning breakfast and losing the cards of husband. At first imagine your husband, but as the movie progresses, he begins to fantasize about other men and the encounters with random strangers he meets. This culminates in his acting out his fantasies with disastrous consequences for his marriage. Can she and her husband rebuild their relationship? Is it worth saving? <br /> <br /> This may have been an interesting premise, but the execution is so bland that you wonder why they ever worried. The characters are not developed. The reasons are not explained. Basic information is not provided. No exploration was done about how Julie got to the point where she failed to control herself, and no explanation is given as to how she will do it in the future. The end product is a confused mess that is just as confusing as Julie's fantasies, which are surprisingly underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> Acting is a mixture. Donna Mills as Julie does well with the material she is given, even though her self-pity continues to get jarring after a while. James Brolin behaves as if he were reading his jokes, and even his anger at his wife's infidelity is hard to accept, shows so little passion for the whole issue. The secondary roles are mostly forgettable. <br /> <br /> A disappointing treatment of what could have been an interesting story. More is the sin, since it does not even offer the candies that it promises.
