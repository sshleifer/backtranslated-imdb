SPOILERS, ATTENTION !!! Flashdance is an honest film, in my opinion. Some things confuse me (for example, Jeanie asks Alex how long it takes to dance so well, Alex answers "About 25 years", shouldn't Alex be 18?) And some things fascinate me (I LOVE rotations!). Overall, though, it intrigued me. When this film was made, I wasn't even born. I didn't really live the eighties (I was born in 85) and I have to ask myself: sometimes Alex ran around a bit, or threw himself on everything, he didn't really dance, just banging things, throwing them back and waving - was it considered "dancing" then? If it were, I'm not sure I could stand it. The laps, the launch, the fluid movements were fantastic, but some - my neighbor's child could have done better! Also, if Alex is a welder during the day, wouldn't she be tired after a hard day's work? When she's not going to work for almost a week, wouldn't she be fired? Living in a warehouse, I can almost see it, but not quite. It does not seem fair that she is a welder, that she owns a warehouse and is trying to get into ballet. None of this really makes sense. I shouldn't be too judicious considering my past, but please. Maybe Jennifer Beals is too feminine for me to see her as a welder, I don't know. But in any case, they could have chosen a better actress. The actors were fine. I also liked the love story. Make your decision. But mine is: rent it once, never see it again, it's not worth it.
