This film has been advertised for over three months in Greece as the largest Greek production ever. Well, it could be, but ... When you hear about a big production you expect to see something new, something different. What you see here is a film with no reason to exist. George Corraface looks like he didn't like shooting this movie very much. His acting is so simplistic, that it seems almost amateur. The sound, especially when some of the Turkish actors speak English (nicknamed?), Is full of hiss. The fortunately few special effects that show Istanbul and Athens in the late 1950s and early 1970s are more like digital paintings than computers. Finally, we see the same boy from 1959 (age 5) until 1968 (14 years), but miraculously he becomes a teenager five years later. <br /> <br /> So much for "the biggest Greek production". At least one might think that there would be some sort of interesting script to qualify for such expensive production. And all you get is a love story between 7 years old, which meet again 40 years later. Oh, there is also a political side. A couple of ironic remarks on the Greek "junta" of '67 -'74, so childish that it seems almost forced. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, a couple of good things in the film: most of the actors are fantastic, mainly Ieroklis Michaelidis, the excellent scenery and the magnificent music of Evanthia Remboutsika; but they are so few for such expensive production. <br /> <br /> Bottom-line: is it such a bad movie? To tell the truth I don't know. I only know that at no point does it justify its enormous budget (by Greek standards).
