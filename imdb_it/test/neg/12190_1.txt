This film is simply terrifying, the way the talent involved has made this is beyond human belief. I think they must have been getting drunk when they thought of this idea, I feel like two hours of my life have been taken from me. Harvey Kietel will try to distance himself from this rubbish, it should have been a great detective film but develops into a bloody vampire mess. I would recommend this film to people who like to sleep through movies, you will lose nothing. Humor is ready for the lowest common domain, films can elevate us and remind us that life is worth living, this film depresses you. As DeNiro said in a film, the saddest thing in life is the wasted talent that this film is a perfect example of this statement.
