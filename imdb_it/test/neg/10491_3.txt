There is an adjective that describes everything about this film - acting, plot, effects, continuity, etc. - and that word is poor. The government wants to evaluate the effects of space travel on certain organisms, but the capsule crashes and a mutant something-or-other (it looks like a guy in a monkey suit with the upper part of a football helmet on his face) detonates the incident scene, which includes a favorite place for window fogging, the party set. Therefore, some young people - in addition to a police officer - are among the victims of the creature. You must be extremely uninformed about how you spend your time - or rich, if you spend money - to see this epic.
