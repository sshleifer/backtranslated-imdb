These rubber monsters have failed to try to be fantastic, scary or even comedy, it looks like a Porkys or Animals House movie, but the sequences and the story are not always clear even they can't capture your attention. taste, the only thing that makes you laugh are the horrible rubber monsters that must cost one dollar each, because the work or them never seem realistic, the movements and expressions make the Muppets look like a Pixar 3D movie when compare to this. I hope that Marie Carlton is the only thing that makes this horrible film tolerable, and when it dies in the film, it becomes even worse than before. A film that should only be seen forward.
