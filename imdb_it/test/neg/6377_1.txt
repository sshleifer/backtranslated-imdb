Jon Stewart (aka John Liebowitz) constantly tears conservatism and anything republican. This liberal comic strip is anything but, while it pours its cutting "humor" into the throats of impressionable young people. I saw the show while I was stuck in a waiting room while my car was repaired and this guy has no treason. He will take the part of Al Queda on Bush every day. He is shameless and everything he says is punctuated by a false laughter. I remember four years ago when he "interviewed" John Kerry. The two made faces to each other that seemed to preclude a make-up session. It was like "take a room, boys". I simply don't like the little traitors who propagate their propaganda. Call me superficial. The Daily Show has had a long run and there are many Liberal peers who have a seething hatred for Republicans and conservatism. I'm not surprised by its success, but do I make sure that many people actually look at Comedy Central? That guy from Mancia makes me think.
