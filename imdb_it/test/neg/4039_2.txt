As you can see from the other comments, this film is about the WORST movie ever made. Show me how many different words I can use to describe it: boring, unbearable, ridiculous, lousy, stupid, horrible ..... <br /> <br /> I could go on with these descriptions but you'll probably get the point. <br /> <br /> I would have given this a 0, if possible: bad acting, bad direction, bad production, bad plot. <br /> <br /> This was done in 2001 and looks more like 1965. Very low budget, boring storyline, horrible acting, really bad special effects, etc ... <br /> <br /> I rarely see a science fiction movie that I think is absolutely so bad. I mean, this is pure garbage. This has nothing to say either. As for a "B-movie" this is the bottom of the lot. <br /> <br /> I think I would have more fun staring at a white piece of paper for 90 minutes. Junk like this gives good low-budget movies "B" a bad name. This makes Ed Wood movies look good. <br /> <br /> Watching movies directed at the video is, just when you think you've seen the worst, see something worse! <br /> <br /> DJ Perry is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that make him stand out. <br /> <br /> Avoid this waste at all costs! Oh humanity!
