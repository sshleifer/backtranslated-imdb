This film has changed my life! Hogan's performance was nothing short of incredible, and I have not yet recovered from his exclusion from the 1990 Oscar nominations. As brilliant as Hulkster shines in this film, it is not possible to discard the brilliant writing and direction that transforms this masterpiece in the highest level of success in the cinema. If you have not seen this movie, immediately delete what you are doing and get a copy. I guarantee you that it will leave you speechless. And if you don't like it, then I only have one question for you ... Watcha who will do when the 24-inch pythons and Hulkamania go wild on you !!!!
