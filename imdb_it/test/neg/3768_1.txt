There is a phrase from the experimental director Nathaniel Dorsky, who says that some films are structured like a camera mounted on the head of a dog going into an alley, sniffing everything along the way. <br /> <br /> Here's how the movie is. The structure is "Kurosawa was born as a child, then he became a kid, then a young man, then a director, then he started creating" masterpieces ", then he became old, The End." The word "masterpiece" is used a lot in this film to describe the production of Kurosawa, without explaining * what * makes his films so good / great. Just because the off-screen narrator who reads a script says that a film is a masterpiece, should we kiss his back and accept that a certain film is one of the great works of art of the 20th century? And another point. Paul Scofield's voice is used as Kurosawa's voice, when extracts from the director's memoirs are read off-screen. Bring the Shakespearian pear-shaped tones to the text ... but why him? If you made a documentary about Billie Holiday, would you use Dame Judi Densch as her voice ????
