The premise of this film, a comedy talk show that is a candidate for the presidency as an independent only to shake things up, is fun, funny, brilliant and even a little stimulating. (I was thinking of the debate on the west wing when Tom Dobbs left his podium, he thought of Steven Colbert announcing his candidacy, good times). The first 15-20 minutes of this film are therefore very entertaining, especially the debate. When he is finally elected, it is a pity that due to a computer problem, you would like him to win rightly (even if it is not realistic). <br /> <br /> But after this movie it goes completely downhill. I thought we would have a great movie like "Dave" (1993) where we see how it would be if a comedian actually ran the country. Instead, the film turns from comedy into a thriller, a romantic comedy and a drama and does nothing good. The computer error becomes the main plot, which really sucks. The boy is disappointing. I gave him 3 stars just for the premise and because I could see this movie from beginning to end without stopping it, which is usually a good thing for me.
