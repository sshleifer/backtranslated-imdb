Army soldier Gene Kelly, who is also a talented trapeze artist, is put under fire to do daring stunts without a net and alienating his high-wire cohorts; in the meantime, there is an elaborate "field show" to wear for soldiers and army personnel, and the entire M-G-M studio showed up to join in the fun. Mickey Rooney plays M.C. (unctuously), introducing acts like Kay Kyser and his orchestra, Bob Crosby, Benny Carter and the M-G-M Dancing Girls (which look like vegetables). Red Skelton does a nice job with Donna Reed and Margaret O'Brien, but the other comic pieces suffer from an apparent emptiness between the artists and the alleged live audience (they are tremendously silent until the publisher cuts them for shots of exaggerated reactions). Judy Garland sings an inappropriate song about a night jump at Carnegie Hall (unlikely accompanied by classical pianist Jos√© Iturbi, whom Judy calls "hep"). The production is lucid, but the manic energy seems false, manufactured. ** from ****
