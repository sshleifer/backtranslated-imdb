The box of this film is totally distorted. The cover shows a view of legs and panties in a short skirt. The title is "Tart". The synopsis on the back of the box made it appear that Cat, the main character, was an outcast who became one of the popular students, but that popularity led to a bizarre lifestyle that he could not escape. Everything the box built this film on was a horrible lie. I was expecting a lousy version, directed at the "Heathers" video aimed at today's teenagers. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you what it really was "Tart". Yes, this is really the plot; so if you don't want to know what happens, stop reading. We have a far-fetched and boring girl. The best friend of this unlikely girl is a skank. The skank is expelled from school, so the unlikely girl makes friends with an English girl. This leads to the unlikely girl dating this boring boy, to whom the box refers to as "the most popular boy at school". If that guy was the most popular guy in their school, I'd like to go to that high school, because I could have kicked him. However, as any film will tell you, the most popular guy at school is invariably a murderer or a drug addict or a thief, or in this case, all of the above. However, everyone ends up detesting the unlikely main character because he is Jewish. Then the most popular guy at school beats his best friend, the skank, with a stone, because the skank has captured the most popular guy in a homosexual act. Eventually the stoic mother and the hypochondriac younger brother of the most unlikely girl are there for her. Oh, and the whole movie is about snotty kids and their horrible parents. Damn, what's wrong with that? It looks like a fantastic movie! Well, that's what I thought. But see, there are no nice characters in this movie. The main character is boring. The filmmakers gave her an average, while during the film she continues to spit on what is a monster. The Skank is not extravagant enough and has little time for the screen. The popular guy is nothing to write home about. The popular girls are just your whirlwind girls. There are no moral lessons. Cat, the boring main character, is not a monster, she never becomes one of the really popular girls, and (worst of all) after all the crap she goes through, she thinks she's still too beautiful to make friends with the only pretty girl the stupid girl. To be honest, I have no idea why the film is called Tart. I kept asking, who is the tart? Is she the tart? Are they all tarts? At 94 minutes, theoretically this is not a long film. But after really seeing this horrible waste of a VHS tape, and not knowing who the cake was, I was surprised that the film was only an hour and a half. The film seemed to have been two hours and some changes. After a while, I was hoping the film was about pop pies. At least when you look at a box of pop pies, you know what to expect.
