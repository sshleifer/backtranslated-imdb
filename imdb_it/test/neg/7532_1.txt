This is really a bad movie. It may seem like an oversimplification. A fickle and childish response comparable to an insignificant insult. The truth is that there is not enough to say about the confused and senseless plot, about the really atrocious acting (I'm talking about bad people here), or about the random images of violence towards women that make up the chaotic pastiche of radically horrifying films errors that push this affront to all that is good and decent in the world of cinema, indeed, of human culture. Please trust me, don't look at it ... never. I'm serious. Stop. You can thank me later.
