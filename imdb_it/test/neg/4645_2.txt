After reading both _River_God_ and _The_Seventh_Scroll_, I can't begin to express how disappointed I was with this movie. While I agree that a poetic license can be admissible, this film is in constant contrast to the books, committing an incredible injustice to the exciting, plausible and wonderful stories written by Wilbur Smith. I can only believe that the film's writers, directors and producers have never even heard of Mr. Smith, let alone read his work. Smith's lively characterizations are converted into stylized wooden figures, all historicity is ignored or taken for granted, the realism of the books has been changed to include ghost monsters more appropriate for a cartoon. And why does an Egyptian henchman speak Spanish? Geesh, no wonder the film has been turned into a television miniseries! Has Wilbur Smith had any contribution in making this film? I can not believe. Terrible and terrible film. If you have read one or both books, do not waste time or money watching this money. You will be very disappointed, I assure you. <br /> <br /> Only a moment of supreme generosity convinced me to give this film a "2" ranking, and only for the beautiful, sometimes spectacular, photograph.
