Oh, there are many worse Wayne movies. This film has been modified badly, but has a campy element that makes viewing enjoyable. The villain is an Anglo actor who sports ridiculous Mexican clothes and hits an exaggerated Mexican accent that is exhilarating. The girl is dressed by an aspiring Jean Harlow, after all this is 1934. At least the position shots are beautiful and amusing. <br /> <br /> Watch it and laugh. Don't expect a serious western, but rather a light and superficial story with poor acting, but occasional flashes of field humor. Wayne is almost ridiculously young and handsome and you can see his acting ability blossomed years after this unpleasant feat.
