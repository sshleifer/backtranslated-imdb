Tempest is based on the classic Shakespearean work of the same name, but has few similarities with its source material. <br /> <br /> He masks himself as a brain like his namesake, but instead is a mixture, twisted and trivial. Physical exercise The original probed the premise that people have an evil side, which would be destructive if not controlled. Here you only get a disinterested mid-life crisis (yawn) that is making everything wrong in your personal and professional life. He becomes endowed with a supernatural power that he uses to try to control his environment; in other words: to do it your way. <br /> <br /> Every few minutes, after something else in his pathetic life goes wrong, he finds a secluded place and starts babbling "Let me see the magic!" while shaking hands and making an expression of "serious concentration". From the way these scenes are shot, it seems like I'm trying to turn bugs into other kinds of bugs. Turn a spider into a cockroach, perhaps, but at this point, you don't really care. <br /> <br /> The story made him escape from his life with his daughter on a Greek island somewhere, then have an embarrassing relationship with a girl he meets, one of the most boring novels ever committed to cinema. History gets bogged down and moves at a slow and slow pace. No reason is ever given to you to please or dislike anyone. <br /> <br /> I will give this a 2 because of the beautiful shots of the Greek position and the semi-optimistic conclusion (although it is not clear if the storm power brought this ending roughly or not). The spirit of Shakespeare's work has been captured much better in other films; a notable example is "Forbidden Planet", which has given credit to how power becomes out of control. <br /> <br /> As for this "Storm", his only magic is to cure insomnia.
