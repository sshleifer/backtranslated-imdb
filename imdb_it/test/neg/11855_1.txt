The only reason why there is a question mark in brackets is NOT because I haven't seen all the movies released in 2001 so far. It is because this film was made only PARTLY in 2001. The rest was stolen from Roger Corman's other dinosaur films, Carnosaur 1-3. I have a confession to make. "Carnosaur 2" is perhaps one of my favorite B-movies. He borrows so much from James Cameron's "Aliens", it's not even funny. But I love it. I can't explain exactly why. It only works for me. I liked sets, I liked photography, I liked how they borrowed from "Aliens". It is a bit ironic that Cameron at one point was a replacement for Corman, with films like "Battle Beyond the Stars" (1980). <br /> <br /> I own the Carnosaur trilogy on DVD, and the most I can say for the first part is that it has moments. The best I can say for the third is that it took me five years to find it watchable. <br /> <br /> Now we have "Raptor", which DOES NOT continue that series. Instead, he borrows ENTIRE scenes from the Carnosaurus Trilogy and BUILDS a movie around it. And somehow Roger Corman managed to convince Eric Roberts and Corbin Bernsen to do it. Now, I'm not saying that neither Roberts nor Bernsen have ever reached a high career level. But they were both at one point those who could be called respectable actors. Not here. Of course, the actors react to the effects they won't even see during the shoot. Here, however, they are reacting to films not corresponding to films between the ages of five and eight. There is also a sherrif whose costume was modeled directly after a character in "Carnosaur 1." Apparently it made too much sense to bring back the original boy. <br /> <br /> When "Raptor" was announced I was a little excited. However, I was disappointed when Corman said they would use the old "Carnosaur" dinosaur models. Apparently Corman has decided, after this interview, that he wouldn't even have done it. And it's not like he couldn't find an FX crew to do it. The script for this was clearly written keeping in mind that the story had to be built around pre-existing repertoire material. <br /> <br /> Don't compare it to Ed Wood. And he did better than this. At least he used the filming of Bela once in a movie. There are ways to incorporate archive material into a movie, and "Raptor" brings this technique to a new level. Even if you liked "Carnosaur 3: Primal Species", stay away from "Raptor".
