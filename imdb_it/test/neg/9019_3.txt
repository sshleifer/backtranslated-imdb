The somewhat fierce 1950's sci-fi-horror skeleton is not entirely a loser. It is a manned space rocket that crashes in a remote area. A group of scientists goes to investigate and discovers that the astronaut is in a kind of coma; it is kept alive by alien embryos that have been mysteriously implanted in him. However, the title alien monster soon raises its head causing general chaos, including partial head removal. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film is its rhythm. It takes quite a while before the Blood Beast appears, and in reality it only comes to mind in the last 20 minutes or so. It is undoubtedly a completely ridiculous creation but it is not a problem as it provides a good dose of comic relief. At the end of the movie, where we have the final stalemate and this ridiculous creature starts talking in the voice of the doctor who killed before, you'll be fine not to laugh. So even in the bright x-ray scene where we see alien embryos floating in the astronaut's body - it's too funny for words. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, the funny moments of Night of the Blood Beast are too few and far between. If you are a science fiction fan from the 1950s, then this is worth checking out. Don't expect too much.
