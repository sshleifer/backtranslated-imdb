If you're in the mood to laugh at a really bad movie (bad in the way that only Ken Russell can be the worst), you have to try this. It makes you look like you've just landed in a .25 porn booth and you can almost smell the smell of urine on the floor. Kathleen Turner struts in a blonde wig, making sure that her kicks "pretend" to be a cheap whore (she really does a good job in the clothing industry and was hurt so badly by men that this is 'the only way she can connect), and Tony Perkins plays a hysterical "priest" who is out perhaps to assassinate her (yet another film that ends with Tony Perkins dragging). Annie Potts introduces herself and is not allowed to provide an ounce of her usual wit, which is reason enough to hate this movie. The kinky will love the sex scenes, so rent the UNrated version in the RED box so you can see Turner give a taste of his billy club (I had to pause the VCR until we stopped laughing).
