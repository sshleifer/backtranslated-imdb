When I started watching this, I immediately noticed that I couldn't understand what someone was saying. I turned up the volume. With the background noises booming, I could hear the voices. What are the actors saying? Is the film not dubbed? Are they speaking Spanish? After some confusion, I realize it was English. At least, I think so ... The incredible Jess Franco put the microphones too far from the actors. As a result, we cannot completely feel what they are saying. He has done it before. But maybe this is Mr. Franco's intention? Not knowing what people are saying, we're thrown into some mystery about what's going on, and they're left with more visual clues ... Maybe it's just me, but I would have liked to know what was happening! How about some suggestions? The basic premise (I refuse to call it a "plot") concerns a young exotic American dancer named Paula (played by Amber Newman) who has a boyfriend who invites her to a small island owned by some squalid rich characters. It is somewhere off the coast of Spain. For this visit, a large cash payment is promised to Paula, who gets her boyfriend. Then he flees the island, only to return later. Why? Pay close attention to the scene where the boyfriend opens Paula's US passport. Although his hand tried to cover it, you can see the real name of the actress, Amber Newman, printed under the photo on the bottom of the passport !! However, returning to the "history": there are other squalid, rich and beautiful characters who visit the island, all with ambiguous motivations. We are witnessing sadistic games (are they real or fake?) And unattractive culinary scenes. But the food must be good, like a fake French cook prepared it! There is a young woman who turns naked and never talks. Is it really mute? And we care? Of course all women are mostly naked during this film ... Oh well, we can at least be thankful that men (50+ and overweight) remain dressed! In addition to the abysmal sound quality, what always amazed me about Jess Franco is her incredible ability to film beautiful naked women in such a way as to leave the viewer completely turned off. This movie is no exception ?? I needed fresh air after seeing it! <br /> <br /> In conclusion: I am happy to report that, regardless of what Mr. Franco can imagine, I am still attracted to women.
