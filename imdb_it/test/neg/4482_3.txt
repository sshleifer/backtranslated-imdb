Today, being President's Day, my wife and I had the DVD "The Notebook", checked at our local library. It is a film released in 2004 that fell under our radar, since we are great cinema fans. I am a published author with the hope that the screen will reproduce my first book. I had noticed references to "The Notebook" in reviews of other films, which is why I brought it up to watch and this morning provided the perfect opportunity. We really enjoyed it. He made my wife cry; we could refer to many things in it with our continuous love story and I too fought again by suffocating. <br /> <br /> This afternoon, after many chores, garden work and eating, we decided to take a matinee. When we arrived at the theater, after seeing most of the current film series, we chose to see "Victoria Day" which for some reason was not in the theater, even if both the IMDb film and my movies on the phone they showed it. So instead we looked at the "Dear John" poster and it was written by the author of "The Notebook", making it the obvious choice since we enjoyed the "TN" so much. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment! First, the characters did not have the same credibility or sense of empathy as "TN"; and we continued to comment on all the similarities - about two dozen - making us quickly understand that this film was none other than, as another reviewer commented, "a poor man's notebook!" He had a real "chewing cow" feeling, which means that the Sparks simply threw a story together, based on the exact model of "TN", simply to earn a quick penny. Not only that, after the "liar-eyed" trollop unlikely "Dear John's-John" for the cancer patient, we ridiculed the film with each of us, passing a stupid soap line to the end. There were only about 6 of us in the theater during this matinee on Monday 4:45 pm and my wife also told me to keep it down, so I didn't want to ruin it for the others ... it was so bad. <br /> Seeing this in the wake of 'TN' ensured that the similarities of tear were vividly recognizable and overt Sparks, attempt at writing cheaply painfully obvious model writing. We were just hoping we could see "Victoria Day" instead ... no matter how bad it would have been after seeing this poor entrance to the cinema. And oh ..., for the last 30 minutes, I kept saying "... don't give those cows coins ... don't give those cows coins?"
