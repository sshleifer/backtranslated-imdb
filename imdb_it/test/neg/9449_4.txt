I looked at this because of the description and the cover and once again I was deceived. I'm getting sick of all these stupid horror movies on DVD. Once in a blue moon, it will be fine. He started with a confused scene and then jumped 30 years and showed a couple a night during a storm that was fine because I liked the storms and put in a good mood. Then it turned into a nice road trip where they met bizarre people at a dinner party. The rest became strange and then became confused. I looked at it until the end, but it was even more confusing when it ended so badly. I had higher hopes for this film but it was more like science fiction then horror and something that should have been done for TV.
