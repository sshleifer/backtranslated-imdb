This film wants to be a study of the character of perversion. Some reviewers have been convinced that, since perversion is represented, the film is psychologically profound; in reality, considering the salacious material, it is surprisingly boring and superficial, without motivational substance. Why is the main character as he is? You won't find out from the script. For a better treatment of the same theme (and a more entertaining film), try Belle de Jour by Bunuel.
