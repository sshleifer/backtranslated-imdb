After watching this movie on a boring Saturday afternoon, I couldn't understand why so many people liked it. It was not "moving" or "intelligent"; it was simply an amalgamation of all the other "non-correspondents who met during a vacation and despite their ideological differences they learned something from each other" the film was never realized. <br /> <br /> The characters are a bouillabaisse stereotype - We have blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Asians and homosexuals - and they never do anything but what everyone expects from the characters in a movie how they do this. The black mother declares that it is "all right, then" when it is said that another black character is in church instead of helping to prepare dinner (because all blacks love the church), Hispanics seem only capable of speaking Spanish when they say hello or make exclamations, the lesbians do nothing but cuddle and kiss (and one of them wears a bandana because all the lesbians dress up like Ani DiFranco) and the Vietnamese family owns a video store. In L.A. Imagine that. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is called "What's Cooking" because every ethnic family cooks a different version of what they think Thanksgiving dinner should be! The black mother wants corn bread and macaroni and cheese, the Hispanics are shown rolling tortillas, the Vietnamese family is deep frying the spring rolls; I'm surprised there wasn't a bottle of Manischewitz on the Jewish table. All this is demonstrated by the ancient tradition of "musical editing", in which they play the "Wipeouts" of Surfari, rapidly changing the instruments used in the melody to reflect their respective cultures. Isn't it cute? In any case, once the director has finished determining how different they are, he tries to show the inner humanity that we, like all people of every race, religion and culture share, inventing implausible and dramatic conflicts for each of the families to deal with. It would be a plot killer to talk about each of these conflicts, but rest assured that they are really surprises, that is if you have slept for the first half of the movie. The theme of "dishonoring the family" is pretty strong in everything. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are the kind of person who loves those unreleased films that revolve around the stories of unlikely intertwining characters, well, you won't like this movie. If you like extended food montages that are passed around a table, you have to put it in Netflix's queue. But if you like stereotypes and clich√©s, make sure you ask for Christmas. O Hanukkah. O Kwanzaa.
