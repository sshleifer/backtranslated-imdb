Anupam Kher is an excellent actor, he made his debut at the age of 28 playing 50 years in SARAANSH <br /> <br /> Now he becomes director with OJJ <br /> <br /> The film has a good plot but is regressive <br /> <br /> The theme was done to death and the character of Urmila seems too put up while the tracks of Anil-Mahima and Abhi-Tara are too sudden and then forgotten <br /> <br /> The movie is it moves at a snail's pace and starts to drag but there are many good scenes like the whole conflict between Anil-Fardeen and Abhishek where Fardeen says to sell the house <br /> <br /> Abhishek is captured for a crime and Anil the screams against <br /> <br /> The climax is too much even if <br /> <br /> Directly Anupam shows the potential, but has a way to go Music is okay <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor excels in his part as always Fardeen tries hard and is fine, but needs to improve Abhishek is excellent, this was a turning point, people realized that he can turn Urmila is fine Mahima and Tara are wasted Waheeda is good
