It's been 3 months and you know what it means ... A new Seagal movie. Seagal has really acted in a horrible movie after making a horrible movie. Every time every movie gets worse and worse, it's really incredible! I really don't know what to say about TYD, first it's a piece of shit, the story doesn't make any sense, secondly it uses stunts in all its fight scenes, and last but not least, much of the footage is taken from other movies! Surprising the way this guy continues to find work, he arrives late on the set and leaves early, so his films are full of holes in the plot and acrobatics. Why do we continue to buy his films, because we continue to have the hope that perhaps he alone will make a great film?
