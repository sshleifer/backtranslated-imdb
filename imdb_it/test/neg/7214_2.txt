Man stops making sequels with great films. The original was a great movie that was exaggerated with fights, sex and one of the coolest characters that adorned the screen in the 90s. The story is credible as if you were in the bars of the southern outs that you would have known. But here comes this piece of trash Roadhouse 2 Last Call. We only hope they are serious with the title and never make another Roadhouse. It does not have the charm of the characters of the original, nor is the story really believable. The Story is more of a Steven Segal type of action that, even though Roadhouse 2 is a B movie, it still doesn't click while some B animation movies still sell the movie, no matter how picky it is. The only reason to hire not buy this film is that we finally find out that the only question was left by the original Roadhouse. The character of Patrick Swayze Dalton, Dalton is his name or surname? Well, I'll save you the rental fee of $ 4.00. Dalton is his first name as in Dalton Tanner. NEVER DO ANOTHER ROADHOUSE !!!!!!!!!!!
