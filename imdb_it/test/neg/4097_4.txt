One hundred and seventy five million dollars is a lot of money to spend even for the biggest summer success. Not even Michael Bay had such a big budget for Transformers, so just like Universal Pictures spent so much money making Evan Almighty a mystery. They certainly didn't spend it on the script for one thing, since the film is not so much a classic comedy as the waving of a Christian flag and barring one or two quiet giggles, you're more likely to spend the time wondering where it is the budget or because Steve Carrell felt the need to set it in a decidedly average film at the exact moment when his stellar profile started to rise. <br /> <br /> A sequel to the Jim Carrey comedy Bruce Almighty, this film sees former support character Evan Baxter (Carrell) climbing the ladder in the player's main box. The story opens with him leaving the newspaper to become a public official and he moved to Washington with his wife and three generic children (a strange little primary school mushroom, a lively high school student and a sullen teenage boy). However, Evan's candidacy to change the world through politics comes into play when God (Morgan Freeman) appears and asks him to build an Ark. <br /> <br /> In other words, it's an update of the old Genesis story with Evan fighting against cynicism and opponents to build the huge boat. Unfortunately, while the premise is reasonably promising, unfortunately it does not provide much laughter. There is some fun at the beginning when Evan's heterosexual parliamentarian tries to juggle public service demands with unwelcome packs of animals following him and a beard that resists all attempts to shave him, but at most soon while accepting his divine mission, the film takes a dive. <br /> <br /> From this moment on, it turns into a message movie. Evan begins to preach with alarming regularity and Morgan Freeman continues to present himself to offer gentle wisdom, while gently urging his choice in the right direction. Without Evan's resistance, however, the only trace of the left of the comedy comes in the form of some animal excrement jokes and the role of John Michael Higgin in the role of Evan's exasperated right arm. Higgins could show the same rich comic potential he had already had in Arrested Development, but his enthusiasm cannot save the sinking ship, especially given that Carrell has almost put a strain on his formidable improvised skills. <br /> <br /> In some ways, it is slightly similar to the Passion of Christ, but unlike the film by Mel Gibson which encouraged everyone to believe in God through the loss of guilt and guilt, Evan Almighty look for a gentler approach. The film simply tells us that we should have faith in God because he has faith in us. Unfortunately, this film has the same probability of making you laugh like the Passion. Carrell is on autopilot, the jokes do not exist and Wanda Sykes makes an offer to become the most boring person on the planet. It may be sweet, but someone has thrown out $ 175 million.
