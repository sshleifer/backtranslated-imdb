this film was incredibly stupid in the sense of what ever. I fell in love with all the actors and actresses who ruined their career in this stupid movie. the whole film was based on how unrealistic they could make it, to make it little like what made it even more stupid. some of the names were also unrealistic. the movie is fun to watch, which is why it got 2 out of 10 stars. this is probably the third stupidest film ever made. I really did after realizing that there were mostly adult actors, but in a children's movie. the most shocking was Danny Trejo, an always dirty horror film actor. the other actors were practically clean as far as I'm concerned.
