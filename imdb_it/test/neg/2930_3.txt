Well, I generally like Iranian movies, and after seeing "10" of Kiarostami the night before, I was expecting a great movie. I was very disappointed. This is by far the worst Iranian film and one of the most boring Asian movies I've ever seen. If you've never seen a Kiarostami movie before, look instead at "Dieci". If you want good Iranian films, you can also try "Sib", aka "The Apple". This film is divided into 5 parts, and only the fourth, with some funny ducks, is worth watching. If this is the first Iranian film you see, you probably don't want to see it anymore. I don't blame you, but you'll miss some great movies.
