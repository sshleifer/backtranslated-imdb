I saw this film about the strength of the only positive review and I can only imagine that that guy is a shill. <br /> <br /> The acting of the female protagonist is actually quite good, but the whole film is so atrociously boring I could barely sit up. This is the very definition of dullness. <br /> <br /> So far, this movie is rated as 8 out of 10 out of 7 votes. This means that the director, the director's girlfriend, the producer, the actress and the drinking friends have given their film to 10. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you, who simply want to be entertained or enjoyed of a good story, avoid this. <br /> <br /> This man on the road must give him a FDA note of 2 out of 10. <br /> <br/>: while this film can be used as an aid to get a good night's sleep, no medicinal value is implicit or offered.
