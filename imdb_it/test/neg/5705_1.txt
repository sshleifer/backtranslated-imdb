If this is not present in every "what not to look" list, it should be just because those who keep that particular list are not aware of its existence, which, as long as it remains, is the acceptable alternative. I'm not kidding you, this is a * bad * "movie". Joseph Meeker returns from the dead, with various vague and indefinite supernatural powers, the most employed of whom would appear to appear in a new way, more and more comical and ridiculous (and never scary or disturbing ... in general, when this is true for the last of these, one ends up just being bizarre, and tries the first one just does not work, period) clothes and stereotypes / archetypes, and is played by David Keith (whom I respect in ... well, at least Scavezzacollo), who often turns out terribly inconsistent (which could also have to do with the script) and often above the best performance. A character or two have such incredibly irritating personalities that they are painful to watch. The montage thinks it's considerably smarter than it really is (and what on Earth was it with the red tint for flashbacks?). Cinematography ... oh dear. Framing, coverage, effective use of the angle (which could also be attributed to editing, perhaps), please, guys, stop me when I say something you've ever heard of. As for the technical side, this is a rather bad excuse for something else worth putting in the projector of an unexposed movie. But why stop there? The plot is poor. The basic idea was made, and it was done much better than this (The Crow would be one). The way it is said is deceptive, and while there is some explanation behind the flashbacks, it still doesn't satisfy. The rhythm is non-existent. The advantage is clearly unpredictable, and there is more personality in a stable door, not to mention the fact that these too are much less in wood. Kelly Perine and Thomas Ian Nicholas? In the name of all that is good and just (pun intended) are you doing in this? Perine, you were already funny before that, on The Drew Carey Show, Nicholas, well, I didn't see you in anything before the American pie, but if anything, you * were * funny later, and in those productions, fun was intentional Dialogue is ... less said, the better. The language is unrestrained and tends to be stupid. The violence is hurt and they don't even seem to worry about trying to hide it (suggesting that it could have been the smartest strategy). Characters, don't get me started. Why spend so much energy on portraying non-exciting, sometimes absolutely illogical events? The more you think about this, the worse it becomes. It's not even passable as a "bad horror movie", or a B movie (it could very well go through the rest of the alphabet, and go even further), it might not scare you into the scariest day of your life if you had a car electrified electrifying. I only recommend it to people who want to deny how bad it is, and don't say that I didn't warn you. 1/10
