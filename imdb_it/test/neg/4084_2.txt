The only way I can feel good after delivering these precious minutes of my life is to tell someone how horrible it is every day. And even if I say it once a day, every day for the rest of my life I won't be able to fully understand my point of view. Simply stupid. <br /> <br /> There is a difference in films like this and movies like Elephant or Fat Guy Goes Nutzoid, two of my least-loved films. The last two were terrible, yes, but that was it. Evan Almighty takes a strong cast and tries to kill them all. Wanda Sykes, Jonah Hill, John Goodman and Steve Carrell ... WHY GOD WHY !? All these people have a much better talent, now every time I see some of them I will think of this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this 2 instead of 1 was when I saw the movie there was an elderly woman with mental problems who thought that the flurry of bird poop and the jokes of they were so funny that they kept laughing all the time while they were under construction, almost caressing each other several times.
