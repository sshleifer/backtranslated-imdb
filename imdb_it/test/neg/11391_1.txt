This is a horrible re-make of the French film Ma Vie en Rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). The only scenario I can imagine where someone (Sinise?! Bates ?! Butler?! What they were thinking!?!) He agreed to be associated with it is MacLaine see the original, be rightly impressed, and enlist a friend (with no written credit - or talent! - to his name) to translate the themes for the American public - that both agreed to be stupid, stupid, stupid. Then he enlisted other friends to join, and they did it as friends - certainly not on the subject of this pathetically invented, all-but-sink script. <br /> <br /> I am not a fan of French cinema, but Ma Vie en Rose is a subtle, thoughtful and stimulating treatment of sensitive cultural issues. I'd like to see him get a broader exposure in the English-speaking public - and if that means an American re-make, so be it. But puh-leeze! a little respect for the issues And the intelligence of the public - and a better direction for the actors, who seemed unable to decide if they were working for Tennessee Williams or Jerry Lewis!
