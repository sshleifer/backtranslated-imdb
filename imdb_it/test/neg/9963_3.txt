I'm working on the Horror Classics 50 movie collection and THE MAD MONSTER is one of the films on the set. I'm sure George Zucco was a good actor; but this was only the second film in which I saw it, the first is DEAD MEN WALK, in which he starred in two parts. However, even good acting could not save THE MAD MONSTER. <br /> <br /> Zucco plays a mad scientist, Dr. Cameron (who was banned from the academic world because of his unethical and inhuman experiments). He believes he can control evolution by highlighting the characteristics of one animal in another. <br /> <br /> In this case, like so many others of its kind, it is a transfusion of (I assume) the blood of the wolf in human beings. His goal is to create an invincible army, which he can control through the antidote. The subject of his experiments is his hired hand, a retarded gardener, whose dialogue slows down this classic at a snail's pace almost to the point. <br /> <br /> Beyond his experiments, Dr. Cameron also complicates the revenge of those who discredited him, using his transformed gardener. However, he loses control of his subject, which begins to transform without the transfusion - yikes! <br /> <br /> Transformations of the werewolf are classic Hollywood stop-action / trick effects. Undoubtedly these were revolutionary techniques of the time; but in today's digital age it's hard to imagine that the public is scared of it.
