This 'documentary' does absolutely no light on what it would be like to be backstage during the Hard Knock Life tour. Of course, I wasn't there, but watching this movie didn't make me feel like I was. And for a film like this, it's not exactly a compliment. All the time I looked at him, all I could think was, "What are they leaving out?" When it is all over, the only rapper that seems to have some intuition is DMX, mainly because it speaks only of his dogs. A waste of time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
