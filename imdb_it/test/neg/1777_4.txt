Stinger starts "3 months ago" on the SS Newark submarine, where genetic experiments have gone wrong and the crew member is brutally slaughtered by large killer scorpions ... Go to "Camp Pendleton" a couple of months later, where the General Ashford (James Cagnard Lieutenant Williams (John Miranda) on his mission to board the Newark and assist genetic scientist Dr. Carly Ryan (Michelle Meadows), before anyone knows it a group of business scientists and marines are on board of the Newark and I am shocked to find out he mutilated the corpses of the team apart from Dr. Mike Thompson (Casey Clark) which doesn't make much sense. Sergeant Sam Harmon (Christopher Persson) is promoted and takes the responsibility of putting everyone in safety and ending the threat of the giant scorpions forever ... <br /> <br /> This co-production of Sweedish Am erica was directed by Martin Munthe and also managed cinematography and I thought it was a non-inspirational feature of creatures strictly by numbers. It's the beginning of the new year and Stinger is the first type of genetically mutated monster / creature / insect I've ever seen in 2007, we hope things can only improve ... The script of Mat Nastos is incredibly clich√© and gets it all that is the ideas of other films, in particular Aliens (1986), allow us to glimpse the isolated position in this case being a submarine, there is the team of hurriedly gathered marines including one who chews a cigar during the entire film, there are the scientists including a Swedish blonde one to try and explain everything and the evil money that grabs the corporate villain that puts the mighty dollar over human life and the final ingredient which is the monster / alien / insect or whatever, in this case there are a lot of big scorpions running around but they are not used in any unique or imaginative way so that they could also be killer grasshoppers. Yes, that's all, unfortunately, Stinger is not an alien if you understand what I mean. It's a touch more than 100 minutes long and it's really predictable even if it moves at a reasonable pace and as a characteristic of a stupid creature you could do worse, despite what many say in the abice ... <br /> <br / > Director Munthe does not stand out, it is not scary, there is a lack of atmosphere and the action scenes are boring and not very exciting. There are not many scorpion attacks and it is almost an hour before significant action occurs, the special effects are at the bottom of the scale but I've seen worse for sure. I mean, this doesn't mean that the effects on Stinger are good but I've seen worse. There is not much blood or blood, there are some mutilated bodies, some decapitated heads and someone is torn in half. The only clever and funny moment of the whole film is when the naked Swedish scientist asks her lover to light it by talking about all the money they will make from the scorpions ... However, there was a moment when I complained about tearing my hair in his stupidity while a guy tries to repair the submarine circuits and runs the lights by hitting the power / computer boards with a hammer and it works as well ... <br /> <br /> Technically Stinger is average at best and there is the usual infinite quantity of dark corridors that becomes monotonous. Stinger was killed in Sweeden in Stockholm, if you are interested. The acting was poor and there is nothing else to say. <br /> <br /> Stinger is not a great movie and it's not a great horror movie, I can't recommend it at all but I've seen worse. If you liked Stinger (unlikely) you might also like the "giant scorpions on film" with a similar theme, Tail Sting (2001) or Scorpius Gigantus (2006) (equally unlikely).
