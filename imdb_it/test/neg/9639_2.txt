It is a pity that among this film, In the Valley of Elah, Lions for Lambs and Home of the Brave all seem to be based on common stereotypes about veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Getting drunk, fighting, short fuses, fruitless marriages, kids freaking out and digging a hole in their backyard when they're drunk, etc etc <br /> <br /> It happens - yes, but not as often as one might think after having seen one of these films. I think it's a shame that these directors / producers / writers choose to crush their ax against the political establishment by representing the soldiers in such an atypical way. In this film, Kimberly Peirce didn't even throw a bone at us, like showing the new babies born while a family member was on the line, or the kid raised in a ghetto who can now afford college thanks to the GI Bill, can afford a home, or start a new business, earn citizenship, etc etc Instead, we are treated to stereotypes because the people who made this film want to show you only the negative side. <br /> <br /> A couple of problems with the movie itself: 1) someone messed up putting Phillippe in for a Bronze Star with V after leading his team into a narrow alley after being triggered by an assassin a taxi. Rather stupid, but yes, it happens. 2) The humvees had no turret armor, so we should believe that it is almost the beginning of the war, yet each soldier and their brother have an ACOG and every possible attachment for their M4? sorry, I don't think so 3) Timothy Olyphant as a lieutenant colonel? It's hard to believe, but I just checked and turned 40 in May, so times aren't too high. 4) Strikes two soldiers to avoid being sent to prison after saying that he would not return to Iraq (after learning that he had been arrested). So he's a fugitive. Then, when at last he finally finds himself and takes it back, does he keep his rank and line up with the same unit? Sorry, I don't think so. <br /> <br /> I can only describe it as a giant stereotype of the Army and Infantry. Some of the events portrayed in this film happen to some soldiers, yes. However, in this film you get practically every stereotype in the space of about 100 minutes, and in reality things are not like that for most returning soldiers. I would like the director to make a little better research instead of starting with his agenda and then making a film. <br /> <br /> Of the films I mentioned at the beginning of this post, the best is probably Lions for Lambs, which is more a comment on the sad state of Generation Y + than it is on the Wars in Iraq or in Afghanistan or the Bush administration. If you really want to see this movie wait for the cable or Netflix, don't pay cash directly to rent it.
