Buyer be careful. The Alpha Video version uses a print that escapes the description. The film was shot in color but you wouldn't know it for the first 25 minutes or so. The print that is used is so faded and decrepit that it seems almost sepia. After 30 minutes some color filters through the print, but from there to the end the color comes and goes. Keep in mind that, although it is better, the color is pale and faded. It appears that the print was recorded by a television that did not get the best reception. Adding to this disguise is the hardest delivery of lines I can remember. Even the voice above the narration is a wonder that induces. Each line is delivered in this irritating behavior. I found myself wishing for them to hurry and get the words out. For this reason I could not wait for the film to end. It's one of those good films, but I'd like someone to find a half-decent print.
