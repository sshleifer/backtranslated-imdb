Like the previous two "Mad Max" films, "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome" is no exception to violence and strange plot. Mad Max is in a post-war society where he must destroy the master blaster and take the children to the "land of tomorrow tomorrow". This is generally a deformed film with references to Peter Pan and Tina Turner, methane pigs and strange characters. I got very bored watching everything and offered nothing to me. I didn't feel inspired after seeing this movie; the only decent thing about this movie was the extremely strange characters that were chosen in various ways during the film. It's too weird for me, and it was too boring.
