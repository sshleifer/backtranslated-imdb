It is incredible that someone could have conceived this absurdity and then produced it. Which actually went on television and the advertisers actually paid to be associated with it is mind boggling. This excruciating excuse for children's programming is almost too low to comment. I burned - yes burned - all the Barney tapes that people gave to my son. Finding this terrible programming in my library was an unpleasant surprise. And where, tell me where, do they get those skinny child actors? Don't their parents make sense? Those children will be drugged before they become teenagers. Damn. The final insult is that I have to add this extra line to the review to do it on IMDb.
