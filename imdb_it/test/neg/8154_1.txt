The only thing I expected that this film didn't have was a smart, talking motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This movie is simply awful. I gave him 1 star, which means I loved it. Bad acting, bad writing, bad direction, bad fighting choreography. The only real actor in this film is Martin Landau, who obviously does a good job playing the villain, even if the character is your bad CEO. Even the so-called "twist" in the end was not a shock. <br /> <br /> There was so much to tease in this film, I loved it. And he had some impressive destructive car stunts. <br /> <br /> Like bad movies? Check this, ouch. Do you want a good movie? Not here.
