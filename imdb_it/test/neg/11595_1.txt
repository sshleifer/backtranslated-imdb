As a movie fan with the lucky job of the video store manager, I tend to watch all kinds of movies, from good to very bad. This was a film with so many lines of corn-balls, CGI-like effects and predictable plot points that I ended up laughing a lot before turning it off after 30-40 minutes. The genre of "creature feature" films has revealed pretty horrible things in the last few years (Godzilla 2000 anyone?), But this film makes me think that the creators weren't even trying. It might be worth trying just for the potential "fool me" (counts the shots!), But I couldn't in any way recommend this movie to anyone.
