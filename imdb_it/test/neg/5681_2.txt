... and this is saying something. No matter how bad a movie is, I am normally able to sit down and judge the complete film. Through this, I did about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the DVD, or maybe it was my laptop, but I couldn't hear the dialogue, even with the volume turned up completely. The sound effects were good, so with the volume turned up to listen to the dialogues, I was turning off the timpani with the effects. As much as I wanted to see this, I would not want to sacrifice my hearing for this. <br /> <br /> From what little I could tell about the plot, the film was a great flashback of the main character's daughter. It seems that the mother, a military pilot, had to abandon her ship because the only person on her ship she trusted turned out to be one of the enemies and now she is chasing her through a desert planet. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about the film was the appearance of the main character; there was something I liked about her hairstyle. <br /> <br /> Oh well, it looks like this is going to the dumpster ...
