First the easy part: this film is pretentious crapola! <br /> <br /> It reminded me of "Magnolia". And then I thought "Wow-- someone made an even more stupid and irritating film than" Magnolia ". <br /> <br /> I don't know anything about the Polish brothers, but this movie seems to have been made by someone who has learned very much in the film school, but knows nothing of the narrative: the trite elements of the plot and the symbolism of the mallet are pretty bad, but the dialogue is simply pathetic. <br /> <br /> Detailed comments would only be a list errors that should be funny or satirical, the "elegiac" parts are beautiful photos of small tables with mediocre music, the "emotional" parts are simplistic. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the film shows no love for the characters, except for a little cornball dignity in the priest. <br /> <br /> I still can't believe the respect that some people gave to this image.
