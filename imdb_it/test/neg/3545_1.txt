I remember browsing the channels on HBO and saw this. This, my friends, is one of the worst TV movies I've ever seen. There is no excitement in this film. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Drew Summers (Candice Cameron Bure) driving in a small town while in a trance. Stay with a couple who, by chance, had a daughter named Laura Fairgate who looked exactly like her and is played by the same actress. Even citizens agree that they looked the same. The fact is that Laura was killed over a year ago. Her boyfriend disappeared at the same time as she was killed, making it look like he had killed her. <br /> <br /> While settling in this city for a while, Drew starts having visions and nightmares. These visions and nightmares could prove that Laura's boyfriend is not the killer, after all. Throughout the film, you discover that Ray Ordwell Sr. (Denis Arndt) is the one who often raped her for a period of time and killed her. <br /> <br /> The film is too long and very boring. The film drags on again and again and again and again. Surprisingly, I saw another TV movie after this called (Cloned) from 1997, which was good but I'll review one later. <br /> <br /> Give this movie 1 star out of 10. Avoid this TV movie. It's not worth your time. This is the worst TV movie of 1997!
