This soft-core / sci-fi movie SOFT is what you would have if you were caught in a Fred Olen Ray movie and had taken the fun of it. Or, on the contrary, it is like a "film" Uwe Boll, but without the same ineptitude. A young inmate of the maiden chain (C.C. Costigan) agrees to pretend to be space commissioner to stop Kim Dawson's wacky plans to ... let everyone have sex with everyone else (that vile devil). Anyone who came into this movie in search of serious science fiction, well, you got what you deserved for not doing any homework on the film. First of all when Kim Dawson is NEVER the protagonist in something other than the Skinamax prick. For this, take a look at the resume of Costigan and the director, before making a whistle saying that you were expecting something else. Don't get me wrong, for a space movie / action / soft-core / titillation, this film is not YET good, but if you were expecting something along the lines of "Contact", I DO NOT pity you. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz-on-demand (Available until December 8th 2005)
