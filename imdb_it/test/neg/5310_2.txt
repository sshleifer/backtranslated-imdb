That film, although slightly imperfect, was entirely fun. About half an hour into Be Cool, I started having Hollywood Homicide flashbacks. But guess what? This is worse. The dance number is also bad. I like most of the cast of this movie, so I feel bad about writing a negative review but I feel obliged. The Rock, Andre 3000 and Vince Vaughn were in a comedy. No one else seemed to decide which kinds of movies were playing. I'm sorry for Travolta because he brought the same Chili Palmer of Get Shorty in this movie. He was totally consistent in the role, but this film is so different from the original that the character sticks out like a sore thumb. I was going to give this movie 4/10 because I like actors so much, but in the movie there's a conversation about a certain song that is so absurd that I couldn't believe that the artists had actually said it. If you want to go to the movies this weekend there should still be some contenders for the Oscar. It would be a much better way to pass the time.
