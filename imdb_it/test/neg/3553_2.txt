I had high hopes for this after reading previous reviews, but it was so slow and the plot so simple that I wondered if I had read the wrong reviews. <br /> <br /> Please, a guy meets the girl next door at 11 and they both want to love and be basketball legends. It collapses apart, but look at the other's progress. Guess what! They both get scholarships for the same university and become lovers again until his father is caught playing with a younger woman. Our young hero unable to cope fell into a courtroom concentration, but some decide how to do pro and drop studies and guess what is collected by Lakers. Download heroin because it wasn't there for him during this emotional time. So for 5 years they go their own way. Back from Spain after losing the taste for the game and our hero gets married in two weeks. Mom tells her she should fight for his love, so she professes her continuous love and challenges him to a basketball shoot. Vince gets married and wins that he loves her. Well, he won, but he decides to download another girl for our girl. The End lets them play basketball and has baby-sitting tasks. Sorry 2 is my highest score. My partner scored 0 for a soaping story for those who read Mills and Boon
