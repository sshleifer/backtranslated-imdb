This is the worst movie I've ever seen in Nielson. This movie has just what it needs to be fun. I think the reasons why the Naked Gun and similar films are that they didn't require Nielson to be funny. He simply played the straightest possible roles while the whole play was visually. But when you put it in a movie where it has to be fun, it's not. The film had only a good part, and this could be considered a spoiler by some, and that the credits were animated. If the whole movie had been animated, it could have been fine. I wasn't going to see this movie when I saw the commercials for this, and the only reason I saw it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest. This is the first and probably the only film I've ever walked on. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this film a score of -100.
