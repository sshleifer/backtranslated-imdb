I don't know, maybe I wasn't in the mood for this kind of movie, but it was full of haunting melodrama. It was too long and seemed at least moderately disjointed (granted, I didn't pay the utmost attention ...). For a more entertaining representation of the Battle of Stalingrad, see Enemy At The Gates. True, some pretentious people will mock because it's a Hollywood movie, and they don't show "the harsh reality of war" as this "wonderful foreign film", but it has a better flow and is just more fun to watch. Furthermore, there are already quite warlike "gritty" war films, and this seemed hardly amateurish. But hey, you might like it, so go ahead; it wasn't just for me.
