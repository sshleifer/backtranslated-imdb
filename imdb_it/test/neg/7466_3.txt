Antonio Margheriti, director of the adorable cult horror film Cannibal Apocalypse, elaborates this gothic flavor yellow that features the icon of the 70s with open eyes, Jane Birkin (as well as his passionate French lover of the day, Serge Gainsbourg). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, despite the inclusion of tricks like a tasty bi-sexual French teacher and a terrible unrealistic killer orangutan, Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye ends in a miserable mess that is a struggle to endure . <br /> <br /> The lovely Corringa schoolgirl (Birkin) returns to her family's Scottish estate after many years, only to discover that a maniac is killing her relatives one by one. Using the entire series of tricks of "old spooky house" (hidden doors, dark corridors, eerie cemeteries, rooms covered with candlelight cobwebs), Margheriti puts together a confusing story that sometimes promises supernatural actions, but ends with out of order that is absolutely unimaginative. <br /> <br /> 'And where exactly does the cat fit into this?', I heard him ask. Well, a rather fat moggy testifies to every murder, thus justifying the rather cool title of Margheriti. <br /> <br /> 'Gory, stylish fun' claims the DVD cover; "Boring pile of dung," says I.
