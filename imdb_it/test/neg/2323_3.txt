I saw it last night for the first time in 40 years. It's bad. Really bad. But it has enough terribly terrible moments, which are worth watching. First of all, was it intentional to make the child completely healthy? He also tells Costello in la Mae West "you will fascinate me!" as Costello does a double take. God knows what would have happened if the babysitter had been a hunk. THIS child would have seduced him in the blink of an eye! Then there is the main male dancer. He is totally inept. He roars with laughter as he jumps and dances without talent on the giant's grave, when he never looked better in his life. The two romantic parts are zeroes, rubbish. Abbott goes on to sing a line and that was dubbed by another singer. Damn, I guess he couldn't even bring a melody! Costello manages to be fascinating in his issue I Fear Nothing, and I imagine that very young children might like it, but there isn't much to recommend it. But oh that seductive effeminate boy! THIS aspect shocked me! Furthermore, the family accepted anyone on the street without referral to babysit a child! Today, the little femmebbe would have been taken away from them!
