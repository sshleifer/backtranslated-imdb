I'm sure many guys will love this movie. The only woman who shows some "ball" (unlucky pun) is made to look, talk and look like a boy, the other two women are portrayed as sexual objects with one thing in their mind: sex / being sexy sex as their only characteristic and ability (Iris) - or as little freakish princesses that the neurosis denies any force and professional authority they had before hell broke by losing (Doc). The only strength that Iris has at the end is the result of some advice from a great strong man. In addition to my negative visceral reaction as a feminist, I have to give the work machine props - and Ethan Hawke is fantastic in the very first scene. After this his performance loses strength. Empty entertainment for a brain that wants to take it easy. At least the film touches on the theme of the duality of good / evil in the criminal mind.
