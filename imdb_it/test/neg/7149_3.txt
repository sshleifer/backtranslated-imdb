I was in this film as an extra in the filming of Dallas in July 1975. Some of the things you see today, and taken for granted in movies, have been implemented in this film. The premise of the film, the costumes, the special effects, the acting. Everything was ahead of its time. He opened the door to films like "Star Wars", "Terminator", "Matrix" and "X-Men". Now people look at it and say "Well, this doesn't add to this new story of special effects ..." It had no computer graphics and like new movies these days. He had a story, a wonderful cast and an infernal director! The places were shot as the World Trade Center in Dallas, the Zale Building and the Ft. Worth Water Gardens were then the most modern and futuristic contexts in which to film. Director Michael Anderson was very creative and tried to show a perfect future that was spoiled by human desires and fragility. It was my first cinematic experience, the first of six films I went to. Just because it was shot in Texas, it is no less a wonderful piece of art as a director. Watch it again and enjoy it more. This film was the foundation that set the standard for many great movies that we now like. Well, my hand is blinking ... I have to run. Sanctuary awaits ...
