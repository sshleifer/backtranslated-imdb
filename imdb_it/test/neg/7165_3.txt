I liked some characters, but our lead was too reliant on a charming smile. I didn't care about him two. He makes wrong choices and I really didn't care because he didn't even seem like him. He seemed rather unintelligent. There were a couple of moments that provided an opportunity for some human intuition (the whale scene was interesting), but these are lost in the general malaise of the film. Love interest was acceptable and the other characters were slightly interesting, but the plot hovers too much and leaves me to be desired in many parts of the film. In the end, I wondered why I stayed that long. <br /> <br /> There are humorous moments, but in the end I didn't care. I can't evaluate the film higher. - 3 out of 10
