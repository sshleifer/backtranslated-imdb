SPOILER ALERT. <br /> <br /> This movie will ruin your afternoon or the "small morning time" viewing space. <br /> <br /> I like Marc Singer. He played good characters in the roles I saw. Until this movie. <br /> <br /> What begins as a promising film soon vanishes with the disastrous background of the CGI and the extreme closure on the dying person ... <br /> <br /> Then it gets worse. <br /> <br /> Much worse. <br /> <br /> Describing it as the acting of the hams would insult the pigs. This film goes to the bottom of the barrel of hams and scrapes the acting out there. <br /> <br /> Apart from the overcooked cooking of Marc Singer, Mike Dopud tramples and trudges around the landscape with the air of one who is afraid that he might fall on the rocks and his bad maniac "man" with eyes wide open makes him look like a moron. It is not at all threatening. <br /> <br /> George Stults looks like a deer caught in the headlights. He claims to have been threatened by the other two, but his character would have been threatened by a cashier who offered him "paper or plastic". <br /> <br /> This is really a vehicle for Nicole Eggert as an independent woman who takes her back despite attracting the wrong kind of man ... She was insignificant. <br /> <br /> This is not a remake but this is remarkably similar to "Cliffhanger" - expert guide, loses someone in a fall, straight conscience to help someone else, a missing treasure that is worth a lot of money and a band of wealthy people who use the guide. Except Cliffhanger was a great vehicle for Stallone and Lithgow. I have to admit that Lithgow stole the show. <br /> <br /> Even the involuntary comedy was poor. There were times when I wasn't sure if they were using a model with a rubber face as a replacement for Singer while trying in vain to assault the weather station (no pun). Pressing his face towards the goal post and his clumsy manner in general did nothing to help his character. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> No, seriously, avoid it. Save 96 minutes of your life and do something more constructive like looking at dried paint or growing grass. Or simply close your eyes and examine the backs of your eyelids for 90 minutes ...
