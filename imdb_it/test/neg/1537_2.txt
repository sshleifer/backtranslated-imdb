well, the script was very sloppy, the director was poorer, and the editing made it worse (at least I hope it was editing). the acting wasn't bad, but it wasn't even that good. hardly any of the characters were funny. at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other now was not used anywhere near its full potential. it was a great idea, but another good wasted idea passes. he could have finished 3 different places, but he continued to end up in a mostly predictable Hollywood finale. and what was not predictable was done so badly that it didn't matter. the ending was not worth looking at. Sandra Bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of films. even the film seemed rushed. the film was not really worth seeing, and if I had paid for it I would have been very angry. maybe I was more disappointed because I was expecting a really nice movie and I had a bad one. the film on everything wasn't terribly bad, but I wouldn't recommend it. I gave 2 out of 10 b / c I liked the idea so much and I did like a character (only I think, the super smart one). and also had some very cheap ways to cover the holes in the plot. it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap tape, it wasn't cute. however, if you see it, wait for the $ 1.50 movie or video, unless you like practically every movie you see, so I guess you'll like it.
