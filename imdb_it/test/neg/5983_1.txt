There is nothing in this that the viewer can indicate and call "good". The acting was boring and sedated. The sets and the cinematography seem to have been developed by someone who grew up in a Starbucks and tried to make the Gap spot perfect. The characters have no motivation, motivation or reason to take care of them. There is such a lack of interest and tension that it is difficult to follow trivial action and dialogue. And the plot ... if anyone finds it, I'm sure it would be boring like everything else. <br /> <br /> It's not fun, it's not romantic, it doesn't reflect on the human condition. If you want a good stoner comedy, look at Half-Baked; if you want a nice stoner drama, look at Trainspotting. The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of one is because it's fun to see some familiar faces in the mid-90s cast. Which is a shallow reason to give the film even a single star, but again, this is a superficial film.
