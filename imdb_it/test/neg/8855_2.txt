Gritty drama? Emotionally powerful? Blah! The BBC has lost a lot of time in masterful productions such as The Wire, Sopranos and HBO's Carnivale. Ok, so the budget could be much lower, but "The Street" last night was misunderstood, predictable, unrealistic, stereotyped, insensitive and a big waste of time. TV (British TV) is not as good as it used to be and is increasingly falling behind American productions. <br /> <br /> There was no sense of brutal violence on the part of the "local gangster". There was no indication that this man was "crazy" enough to beat a man he respected for so long. There was no remorse when he did this and this should not be the kind of character that would back off when Bob Hoskins called his son a pansy, in a show of "courage". <br /> <br /> I would love to have been more eloquent to express my contempt for this show, but I'm not and even if I can't prove my point well enough, believe me when I say this was rubbish, TV shock , which does not provide a true inner perspective on life. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
