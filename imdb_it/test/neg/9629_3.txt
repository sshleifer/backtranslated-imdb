So many people have loved this movie, yet there are some of us critics who have found Mirrormask incredibly uncomfortable watching and making the hole. I fall into the last of these two fields, and I will try to explain what made my toenails bend so unpleasantly. <br /> <br /> First of all, to make things clear - I like Neil Gaiman's books. Sometimes I find his wise, sarcastic humor, 'wry asides' a bit of a geek, and actually I prefer his work when he's playing it straight and leaving the lines alone - but, even with his occasional mistakes in dad's gag ', I find his creativity and imagination to be something a little special. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, one of Gaiman's strongest works is Coraline, a gothic fairy tale for children that is very low on jokes and with a high level of tension and creepiness. His latest novel (Anansi Boys) enhances entertainment and tends to read, at times, as Terry Pratchett does the Sisters of Mercy (not the nuns but the band). Mirrormask lives in a territory similar to Coraline, and when I saw the extraordinary visual effects in the trailer, I was a little excited that someone had managed to transfer Gaiman's spectacular vision and imagination to the screen. <br /> <br /> To the praise of the film, some sequences seem wonderful. However, visual effects are occasionally ruined by CGI animation that resembles a Media Studies student project. The backgrounds and scenarios are often incredible, but some of the characters' animations appear awkward, amateurish and inexpensive. In a sequence of the initial dream, the spider is magnificently animated, but the book-eating cat seems ill-conceived and very "computer-generated". Compared to the standard of animation present in productions such as "The Corpse Bride", Mirrormask from time to time seems really amateur. However, in Mirrormask's defense, the budget was tiny for such a big vision, and some creaking effects can be understood and forgiven. <br /> <br /> What cannot be forgiven is the stilt, the deer, the dart and the pretentious dialogue. The actors struggle desperately with dialogue - and there is so much of it that they are constantly hindered and stumble upon it. The conversation is made completely unnatural, the lines continually fall, and the turgid speeches seem to be the writer's only method of exposing the plot. Combined with the fact that the actors are working against a blue screen (which always adds an element of "Phantom Menace"), this makes the film almost unwatchable. In such an unreal context the actors have to work twice as hard to be believed, and overall they fail terribly. The girl who plays the main role carries out a courageous fight against the impossible scholastic dialogue of scene, and occasionally shows true promises, but it is never enough. The horrible cod-Oirish of the San Valentino character (with whom he is forced to spend an excessive amount of time on the screen) jeopardizes every possibility of this young actress who rises above the material. It seems that Valentine's work explains the plot to younger viewers and adds some lightening. Personally, I wouldn't want it anywhere near my 15-year-old daughter. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong with this movie? Answer .... Rob Brydon. What is boring (for us Brits, anyway) is that we know that Rob Brydon can act! We saw him hold the screen for half an hour alone (doing the monologues of 'Marion & Geoff'), and in the first piece of the movie 'real world' is fine. However, put it in front of a blue screen and lose all sense of character and become the worst am-dram-ham I've seen in years. Such a pity. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong? Answer ... the bizarre soundtrack, sub-Courtney Pine saxing and unheard, too in-the-mix soundtrack that never closes. God, the music is incessant, noisy, distracting, irrelevant and, if that's not enough, it has a wanky slap bass that masturbates everywhere. It makes the dialogue very difficult to listen to, but that could be a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong? Answer .... The hissing mime. In modern society there should be no place for the mime, apart from certain secret places in France. Every moment the camera focuses on the whirling idiot, whistling, moss-juggling, yogurt weaving, I understand why the inhabitants of Edinburgh get a little anxious and irritable when the time of the Festival returns again. <br /> <br /> My final criticism is that the film is rather boring. Is surrealism often boring ?? or requires its audience to slip into a dream state, Zen, accepting, or for the public to be constantly impressed by larger and grander surprises. A story with a bit of rhythm that involved characters we could believe in and should have done would have been a long way to give this film the emotional center it sadly missed, stopping the eyelids from collapsing. <br /> <br /> Finally, apologies to all those who have found depth, meaning and wonder in this film. You managed to suspend disbelief, you saw beyond the squeaky CGI, you ignored the lousy dialogue and the abyssal exhibits that ensued, and you understood the grand and imaginative vision of the producer. I wanted to, but I couldn't see beyond the flaws of the real world that dragged him down. <br /> <br /> I hope Neil Gaiman can do it well the next time, if he gets (or even wants) the opportunity.
