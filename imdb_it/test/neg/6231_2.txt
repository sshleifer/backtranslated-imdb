I love most of the Jet Li movies (with the exception of Romeo Must Die) and bought this film in a very economical three-pack with "The Master" and "Twin Warriors". While the Twin Warriors were really impressive and I was completely intrigued, and the master was a bit "Karate Kid" but also pleasant, I thought this film was TERRIBLE. I'm not saying it just because I'm used to better films. I'm saying he was almost there with "Kazaam". The fighting scenes were terrible (fuzzy cameras and no real combat) and the plot was the typical "stupid kung-fu plot". If you're going to have such a stupid plot (see "the man turns into a woman to become omnipotent and then falls in love with Jet Li"), you'd better combine with him. If you are looking for an original HK Jet Li movie, I suggest you go and rent "Shaolin Temple 2" (aka Kids from Shaolin).
