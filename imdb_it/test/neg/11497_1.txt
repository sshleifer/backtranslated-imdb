A film like that. It's just a stupid anti-Russian propaganda, with a plot completely in BS, not in any way linked to the book. <br /> <br /> It seems that the production team got more money from the people who ordered the movie, which they will never be able to get from the sale of the film. The film's plot includes references to some of the actual recent events in Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe, but puts them in a way that has nothing to do with reality. It seems that the film is a tool for brainwashing, which helps portray Russia as a place populated by evil people who always dream of killing someone. <br /> <br /> Obviously there are hundreds of stupid mistakes like using the map of the USSR instead of Russia when news is published, showing a crowd with Ukrainian flags and commenting that these are Russian elections, etc. <br /> <br /> In addition there are many bizarre episodes (ie a character runs through Red Square in Moscow and in a second he is in the center of Sofia, Bulgaria).
