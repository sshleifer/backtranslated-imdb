this film is supposedly a comedy. So where all the laughs went. I forgot to put them in, in the version I saw. Like a football movie, it's slightly funny, I think it's just a stick in the mud, with no perceptible sense of humor. Or maybe this movie is not funny. that way over the soundtrack "you're a winner" and the strange thing is that the team sucked most of the season, winning only the last two games, and the last game meant nothing as they weren't in the playoffs. So what's the point? celebrate mediocrity? I don't see it. If no one knows, please let me know. This film is not great or even very good. I give him a low 3 *
