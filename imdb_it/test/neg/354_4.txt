You will hardly know that a year later MGM put Norma Shearer in THE DIVORCEE which lights up with the technical know-how of MGM. How much they arrived in a year. CHENEY is a very lively talker. The camera barely moves. Shearer is his usual charming and Rathbone performs well in a romantic lead role. They are all very careful to speak clearly and slowly in the source of the microphone that mitigates a dramatic scene that flows naturally, but the game is a strong and amusing workhorse so you can have fun if your expectations are not too high. Oh, by the way, the plot involves a ring of high-class thieves infiltrating society to plunder their victims. There are some clever twists in the script and true love wins everyone. An Oscar nom for the best screenplay.
