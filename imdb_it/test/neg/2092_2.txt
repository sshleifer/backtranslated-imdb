"CLOSE THE FRONT DOOR" This is what I said when I was told that Blockbuster got a new movie called Snakes on a Train. Ok, maybe that's not exactly what I said, but you understand the point. I didn't need to know who was in the movie, or anything else. All I knew was that I'm renting this movie. I probably should have asked him what it was. In retrospect, I don't know if I really wanted to see a movie about a Mayan curse that causes a woman to give birth to an inner snake and spit them out of her mouth. Nor would I want to see a film that shows a guy who looks strangely similar to a pedophile version of Leif Garrett. <br /> <br /> However, while the curse might be interesting on some levels (well, maybe not), there was still the promise of these annoying characters that were eaten or at least killed by snakes. So I was willing to sit for the first hour of a very small event, apart from a Texas Ranger that forced a girl into a nice little grope to keep her cocaine, or the Hispanic shaman who sometimes loves to stab people. But then all hell broke loose and the girl started spitting more and more snakes. <br /> <br /> * NOTICE SPOILER * So in the end everything will be fine, and I am willing to overlook the fact that some of these snakes suddenly turned out to be 25 feet long. After all, people are eaten, so it's okay. But then suddenly, and I'm not going to tell you how, because it would ruin the best part, one of the snakes is about 300 feet long. Then he proceeds to squeeze and devour the train, with all the graphics of Serpentaur from the old GI Joe cartoons. Unfortunately, I couldn't create a Nemesis Enforcer connection with this film. Anyway, so you'd think that such a big snake that ate a train would be pretty unstoppable. Well, not if you know your Mayan voodoo rocks and you have the ability to summon tornadoes from the sky. Yes, that's all I'll say about it. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is bad. Really bad to the point where you could be numb after seeing this, or your brain could hurt. I didn't give it to anyone, because no matter how stupid it was, it wasn't as bad as Date Movie. So, if you like horror films B bad or built, this is the one for you. If you think this will be really as beautiful as its bigger and infamous brothers, get out of the box if you see it. And I'll leave you with a quote from the movie that should basically summarize everything. <br /> <br /> "Snakes can't get on a train!" Because it's just silly. Not like they make stops or anything ...
