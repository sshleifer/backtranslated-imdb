GINGKO BED is a strange film. He is very twisted, as if he had many ideas, but there was no possibility of bringing them all into one coherent story. Instead, we get various plots that diverge in their little separate films. Oh sure, in the end they will meet, but everything seems rather ... superfluous. Of note is the girl and her problems at the hospital. Was this ... interesting? Then there were the elements "we are spirits, so we have no physicality", which leads to the same problem that people have with GHOST, namely: if the characters have no physicality (that is, no body shape) and can phase the walls what not, how do they keep from falling on the floor, or hovering on the ceiling? <br /> <br /> GINGKO BED has been widely publicized as a new breed of South Korean film. There are a lot of special effects, but the film itself is empty and its fake melodrama will only "touch" those that are easy to touch, to begin with. <br /> <br /> 4 on 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this film and reviews of other foreign films)
