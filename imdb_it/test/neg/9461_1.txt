One of the commentators is wrong. This is not the only Pat Patterson film and he did not die two years after he did it. He shot a movie called "Electric Chair" in Pineville, North Carolina. He shot this a few years after Dr. Gore. Patterson died in the late 1970s. I know because he used my house and left a cat there !! He also sucked. This was a big problem when the movie was released. No independent horror films have been made in NC. This film was not helpful. Patterson did the effects of blood for H. G. Lewis. He was also good with magic. His gore scenes in Body Shop were really well done. The film was shot in a building that also housed a 7/11. You can actually see the tops of the walls in some scenes. The budget was less than $ 20,000 and the script looked like it was written by a child. Only Patterson could understand that. Still ... it's entertainment and it's a classic.
