I read the reviews of this film, and they were generally pretty good, so I thought I should have seen it. I'm a big fan of cinema and francophile, but I think this is another case where critics do something "artistic" or "intellectual" in something that is not. I'll be honest: it contains scenes of sexual perversion that I never wanted to see. Obviously, the piano teacher has some important psychological problems, but I really didn't want to see them displayed so graphically. The film is essentially disgusting. I mean, when I saw Requiem for a Dream, I was rejected by the last kind of scene with Jennifer Connelly, but it wasn't the kind of disgust and repulsion I felt during this movie.
