Who wrote the script for this film, the staff of Disney Studios?! This is the most bitter adaptation of any story ever! I wanted to laugh at some scenes and cry to others, and this was just because of how painful it was. I'll have to give her credit, there were some funny scenes, but I could have spent some better time with my evening. Very rarely I turn off a movie after only a quarter of a distance.
