In case you're wondering, the fool Loren C ***** n of (Cryptozoology Inafame) is a living idiot and any information he is given is to be thrown out with the garbage. The boy is simply a news cutter. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it was a predictable train accident, the actors were mechanical, the lighting was horrible and the props / clothes were cheap. /> <br /> Bobcat Goldwait would have had to act on the clowns in this film. I was physically ill after seeing ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There are insane / late monkeys who are still responsible for the films I see. <br /> <br /> Dan
