Summary: You are not completely familiar with Macbeth's Shakespeare story, but my guess is that this is quite close to the original, set only in the present time. It tells the story of Macbeth, a member of a criminal syndicate in Melbourne (?). He is an appreciated point man and in favor of leader Duncan. But he and his lady have higher ambitions than those and plan the murder of Duncan and any competition of the throne. This is a story of betrayal and cold and brutal death. <br /> <br /> Comments: A very interesting idea, I must say. To use the story but change the setting to present the time, but still keep the original dialog (?). Establishes an enormous contrast between classical poetic work and violence. Promised to be extremely violent, it is a promise that he keeps, but not in the notion I imagined. He is really very damned, but the violence is slow. Not only in a figurative sense that it is calculated, that it is also, but also literally. A lot of action is actually slowed down in slow motion and that's what puts the film on its knees. <br /> <br /> What might have been a unique force, the contrast between superfluous and poetic dialogue and extreme violence, now turns into something else entirely. Now both slow down the descent painfully, so much that sometimes it becomes boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I cannot understand the context in which the three witches act. Set to present time and reality, I imagine that such magical sorcery had no place in the film. Apparently he does, but to me it seems completely out of place. Not a subplot but a complete subplot with its rules, completely different from the rest of the film. It looks completely out of place. Surely it must have been possible to convert even that part into something modern. Perhaps drug-induced hallucinations (which I suspect the director mentions but then left too much witchcraft to be credible)? Now they only carry traits of the film that is clearly next to the story and I just waited for the real movie to start again. <br /> <br /> A clear disappointment, but maybe something for Shakespearean fans? <br /> <br /> 4/10
