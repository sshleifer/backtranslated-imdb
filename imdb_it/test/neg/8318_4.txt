I am very disappointed because I was expecting a real tour as promised in the many reviews. The script is very bad with many holes and also the direction. The director failed completely in developing every violent scene with chills and suspense. He tries very hard to follow an aspiring thriller. So I had to watch how each bullet was spent without making any sense to me. I always wondered what kind of movies I watched. Then I didn't like to smoke aggressively one cigarette after another, but maybe the film was supported in part by the tobacco industry. The end is also very disappointing. I can't understand how Jodie Foster could have been nominated for a Golden Globe in this worst role in her life. Jodie, so I really liked PANIC ROOM or FLIGHT PLAN. This is definitely one of the worst I've ever seen. 4/10.
