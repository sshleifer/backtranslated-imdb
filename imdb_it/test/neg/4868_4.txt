My Take: Political thriller routine with mediocre action scenes and predictable twists. <br /> <br /> A rarely seen political thriller, which made the box office a very poor response, I managed to capture THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY on TV right now, and while I was glad to have satisfied my curiosity to see this rare film, I didn't think this movie was all special. Considering the box office response, SHADOW CONSPIRACY is not as bad as the critics and the public reacted to it, but it is still not very good to start with and everything, from the script to the director, is quite predictable. Charlie Sheen plays the presidential assistant who finds himself involved in assassins and chases (many of them) when he discovers a deadly conspiracy that lurks among the White House staff. After a professor has been murdered, Sheen helps the former flame reporter Amanda Givens (Linda Hamilton) to discover the traitor and unlock the conspiracy of the title. <br /> <br /> But this script, written by Adi Hasak and Ric Gibbs, is as pedestrian as they are, not very different from the other White House conspiracy thrillers like in ABSOLUTELY ENHANCED and Murder of the 1600s. Sutherland, Ben Gazzara and Stephen Lang) do their best with a routine script, but rarely save him from the predictability of the script. Not to mention a ridiculous scene involving a toy helicopter, which seems too silly and out of place in this "serious" political thriller. THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY has its moments, I'm sure, some of which are very little appreciated (director George Pan Cosmatos offers some decent hunting scenes), but none of these raise this routine thriller of which there are not many gains or surprises. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
