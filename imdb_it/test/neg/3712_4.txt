If you like poor SE, (some) bad acting and a total lack of credibility, this is a movie for you. So a really cheap looking movie, but I liked it anyway. Why? Because I like that kind of movie. I can't help but smile when I see these types of films ....... What were the producers, actors, director and viewers thinking when they made this film? Don't expect an "Abyss" or "Alien", just a low budget horror / adventure movie (very). <br /> <br /> There is a nice "splatter" moment in which a man's head is shot, but for the most part, the horror is quite docile. Even the final monster is quite beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's only 73 minutes, so you can't go wrong. Maybe you can pick it up at your local VCR or watch it on TV. I'm sure you'll have fun watching it. <br /> <br /> But don't say you haven't been warned .............
