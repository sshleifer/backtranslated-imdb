In part it is bad luck for "Illuminata" that comes out after "Shakespeare in Love" because it treats practically the same themes of life as art, art as life and the magic of the theater and the same archetypal Foibles of Theater Folk, but very more heavily. <br /> <br /> There are scenes that come to life, how a game develops and is reinterpreted by the life of a writer, but there is a lot of ego by Orson Welles in this product from / directed by / interpreted from John Torturro as a vehicle for his wife Katharine Borowitz (with an adorable son cameo). <br /> <br /> Each actor has his moment literally in the spotlight, but there are many "masks" or pieces that look like nineteenth-century parlor games. Bill Irwin speaks. Susan Sarandon becomes a diva. Christopher Walken becomes a different kind of villain: a gay critic. Women must vanish unnecessarily because this is an art film. <br /> <br /> Art and direction are wonderful, even if rather dark. This should get a prize as the best use of a city theater in Jersey as a set ever in a movie. (originally written 8/21/99)
