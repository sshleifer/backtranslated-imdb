There were so many things wrong with this movie that I have trouble keeping them all straight. But one thing that really bothers me is that if Jigsaw was the one lying on the floor in the bathroom, what happens if Zep never shows up? What if Zep had been killed by Danny Gloover before he reached the bathroom? Jigsaw simply gets up and leaves? Could the boy in the middle of the bathroom not be a puzzle, but another part of the Jigsaw game? And if Zep had killed his wife and son, how does Jigsaw make him the antidote for poison if he's in the bathroom? Why does the doctor wait until the last minute to finally cut the foot? It was too late, it was six o'clock and, as far as he knew, his wife and son had already been killed, it wasn't the best time for the heroes. These are just some of the questions I asked about the movie, but I may have missed something or all of it as I saw the movie once. Please help!
