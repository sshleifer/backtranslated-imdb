I must say that this film was really horrible. the acting was on average the pace of the film was terrible as was the soundtrack and the cinematography. I discovered that I was bored in many parts of the film and the lines of the clich√© did nothing for me. the two boys who played the main roles sometimes seemed terrible and didn't bring out the emotion that was needed in the film. sometimes the child was scary and looked like a scary doll. the ending was not satisfactory, even if the film did not feel anything for the characters to finish the final. this film was boring and did nothing for me, I recommend this movie to anyone.
