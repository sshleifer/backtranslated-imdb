This tale of the upper classes that took over and rolled into their high-class misery is like a contemporary version of the Mid-Sommerish of an old Joan Crawford film in which he suffered in the mink. Here, people behave in a frighteningly civilized way in the face of adversity. A wealthy lawyer in London, (Tom Wilkinson), finds out that not only does his wife have a relationship with the local nobility, but he also killed their maid's husband in a serious accident. He vomits, but otherwise his stiff upper lip hardly believes. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Julian Fellowes, who won an Oscar for writing "Gosford Park" (this is his directorial debut), from a novel by Nigel Balchin, is quite comical although I'm not sure what part of the play is intended. It is like a return to the 1940s British films in which the characters acted as characters in books or plays rather than as people in real life. However, it is not bad at all. Wilkinson is formidable, even if you don't believe in him as a person while Emily Watson (the adulterous wife) and Rupert Everett (the top class amoral) are both very good at covering up the cracks in the material. Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography ensures that, no matter how hard the ear is, it is always good on the eye.
