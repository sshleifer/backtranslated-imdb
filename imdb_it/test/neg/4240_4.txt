This show can be described accurately as Bubble-Gum TV: chews, tastes good and lasts a long time. But, like Bubble-Gum, it can leave a bitter taste in the mouth after a few too many bites. <br /> <br /> This show presents very simple questions that take the form of simple games, like Hangman, by guessing a simple sentence or guessing articles in a short list. The callers are the competitors, and anyone can play. <br /> <br /> The questions, however, are terribly easy. There is techno music pumped in the background that is modeled in a continuous loop. He never seems to grow old, but he never adds much to the show. The hostess, however, regardless of which she is, is extremely pleasant, pleasant enough to look at and can make very funny facial expressions. I rather like that English woman. <br /> <br /> But there's nothing in this show. It is simplistic and unpleasant, although it can be fun if there is absolutely nothing else.
