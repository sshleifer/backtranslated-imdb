The film is great for Venezuelan tourism, birds, birds and other birds. Only 1 piranha. Beautiful panorama. The only highlight was the alligator seen during a very long and boring motorcycle race. The end when Caribe drowns is a Hollywood proposal. There is no precise plot. It goes from the Venezuelan scenario to an easy-to-ride rip-off to diamond mining and a ruthless hunter goes crazy for some reason at the end. A low-budget film that could have been filmed anywhere with Venezuela outtakes. William Smith is a very talented actor who has made some great films. Like all actors, everyone needs to have at least one bad movie. Don't waste $ 5.00 on the DVD.
