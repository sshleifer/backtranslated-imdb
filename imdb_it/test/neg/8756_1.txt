Most films for fear of low-cost budgets made exclusively for the 80s invariably smell like worse than old vulgar socks. This unbalanced Chicago affair, particularly depressing and amateur, without a budget, "a necrophilous necrophile merciless on the free" bloodbath serves as a depressing affirmation of this inescapable fact. A bearded cake, disheveled and with long hair, with beads and flowers, with wild eyes and the hippie pancake with wild eyes, launches into a gruesome murderous madness, graphically slaughtering the young, lustful couples who engage in a strenuous coitus each time Mansonesque's lunatic lunatic attacks. (Hmm, am I detecting a message "do you have sex and die" quite obvious and purely moralistic here? Gee, it could be, man.) Boy, this mentally unbalanced disease is really ridiculous: after stabbing his female victims, our ceremoniously cracked murderer loves making love with their newly killed bodies. (ATTENTION: possible * SPOILER * forward. Towards the end of the image the madman who copulates the corpse is abruptly interrupted by the policemen while he is in the middle of doing the unthinkable with a maiden corpse, thus causing the perverse perverse to make his way with a understandably anguished and the blustery cry of "Nooo!") Now, isn't this gonzo a true love and a half? <br /> <br /> Too bad this film is so badly made; if it had been done only with a minimum of talent and competence, it could have been a little squalid gem of an object of exploitation of horror. Alas, the crazy direction of Wally Koz, Lamar "Larry" Bloodworth's stubbornly static and immobile cinematography, Frankie "Hollywood" Rodriguez is insipid and monotonous, "hard rock", the pitifully cheap and unconvincing f / x, flat, in a seemingly disordered way compensated that acts as horribly all thumbs and unattractive non-pro cast, lethargic rhythm (too much time for the screen is perplexed exhausted on the squalid police efforts to capture the wacko), a surprisingly surprising ending (the true identity of the mysterious killer is guaranteed to make you moan of disgust), the characters uniformly boring, incessantly quarrels and positively braindead, and a constant succession of boring soft-core sex scenes that are almost erotic like watching two roommates for 90 minutes in a row they add to a deeply putrid and insignificant lameness, a soaked pot of a crunchy clinker. However, to be honest, this film has a stellar virtue: the mad dog slasher unquestionably has an excellent taste in Hawaiian shirts of a gibbous and tropical day.
