** May contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> The main character, a nobleman named Fallon, is stuck on an island with characters so shocking and deadly that he may have been better drowned. Count Lorente de Sade (pronounced "dee-SAYd") talks about his own hallucinations and sees all the intruders on the island as invading pirates. He beats the dumb servant Anne regularly and tortures her involuntary guests in the dungeons. The unnoticed laughter is provided by the giant "Nubian" slave Mantis who speaks with an accent from the deep south and helps de Sade to hunt down offenders in the style of the MOST DANGEROUS GAME. De Sade's crazed wife, devastated by leprosy, offers some truly frightening moments as she wanders into the dungeon and embraces a helpless prisoner. (This scene was seen on TV late at night by many young people who brought memory into adulthood.) The only almost normal person in sight is Cassandra, who has self-deprecation towards a science. ("I was a nurse, now I'm not much of anything.") She and Fallon plan their escape and eventually encounter a more formidable enemy than Sade and Mantis combined. <br /> <br /> was shot in San Antonio and directed by a man more competent in drawing horror comics than making horror films. (I'll say this to Mr. Boyette - show his fixation with contagion here, as he did in his comics.) It's rather like a melodrama by Andy Milligan minus the meat cleavers. The period wardrobe, library music, the abuse of the handicapped and all-round misanthropy amaze that Andy was not called as a consultant. However, Milligan did better costumes and wrote a better dialogue. The technical gaffes are too numerous to list here, but you know that this film is in trouble when you see the opening shipwreck, which appears to have been shot in an aquarium. Furthermore, a film made in Texas should have had real spiders and snakes rather than rubber. Glamious Eastmancolor gives this melodrama the striking appearance it deserves so much. Fallon's initial encounter with the countess leper is truly terrifying, as is the shooting of the film. If the rest had been half atrocious, THE DUNGEON OF HARROW would have been a classic of terror. Instead it is a fun piece of schlock that garbage fanatics will love, for all the wrong reasons.
