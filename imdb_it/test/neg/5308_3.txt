If pulp fiction and Get shorty didn't exist, this could be an OK movie. When I say this I mean that nothing about this film is really unless it is another bit of terrible dialogue or a scene full of clichés. All the lines like 'I won't say more than I have to if this from Get Shorty seems to appear in this garbage sequel, all cameos like Steven Tyler are acted terribly and are not necessary and as for Christina Milian, friend, don't get me start. Some coolest actors and actresses like John Travolta and Uma Thurman seem to want to try to be with kids and hip and have almost ruined their reputation because of this movie and frankly I think the best acting is of The rock that He plays along with one of my least favorite actors, Vince Vaughn. The man tries to be funny with him by taking the mickey apparently represents the rappers.Cedric the entertainer and Andre 3000 play another terrible double act {personally I think the background actors were better than Cedric to nd Andre} and l The only fun part of Cedric's acting, Andre and the rest of the group is the way the pants are down to the knees so you can clearly see the boxers and the only reason I find it funny is because many of people actually they do it. So, in conclusion, this film tries to be funny and fails miserably, has no new material, comedy or coldness as it copies every other film and finally the only reason you should see it is if you want to compare how bad it is for the his brilliant predecessor Get shorty. Oh yes I forgot to mention that there is a big cliché at the end.
