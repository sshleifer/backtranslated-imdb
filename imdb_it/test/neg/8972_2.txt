The stage star Grace Hayes is the star of this dark film. After years on stage, he will visit a small university town to check on his son who is raised by his grandfather. The child does not know who his mother is and when he sees him in a local malt store, he is an extravagant cretin. Part of the problem is that he is a college clown, the other part is that he is really spoiled. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the mother is really very rich and is not only financing her son's life but is a big college collaborator. So, she has the idea of ​​forcing the young man to mature. Talk to the man who is raising Peter and his allowance is interrupted completely, hoping that he will adapt to the occasion. It also turns out that she puts the screws on the school because she thinks that all these children should stop playing and be more responsible. <br /> <br /> Now this is where it gets pretty stupid. To show that they know the value of hard work, he hires some of them to sing and dance in the malt shop he just bought. Talk about being artificial !! What happens next is like a long and not particularly good show of talent or perhaps the poor version of a Judy Garland / Mickey Rooney musical! I would suggest that children try to do something else to make money ... or even sing and dance until people pay them to stop! I know I would pay them. <br /> <br /> Considering that talent is anything but talented, Peter is a bad actor and his transition from an adult to a responsible adult is almost instantaneous, everything is a bit difficult to take. It's not a good movie of any sound level, this is a dark film that should have remained obscure! <br /> <br /> By the way, it is interesting that Mrs Hayes' son in the film, Peter, is actually his real son. The only problem is that Peter Lind Hayes is a really terrible actor. He is not handsome enough to be a front man and turns out to be boring or uninteresting or even hateful. In particular, all the stupid impressions he makes are really bad and he has the charisma of jelly scraping off Spam. Despite this terrible performance, he continued to have a reasonably successful acting career. Who would have believed it if I had seen it in ZIS BOOM BAH - because here, it is welcome as the Plague Bubbles !!
