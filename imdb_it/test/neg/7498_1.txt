Hi everyone - for what it's worth, I'm in a doctoral program on Indonesian politics and I returned this semester after about a year of field work, most of them in Jakarta. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of cinema in general, so I went out as many times as I could and bought tons of local VCDs while I was there. This I saw in the theater, since it was opened while I was there, and, fortunately, it was closed shortly after. <br /> <br /> Who was the intended audience for this film? The spoiled wives and daughters of the Indonesian super elite whose antics are weak and ineffectually parodied? The vast majority of Indonesians who could never afford even a single dish, let alone a full meal, in the location of the film's central restaurant? Or gay Indonesian males, whose dilemma in the country's Muslim-dominated society is reduced to an absurdly simplistic sermon, how to respect yourself. <br /> <br /> If all this were not bad enough, the soundtrack was recorded or mixed in an inept way that even Indonesian native speakers were not able to hear many of the lines. <br /> <br /> short, if you are looking for a homosexual movie from a region of the world that seems to be among the least likely to produce such an animal, forget it. "Westler" from the early 80s, or "My Beautiful Laundrette", from the same era, has a much better success in giving a happier face to coping with homophobia, and it does so by showing no story through incessant and lengthy scenes. <br /> <br /> Overall, an unfortunate waste of money in a country that still cannot educate all of its children or keep them healthy.
