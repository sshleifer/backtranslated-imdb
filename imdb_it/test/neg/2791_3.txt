The film begins when we see a video of a huge drought in the 1930s in America. Then a brief account is shown of an Elija farmer who made a gruesome pact that made a deal with Satan, to get a good harvest. Elija hired young men to work in her garden, killed them and used as a scarecrow. He also fed the soil with their blood. Some time later 2 policemen come to visit him. One of them is shot by Elija, another kills the peasant himself ... After that, the day he is presented is shown, and a guy named Sean is told he has an old farm left as an inheritance. He decides to go there with some friends to see what happens. Little Sean knew that the next evening is the "Payback Night" ..... <br /> <br /> For me, this film had a good story for a horror movie, but the budget was small and poor special effects have been ruined it. "Dark Harvest" is a perfect example of lazy movie production. For example, we see a scarecrow (a normal boy wearing a funny and cheap mask) chasing a girl. When he raises his hand, we see a normal human skin under his glove, instead of a rotting flesh. Even the blood is not very impressive. There are some bad killings by our "adorable" scarecrows but everything is very cheap and unrealistic. Surprisingly, acting is a bit OK in this film, or rather, it's credible. Some nude scenes are also presented for fans (even a lesbian scene), but those scenes don't save her. Verdict: good music, good story, solid acting. But terrible effects, economic holes and holes in the plot slow this film down. Not really recommended.
