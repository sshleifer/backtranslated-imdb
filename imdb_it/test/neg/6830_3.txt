I would like to avoid any temptation to watch this film, it is simply boring. The characters are predictable and without mind. The killer is not enigmatic enough. There is no tension, fun, no style or even a glimmer of originality that can be found in this railway wreck. And the swamp of Hollywood clich√©s is suffocating. Oh, and you have a movie that is the hero of an IRA terrorist. Nice. And now I need to talk again to fill the ten lines. And a little more is enough? Not really, what do you say now? No, quite another confabulation should do the trick, but the Jackal is not really worth ten lines of exposure. The original was great though.
