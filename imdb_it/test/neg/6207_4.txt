This is another Bollywood remake of a Hollywood movie. Hitch ... If I'm right. <br /> <br /> The film has some great moments that will make you laugh out loud, which frankly only come from Govinda who has become a legend in Indian cinema and will always bring his A game in terms of comedies. Another bonus is Rajpal Yadav; which is hilarious as the gangster who imitates "Don", an Indian icon of cinema. Lara Dutta is an advantage ... I know I seem superficial but it's mainly because I have a weakness for her, she tries to be funny but she seems to be forced. His acting is weak ... but he continues to shine. Salman Khan is atrocious, tries to bring fresh and fascinating depths, but fails miserably, pretends and continues to scream for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> "What is not acting, is called being mentally challenged" <br /> <br /> Katrina Kaif is just bad ... not very good at anything. No charisma, no talent ... and I don't see why people consider it pretty ... The plot was far-fetched and I had a hard time believing that Katrina's character was remotely attracted to Govinda. The only positive thing is the music ... "You are my love" was the best in the soundtrack.
