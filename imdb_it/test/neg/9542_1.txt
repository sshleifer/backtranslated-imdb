Wow - this movie was really bad! Are you talking about a plot of formal and typical films? Watching this movie was like repeatedly hitting my head against a brick wall. The transitions kept trying to be cool but failed. The plot twist at the end, where we find out who the bad guy is was unexpected, but it doesn't make much sense until his monologue. Even then ... The amount of blood in this film doesn't even help. Are all these images necessary? My last complaint concerns the plausibility of the pieces of the film. Would the PD actually send a lone officer to an unlit warehouse, a subway tunnel or anywhere to find a corpse when the criminal's position is unknown? And why is the romance at the end just such a thing suddenly? It's like the writer was trying to adapt to all the Hollywood clich√©s he could. Don't waste time seeing this piece of ... something.
