I couldn't wait to see this film as if everyone was talking about it as a good horror movie, and finally a European one. So maybe my expectations were high. <br /> <br /> It starts with a quiet horror / shock sequence but leaves you immediately in the following scenes, where the plot starts to be introduced, like acting and the motivation / life of the characters doesn't turn out better than any drama " made for TV ". Continue like this until the end. <br /> <br /> As for the horror part of the film, it's certainly a good idea and a different one, but ALL the scenes are of the "seen before" type. Overall, my idea of ​​this film was that it had a good concept, which was inserted into a mediocre plot, into a acting and a less tolerable plot. <br /> <br />
