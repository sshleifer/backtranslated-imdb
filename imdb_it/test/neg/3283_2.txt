If you haven't seen "War at Home", let me tell you what you missed. It's a show about ethnic diversity and sexuality that could only have been sharp and fun in the 1960s. Where America has grown in acceptance of race, sexual preferences, religion, etc ... this show seems to be arguing with this progress. It is a step backwards in American evolution. <br /> <br /> For example, one of the ongoing jokes of the show is that her daughter WHITE goes out with a BLACK school boy. This is obviously fun to see how you can't see that kind of relationship in any mall in America. I lived in both small towns and big cities, so don't give me some kind of red excuse, blue state. Not only is this the joke, but the father, who presumably is not racist, finds this disturbing and repeatedly asks his daughter to break up with her boyfriend, who is opposed to her character "may seem like a racist, but it's just stupid" . <br /> <br /> If this were not enough, a second joke in the running is that one of the sons, and soon will be metropolitan, is ambiguous in his sexual orientation. The public repeatedly learns that it is not gay, but the father is not convinced, so he constantly avoids his son, fearing perhaps that his son will hit him, since all gays are wild nymphomaniacs, who can't control their will. The father always arrives at his son's acceptance, once per show, but usually continues to avoid it in the following episode. <br /> <br /> The only way this show can be cured in my eyes is if the exposure continues to these "unnatural events in life", open the eyes of the father a little, but it could be asking too much - and besides, with jokes like these, I'm sure we will have hilarity in the episodes to come - Episode 13, "Father votes against women voters", and episode 14, "My Muslim neighbor is a terrorist". <br /> <br /> Please leave this show, FOX. We live in a world different from the one in which your leaders grew up.
