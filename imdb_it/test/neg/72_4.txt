Oh my ... bad clothing, worse synth music and the worst: David Hasselhoff. The 80s came back with revenge in Witchery, an Italian-American co-production directed by the infamous Joe D'Amato for production and short film director (thanks for the small miracles) directed by Fabrizio Laurenti. Marketed as a sort of sequel to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series in Italy (which was nicknamed "The House"), Witchery offers some modest groceries and bad acting. <br /> <br /> A mix of ghost history, possessions and sorcery, the film bounces without a trace from one scene to another without letting serious wooden actors and hilarious mixes of day and night slow its progress until predictable final, overtaken by a severe WTF surprise climax. (I love the look on his face ...) Surprisingly Laurenti manages to gather some suspense and an air of malice in a few - very few - scenes; unfortunately for him, these few glimpses of magical cinematic magic descend quickly and effectively. <br /> <br /> The positive sides are experienced when the gore hits the fan. This department is quite effective and fun in that classic latex and red-paint style of the 1980s Italo-gore, when things were made 100% handmade and just as surprising and vivid as modest budgets could afford. I could only look with sadistic joy and some laughter at all the exaggerated ways in which hateful characters (and actors) were mutilated and abused, one by one. I just felt sorry for Linda Blair, who apparently was not left to try anything but that good old girl / woman role possessed in her career, or so it seems when she looks at her filmography. <br /> <br /> Well, folks - there's not much else to say, much less to tell at home. Don't expect too much when you spend some rainy afternoons with this, and you'll probably have at least some fun. It also helps if your rotten little heart beats in the 80's heartbeat in euros. And speaking of hearts - every film that saw David Hasselhoff stuck in a large metal object and bleeds heavily in the room and in the corridors, MUST have it in the right place. <br /> <br /> This is my truth - what is yours?
