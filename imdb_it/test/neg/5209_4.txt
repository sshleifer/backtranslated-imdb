The Isle of Death is not really a good movie, in any way, but it is curious. Imagine if Natural Born Killers had been made 20 years earlier, like a Greek porn movie Eurotrash. Here's what you get here - the picturesque story of a young British sociopathic couple who marks a deadly pace through the population of an adorable little Greek island. <br /> <br /> I save you a detailed subdivision of the plot; it is not very important except to create more and more perverse or violent sex scenes, followed by disturbing murders, often photographed with love for posterity by our charming young couple. It could have been brilliant, in his sick and bad way, but instead ... <br /> <br /> Instead, I found myself eagerly checking the execution time and the chapter index to see how long the parade was going to last. The slow rhythm and the senseless and insignificant action transform even the most perverse perversities into a mess, and connect the scenes to an eternity of boring trudges. Ah well. You can't win them all.
