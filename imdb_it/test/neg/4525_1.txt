Yet another TV show becomes a movie. Steve {The Office} Carell plays the deceived agent Maxwell Smart in such a bad movie, which makes it the worst movie you've ever seen become the second worst movie you've ever seen. The seventh rate - if you can call her who has a megalomaniac who tries to conquer the world. It's so unpleasant, absolutely pathetic. The only thing Anne Hathaway does as agent 99 is good, she seems unable to do anything else. Bill Murray has the good sense to limit the screen time to about 90 seconds and some faces in the TV series are in very small roles. The film should be partly thriller and partly action movies. It's not even Although I wasn't a fan of the TV series, at least it was light years ahead of this hit piece. All it does is drag it into the dirt and reduce the good memories we had. Thank God Don Adams is not here to see it. Keep it up in Hollywood! Keep making bad movies like this and keep sending them to multiplexes every week. No wonder the film industry is going broke. This movie is so disgusting, it's NOT even good for laughter. If this film were a newspaper, it could be used to align the bottom of a bird cage. There is absolutely no reason to see this movie. A root canal is more pleasant than this. Rating - zero minus five stars. Unless you are masochists, STAY AWAY. Better yet, do what the title says: get smart and save your nine dollars. You will be able to buy about 2 gallons of gas with it. Put it in the car and be thankful you didn't waste it going to a multiplex to see this bomb!
