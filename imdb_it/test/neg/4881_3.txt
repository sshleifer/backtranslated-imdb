I saw Bogard when he was released in the 70s. It was one of those photos that received an X rating for violence. We sneaked into our local mill and we saw it anyway. Pretty good picture. A lot of blood from street struggles, even if the cheap sound effects for fists took something away. And a lot of sex. I remember one of the first scenes in which Bogard meets this beautiful brunette in an apartment that she is showing him. Without saying a word, he takes it, puts it on the window sill and nails it. From what I remember the image sailed from that point onwards. So when I found out that Bogart is also called Black Fist and was available on VHS, I ordered it online. I was very disappointed. Black Fist is Bogard published for television. So many of the scenes I remember were missing, I was wondering if this really was the same image.
