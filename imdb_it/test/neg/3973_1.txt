Parts: The Clonus Horror is a horror all right. There are of course the bad fashions of the late 1970s. There's the really bad acting from Dick Sargent to Peter Graves. And then there are the clones themselves. Their days consist mainly of running, jumping, cycling and fighting with each other. When they don't, they learn America. Not the band America, or the song by Neil Diamond, but an America where they continue to be part of a larger society. But he is given a strange drug, so all their body fluids are drained (the General Ripper was right!) And they are put in the freezer and are waiting for Thanksgiving or Christmas when they are thawed and roasted at about 450 degrees. Oops, that's not what happens, but it would have been much more interesting than what was shown. Mario, known as Super Mario Brothers, makes a delicious cameo as a doctor who bickers with Dick Sargent.
