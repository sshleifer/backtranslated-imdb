What was this, a Zucker brothers movie? I don't mind a bit of humor in my Holmes (I'm a big fan of Billy Wilder's "The Private Life of SH"), but this version of "The Sign of Four" looks like an episode of great Guignol of "Murder, She Wrote "(from the opening credits, which are the worst possible type: a montage of scenes from the film) as directed by Mel Brooks. Ian Richardson is a handsome actor, and he certainly has the part (he is a dead man for those The Strand drawings!), But his interpretation of the character is completely wrong and overly humorous, with the silly smile he often attends (I thought that Holmes's drug was cocaine, not grass) due to his expressions of comic rigidity in carnival sequences. Not to mention the fact that when he disguises himself as an old man, it's so over the top that, despite the refined make-up, we recognize him immediately. David Healy is a film not memorable but, under the circumstances, acceptable Watson, and it's not too fool ... at least not more than the rest of the characters. Cherie Lunghi (Excalibur) plays Mary Morstan in an enlarged and naive way that came out of a vaudeville of the 1930s. <br /> <br/> In terms of history, there are some unnecessary additions (such as giving Tonga's vampire teeth an appetite for raw meat and a carnival pit as a place to live, turning it into a waste from the Dr. Moreau's Island), and we are even denied the pleasure of discovering the mystery with Holmes, since we are well informed of everything before Holmes finds out. And this is full of tired clich√©s: not only do we get the infamous slogan "Elementary, my dear Watson" (which, as every Sherlockian will know, Conan Doyle has never written), but we are exposed to these banal common places like having Hindi pop music of nothing when Holmes goes to see a white boy in Hindi clothes. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: in Britain, in the 1980s, two rival television companies attempted to create a long-standing series of Sherlock Holmes adaptations and produced initial TV films as potential pilots. One of them starred in Ian Richardson, the other starring Jeremy Brett. Fortunately, the one that made its way through several episodes was the beauty! <br /> <br /> 3/10. Farce.
