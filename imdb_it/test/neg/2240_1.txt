In my opinion, Quentin wrote and directed only one good film and this was the award-winning Pulp Fiction. However, most films, especially recent ones, have been real REAL turkeys. People continue to vote for him and his things today and I really can't understand why. There are many other directors and writers nowadays who produce far better entertainment in all aspects of their films. From this point on, I will not believe the hype that is a Tarantino movie. <br /> <br /> Inglorious was too long and worse yet you felt it. The humor was, well, minimal and not so funny. Violence was nothing new (minus the final scene). Sometimes the dialogue was very elaborate. <br /> <br /> For some, they will love this movie; and for others they will hate it. <br /> <br /> ... and I thought the Nazi argument was finally put to bed with the fantastic 2004 German film Der Untergang.
