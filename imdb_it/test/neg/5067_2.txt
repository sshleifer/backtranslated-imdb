This music is totally out of the world of the film, showing itself from time to time when the Wagnerian bomb and Lone Ranger hurry, otherwise non-existent.

The continuous interruptions with the camera angles of the explosive cameras and the single-color clips of pieces of people were rather irritating, but it is only a personal sensation. The plot is not worse than others, actually not worse than most, completely ignoring logic, reason and reality. At least no one walked in front of a machine gun for three minutes without being hit. The three high-level villains were avid.
