Where the hell do you start with the mess that is Darkhunters? First, the script is one of the worst I've ever found on a movie or television screen and can only be described as a misjudged Stephen King scam. At one point, the alleged obscure hunter Jack says that Carol, the girl who is helping the chasing man, is as annoying as "a gherkin in a burger". I would love to laugh if I was making up, BUT I AM NOT! Equally grotesque is the way in which Carol came to have the power to see how people die. A cat gave it to him as he held it in his arms during a car accident he had had as a child. THING ???????? <br /> <br /> Secondly, for a horror movie, it has no sense of tension or threat whatsoever. This may not be helped by the fact that all actions take place during full daylight. Not very atmospheric. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, acting is really horrible, Pignone proves once again that he needs to speak in his native language to be credible even remotely. Jeff Fahey is obviously on autopilot, but how can he blame him as he runs through a goddamn Humphry Bogart imitation like Barlow (Marlowe-Barlow? We've taken the joke isn't funny). The credit should go to Susan Paterno, an actress I was not aware of, does her best with the terrible part she has and puts the other more experienced actors to be ashamed. <br /> <br /> At no point has he even explained how the human character can understand what the character of Van Husen is telling her. Obviously he has a sort of degree in strange foreign languages. <br /> <br /> Among the positive aspects, a moment is well done, the car accident involving Susan. The sfx are really believable and if it weren't for the hilarious plot that the reason for this happening would have been applauded. <br /> <br /> All I can say about darkhunters is that British horror will never recover from its endless collapse if films like this continue to be made and shown. Avoid this movie like the plague, even if the plague would be much scarier. <br /> <br /> Darkhunters 0/5 <br /> <br /> p.s. the insinuations in other reviews that the film remains too clever to some are honestly hilarious. It is a weak defense when someone says "you didn't like it because you didn't understand it". The letters that follow my name make you look ridiculous, not me.
