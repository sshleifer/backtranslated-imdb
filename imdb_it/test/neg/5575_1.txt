This must be the WORST move I've ever seen !!!!! It wasn't just boring, it was "biting me with a stupid spoon". Where did you find the actors ... on a street corner? Who made the special effects ... Maaco? For God's sake I could have made a better movie with my cell phone. And if that wasn't bad enough, by the end of the movie you also had extras so you could see how stupid the actors in real life were. Who ever did the trick for the aliens ... must have spent $ 5 at your used costume shop and called it one day. And anyone in the world who wrote the description of the film on the back of the DVD case should be shot. PUHLEEZ !! It is not even 1/8% of what is described. That description is just to suck people to buy, rent or pay a ticket to see it. No wonder there was never a trailer ... you would have pushed them all away !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Bad Actors ... $ 5 <br /> <br /> Special Effects ... $ 5.50 <br /> <br /> Fake Fire .... $ 1.89 (cigarette lighter) <br /> <br /> Time spent watching this movie .... total waste! (I should sue for my time watching it)
