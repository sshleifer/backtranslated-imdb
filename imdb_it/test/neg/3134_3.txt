Bardem is fantastic. The actresses are great. But Amenabar didn't have to do it this way. It's okay to defend your position on euthanasia, an extremely delicate issue. But doing it this way makes him lose his point of view: the film is a fake, offensive to intelligence, full of tricks and sometimes extremely boring. Some scenes are advertising material, rather than a movie. Women are incredibly attracted to this mentally ill man who wants to force someone to kill him, without understanding the implications. He seems not to care about anyone and thanks them for the care, love and attention. I think Amenabar may have made people think about this problem in a different way, but the way he chose to do it I think is not correct. He could have made his point more powerful by exposing the other side of the coin without mocking it.
