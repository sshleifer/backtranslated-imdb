It is a bit difficult to believe that this came from the same director who gave us HELLRAISER. Where is the style, the presentiment and the charm? I mean, HELLRAISER is not a great horror movie, but at least it had something. NIGHTBREED is like a big ball of badly executed bad ideas. From the opening there is a problem with subtlety: the monsters are shown in the first shot! The sequence of opening dreams shows too long. Our hero does not show professional acting skills (but nobody expected this kind of bastard). There are killings that desires are more interesting. Then we have David Cronenberg. Man has never really been thought to be an actor. He adequately fills the role of the terrifying psychiatrist, but what he should have done was step behind the camera and save this disaster. Then we get to Midian, a creepy fake cemetery with a fake creepy gate. This thing is not a huge improvement over the cemetery on FLOOR 9 FROM THE EXTERNAL AREA. It gets worse when we meet the creatures in it. There is nothing really wrong with the character's design and make-up effects here (well ... except for the scalpless type, with the pointed chin and forehead and the fat type with dark circles around the eyes ), the problem is the way they act and the terrible dialogue that is given to them. Barker's photograph of the underground city is tired and this part of the story could have been improved much better. Some might call what follows SPOILERS. After our hero dies and becomes "nightbreed", we wait around to see what it will turn into (we are talking about things that are flying and werewolves), but when the time comes for him to change it seems that their hero is too cute to give a decent design. With the turning point in Cronenberg's "character", the story becomes less interesting until the battle between jokes and rules (which is only bad). Barker's mythology disappointed him here. There is no genius and little originality behind any of the NIGHTBREED. The image could have used a bigger budget, a serious script and a character design that wouldn't let you say "oh ... oh, what a lame". What a waste. Not scary, not cold, not even very dark, just weak.
