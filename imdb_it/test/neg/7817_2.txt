This is the first time I post a comment for a movie I haven't seen until the end credits. The reason is simple ... people must be warned: this is one of the worst comedies of the new millennium. Usually I was away from a good deal of tacky comedies, but I thought it was watchable. An unpleasant decision based on other comedies by Ashton Kutcher that were (semi) funny as A Lot Like Love and Guess Who. <br /> <br /> Where those two films had their charm and laughter, this one had none (and I mean nobody !!). The acting is horrible, especially the "boss". Tara Reid was not a surprise, how dare you call yourself an actress ?! The premise is subtle and the plot does not thicken at all. It's not a problem if you can keep it funny and / or sweet ... but as you've probably already guessed, this wasn't cast at all! The script seemed not to be completely finished and I wouldn't even be baffled if the director had rewritten during the shoot. My dog ​​could have written a more coherent, serious script. And he isn't exactly Lassie either :-). <br /> <br /> Stay away from this tripe even if you like stupid clumsy comedies sometimes (like I do). This low quality movie will not be appreciated by many ... <br /> <br /> I (almost) never give one so then ... to 2.
