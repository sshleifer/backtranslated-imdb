Given the budget and inexperience of everyone involved, Livin 'tha Life could have been worse. Jamal wants to be Chris Tucker (which I've always found very boring), as one previous commentator noted, but Peanut (Edward D. Smith), while some of his (over) reactions go on too long (a director's problem) , has some relatively subtle and amusing moments, such as when he is trying to instruct Jamal on the correct method to smoke a joint with a friend. All the while, he is usually more balanced and self-possessed than Jamal, who may have been the germ of a beautiful exploration of the contrasts in the relationship, but it was not developed very far. <br /> <br /> But the inexperience of the writer / director / director of photography / etc. it is not an excuse for his carelessness. Have you ever seen a movie? Faces are important! Have you ever heard of a close-up? Ed Wood could also make a close-up. I don't think it's a budget problem. I could only give a general description of how the actors are made, and not just because of close-ups, but because of lighting ...! Lights for outdoor shooting may be too expensive, but you can create a spotlight with pieces of paper! This would have required moving the camera closer to keep the reflector out of range, helping to solve the foreground problem at the same time. If it is too technical, you can turn the actors so that they are not in the shade, or you can expose for the shadows, and if it had not been shot in L.A. I would say take advantage of cloudy days. Needless to say, the films this one steals are all, with the possible exception of Weekend at Bernie's, better than this, but Livin 'tha Life would have left a much better impression if it had not surprised the observer the right way to seize a glimpse of whatever the human element could have been. <br /> <br /> PS The scene in the barbershop is simply stupid.
