"It's as if this city had the power to suck your brain out of your head." -Patti <br /> <br /> Patti (Christina Ricci) is a sarcastic teenage girl, bored by her small town all too common. Bored until a woman is kidnapped and finds what she believes to be a clue to the fate of the poor woman. Now, with the help of his precious cat `D.C. and an inept FBI agent (Doug E. Doug) must find her. <br /> <br /> That Darn Cat is a bad movie. He is quite foolish and has a humor that often falls rather flat. There are, however, some buds of talent. Doug E. Doug was good at Cool Runnings. His performance of "Senga" was really fun. Here he is wasted as a mumbling FBI agent. It has a good scene when it mimics the cat, though. Micheal Mckean plays Patti's father. His character must be the most understanding parent to ever live. This poor boy has his expensive crushed cigar, is arrested for taking his cat and is abused by his ruthless wife and STILL doesn't get angry with his daughter for causing all his problems. I wish my old man was like that. The only real performance is that of Christina Ricci. He has fun like Patti, always annoyed, but his occasional bad dialogue makes his performance lower. You could also recognize Peter Boyle (Young Frankenstein, Everybody Loves Raymond), the old lady of Wings and Cliff from Cheers, in this movie. This is a film that probably all these actors will want to forget. Even the cat is not very good ... I can't really recommend that damned cat from 1997. Some children (under 8) might have some fun, but everyone should look elsewhere. If you're looking for a good Christina Ricci movie, I suggest Addams Family Values, The Opposite of Sex or Sleepy Hollow. If a fun family movie is what you're looking for, try Snow Day instead. <br /> <br />
