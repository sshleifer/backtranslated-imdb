(Only the light spoilers in here) <br /> <br /> Stealing Sinatra is a half-act comedy about dimwit kidnappers, dimwit victims and some other side stories thrown away to eat some time. <br /> <br /> You will see some poor performances throughout this movie. The drama is forced and humor makes no sense. Whether you're looking at the kidnappers who threaten the victim who won't shut up, or the father of a victim who responds to the criminal's death threat with "Take care of some tea?", None of this is credible. This fits quite comfortably in the "animated film" category. <br /> <br /> In addition, you will hear a repetitive goofy piece of music in almost the entire movie. It is rather unprofessional and adds nothing. In reality it is just a sad attempt to make a painfully little funny movie a little witty. <br /> <br /> However, if you can look past and suspend a lot of disbelief, you may be entertained by the appropriate storyline. <br /> <br /> I voted 4/10.
