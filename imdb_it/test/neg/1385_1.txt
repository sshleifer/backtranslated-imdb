Right, I can no longer watch Comedy Central just because I can't stand to watch repeated advertisements for this show. I'll tell you the truth, this is a terrible sight not because it offends me, but because Carlos Mencia is one of the worst comedians I've ever seen. I'd rather watch Carrot Top make an impression than George Bush than watch this trick without skill. And to believe that he defines himself as the greatest. Even if he hasn't stolen the jokes, he's still bad at telling him, he's out of time and not original. I remember in a joke that he said "Why do whites go camping? Does he pretend to be poor for a week?" Now what do you mean? That all whites are rich? Another one that I don't understand is when he made a price skit is right and told a fat guy "You should know how much a fridge costs, you're fat" and the fat guy had the saddest expression on his face. But what does it mean? Is that "fat people" always looking for refrigerators? These are just the two I've seen in his commercials, God knows what his show is like .. <br /> <br /> This show falls in films like Epic Movie and Date Movie ..
