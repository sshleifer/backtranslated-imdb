This story has the potential of a good movie. The difficult choice of love against money and anguish and the regret of making mistakes. However the film was ruined by the horrible mixture of Robert Redford as the villain offering $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Demi Moore. Like Redford, he has to pay for it. Redford's beautiful boyish appearance and the allure of all Americans do not reduce him as ugly, unbearable, threatening. Redford's acting skills aren't enough to make his character threatening. I can see it now, $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Robert Redford. OK, the lady says, but you'll have to give me some time to collect the money. Jack Nicholson would have been as perfect as the sleazeball.
