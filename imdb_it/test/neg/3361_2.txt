Hi, I'm Derrick Cannon and welcome you to the first cannon review show. My film for this week was questionable, which path which film, which excellent epic four star would I have chosen, guess what I decided to shoot an eighty and go to the other path, I decided to review a film so atrocious that it is totally killed what could have been a truly unique concept. The film I will review today is Jack Frost Two revenge of the killer mutant snowman. The stars in this film include Christopher Allport as Sam Tiller, Eileen Seeley as Anne Tiller, Marsha Clark as Marla David Allen Brooks as Agent Manners, Sean Patrick Murphy as Captain Fun, Ray Cooney in role of the colonel and Scott MacDonald in the role of the snowman Frost. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly fun Jack Frost (loved in the carrot scene), but it's even harder to believe that this is exactly the same cast. The film was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and Captain Fun was introduced. What was the point of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie? The only possible reason I could see was that they wanted to give us a character who was a total murderer snowman fodder. Sam Tiler seemed more paranoid than he had done in the original, his stammering against antifreeze was one of the most pathetic shows I had seen in a movie. His wife, however, was one of the few bright spots. He played his role as the main woman to the end. He was a voice of reason in the film of pure idiocy. The scene where he discovers how to kill snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the film. Ray MacDonald once again did a great job as Jack Frost despite what he was given. Had it not been for such weak characters, he could have been immortalized as Chucky, Freddy and Jason. Laugh if you have to, but when it comes to this, Jack Frost had sperm, he had humor and, above all, he had an undoubted vein. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been much more, it could have been was the continuation of a great franchise, instead all plans to make a Jack Frost three have been canceled. <br /> <br /> This film gets a two out of ten for me, and it is fortunate that it also gets one.
