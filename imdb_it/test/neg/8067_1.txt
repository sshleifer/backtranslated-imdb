... never! (I always wanted to write it :) Many years ago (in 1993, as I remember it) one of my former classmates convinced me to look at what he called "an epic masterpiece". To date, the worst film I've ever seen stands out for me. Acting, history, effects: everything is bad. Unless you're one of those people who loves garbage, you should go over it. However it's likely that since you're reading this, you've already seen it. <br /> <br /> Of the almost 500 movies this is the only non-short one I gave at 1/10. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen any other low-budget Asian warrior films, so I guess there are even worse things out there! Scary ... <br /> <br />: P
