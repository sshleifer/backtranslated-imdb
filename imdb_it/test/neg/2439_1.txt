Laura Fraser creates her ideal man on a virtual reality machine and, suddenly, comes to life, of course. Oh, that jolly japes doesn't happen on a Britcom flop, so Day-Glo is so bright and so sad that it makes the 1980s American animated film Weird Science almost decent. The sex-obsessed script is by The Sun film critic Nick Fisher, a former teeny-mag "dying uncle" who obviously never saw an episode of Smack The Pony in his life; shame, because then he could at least have been in it with a scream of writing female characters who were recognizable members of the human race. This lot of twist has emerged all too clearly from the virtual brain of someone who imagines he is funny. Suddenly, the thought of Iran's new wave cinema is somehow attractive.
