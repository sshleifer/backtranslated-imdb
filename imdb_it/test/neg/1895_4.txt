While the film was beautifully filmed and reasonably well played, the script was boring. struggling and nothing we haven't seen before. Not once in this film have I ever had the feeling that these people were really in danger. No appreciable climax and a very standard resolution. I believe that this type of film has been exaggerated and a period of rest should be given. After all, didn't everyone on the planet see "Schindler's List"?
