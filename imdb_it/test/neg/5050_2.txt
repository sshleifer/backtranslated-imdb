It is a pity that high-quality actors and actresses are involved in pure shit, probably because they have been offered a great deal of money. None of Helen Mirren's best career moves. Acting "teenagers" is simply terrifying, not helped by a script that is in part simply inept. <br /> <br /> Most of Kevin Williamson's work is above the box office average, but this is really below average. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you watch on TV when there's nothing better and you've drunk half a bottle of wine and you're waiting for the pizza to be delivered so you can drink the other half .
