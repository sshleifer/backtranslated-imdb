It doesn't take balls to make fun of retarded people. Having to listen to Mencia insist that it is courageous to make "retarded" jokes is intolerable. Also, it doesn't take balls to bite the chapelle show. The racial game shows, the racial olympics, it seems that many of the skits are just Chapelle Show skits, which are simply less fun. <br /> <br /> But the most annoying thing on the show is its insistence that it is marching to the beat of its own drum, when in reality it is marching to the beat of many overtired drums that have been played many times. <br /> <br /> I hate this show. I hate that he presents himself as a voice for Latin America. <br /> <br /> And no Carlos, I'm not trying to convince you. If people like it, keep it up. But personally I think it's a bad show.
