Having read this story some time ago I was very excited to see the film. I read the book again. It's one of my favorite books by Nicholas Sparks. What I think makes history is relationships. This was the negative point for me in the film because I think the reports were little expressed in the film. I have no idea what is the point of changing the roles of the main characters (the characters of Tim and Alan). The film has by no means captured the relationship between John and Savannah. Maybe if you didn't read the book you might like this movie, but I thought it was so boring compared to the book. I thought Channing was a great choice for John, but I had the feeling that he would bring all the young adults to see him, so I think he was more oriented towards them. The ending cuts the whole point of the book, so I wasn't happy with that. I was hoping the film was more like the notebook or a walk to remember and the way they captured the books. I feel like I've lost a Friday night and $ 10 in a sweetened romance, not at all the story I expected to see.
