Not so close as the film "Guinea Pig" was inspired by ("Flowers of Flesh and Blood" or "Devil's Experiment") and not transmitting any real philosophy, this video feature, which barely has length, adds hardcore sex ( with the censorship of the mosaic) to his inspiration. The special effects for make-up, which include cutting the stomach and gutting it, are quite good, if illuminated. The amateur feeling of production is a distraction. It all seems cheap and lazy. The lighting is hard and the sound and the editing are sloppy. The simple story involves a porn actress who ends up with a real snuff movie. Just when you get tired of being abused, the real abuse begins. In the scene of the film's hero, an actor cuts the woman's stomach open in a graphic foreground, shoves his member into it and proceeds to do his thing. I did not find "Psycho - The Snuff Reels" shocking. On the contrary, I found out that it was a desperate attempt by one-up "Guinea Pig" amateurs and his blood. It is interesting to note that this was distributed by Aroma, one of the leading fetish producers.
