This film is dated in many ways, it's sensational. You can laugh or shake your fists in anger. <br /> <br /> This film deals with many problems in American history, but with the typical white-male-Christian-American paternalism: the main character is one of those who-I-can-all-and-have-me -I love-for-me-to-type-of-guy. It is so pompous and should not be taken seriously at any time. What a horrible creature! His wife is a small woman weak for the first part of the film and a character still very whiny, but stronger at the end. Too bad you still forgive his presumptuous ways after he left her for the second time. It's just sad that the character hasn't changed at all. Even if she should represent a strong and independent woman, in the end, she is consumed by concern for her husband in search of adventure. So 2 out of 10 feminist points between us (and those are just for good intentions ...)! The problem of Indian suppression is treated fairly well, but there is still that paternalistic story. And the fact that all African American characters are typical stereotypes makes the film even more hypocritical. I was so angry most of the time! So a point (to prove) from the civil rights movement. <br /> <br /> I know the film was made at a different time. I love old movies and I have a lot of patience with some of those old views. But this was simply disgusting! <br /> <br /> What saves this film are the parts without the main character. Mr Dix's acting is exaggerated and smug. Maybe that's why his character is so unpleasant ... I liked the performance of Mrs Dunne, even though her character bothered me sometimes. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that the famous land run scene was incredibly over. And the way the Oklahoma settlement was portrayed made the film worthwhile. It is simply amazing how civilization arose from the dirt and dust of the 19th century. And I don't understand the problem that some have with that church scene. I thought it was pretty funny and fun. Maybe it didn't have to be, but I liked it. So 9 points for those scenes and the impressive storytelling of the development of the state of Oklahoma. This makes a total of around 4 points!
