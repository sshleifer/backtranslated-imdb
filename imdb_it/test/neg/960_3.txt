I'm a fan of the original 50s and about 20 minutes into this remake I started thinking that it would be as good as the original, but it wasn't. The reason for the murders was incredibly stupid. Two of the movie lovers turn out to be brother and sister - excuse me as I jump. The main character stops in the middle of the movie to have sex that doesn't make sense considering the situation in which he finds himself. If the filmmakers wanted a sex scene, they would have had to put it first in the film before the main character (Dexter played by Dennis Quaid discovered that he is going to die and that he is accused of a crime: there is a reason why the scene of the sex.At the beginning of the film Dexter does not live life to the fullest so he is not interested in sleeping with Meg Ryan.I still feel it would make more sense that the sex scene had been cut or first in the movie and that the two brothers had not been lovers. <br /> <br /> One of the stupidest parts of the film is about a shooting, a couple of people are killed and a person is run over by everyone within 15 meters of a crowded carnival and still NO ONE TO THE NEWS OF THE CARNIVAL !! Also in the scene is the tar the university where the film takes place is built on If you fall into the tar, sink to the bottom and in a matter of seconds Not only is it difficult to believe that things sink so quickly in the ta r, but above all those who build a university on bitumen wells. I would like to say more about how stupid the end of the film is, but I don't want to put a spoiler in my post.
