You must be a fan of the little man but I found Burlesque on Carmen boring, without fantasy and absolutely not funny. <br /> <br /> Chaplin is telling the story of Carmen and plays an important role as Don Jose. It's a story about the men and women they love, even if it's not clear why they would love a woman like Carmen, while playing men against each other. <br /> <br /> As I said I didn't think much of Chaplin made dozens and dozens of better films, so you can leave this behind. Oh, and I'm curious to know what the difference is between this movie and the 1915 version ... or is it just an IMDB error? <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10.
