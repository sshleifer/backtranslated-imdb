This is undoubtedly the worst follow-up I've ever seen, and I've seen many to make this conclusion. The plot is simply ridiculous. I can take a ball and even run in a field. Why can't I play in the Superbowl? Yes, I know that this film was for children, but there are only a few plots that even children can make are totally stupid and unrealistic. The first Air Bud movie was pretty good, but this was a total accident. Disney is losing it. If you controlled who won the Razzie Awards, I'd give this a couple. Good day! =)
