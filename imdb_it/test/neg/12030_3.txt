This horror movie at home tells the story of a guy who kills people using the motif of Edgar Allan Poe's stories. The local police cheated the case for a few years, so now the FBI has taken over. They know exactly who he is, but apparently no one has thought of going to his house, because that's where he's around, running around in his vintage clothes and torturing casual clubs. So the FBI girl is kidnapped, which involves her father, the former local police chief investigator. To top it off, a bunch of wacky college kids decided to camp at home and smoke some grass. <br /> <br /> Mostly, the FBI agent ends up screaming and running like a child and not even one of the burly college boys thinks about stopping and walking around poor Poe. Mostly exaggerated and sometimes underestimated, Dead End Road smells like a low-budget, cast-with-friends production that has foolish points too numerous to cover.
