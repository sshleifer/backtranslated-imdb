This show demonstrates the depths to which the pre-watershed drama of British TV has sunk. With these boring scripts, mediocre acting, poor plots, terrible dialogue, one is forced to watch a DVD of every old ER episode to see the drama of the excellent hospital. <br /> <br /> None of the actors employed on this show seem to be able to really act! <br /> <br /> If you want a low quality but easy to absorb from the soap opera style TV, this is the show for you. Personally I like something with more meat on the bone. Unfortunately, as with all the other British debtors, I am financing these waste.
