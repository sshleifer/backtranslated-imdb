Hmmm, started well, as a hybrid of X-Files and First Wave, unfortunately, if the simple notion of Da Vinci's lost time machine is absurd to you, then the final "battle" between a man with a gun and 4 monks of the sixteenth century armed to the teeth with automatic weapons will seem positively ridiculous equaled only by the poor acting, by the bad script and script, or, in other words, by laughing captain of factor 5.
