Unlike the other spaghetti westerns, this has characters that have almost a meaning and that can be identified to a certain extent. It still has the silly shooting of other western spaghettis. A spaghetti, by the way, is another word for a Westerner with no plot, without characters that could be of interest, and stupid shootout that makes no sense at the time, and that relies on great music to make the audience feel something . This is more carefree, like those made together by Bud Spencer and Terence Hill. They too were superior to the stuff made by Eastwood and others, which the sado-masochists show to their friends, if they have the chance. It seems that everyone had a lot of fun making the film too. It was nice to see a giant actor like Gilbert Roland, who wasn't even mentioned in the movie box, yet he was clearly the biggest name. His character was very funny. In the end there is a three-way stall, which is much higher than the one that falsifies (the good the bad and the bad), simply because the characters are at least a little funny and a little identifiable. It's not a good movie, but it's a bit of fun.
