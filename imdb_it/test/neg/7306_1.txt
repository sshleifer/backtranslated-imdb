It was (foolishly) with a degree of pleasure that I sat down to watch what a friend had promised would be the worst / best cinematic experience of my life, the mighty 'Roller blade 7'. 2 years later and I'm still in therapy. Oh yes my dear friends, it is really THAT BAD. Obviously they got about 40 minutes of footage in the jar and then decided to use that movie endlessly and repeatedly due to the numbness of the brain. My only fear of the kind of post-apocalyptic world described in this turkey is that somehow, somehow, a print of this abomination would have survived. Truly the living would have envied the dead.
