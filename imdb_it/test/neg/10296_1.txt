Sorry for all of you guys who are not familiar with the Lynch. <br /> <br /> My sister-in-law asked me how you can only make a disturbing movie. I told her that if her daughter and her father didn't want to make these films, they would have had to go around killing and cutting people to pieces instead. <br /> <br /> After each Lnych film I tell myself, once again a half hour lost of my life. But next time I'll check the name of the director or producers. <br /> <br /> So, you don't want to be angry with yourself and waste time, don't watch it. But if you think you need to kill someone, look at it, it's probably a better medicine than spending your whole life in a prison for mentally insane.
