A lot of good things could have been done with this film using essentially the same sets, plot devices and plot. For example, why not plant a seed of Erica's ability before the murder of her lover? Why not develop the relationship between Erica and the policeman slowly and convincingly? Perhaps contrasting the metamorphosis of Eric by including in his life some other aspect, relationship, etc. Post-event now refusing? Why not hurt an innocent spectator to underline the error of Erica's actions. <br /> <br /> Instead, TBO exploits the fantasy of revenge at its highest level, giving an insincere word of mouth to "don't do it at home" messages entered just to allow the film to be considered legitimate. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Jodie Foster. After showing some films in films such as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, NELL and one in which she plays the ordinary mother of a child prodigy, Foster slipped into a series of roles in which she plays the same heroine with a hard and tormented tip that goes beyond herself Evil . This is fine once or twice, but I'm getting too used to his "fight against flight" first floor. TBO could have used a younger actress or one who more convincingly accepted being a woman in her forties (instead of 40-something in which Foster plays a younger woman). <br /> <br /> TBO is a film with important actors, funding and resources that manage to descend to garbage.
