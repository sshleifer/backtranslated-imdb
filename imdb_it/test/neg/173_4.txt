It was really necessary to include embarrassing footage of non-participants in a documentary. And why all the silly dog ​​scenes, and then the repetition of all the same silly dog ​​scenes? This film begins with a great promise: exhibiting international politics and wine business. It started off great and included all the right characters. But production is a mess. The points are started and developed most of the time, so they were never completed or remained with dangling ends. Very mediocre and confusing camera work and modification. They should have used subtitles for Christie's English mumbler. <br /> <br /> Too much stuff and not enough for a documentary. <br /> <br /> Probably honored at Cannes because of the beating of the United States in my opinion there was too little). <br /> <br /> We left at 2:00 am, I have no idea how much time has passed.
