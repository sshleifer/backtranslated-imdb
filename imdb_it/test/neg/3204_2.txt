(SMALL SPOILERS) I just bought the DVD of this movie yesterday. I saw it with my friends and I couldn't believe what had happened. <br /> <br /> In the first 3 films, the little creatures had at least a sense of humor (especially the third film), but not only the creatures almost never made an appearance, they were not funny! They never made me laugh. I must admit that the story started well. After an hour passed I remembered that the Critters films were always very short. So I thought to myself, "where $ ^% # $ are creatures?!?!" They were barely in this movie! If that didn't make me angry enough, the guy named Ethan was sitting on his bed after Charlie "murdered the ship" and knew the creatures were still on board! In the first movie the Brown family was scared to death. But here, Ethan didn't even care! It was as if the creatures weren't even a threat! <br /> <br /> Now what I'm about to say could ruin the ending, but I'll say it anyway. In the first film, in the end, they had to face the giant critter for a final battle. In the second there was the great ball of critics. In the third movie, the critter with his burned out bean spindash (from Sonic the Hedgehog) and was about to attack the little boy. But at the end of the fourth (which is what made me most agonizing), the bald accuser accuses Ethan, and Ethan kills him as if it were nothing. <br /> <br /> Now something I really don't understand what happened to Ug. He was one of my favorite characters in the first two. Then, after 50 years, it's bad. It was very disappointing. Not only that, but wasn't he a bounty hunter without a face? Why was he still "Johnny Steele?" Furthermore, he seemed to have a different personality. He seemed much more intelligent and not as monotonous as in the first two. <br /> <br /> Being someone who really enjoyed the first two critics films and loved the third, I give Critters 4 to 2/10
