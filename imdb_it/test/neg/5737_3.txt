Definitely not your typical police, Redneck never worked for me. The film tells the story of a jewelry robbery gone wrong and a boy who is involuntarily kidnapped in the process. In their attempt to get away, the thieves leave a bloody trail in their wake as they come up with a plan to redeem the boy. The plan is never expelled since the thieves are more intent on reaching France and the boy is willing to stay with them. While I could mention a number of problems I had with the film, I will focus on the most obvious ?? the Memphis character played by Telly Savalas. From his work in The Dirty Dozen and Kelley's Heroes to other Italian films such as Crime Boss to his most remembered role as Kojak, Savalas was a winner. I always thought of him as a superb client. Unfortunately, Savalas is almost unwatchable in Redneck. Did the director turn on the camera and teach him to act as psychotic as possible? It may not have been too bad if his actions were done in the context of a plot I cared about, but here he seems to act oddly for the sake of being bizarre. It seems to be random madness. And what is that accent? Savalas could have been a lot of things, but Southern is not one of them. It even seems ridiculous to try the accent. Besides that, I found it uninteresting for the rest of the film. As I indicated, the plot never attracted me. I just didn't care what was happening. And the idea that the boy is so quickly attracted to the criminal lifestyle does not sound real. As for the other actors, Mark Lester is almost as bad as Savalas and the usual Franco Nero is not much better. Three actors of "name" and not a good performance between them. To make matters worse, I think the director filmed many night scenes with nothing but the glow of his watch to light up the shots. I couldn't tell what was happening. Characters I hate, a plot that I don't care about, and a production value that has failed? little wonder that I gave Redneck a 3/10.
