Well, surely he stunned me - I can't believe someone made another Australian film that is even more boring than Somersault. The story is not plausible, the characters, with the exception of the characters of Friels and Mailman, are unlikely and wooden, Tom Long possesses a VAST series of facial expressions: happy and not happy, and the "sex scenes" that could have being very opposite and disturbingly erotic, he would have been at home in a low-budget porn movie. <br /> <br /> This is the first film I saw in 30 years of cinema that took me to the edge of my place ... ready to get up and leave. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the promotional poster.
