I will never go on another Tarantino movie. The whole film was useless. Both my wife and I regret the fact that we don't get up and go to the first indication of what the movie really should have been (which is still difficult to determine since it was such a ridiculous plot ... blood, guts and violence seemed be the only real theme), but we kept hoping that there could be something redemptive just around the corner. Unfortunately, it wasn't there because there was nothing that made sense! We, along with many other people in the audience, left the theater muttering "that was disgusting", "what a waste of time", "I should have gone out", "where was the comedy", "that was pathetic", etc. In reality it has made us, the public, the voice our disgust and the feeling that we have just been completely robbed. The only thing of merit in the film was the costume designer and the acting ability of almost everyone in the film ... there was not only a plot / script worthy of their talent. I consider this a 1 because there is no 0. I cannot understand how anyone can judge this higher than a 0!
