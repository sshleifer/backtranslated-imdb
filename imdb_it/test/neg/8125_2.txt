I tried. I really, really tried to think of something that deserved a rating above two. It's not that I don't "understand" it - I'm a big fan of Asian cinema. The truth is that the film is childish in construction, long-winded and painfully disconnected. I suppose if you are from the school of thought of Alfred Hitchcock "Don't tell him, show them" then you could try to appreciate this movie, but you would still have difficulty. <br /> <br /> First of all, The Terrorizers proves the flow of consciousness in the style of Jean-Luc Godard and fails in this. Edward Yang seems to understand the basics of the technique, but he is very unqualified. (Maybe it gets better with age, I don't know how I haven't tried other Yang films yet.) The point is that it uses the lack of "show, do not tell" that actually only serves to interrupt the procession of history. Of course, he gets some visually appealing images, but they don't draw the story together, and they don't help make it better. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the main concept behind stream-of-consciousness and "show, don't say" is that with the right images, the right drama, repetition and close correlation, the viewer will be able to make his own inferences; not to say that these will be the correct inferences, but those can be modified as the story progresses, and every director should strive for some of this kind of interaction with the public. In this, Edward Yang disappoints deeply. The viewer is constantly on the periphery. There is no reason to be attracted, no reason to consider the characters or their motivations, no reason to be emotionally involved, and indeed, no reason to be alert. <br /> <br /> Finally, Yang gets lost in the story he wants to tell, not the story that the film itself tells. His art moves in one direction, but like a big dog he can't control, he is constantly pulled by lead, trying to bring it back to the path he wants, not the one he follows naturally. The most striking example of this is the ending. The ending really should have happened at the time of her husband's revelation. The end of the book on which the film is focused, (and by extension, a possible ending for the film) has already been said to us. If Yang had chosen to finish at that point, he would have had a much more powerful piece, leaving the observer pending - does the story unfold as the book says, or does Yang's "real world" play differently? Asking the spectator to think about this is the kind of interaction of the spectator that Yang sorely needs. Instead, he continues to tell the story he wants to tell, straining the natural conclusion for the sake of what? For the pure pleasure of dwelling on a main character - we didn't need to know more about her in a superficial way, and Yang wouldn't have felt the need to tell us if he hadn't turned her into a patina instead of worrying about making it a character more engaging and profound to begin with. <br /> <br /> Why else does Yang prolong and torture his film? To get a little more of those "visually appealing images". The film really suffers. He wants to finish, he has a conclusion that seems natural and leaves the viewer restless, but instead, Yang pushes forward. Instead, Yang builds a complex ending that guides the viewer, forcing him to continually ask "so what?" The first ending, the one that Yang ignored, was positive. The second ending, well, my thought was "so what, who cares?", Because it's not like he was introducing something that hasn't already been put into the plot ... but the last ending? It was really a waste of time. Not only did the "real" ending leave me disengaged, but I also felt that it was an affront to what the story could have been. Yang sacrificed a potentially good story for the bubblegum-melancholy-noir conclusion he had always insisted. <br /> <br /> My last problem with the film has nothing to do with the film itself, but rather its post production. The subtitle (if you see it below) is horrible. Long sentences remain dormant for a second or two, while short sentences remain too long. Furthermore, while Yang quickly changes images, subtitles are removed from the screen. This is one of those rare cases where subtitles should be able to remain on the screen even if the image has changed, because there is not much dialogue going on anyway.
