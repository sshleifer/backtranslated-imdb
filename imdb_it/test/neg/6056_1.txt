I survived the first hour and came back in the last ten minutes, just to say I saw the end. If you want * real * mythology, impeccably executed, look for "The Odyssey" by Armand Assante. Great storytelling doesn't need to be optimized - the stories are fantastic on their own. I just hope Sean Astin needs money. And Sophocles and Ovid must spin around in their graves, wherever they are. <br /> <br /> At least with Sorbo's version, the tongue was relentlessly struck on the cheek - we knew it was mostly balderdash, but perhaps there was enough interest generated in the backstory to send someone to the library. I'm surprised Halmi could turn out to be something so funny (the TV series), and follow it with something so lacking in quality.
