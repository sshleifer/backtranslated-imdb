There were so many reasons why this movie could have been great. I'll give you three. <br /> <br /> 1. Sienna Guillory. It is very hot in this film and it was the reason I chose to watch it first. <br /> <br /> 2. Tim Curry. Stupid boy and I always get excited to see him in the movies (even Home Alone 2). <br /> <br /> 3. Jason Donovan. For all you Aussies and Poms out there, this is a rare treat. The former stripper of the 80 years of the ex-neighbors dressed in the drug selling drag. <br /> <br /> However, neither of these things, nor the fact that the film is about drug / raving culture, has managed to make this film even remotely interesting. The script was boring, the performances were ordinary and despite the scenes with J.D and every scene with Sienna I found everything about this pretty pretty movie. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
