Sometimes I show my children this garbage so they will understand how pathetic the "competitors" of the show are. They are pathetic not because they are fat, but because they have prostituted their dignity for a few minutes of fame and fortune. <br /> <br /> To make anyone appear on national TV and fat, sniff and complain about being fat (entirely their fault) is sickening. What does it say about us as a nation? Does it suggest that your lifestyle choices and their consequences are not our responsibility? <br /> <br /> "The Biggest Loser" is an appropriate title, but it has nothing to do with your weight. <br /> <br /> Absolute basket.
