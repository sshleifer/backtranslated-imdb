Disappointing film with Walter Pidgeon as a hunter going to Germany to assassinate Hitler. When discovered, he is forced to sign a document declaring that he acted by order from England. His refusal to sign the document leads us to the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Pidgeon is persecuted in England by the evil George Sanders and his cohort, John Carradine, who speaks little, but is again as always, the embodiment of evil personified. <br /> <br /> Along the way to being chased, Pidgeon meets Joan Bennett, the latter with a wonderful cockney accent. <br /> <br /> History gets bogged down a bit as love develops between the two, but again as we approach the Second World War, realism becomes the object of the day. <br /> <br /> The scene near the cave between Sanders and Pidgeon is well done but we know where the arrow will go. <br /> <br /> Very interesting is the fact that while Pidgeon escapes from Nazi Germany, he meets again with a young Roddy McDowall, one of the many co-stars of Pidgeon the same year in the memorable "How green my valley is ". How green was "Man Hunt?"
