I'm new to Argento's work, and if this and Suspiria are an indication, then Argento is much more a filmmaker of experiences than of stories. In his films, the characters are placed in exhausting and hypnotizing horror contexts that literally saturate the logic of the world around them. The camera literally flows gracefully through the sets as the characters run, stumble and make their way to a terrifying conclusion. It worked, REALLY well, in Suspiria. For some reason it didn't work here. <br /> <br /> The problem I see with this film is that even if the protagonist "gets help" by contacting the police and asking his friends for help, he still feels like he refuses to "get help" in terms to actually try to find a solution to his problem. The entrapment in this film is that she is trapped in the little killer game, one from which she could easily come out ... doesn't she sneak in so easily? In a strange way it seems that the character wants the torture that the killer gives them, which in a sense is the point and could have worked, except that the whole psychology of it was generated mainly because of what Silver wants to do. > <br /> As a loving tribute to "The Phantom of the Work", it is certainly an interesting and unique way. For all its value, Argento also delights in operatic movements, which highlights the action well. It doesn't make much sense, especially if it goes into a completely useless ending (yes, I know it's a reference to Harris's novel "Red Dragon". No, it didn't work). Because the character should go from a terrifying experience of entrapment to a willing one with the director is beyond me. It seemed almost selfish on the part of Argento. <br /> <br /> Overall, a fun experience, and between this and Suspiria I am more than willing to follow other productions of Argento. But this is not a film I would like to return or remember. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
