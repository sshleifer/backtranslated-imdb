Brooke Shields - in a departure from her "Suddenly Susan" duties - plays a bitter divorce involving three girlfriends on a "girls only" weekend in Palm Springs. The problem: Brooke is "detached" and looking for prey, while his friends are all involved. Hence the implications of the title and the emotional repercussion of the causes of their "amoral" purpose. <br /> <br /> Despite some laughter generated by Dan Cortese ("Victoria's Closet") and MTV "relationship authority" Adam Corolla and Dr. Drew Pinsky, this is sad stuff for women only. D.B. Sweeney, Virginia Madsen and Jon Polito are the co-stars.
