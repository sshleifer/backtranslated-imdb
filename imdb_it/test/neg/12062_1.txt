Idiots go camping and behave like idiots before they eventually die like idiots, yes Camp Blood (or if you want a horrible, nastier game than a bad word game that fits a bad movie, "Camp Bloody awful "), it's so ugly that it's actually pretty depressing to watch. And it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad movie ... <br /> <br /> Awful acting-check. Control script. Flashy effects: do not check originality of any kind - double check. <br /> <br /> It does not even try to be different, and is full of every imaginable clich√© expected. For example, the film opens on a couple having sex in the woods, so obviously they end up dying. <br /> <br /> One of the most disturbing things is that this film has actually generated two sequels, how and why it just baffles the mind. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this.
