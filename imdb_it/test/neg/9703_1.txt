From the first shot of the film - Keira Knightley while Elizabeth Bennet wandered reading through a field at dawn, thus invoking all the clich√©s that cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the rebellious female character with a strong character in the period drama - I knew I had something to make me want to kill myself. <br /> <br /> Joe Wright seemed not only to have not read the book, but to be unpleasantly disappointed that what he was filming was not actually Jane Austen's subtle and nuanced comedy of good manners conducted through sparkling and delicate social interactions in the English salons of the eighteenth century, but a sort of U certificate of stormy peaks. So we were treated in every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason, in an improper setting and often in the pouring rain. Not to mention the fact that Jane Austen, and in particular P & P, doesn't talk about passion, sexual tension or love. These are different strategies for negotiating 18th century society stucification. Which was completely ignored, so that the Bennets' house was a turbulent and chaotic place where everyone was screaming at once, running, leaving their underwear on the chairs and pigs wandering happily around the house; society dances turn into country dances one step away from a Matrix Reloaded style orgy; and everyone says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for fairness. <br /> <br /> The genius of Jane Austen is to explore the void created by a society in which no one says what they think or intend because of an overwhelming respect for fairness, and the tragic situations of her characters are born of misunderstandings and misunderstandings enabled by that void without words. So both the brilliance of Jane Austen and the very factor that allows her plots - particularly in this film - to work have been completely erased. The subtlety in general was nowhere in his film, sacrificed in favor of an exasperated drama that shook completely with the material and the performances. <br /> <br /> He was so obviously trying to be a serious * movie *. The humor - which is pride and prejudice, both the methodology of Austen and its charm - was almost entirely suppressed in favor of all this melodrama from the poem, and when it was allowed, it was handled in such a clumsy way . Pride & Prejudice is a serious narrative that makes serious points, yes, but those serious points and heavier themes are not only intertwined with humor, they are integrated into it. You can't lose the Jane Austen technique, leaving only the bare bones of the story, and expect the themes to remain. Not even when you replace his techniques with your heavy fake-mystic cinematography with fake tones. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Bennett should be a woman, an adult, mature, sensitive and lucid. Keira Knightley interpreted the first half of the film as a shocked student with an empty head, and in the second half as an empty-headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine. Elizabeth's wit, her beaten verbal exchanges, her quintessential feature of being able to see and laugh at everyone's madness, including hers, her strength and composure, and her fantastic lucidity have been completely lost and replaced from what? Lots of giggles and staring into the distance? Rather than being able to keep his head when everything on her was losing theirs, he started crying and screaming at the slightest provocation - and not genuinely angry; no, these were petulant hisses. And where the great strength of Elizabeth of Austen (at least in the eyes of Austen) was her ability to maintain integrity and observance while remaining within the confines of society and supporting unparalleled ownership, the Elizabeth of Knightley had no regard to conventions. Moreover, she seemed to think that wandering barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth-century version of the suit made her beyond any energetic and resolute doubt, and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to support it. A surprisingly clear and insipid performance. In whose search for blandness and weakness, it was ably matched by Matthew Macfayden. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland how Mr. Bennet seemed weak, ineffective and permanently upset without the evil sense of humor and ironic detachment at the expense of man relationships that make Mr. Bennet so charming and tragic. His special bond with Lizzie, like the only two sensitive people in a crazy world, was completely lost, not least because both were crazy in a world of madmen, and this completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact. Mr. Bingley was no longer amiable and well-intentioned to the point of madness, but he was interpreted as a complete retard for cheap laughter, and the woman who played Jane was so wildly incoherent that he might not even try to do anything with the character to all. The script veered wildly between Jane Austen's verbal blocks - expressed with remarkable awkwardness - and a totally contemporary language that would not be out of place in a modern romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Just have the BBC adaptation on DVD and save yourself the anguish.
