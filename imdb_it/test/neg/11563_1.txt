This movie is really bad. It almost looks like it was shot in a park or in a basement. There is a giant spider but all we see is one leg. There are some worms that live in a cave that are cheap puppets with cardboard teeth. And the plot is a bunch of post-apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that doesn't make any sense. The whole thing is simply ridiculous.
