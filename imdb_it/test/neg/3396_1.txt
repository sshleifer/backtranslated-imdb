This is my opinion on this film, expressed in its dialogs. <br /> <br /> To be more serious, I can't say that this movie is a bad time, but I didn't like it either. <br /> <br /> First, I was simply indifferent and could not get myself into the world of monkeys. Although the trick is very realistic, the constant scream was irritating. May the movie change the monkeys for cats and is a cult film for me in relation to my passion for the latter. <br /> <br /> The second part is more interesting, with the talent and freshness of the newcomers (Macdowell & Lambert), but I felt alienated: the whole story is in a large British villa: not no matter how luxurious it was, it was like a prison for me. <br /> <br /> Finally, could it be a good adaptation of Tarzan's Burroughs story? I don't know, having never read the book (or seen Disney) :. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I have no good time to remember, so a vision would be enough for me. <br /> <br /> I should have guessed my boredom after the endless freezing called "Overture" at the beginning ... What is the meaning? Only the director knows.
