This movie sucked. The script is so full of holes; I can't see how the producers agreed to finance it. <br /> <br /> We are never given an explanation of NOTHING. The acting is horrible. The plot sucks. This film was obviously written for the 8 and below. <br /> <br /> I have to say this: why do high school classes only last 2 minutes? The teacher enters, finds a frog on the desk or draws on the blackboard, and 30 seconds later, the bell rings, the lesson is over. The children have not even opened their books. Can we at least have some continuity? <br /> <br /> Oh, dialogue. Milo Jeter is the reincarnated, aborted fetus of zombies. We really need the line, "This is the office of Dr. Jeter, Dr. Jeter, Milo's father." Thanks for the advice; I could never put it together alone. Never gets better. <br /> <br /> Why does Milo speak as he does, even at the beginning? Milo has always been "real". Or was it never real, just what is it currently? And if it was always like this, why was Milo's inexplicable "accident"? <br /> <br /> In addition to "What is Milo?", what are all unsolved articles for? We see all these gadgets in his father's medical office, and we are never given an explanation of what they are or what they have to do with history. What are injections for? And the contraption of the aquarium? Obviously they are not necessary. (See the movie, it will make sense). And what does this drug do to anyone? Apparently nothing, since it has no effect on the leading actress. <br /> <br /> This film is a very, very bad rip-off of all the other slasher films. It's a really bad Friday 13 / Halloween with a 10-year-old writer. It's not bad enough to laugh, it's just an incredibly frustrating bore.
