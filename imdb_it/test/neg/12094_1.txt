I haven't seen anything here for quite a while, but after having had the misfortune of sitting in this garbage masked by entertainment I had to expose my thoughts. <br /> <br /> Normally, however, something bad is, there is a part that redeems, be it a good actor, a passable scene, an attractive member of the cast or a moment of general well-being. Unfortunately, it is not true here, because the film starts atrociously, with a ridiculous shooting, which was so poor, I thought it was a practice, and two halfwits, otherwise known as the blue talkative boys next to a school. br /> <br /> One of these idiots was Daniel Baldwin, who not only acted in this, but also actually Directed this garbage, and unlike his brothers he cannot act as candy. Not that he was alone here, since everyone seemed to belong to the acting school of a trained chimpanzee. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, surely for me, I saw only an hour of this masterpiece, as The DVD would not work, and probably was created by the same fools who produced it. So if you have nothing else to do but look at the dry paint, look at this because it's just as boring, and ideal for getting rid of unwanted guests.
