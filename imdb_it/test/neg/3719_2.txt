If this film becomes a holiday tradition, I'll have to hide for Christmas for the rest of my life. How do you think you compare it to "A Wonderful Life"! It was absolutely horrible! The singing boy curled my toes. And what the hell was the deal with his hair ?? Emmy worthy performance ?! Please. Sure, Lucci did well, but an Emmy ????? I think this film is a waste of money. Being so close to the original story, pretending to give it a modern and retro touch, made it even worse. Lack of enthusiasm and persistence on all accounts. Lighting, wardrobe, make-up, everyone seemed to want to go home. Just a big NO from me.
