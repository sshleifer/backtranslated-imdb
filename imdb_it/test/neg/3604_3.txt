I really liked the movie "The Emporer's New Groove", but watching this was like coming home and seeing your wife have "relationships" with a lama. Seriously, this movie was bad. It's like the Dread Club after the Super Troopers. I should write 10 lines, but I don't even know what else to say. I laughed a couple of times, but only because I was drinking. A film like this should be at least funny when you're drunk. It was not. Perhaps the llamas are just fun and normal cartoon people are not. However, simply keep The New Groove from The Emporer if you want a fun blade-themed movie. Line 10 is this line right here.
