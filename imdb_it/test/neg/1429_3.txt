Strangeland (1998) D: John Pieplow. Kevin Gage, Elizabeth Pena, Brett Harrelson, Robert Englund, Tucker Smallwood, Amy Smart, Dee Snider (Twisted Sister), Amal Rhoe. The disturbing scenes of torture "highlight" this dark and disgusting film about a sadistic psychopath who attracts teenagers into his torture chamber through the Internet. Snider (from the 80s rock band Twisted Sister) plays the psychopathic putrid, which is a dirty "twist" (not a pun) on Hannibal Lecter. Pena is wasted as one of the mothers of the victims. Harrelson (Woody's brother) offers one of the worst cop performances I've ever seen in a movie, and Rhoe shows why this is his only film recognition with an equally pathetic performance. The heavy metal soundtrack is ultimately crippling, the torture scenes are very graphic and vulgar, and the ending sucks. RATING: 3 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and torture, strong language and sexual situations.
