On a mission in scenic Italy, Lana Turner (like Fredda Barlo), with the beautiful synchronization of her lips, meets the old singer and prince Ezio Pinza (as Mr. Imperium). The two fall in love while enjoying the beautiful Italian countryside. Unhappily, Mr. Pinza is called to the deathbed of his great father, leaving Lana at the mercy. Twelve years later, Mrs. Turner is an actress from Los Angeles, who is about to make a film about falling in love with a king. Turner was borrowed from co-star Barry Sullivan, who wants to marry her - then, King Pinza re-enters his life ?? <br /> <br /> "Mr. Imperium" provides a tired plot for the sex symbol Turner and the novice bass singer, Pinza, who appeared for several decades with the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Probably Pinza earned his career in film for MGM after performing in the hugely successful theatrical production of "South Pacific" (1949). The cast album, and the gold single of "Some Enchanted Evening" by Pinza, has sold millions. Supporting casts Marjorie Main, Cedric Hardwicke and Debbie Reynolds give the film an even greater sense of wasted resources. <br /> <br /> *** Mr. Imperium (1951) Don Hartman ~ Lana Turner, Ezio Pinza, Barry Sullivan
