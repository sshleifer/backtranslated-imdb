Some movies are off-beat, but enjoyable, but many movies are just strangely bizarre. "Motorama" adapts very well to this last category. Many people seem to like it because of the infinite appearances of the guests and the total lack of common sense, but these two things can only make a film so far, and "Motorama" simply has no other merit to its credit. <br /> <br /> "Motorama" delights on the improbabilities of the plot. His main character, Gus, is a 10 year old cursing on a journey through an imaginary country that seeks to collect game pieces to win $ 500 million. When interacting with adult figures, none of them seem to notice or worry that they are 10 years old. At first it is incredibly fun, but it quickly becomes too unbelievable, especially considering the people he meets and the fact that you seem so embarrassed by many of the disturbing images (for someone of that age) that happen around him. Gus has no depth and, like an anti-hero who has no problem causing others to suffer to get his game pieces, it's hard to feel sorry for him when he encounters problems. <br /> <br /> The problem is provided by a string of guest appearances, each mistreating Gus in increasingly strange ways. In addition to making the plot already worn out even more incredible and less fun, the characters share Gus's lack of depth and are just as memorable. The character's actions can get a bit interesting, but the actors themselves don't add anything to them, thus canceling the point of getting big names (they could have been played by anyone and the character would have been the same). These guest appearances seem to have been signed more for the value of the tent than for anything else. <br /> <br /> "Motorama" should be interesting - it's a unique idea, but there is too much semblance of meaning in the script for it to work. The incidents that should have a lasting effect on the anti-hero and the spectator do not, since the film passes quickly from incident to accident, in the hope that something will eventually make the public feel sorry or understanding for Gus. This never happens, since in this way no one is allowed to connect, it simply moves back and forth like on a conveyor belt, an accident after another. With a story so meaningless it ceases to be pleasant, and a main character who never evolves to take care of himself or anyone else at a higher level, "Motorama" has little to offer but a snotty brat furtively and try to get rich. Why should we care?
