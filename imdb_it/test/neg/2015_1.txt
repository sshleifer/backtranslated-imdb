Greetings from Lithuania. <br /> <br /> This is the first question that comes to mind after seeing this "movie". <br /> <br /> You know, I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life, but after seeing this, I just had two questions: 1) It's just a parody (parody) <br /> <br /> 2) How could people create such a thing! <br /> <br /> If you've never seen this "movie", you REALLY don't know what a "really bad" movie is. I mean BAD. The script: are you kidding? Acting is so horrible that I am "the actors" in which I enjoy only this film. I know, this is the movie "B", but come on? Does this have to be a reason to be such garbage? <br /> <br /> Oh! And what an end !!! A final not to be missed! Just when you think this is the worst thing you've ever seen, wait until the end - because THAT kind of ending you have NEVER seen before (and I hope you'll never see). <br /> <br /> Woke up this "movie" at any cost, and don't say I didn't warn you ...
