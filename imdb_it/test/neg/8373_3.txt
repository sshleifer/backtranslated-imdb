Perhaps we Australians have a completely different sense of humor and here my lie is the only problem. I have a database of all the DVDs I own (including those received as gifts - which one it was) and so, when I insert a new one, I always refer to IMDb for information such as genre, runtime, director, lead, etc. this, I noticed it was a comedy and so I decided to watch it at a time when I wanted something light and a good laugh. Well, it was neither one nor the other! There was absolutely no laughter and a huge amount of gratuitous profanity (are there REALLY radio announcers authorized to broadcast the kind of filth that Steve Jones cooks?) And if a decent child had tuned in to his station? > <br /> Instead of enjoying a good laugh (or even a little laugh) I found the whole thing depressing. I gave 3 out of 10, but to be honest, I don't know what those 3 are for! I suppose the basics of lighting and sound weren't that bad! <br /> <br /> We have a seemingly stone-broke loser (Giovanni Ribisi) who still seems able to drive a reasonable car (who pays for fuel?) and live in what could be a nice apartment (who pays the rent?) Given the opportunity to form what may have been some sort of meaningful relationship with the one who turned out to be a good girl, he even blew it off! Maybe it was her (Lynn Collins) who earned this movie with 3 points! The fact that she works as a stripper rather than a hairdresser is one of the few aspects of this film that makes sense ("I can do all this in just one night doing what I do in a two-week hairdresser"). <br /> <br /> If you don't want to be depressed and bored by the teeth, forget it!
