Bad dialogue, slow history, scenes that drag on and are absolutely useless. I can't believe this money was invested in such a badly written film. Direction and acting could not even save this bomb. <br /> <br /> 50% through the film and you're still waiting for it to begin. They lay the foundation with the opening preface and then spend the next 40 minutes creating NOTHING. Observe 40 minutes of video without direction in an attempt to do this, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Much of this film is like watching a really bad French movie where nothing ever happens and the characters are just kind of boring, lifeless and self-centered who live without purpose or care. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. Anyone who recommends it is preparing you for disappointment and you will surely doubt their taste and your depth.
