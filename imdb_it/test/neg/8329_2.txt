You would think that a movie about incestuous sisters that would eventually kill their employer could not help but be compelling, but then you would be wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no plot. There is no character development. There is no salvific visual beauty. <br /> <br /> This film is a waste of time. The exploration of how the relationship between sisters develops is nothing, their sexuality is never anything more grotesque, class relations are ignored, and the employer is a stupid caricature. <br /> <br /> Silent and vintage clothes do not equal depth of meaning.
