The beginning of the film was confused and the rest was predictable. It was just one of those movies I came across in my Netflix instant queue and thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfro and Bijou Phillips team up with Bully. Unfortunately "interesting" never happened in this film. Swain plays an invisible girl in a private school whose best friend is rich and does whatever she wants at any time (Phillips). But Swain likes one of the guys ("Renfro") "in the crowd" and eventually starts being with them. And, of course, like all the other films, things are going well (or so it is assumed since the film never allows us to understand that things are going well) and then things don't get so good as to be hanged by rich children. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that there are absolutely no peaks and valleys. It's just a lifeless movie that after seeing it, you feel you could have done something better. Some scenes (those with Renfro's parents) don't even make sense to be in the movie because the director and the writer didn't follow us at all. <br /> <br /> All the interesting things that COULD played out was completely ignored and this is almost like watching an episode before being a star (Mischa Barton and Rachel Bison from the OC). <br /> <br /> The only shining light in this film, and the reason it doesn't get a UNO rating from me is Phillips. They needed more scenes with her inside. Renfro seems to have brought some of his character from Bully. And, for God's sake, the title is BS, the name changes.
