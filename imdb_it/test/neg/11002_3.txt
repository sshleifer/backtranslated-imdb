The Fanglys is set in a small Texan town called Layton on the eve of Halloween, while the citizens treat it as the second coming of Christ or something, I mean that Halloween isn't that important? However, Sheriff Pete (Burton Gilliam) was called to another murder while local boy Ned (co-associate producer John William Galt) discovered a body in the local woods. Could it be the Fang Lady (Justin Hamilton)? The central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers, who knows? Being the funny type of him is Mark (director and producer Robert Harvey) convinces his friend Kelly (Laurie Reeves) to go to a cemetery that his partner Steven (Josh Gobin) found the night before for a Halloween party. The idea of ​​spending the night in a cemetery in the woods obviously appeals to Kelly and she agrees, along with Steven and a girl he called Camille (Natalie Woods) and their friend Nerd Jerry (Tim Boswell) they put everyone out for a night of fun, as well as fun as can be expected to have in an isolated cemetery. However, they soon discover that the legend of the Fang Lady is far from the bedtime story that many have delineated ... <br /> <br /> Edited, executive product, written and directed by Christopher Abram The Fanglys is a nice attempt at garbage at a horror movie. The script is very predictable, boring and offers no entertainment value, in the right hands and with a decent budget. The Fanglys could have been an effective horror film, but it really isn't. It moves at a right pace but the 'on screen' action is so scarce that it doesn't matter, I don't know what else to say besides The Fanglys is a really bad film and I can't see anyone enjoying it. The dialogue is basic, the characters are clichés and lifeless while, overall, the film seems much longer than the 90 minutes of execution. Are there some lame attempts at humor that don't fit well with the elements of horror and what was that retard that he kept in that cage? I guess the budget didn't allow the directors to show it. Oh, if you want to know what happens to Jerry in the end, you too will continue to look beyond the credits while the lame truth is revealed, assuming you can actually do it in a completely obvious way (believe me it takes a few things to do ). <br /> <br /> Director Abram does nothing special. Abram thinks that the neon-lit bathing scenes are elegant, I can tell him it's not when your movie should be set in the woods. There is no atmosphere, fear, tension, excitement or any of the elements that make a good horror movie good. Forget the good blood, there is a little when someone eats some skin from an arm and a pitchfork stuck in someone's throat. Apparently The Fanglys had a budget for filming of $ 2,837 which makes it one of the lowest budget films ever to have a commercial version, and to be brutally honest shows. What about the retarded boy and his fake joke teeth that look ridiculous? The terrible special effects, the cinematography of the video cameras and the terrible acting of all those involved make it even more difficult to sit. <br /> <br /> The Fanglys is a straight-to-video crap, with no safety features. Whatever its IMDb rating is fully justified, it is one of those movies that I was watching in half an hour. watch and wishing it would end.
