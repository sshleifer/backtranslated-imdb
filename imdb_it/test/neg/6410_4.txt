** on **** stars <br /> <br /> Let's see ... 14 divided by 20 times the square root of 13 equal to 23, which was the favorite number of my deceased grandmother and the year in which it is born, 23 minutes after the 23rd hour. Assign the number as you like and ooh be very scared. BE EXTREMELY frightened when you launch into a brain-like mutt to go with 23, and you have Schumacher's last attempt at a dark party of suspense with The Number 23. Oh yes, 23 is also my record in the shots of I want to do my favorite dive on 23rd street in the 23rd state of the union. <br /> <br /> Carrey takes the film about halfway, then we lose sight of him, he doesn't really care. Don't look for crazy expressions from comedian Carrey, as you saw on The Mask and Me, Myself and Irene. No. And don't expect an embodiment of a character like he did with Andy Kaufman. This role is a sad and peculiar devolution for Jimbo. Where is The Riddler when you need him! I know, we don't need him. Virginia Madsen, as usual, is underutilized as a supportive, speculative and peculiar wife. His talent, like Carrey's, is suppressed, and it is almost painful to see her trying to save her underdeveloped character from the nearby anonymity. <br /> <br /> To give credit where the credit is due, there are a couple of interesting scenes in The Number 23 that show very clever cinematography. They are arresting themselves enough without having to be twisted in the inconsistent narrative of this little story. <br /> <br /> I don't know about you, (and I realize it's a work of absolute fiction) but I don't know anyone who often reads his novel in a dark and dark cellar, or spends his time regularly cemeteries like Carrey does in this movie. Schumacher keeps his film dark and blood red and dark and rainy and dull and gloomy and rainy and humid and forward and forward and forward from beginning to end. Even Flatliner and The Lost Boys had a little more light in them, and we're talking about medical students obsessed with death and teenage vampires! <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, even if it is out of pure curiosity ... make sure you do it enjoying around 23 catnaps, so you can kill 23 birds with one stone.
