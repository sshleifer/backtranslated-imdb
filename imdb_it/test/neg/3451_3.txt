I managed to see it in what I think was the second screening of the world, a few days after its opening at the Dublin International Film Festival. While I was attending another movie two evenings later in the same theater, I saw Brendan Gleeson, Paul Mercier and the rest of the cast and crew in another Studs promotional screening. <br /> <br /> I must say that he was bitterly disappointed in the film, I didn't expect a masterpiece at all, but what I was presented with, I think, lacked all the crucial elements of the genre in which he had set himself. Before continuing, two things, I accept that some directors like to subvert general expectations, here it simply is not the case. Secondly, I know it was based on a play (which I did not read but was informed that it is not a piece of sparkling literature), but this does not justify the massive narrative problems that permeate the film. /> <br /> My main problem with the film is the script, forgetting that it was based on a comedy, as a sports comedy just doesn't work, the down and out team are trying to win a soccer cup, few of the games they are shown (when they are, it is very short) and we are not given any satisfaction due to any of their sports results. Having read so far, it could be assumed that this is not a rigorous sports film, but a psychological study of the relationship between a "quack" of a manager and his hopeless team. He certainly doesn't reach him, I'm not even sure if he wanted to. Any attempt to shed light on the history of any of the characters is hackneyed and peripheral. Overall, I found the script lacking many aspects. <br /> <br /> I think the performances and the music were good and technically, the film was well done. But apart from these points, which should be expected from any Irish film at this stage, I left the theater very sorry. <br /> <br /> My judgment may seem harsh but I think there is some hope for a strong Irish national cinema in the near future and this simply does not support this argument. Since Studs has become a recommended Dublin Cineworld movie (I was part of the audience in that screening), most people seem to disagree with me, so this means you should probably judge the movie.
