I happened to see it on TV and I wanted to watch because I remembered the article in the magazine Spin on which the film is based. I was very disappointed. First of all, if James Belushi is the leading actor in a film, it should be a sign that it is not exactly an A-list production. Gregory Hines was a world-class dancer, but unfortunately he is not a great actor. <br /> <br /> In fact, all the acting of this film is flat or hammy, which can only be attributed to the director, which is the weakest link in this film. It seemed that Charles Carner was trying to mimic Oliver Stone's "JFK" in portraying the alleged conspiracy to cover the "real" child murderer, but without the benefit of a good script, an A-list cast or said, talent. Does not work. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that such a worthy subject for a film has not received better treatment.
