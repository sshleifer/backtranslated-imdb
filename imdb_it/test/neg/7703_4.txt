Let me tell you that I am a big fan of Abbie Hoffman and I read Steal this book and steal this urine test. I'm also an even bigger fan of Jerry Rubin. But his film was a bunch of junk that made a very popular version of Abbie Hoffman. The director had no chance to make Abbie Hoffman interesting in this film. They said that Stew Albert was a fucking clever cartoon without intelligence, the man was a Berkley professional for the crusaders. Ok they did a horrendous casting job for Anita Hoffman, they did a horrible casting for the Jerry Rubin character. I only guess that the film doesn't fit the flashes of news I've seen on Abbie or the books she wrote. The film did not fit and disturbed me. Oh yes and theat is the absolute worst voice I've ever heard of Richard Nixon. This is one of the few movies I have ever rented that I couldn't really sit down because, I have a passion for Abbie Hoffman and her discreet band from Yippies and this movie was simply hurt. And it hurts me that now, when people see a film about the yippies, they will see a terrible adaptation and will not have a real sense of reality. Instead they get a hollywoodized palanthra of shit. <br /> <br />
