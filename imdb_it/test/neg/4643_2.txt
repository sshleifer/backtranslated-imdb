I know that Full Moon, or any other film studio like that, could never regain the sci-fi feeling that was the original "Trancers". And with the last two voices in the series with Jack Deth in the medieval era rather than futuristic in Los Angeles, it became quite obvious that there was very little hope in reviving the Trancers series. Breathing new life into a movie is one thing, but taking the main character from its element and putting it in the past, well, it didn't work! So now with Trancers 6, Full Moon has brought so much new life into the series that we no longer even have anything to do with Jack Deth. Now we take care of your daughter, Jo. Jack is in his body and has to go into the past and fight the Trancers one more time. <br /> <br /> * MINOR SPOILER: FIRST SCENE OF THE REVEALED FILM * <br /> <br /> To show how bad this film is, you just need to watch the first two minutes of the movie when the original Jack Deth appears on the screen. But it's not actually Tim Thomerson. These are clips of him and good bytes put together (trust me, you can say they are tied together) in a horrible way to provide the viewer with the ultimate true humor of Jack Deth. And from this moment on, things will only go downhill. Having this girl, Jo Deth, like our main character while Jack Deth should be in his body, is the worst idea in the world. Having this cute young woman as a tough and tough man is by no means the right way! It doesn't work and it seems really silly. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to go deep into the aspects of special effects and make-up because most of this reading knows what became Full Moon: A really, really low-budget feat. I don't know what to say about this film, except that I really wish Full Moon could be like in the days of Demonic Toys, Puppet Master and Trancers 1. Then, while the special effects weren't great, the era the narrative made b-movies serious for fans of the B movie and horror, and this doesn't happen today with the new Full Moon Studios. I long for the good old days and I really hope that Full Moon manages to pull itself out of this horrible collapse where they are now. <br /> <br /> Trancers 6 gets a 2 out of 10.
