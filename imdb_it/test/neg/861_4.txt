Sylvester the clandestine cat on a ship that Tweety Bird succeeds with his master Nonna. Oh, I don't even have enough words to express how much I dislike both the characters Tweety and Granny. They simply are not fun for me and have made this brief the task of really sitting down. Sylvester is a great character on his own, but there is only so much he can do in the face of the pure and terrible offer of that damned old grandma witch. This animated short can be found on Disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 and presents an optional commentary by Michael Barrier. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
