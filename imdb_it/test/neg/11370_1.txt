Director Jeremiah Checheck who brought us big debacles on the budget like "The Avengers" and the remake of "Diabolique" directed this repudiation of the concept of Die Hard, made - as it seems - into a budget by Blair Witch. <br /> <br /> A nuclear reactor in California is overtaken by Arab terrorists. But - are you ready? - terrorists are not Arabs; are really unhappy American soldiers disguised as Arabs! We discover that they do not really intend to blow up the reactor, but to issue a declaration. We're not sure what the claim is, but it doesn't matter. So there really is no threat. But then one of the terrorists decides to do it alone and actually blows up the plant because he's a little crazy. So maybe there's a threat, after all. But the army comes in and all the bad guys are killed. So there was no threat. Oh, and even a good boy is killed. Let it be a lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> If all this seems confused and a little wasted, then you have the idea of ​​what Meltdown is looking at. <br /> <br /> The script never worries about introducing the characters or even providing personal details that could make them effective or emotionally engage the audience. So we stay with one-dimensional characters: the expert-who-no-one will listen-to; the easy-sergeant trigger; i-viscous-political; the-dweeby-engineers. The story jumps from a cliché accident to the next in a composite formula of virtually every action movie you've ever seen. But in almost every turn, just when we think something may be at stake, the script jerks and we find out that in reality there is nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> Like Die Hard, there is a police officer who is inside, unbenownst to the bad guys. The big turning point is that the policeman here is ... A WOMAN! Oh, and she's hurt too. But not so bad, just enough to make her wince a few times. Oh, and instead of the walkie-talkie that Bruce Willis had this cop has a magical cell phone that works everywhere ... even underground! When not yelling at everyone else, Bruce Greenwood - the jaw made of granite - tries to calm her down for the walkie-talkie. He even made a joke once, but we fear his face may break. After all, this is a serious business. <br /> <br /> But above all it is scene after scene of people arguing: the military expert is discussing waiting for him (his reasoning does not seem particularly valid but he should be the smart guy in this film so okaaaay); the people in the White House argue with him; the army sergeant also discusses with him; the friendly Pakistani nuclear engineer discusses with the main terrorist. The dialogue is absolutely B Films in all and lines like "stop the transmission! STOP THE BROADCAST !!!" it could make you roll off the couch as you wonder if the characters actually refer to this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Perhaps to compensate for the lack of quality of the production, the work of the camera is kept nervous in that fake documentary 21 Style by Gram that should give immediacy and energy to the scenes, but the way it is applied indiscriminately and delightfully here is decidedly annoying; even pretentious. Further attempts to speed up the time are done with the inclusion of a nonsensical black and white film that is randomly interspersed with the main action. But even this is pretentious and annoying that way Blair Witch. In short, stylistic attempts seem very amateurish. <br /> <br /> Music lives up to the images - it's synthetic and economical. A bit like a porn movie but with less melody and many more heartbeat sounds. Even the graphic treatment is terribly ugly: good-humored graphics in a huge red font screams "21:28" as if the placeholder actually made a kind of difference. <br /> <br /> Meltdown could work as a marketing concept but it is clear that the script was a second thought. FX - part of Fox - has put together this cheese production and dropped several million dollars. Now that's what I call a disaster!
