Don't kill me fans but I have something to say about this. <br /> <br /> Pros: Well, the mildly interesting season that I have looked out of all the seasons that are out there in Inuyasha has just taken the Shichinintai bow. Unlike the other seasons, I personally think that this has more of a real storyline and of those mercenaries; good god they are such nice characters. Too bad they were killed. Of course, I would like to write a 15-page essay because I really like Shichinintai, but it would be a bit boring for some of you. So this series actually has some nice characters. I will miss Bankotsu ... poor, poor psychopathic boy. <br /> <br /> Cons: Outside the Shichinintai arc, the series was overall boring, repetitive and some of the characters are extremely irritating. For example, Kagome: overreacts to my tastes; behaves like Yuka from Elfen Lied. Inuyasha: He is a strong dog demon with a huge sword. What's so special about him? He has ADORABLE DOG EARS! Tch. Sesshomaru is all talk, no action and very arrogant. Naraku must be the worst villain ever existed in the world of souls. Miroku and Sango ... have some color but they just seem to stand apart too. But what bothers me most if they have absolutely no COMMON SENSE. Rumiko Takahashi did MUCH better than that. I've seen it before. <br /> <br /> If you like series with a lot of action, no annoying love triangle, no excessive repetitiveness, this is not for you then.
