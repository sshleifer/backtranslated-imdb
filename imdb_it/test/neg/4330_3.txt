This film has an extraordinary cast. MGM took some of his best actors and played them in a movie with the usual Margaret O'Brien. Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold and Lewis Stone are the three greedy bachelors living in the same house. While they have accumulated a fortune over the years, they have also been selfish idiots. One of them has the idea of ​​donating some properties to buy a good name (a sort of similar Carnegie) but it turns out that the property they really want to give belongs to O'Brien. And since it is an orphan, volunteers are offered to be its guardians so that they can give their property and look like great philanthropists. <br /> <br /> There is also a silly subplot involving fairies - led by the wonderful character actor Henry Davenport. And, since O'Brien is Irish (as evidenced by his outrageous accent), she and small people make up much of the plot. Frankly, I absolutely hated this part of the film and I wish they had abandoned it completely. Instead, the story could still have been about sweet Margaret melting the bad hearts of old people - this would have worked. But ... the "little people"?!? Sheesh! Overall, the actors try very hard, but the stupidity of the plot and the deadly serious way they felt made me shudder. I noticed that many people liked this movie - I guess I'm just an old fool! I found the film horrible hard to watch.
