Not being a particular fan of westerns, I saw it mainly because I wanted to see Lucille Ball in something other than a type of role "I Love Lucy" or "Lucy Show". Here he plays Christine Larson, owner of a sedan in the Arizona Territory in 1868, who is about to marry the unscrupulous Indian agent (Dean Jagger). Ball's performance was OK - nothing more than that; she didn't blow me away. I was successful because the role was very different from what I'm used to seeing it - there was very little of the extravagant physical comedy in which she became famous, even though the film tried to maintain a delicately fun feeling everywhere. (A typical funny joke - "there are two ways to deal with women - and no one knows any!") I didn't find the story so compelling, although I did appreciate the fact that the Indians showed themselves victims of the Indian Agent There a typical action from gunshots and many horses - the typical western in other words. As for Christine - we can pretty much guess right from the start how her planned marriage will end; it's just a question of how it will come. If you like westerns, this would be pretty typical with a bit of humor. If you are not big in the genre, this will be missed. I'm not big in the genre. 3/10
