How is this a documentary? Much more like a walking tour of ghosts than could be done in a given southern city. Quotations have been generously abandoned without the first attempt to identify the source. George Orwell was the most identified quoter. <br /> <br /> The documents have been cited without ever being produced in any form. The fraudulent shots depicting period films have been set aside by historical films without any separation from reality and self-promotion. Film reels that were completely unrealistic and unlikely for the time available were dropped, as if they were looking for a Blair Witch monkey, hoping to throw a ghost house over what would otherwise simply be a real estate asset. <br /> <br /> Isn't it somehow a great lack of respect for the actual victims of tuberculosis, a dance on their collective tombs for the sake of mercantilism? The line between the actual movie and the self-service product is so subtle; the trickle of doubt faded so insignificantly; the scientific borders so blatantly ignored ... how could it be listed in my TiVo as a documentary? <br /> <br /> It is a holiday promo, and its success is successful. <br /> <br /> Devil, I would visit the town if I could find it on Google Earth. Not a scary said a previous poster. Not too serious, says I. A fascinating story. Thin film.
