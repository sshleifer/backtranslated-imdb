The big (and we mean the biggest big) bad Sebastian Cabot is trying to eliminate land farmers from their lands to get oil rights. When the Sterling Haden pop star is killed, how will Haden put an end to TERROR IN A CITY OF Texas, armed only with a harpoon? <br /> <br /> First of all, this is not a B-western. There are no singing cowboys, or daring stunts, or interesting action sequences. It's just an independent film - you know, those who use unimportant actors to say "important things" and cover the general low budget availability of things with the Interesting Corners. <br /> <br /> Second, this film, to avoid compromises (one would expect) that would cause the elimination of Trumbo's important statements about justice in America, and the rather sick relationship between the henchman and his girlfriend, is really a low budget. The main problem that results is that acting is really, really bad. Sterling Haden is quite decent in difficult roles, but he is the last guy who wants to play a sensitive Swedish sailor who went to seek his fortune in the West. Sebastian Cabot tries to make a Sydney Greenstreet as a (very) bloated plutocrat. It's not a bad idea, but Cabot doesn't have acting ribs for this. The guy who plays the hired gun with the missing arm and soul (Johnny Crale) has the best role in the film. It does nothing with this. <br /> <br /> Third, the script really isn't all that. Trumbo does a bit of immigrant research and will not get a fair shake from the sheriff in a corrupt city, and people, when they oppose the real oppression, tend to back out. This is a rather old cinematic message in 1958: High Noon, Bad Day at Black Rock, Devil's Doorway - they are all Westerners who face the ills of Western society with an eye on the ills of 1950s America. Trumbo, in 1959, certainly had every personal reason to agree with those feelings, but he was not doing anything new or interesting with them. <br /> <br /> So, given all the negatives, why does this film get a 4? Mainly because there are interesting quirks in the film. (The relationship between Crale and his girlfriend is, um fascinating.) And Trumbo, while a mediocre writer when pursuing his political affections, is very good at creating both interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them. Just when one is ready to faint from the boredom of Indy's cinema, there will come an exchange of dialogues or simple strangeness that one realizes that the boy who writes the script was not simply a hack. <br /> <br /> If you don't do it like Trumbo or western, give this miss. Otherwise, try it. You might like it more than me.
