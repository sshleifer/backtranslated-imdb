How can you go wrong with a film that mixes the sophistication of Peter Cushing, the determination of Donald Pleasence and the bust of Luan Peters? Easy, give them a terrible script to work with. <br /> <br /> Peter Cushing, in an evil role, leads a satanic cult that has captured a couple of friends from Donald Pleasence. Donald plays a determined but detached priest who wants to locate his friends but needs Fred's help from Scooby-Doo to locate them. He invokes the help of a hound from New York, who dresses just like the hero of the cartoon, in his task. Meanwhile, the girlfriend of one of the missing persons, Luan Peters, joins the research. If all this sounds interesting, then you, like me, have been deceived. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take long for the trio to sniff the bad guys, but their methods of bringing the villains to justice are foolish. Moreover, women will find this a crapfest. Whenever they pass through the track of villains, our two male heroes tell Luan to stay in the hotel even if he manages to get along better than the squeamish priest played by Pleasence. <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (The script You really don't give up, there's no tension, no dialogue is worth the stars and you'll need both hands to count the number of times Luan Peters is told to lag behind and let men work men. to see a minotaur on the film not to bother.We get a statue of a minotaur that spits flames.) VIOLENCE: $$ (There are some attacks and some sacrifices, but those of you that they drool for gore will be disappointed). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$ (Although there are three of my favorite actors in this movie, there is nothing redeemable here. Peter Cushing doesn't have much screen time, Donald Pleasure is clearly aware of the fact that he is on the set of a stinker and Luan Peters is badly used. This should have been much better given the talent involved, but then again, the Ya nkees lose a game here and there). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $ (Luan Peters takes a bath but you see almost nothing. He is not as kind here as he was on The Flesh and Blood Show).
