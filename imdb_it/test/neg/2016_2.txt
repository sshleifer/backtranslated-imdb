A spaceship crossing the galaxy encounters a mysterious merchant ship apparently drifting in space. The crew investigates, hoping to claim its cargo and acquire the ship. However, once aboard the threatening ship, their own ship mysteriously disengages, leaving them at the mercy of themselves and fighting no one else from Count Dracula or Orloff as this creature defines itself. <br /> <br /> Not a bad start. I mean that it follows any number of typical science fiction / horror storylines. Genres are enough around that even the most original story will inevitably invoke comparison with some other film. But when you start with a typical horror convention, the legend of Dracula and vampires in general, and combine it with a rather typical science fiction convention, a crew runs into something and abandons itself to fight whatever they are forced to confront, the directors have a bit of cunning on their sleeve to impress their brand on the well-known staples of the genre. <br /> <br /> Director Darrell Roodt, who also wrote Dracula 3000 with Ivan Milborrow, is primarily responsible for this total failure. So, no, Roodt and Milborrow have nothing in their arms but arms. <br /> <br /> This film begins in a rather threatening way, with a very bad voice delivered by Caspar Van Dien, which essentially provides enough exposure to explain who the crew is on his ship. I would also like to point out that Van Dien's character is called Van Helsing. And, oh so skillfully, this Orloff character comes from the planet Transylvania in the Carpathian System. I'm not kidding. I mean, from the kids, we have it. And, again, don't be stupid and use these names if you don't have something special in the store. <br /> <br /> So, after the introduction of the Van Helsing crew, we essentially have a film about this crew trapped in a spaceship with a vampire lurking. <br /> <br /> I am a very tolerant spectator when it comes to low-budget films. Occasionally, they can be brilliant, seeing the first two Raimi films of the Evil Dead. Dracula 3000 had a decent budget, enough for some decent special effects and for 3rd string salaries like, Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio, etc. However, unlike the MALE DEAD films, there is no talent behind the camera. Faced with the camera, talent is marginal, but I will give the actors some benefit of the doubt. They really don't seem to know what to do. The best actor in the group, Alexandra Kamp-Groenveld, is killed quickly and the always fun Udo Kier is reduced to being an exhibition vehicle for the viewer like the dead captain we hear and see through a video journal. Even Grant Swandby is fine as a professor, but it's hard to take a scientist in the year 3000 who wears glasses and rides a wheelchair seriously. And, yes, it is a WHEEL chair because there is nothing futuristic about it. As for the rest of the actors, well ??? I'm sure Coolio really tried to scare you after becoming a vampire, but, well, I don't think the irritant qualifies as scary in many people's books. Even Tiny Lister and Erika Eleniak do not offer much. Lister is never again a big black IL stereotype. Eleniak looks really unhappy throughout the film and never tries very hard. Eleniak is a pretty girl, even in her mid-thirties, but she seems a little worn and uninterested for the duration of the film. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Count Dracula / Orloff played by Langley Kirkwood. To be honest, I don't remember exactly who the vampire was. It appears as Orloff but at a certain point it is also recognized as Count Dracula. Go figure. In any case, you will be absolutely amazed by how lame this vampire is. Have you ever staged those horror shows that host local networks on their feature slots? Yes, it's so bad. Langley Kirkwood, the actor who plays Orlock, must have found it almost impossible to concentrate on such a ridiculous dress. I'm sure he continues to be annoyed by his friends. <br /> <br /> There isn't much to the plot. The vampire is the last of his kind and wants to go to Earth, for some reason, and besides, there's some relief in wanting to defeat the character of Caspar Van Dien, Van Helsing. Most of the crew is transformed into vampires, including Van Helsing, and the crew uses conventional machine guns and guns to try to defeat them before they uncover the old pole in the cardiac routine. Yes, it's true, bullets, and yes, the year 3000. Staying in that disconcerting vein, one of the main areas where the crew pierces itself while fighting vampires, or vampire, since there has never been more than one who threatened them is full of old Soviet posters and signs and the like. What? There are also references to God / religion which are antiquated systems. But these references have only confused me. Has the Soviet Union made a comeback? Is there any point that Roodt and Milborrow want to do with this? Never really goes anywhere, it looks silly and posters, etc. They look just cheap. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the film is shot and edited competently. Cinematography is nothing spectacular, but it is clearly made by professionals and I had no problems with special effects. Ships look like ships in space. Although, as I write this, I remember how horrible the captain's body is when the crew finds out. What were they thinking? Why didn't someone say something? See how difficult it is to say something positive about this film without resorting to negatives? I imagine, in the end, this is the thing. Regardless of the good points you feel and give this sci-fi / horror defeat, you feel overwhelmed by its lack of quality. <br /> <br /> Poor Udo Kier.
