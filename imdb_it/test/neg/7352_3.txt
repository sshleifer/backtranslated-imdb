This could have been a good movie if more things had been explained. Too many holes in the plot to find this fun. The finish, in particular, is on the left field. SPOILER ALERT: How did the kidnapper get back to Dundee so fast and Dundee shows up at home in two minutes? Out here wack here. How did Anna get the money? No explanation. If Pete's policeman knew that Lancaster was in danger, because he didn't have a policeman on the hospital door. This and many other questions remain. Too bad because the premise was there, just bad writing and execution. <br /> <br /> The good cast is wasted here. Does DeCarlo go from bad to good to bad? The character of Lancaster lacks development and Dureya is just blah as the "bad guy". <br /> <br /> This could be redone with a consistent plot and better writing. Obviously it would be much more violent with a lot of free sex and everything. Even the mounting would be jerky, so we leave it pretty well alone.
