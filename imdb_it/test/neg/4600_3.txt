does not mean that this film is good. I was really frustrated on many levels. it's the tip of the hat for Bukowski. hey, I read that guy in college - let's see what Matt Dillon does with him. and I like the matt dillon. I thought he'd come close to looking a little like hank, but above all just the ruddy cheeks. I have to worry about a character, though, and there wasn't much that interested me. I think time could be cruel to Bukowski, and that bothers me a lot, because the writing was solid in a sort of post-cultural time. hard to sit, scenes that didn't go anywhere and a soundtrack that made me want to vomit. I ask very little, I have less.
