"This film is fantastic! I watched it with some friends and we thought it was proof that a film should not see commercial success as a success!" ... that's what I'd like to say about this movie. In the words of the film itself "you are very bad!" I went to see an acupuncturist without a license once so generally I agree with the moral of the film. <br /> <br /> I would include a spoiler, but the lack of plot makes this very difficult. overall, a cinematic disaster. <br /> <br /> quotations; "You are not a leper at all!" "You are beautiful, and I bet you are nice too" "Have you ever seen the body of a naked man?" "you could not break a piece of straw". <br /> <br /> cameo in the dubbing; Micheal dog x3, harold bishop, steve erwine, benjamin netinyahoo, yoda.
