Well, they did it again a new pumpkin head movie, the first pumpkin head movie was perfect for its time, a stupid, bloody and clich√© monster movie. here's how it goes, someone loses their loved one, goes to the witch in the woods, raises her pumpkin head and kills everyone responsible. unfortunately the filmmakers considered it irrelevant to try to do anything else but this, for the fourth release of the film, considering it much more suitable to add some Romanesque blades and Juliet's subtitles, involving an idiotic family feud (on a machine! surprise surprise of some murderers of pumpkin heads, so far so formal, but it does not end here the acting talent in this film is terrible ... oh so bad half of them can not even hold a southern accent without slipping into their native accents and often more elegant. Lance henrikssen is on board so surely it would bring a bit of gravitas to the acts of the cinema ... but no hand simply moves on the screen let the words fall into the mouth with absolutely no emotion or seemingly direction, and goes away again, honestly I think he is just introduced himself for the money, then he went to his trailer to get drunk and remember the aliens. <br /> <br /> this film is a real cack, there is no other characteristic than the end of the credits that signal it everywhere. /> <br /> despite the ph: bf defects ... if you want a mindless game that will make you laugh for all the wrong reasons watch it. <br /> <br /> if you want something with abit more meat and originality avoided.
