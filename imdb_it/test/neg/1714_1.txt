This film (even calling it a movie is an exaggeration) is ridiculously horrible. Normally a big fan of Eric Roberts in "B" lists the films, this tragedy of a film makes me doubt his true value of list B! And Charlie, please come back to hope for a Diagnosis Murder awakening rather than this ... you can't blame the eye lovers (uhhum ... members of the beauty contest) for participating in this weak movie, but YOU are a former TV star! Get together. Don't even get me started on Stuart Pankin. For the sake of all that is good Stuart, you should have seen that this was not necessarily a real movie! Bryan Michael Stoller exemplifies the absolute genius only in the fact that he was able to trick anyone into investing in this image (money or time). In reality, it was not a parody or a parody, even if you try on a 2nd level. Mostly, it is bad writing and acting, camera work and editing and ... well, everything is bad. I looked at it because I read an article in some magazine about the involvement of agent MJ and my interest was reached steeply due to the cause in which he was involved. Now I wonder if the only reason why they show it from the shoulders in the film is because he, as in the trial, showed up wearing pajama pants and barely polished (wait a second, is he ever really considered polished? ... I digress ). And Agent MJ? Is it the best they could come up with for a name for his character? Sheez. What a surprising piece of originality! Or maybe it should have been fun? Putting Marriot in the film was a nice touch at the beginning, but it was said and done too much after all. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the pain of watching ...... do not say that I did not warn you.
