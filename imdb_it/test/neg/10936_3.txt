I went to this film with low expectations, knowing Uwe Boll's legacy as a director and screenwriter, and I was still disappointed. Uwe Boll finds a way to make every movie he is involved in, worse and worse. The general concept was not bad, a man bored from his life as a stock broker becomes a serial killer. But the problem with the film is that there is no middle ground, it passes directly from the stock broker to the serial killer. The film has unnamed actors, and I can understand why, after seeing the film, I can't understand why an actor with a career would like to be involved in this film. Anyone who has refused has done their careers a favor. And if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and don't do it. <br /> <br /> I give Sanctimony a 3 out of 10
