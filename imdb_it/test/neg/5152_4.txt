The story of the bride fair is fun and engaging, and it is thanks to the filmmaker who has set out to portray in rural Minnesotans with the same respect normally reserved for coastal inhabitants. It is strange, however, to find an independent film, born from the idea of ​​a single person, that is as unambitious and banal as a gigantic Hollywood asshole. <br /> <br /> The portrait of rural people is meant to be affectionate, I think, but these characters don't sound faithful to me - I had several meals in the diners of a small town, but I never heard a debate about the merits of the several English novelists of the nineteenth century. It could be suggested that the writer / director Semans no longer has experience with rural culture compared to the Coen brothers and a decidedly more satirical verve.
