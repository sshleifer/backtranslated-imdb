I'm a big fan of really bad B movies. And I especially love alien / scifi movies. I say the cheapest, the cheesier and the camper, the better. A low budget and a cheerful idea are fun enough for most of the bad B movies, but this movie is so bad that I felt really embarrassed about the people who made the film and the schlocky ad-lib actors. First of all, there is no real plot, it's all sort of a "comedy" situation (if you can call it that). The "comedy" in this film speaks more of characters who say, in essence, "look at me, I'm in this crazy situation! Isn't it funny?", But it's just pathetic, because nothing that anyone does is so funny. There are no acting comedies, nor any kooky plot to carry all the very unimaginative scenarios through this squalid asshole. <br /> <br /> Bad comedy and the lack of something comically remote is only worsened by bad publicity acting, actors repeating really stupid things over and over again (maybe trying to mimic phrases, maybe just b / c all this is so bad), really unattractive women are portrayed as sexy girls, and people go wild and faint bathrooms. <br /> <br /> There was a middle-aged actor near the end of the film who, in my opinion, had acting lines and was quite convincing in his role. It was out of place as a solid BM in the bathroom of a weekend detox. Corey Feldman was shot for about 3 minutes in total (fortunately we didn't have to endure it any longer), and it was filmed off-site - probably outside his apartment somewhere. He said some really funny little things about aliens and having sex with aliens and this was the extension of his appearance. <br /> <br /> If you appreciate your life and the 90 minutes (and years of pain in remembering) you will lose by watching this garbage, avoid it. If you do a lot of drugs, like Adam Sandler's comic style (and therefore you have no standards whatsoever), and are considered mentally slow, you might like this movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. I think people who are enthusiastic about it should work for Troma or something, b / c I can't believe people can be so lame to really enjoy it. (Do drugs really ruin your judgment so much?)
