So should we find it funny that this woman travels to the jungle - in the war zone - only to find out why her girlfriend didn't go to Switzerland? Or should we take it seriously? It's not even remotely funny, smart or funny - it's stupid - just like the movie. The lead actress is one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a movie - even worse than Jar-Jar Binks. Dialog strives a lot to be fun (almost always) but it never is. The number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing. And what about the plot - did they even take the trouble to explain to us what the rebels are fighting (besides being anti-government)? I imagine it was not important for anyone - neither for the rebels nor for the characters who flew blindly onto the battlefield. Do not waste time. "Coronado" is neither fun nor entertaining.
