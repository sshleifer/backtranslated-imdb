There are many distinct problems with the movie "KillShot". For one, there are too many coincidences. The husband is a hunter and he hunts himself the day the main assassin shows up, with someone the murderer knows. All right, I'll take that. The boy calls the real estate agency his wife works for and asks for money to be ready when he gets to pick it up. Okay, I'll take that too. Before going to get the money he decided to rob his killer, who didn't kill him but decided to go with him to work. He's starting to get very weak. Then they introduce themselves, the same day that the husband has an interview with the head of his wives. There is no one but his wife and her husband who has decided to make his way into the empty office. They make their way into the office and the professional killer thinks they're talking to the right man. This is only in the first 15 minuets. <br /> <br /> There are many more holes in this film, so I'm interested in talking about it. Because the killer didn't kill everyone in the real estate agency I don't know. Because he didn't shoot the woman on his porch, I don't know. Because he kept letting that stupid kid do all those stupid moves and ruin a lot of crap, I don't know. Because the girl was also in the movie, I don't know. Because he decided not to put the gun in his pocket and leave it on the counter, I don't know. Because they even went to the witness protection program, I don't know. What I know is that the casting director did a great job, the director of photography did a great job, the locator chose fantastic locations and the production designer was worth every penny. So my advice to anyone about to choose a script that will be so well crafted by the crew, make sure that any attempt to kill someone from the hit man is not foiled by a peak through an open window.
