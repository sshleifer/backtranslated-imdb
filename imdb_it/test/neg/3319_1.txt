This is definitely the worst vampire movie of all time. I started seeing him right after the interview with the vampire and I was deeply disappointed. Not only did the script of this film have craters as big as the Grand Canyon, the film seemed to jump from one scene to another, leaving viewers completely baffled. The vampire Lestat played by Stuart Townsend was terrible: having a good body doesn't make you an actor! The end of the queen was too easy and sudden, insulting the intelligence of the spectators. I will give this star because Aaliyah actually did his best in this movie and the soundtrack is pretty good. In addition to this, I would recommend Anne Rice to take an ax and start hacking whoever destroyed her brilliant story.
