Wow. Only wow. Never before have I seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad fanfare of inserts that someone wrote one day in 20 minutes. And then I happened to run into "Lady Frankenstein". This film takes everything you know about Frankenstein and turns it upside down ... and not in a positive sense. If you've seen this movie, or you've come across Italian TV, or have the dubbed version on the 50 Chilling Classics Box set like me, as number 24. And just let's say there is a reason why these movies are here. Because they are not very good. enough, though, in the film. <br /> <br /> Start with Dr. Frankenstein trying to create the monster with his assistant who is ... obviously not igor for some reason. His graduate daughter (?) Shows up and states how she just graduated in medicine, because yes. there were so many doctors then. He then says how he wants to help his father with his work and says no. And then he makes the monster and kills him. So he mourns for exactly 7 seconds and then makes a story with the assistant as he was a thief. The monster escapes and goes on a rampage. <br /> <br /> OK, I really can't believe they killed Dr. Frankenstein so early in the movie. dies like ... 20 minutes onwards and his daughter takes over. which .... does not make much sense, but sure. <br /> <br /> So Lady Frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster that is now unleashing .... is to make ANOTHER monster! oh yes how I love his logic. so his new monster gets the body by killing someone and putting the assistant's brain inside ... I know. just nod and get along. So the monsters meet and destroy him. I love how the assistant asks "why don't we let the mobs kill him?" and she replies with "They wouldn't know how to kill him!" and finally kills him with an ax to the head. haha. oh yes, no one else could have understood it. so in the end the brain changed the new monster by killing lady frankenstein. The End. <br /> <br /> This movie was just ... weird. it was seriously how someone wrote an automatic insertion fanfic. There is no other way to describe this film. there were also some strange nude scenes. as, this girl was having naked sex in the park with her boyfriend, the monster picks up the girl and the boy walks away. haha. good boy. Then he struggles a little and dies from ..... to be honest, I really don't know what she's dead from. But. It is Lady Frankenstein. It does not make sense. <br /> <br /> This film has many of these "Why?" moments to the point that I just gave up. The movies shouldn't do that, but for some reason I see that more likely I should. <br /> <br /> So last word, it's not the worst movie I've seen on this package, but it's a bit boring, full of many holes and random things. <br /> <br /> So Lady Frankenstein gets 3 porn scenes of Frankenstein, out of 10
