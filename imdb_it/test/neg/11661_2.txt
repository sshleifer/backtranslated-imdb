The Hindi remake of Mrs Doubtfire interpreted and directed by Kamal Hassan is a somewhat poor version, and is not as good as expected. <br /> <br /> Kamal Hassan clearly struggles with the Hindi dialogues, even after all these years, and cannot even handle a scene without effort. The boy is aged and should rest. Hassan brings nothing new to the role or character as it is, Dustin Hoffman does Tootsie, or actor Marathi Macchindranath Kambli to the character of Mavshi (aunt) in "Moruchi Mavshi" (Moru's Auntie, comedy). /> <br /> What was the boy doing playing with firecrackers when he wasn't Diwali? Most of the romantic "cross connections" of Chachi - Vs Amrish, Paresh and then Johny Walker, seem to be redundant to the main plot. The Tabu bath scene was not necessary. The family is northern Indian, but must remember the night of Karva Chauth of a Chachi 'Maharashtrian'. Yes, right. <br /> <br /> The acting skills of not one but four actors, Tabu, Om Puri, the late Amrish Puri and Paresh Rawal were wasted in this film. <br /> <br /> Look at the original Mrs Doubtfire - clean, sharp and crackling with fun, unlike Chachi 420.
