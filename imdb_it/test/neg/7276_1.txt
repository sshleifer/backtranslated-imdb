I have never been interested in cannibal films before and until a couple of months ago I had avoided this kind of film. <br /> <br /> I recently had to undergo knee surgery and discovered that I had a lot of time available to my hands as I was not able to work, so I decided after seeing almost all the horror films our local video store had to offer I would have had a chance on this. <br /> <br /> Christ was a mistake! I've never seen such a bad movie in all my years of film addiction. This is just a stack of albums pasted onto a DVD disc and sold as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of respect for other horror fans who can change their brains long enough to enjoy this shit, they are more cerebral than I've ever been and this is a result! 0/10 and this is generous.
