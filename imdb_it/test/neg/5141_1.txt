I saw this movie so I didn't have to do it! I have great respect for Kris Kristofferson, but what was he thinking? Did he do it by scale? <br /> <br /> At least the title of the film practices the truth in advertising, since people and objects disappear routinely throughout the film, adding to the confusion. Kristofferson mentions this in his comment that he too was not sure if Genevieve Bujold's character really existed. This does not promise anything good for the viewer to follow the story! <br /> <br /> The "making of" function was much more interesting than the film itself. He explores the difficulty of putting together the funds for an independent film, even if the film was shot. <br /> <br /> To the merit, this film is visually pleasing and in no way resembles a film made with slightly more than 1M. Too bad the money wasn't spent on a better project.
