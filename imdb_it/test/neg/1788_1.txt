Oh my. Started with such great potential - a group of pretty sorority girls that run around almost naked, check. Then go to a bar where the cheese from the 1980s looks good, check. Go to a park of wooded trees the next morning, check. A group of girls and their professor, rowdy bikers, a guy from the General store, and that They Live dood acting as a local drunk makes a nice body count, checks (and talking about body counting, notices the strong resemblance on DVD cover for the foreign horror film - Body Count! Aka Camping del Terrore). A bizarre Indian in the woods doing a kind of ritual, hmmm, OK let it slide, check. And then, oh brother, all downhill from there. Terrible. But the monstrous head of Lochness in the pond blew me up.
