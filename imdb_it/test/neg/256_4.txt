On his first trip to Hollywood, Humphrey Bogart got his first starring role in this B Love Affair image. The first thing you should understand is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Love Affair later in the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne or the two remakes that followed. It's not even half the genre of those movies. <br /> <br /> Bogey, runner-up in Dorothy Mackaill, is a spoiled heiress who discovers he has lived his extravagant lifestyle thanks to the best friend and financial advisor of the late father Hale Hamilton. Mackaill is really a shock. Consider a career in the entertainment world as a way to make money. <br /> <br /> Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and is planning an air engine par excellence and is looking for investors. Mackaill is willing to do so, and she likes what she sees in Bogey. <br /> <br /> Considering the cynical roles that Bogart later turned into a specialty, it is a bit disconcerting to see him as a highly moral and hypocritical character in Love Affair. The part does not wear it well. <br /> <br /> Love Affair is your second B series feature, nothing particularly special.
