This is without doubt the most annoying and frustrating game I've ever encountered. Each time you turn, the game takes control of your character or creates invisible walls that you can't cross. The cut scenes allow you to control the movements of your character, but only to a small extent. Also, you have to play for about 2 hours just to get past the introduction / tutorial. It's terrible! I'm afraid if I play this game anymore I'll end up breaking something. This game sucks. The graphics are good, but nothing special, but the game is terrible. To say that I hate this game would be a huge euphemism. I put it up for sale, but I want my $ 20 back. What a waste!
