- Contains 1 spoiler, market with: ***** - <br /> <br /> Not appearing as yet another remake of "The Interview", Five Fingers is actually. Alas, apart from perhaps the harsh physical torture, he never adds anything to the realization of his predecessor in terms of suspense, plot or performance. In fact, Five Fingers never comes close to its level. <br /> <br /> What I found particularly painful to look at was not the torture itself, but the way Martijn (Ryan Philippe) staged his ordeal. It seemed to me that Philippe was looking for too much to get his right accent and made his performance nonchalantly amateur, which in turn dragged the performance of another great Colm Meaney. Phillipe's accent, far from anything close to Dutch, seemed more eastern than Europe. <br /> <br /> In addition to the acting of Philippi (which to my surprise went from the poor to the true decent towards the end), there is the question of flashbacks with the Dutch and trivial scenario. (If these scenes were set in Switzerland, the cast would have to eat cheese on mountain tops with endless pastures with cows grazing with expensive watches.) Scenario aside, the way these flashbacks pushed the plot didn't work at all for me. He made sure it was served as a fries to a drive-in and caused the accumulation of suspense towards the flatline. <br /> <br /> The film definitely became more enjoyable when Phillipe's acting improved, but I couldn't help but be annoyed every so often with scenes that were simply too implausible. Eg.: <br /> <br /> ************ Start the spoiler <br /> <br /> At some point (after days) Philippe is almost gently washed by the female terrorist . This only to be followed by the brute separation of another finger. Why give the boy a wash if he's in torture? And the breaking of that last finger seemed to serve only the title of this film, I mean, he was practically asking to have it stabbed. Didn't make sense ?? <br /> <br /> ************ End spoiler <br /> <br /> What made me look at the end was the Fishburn performance that once again was revealed a brilliant actor, but he also had the best part of the script to work with. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's much better to see "The Interview" with that other Matrix icon: Hugo Tessitura. And when you do, I'm sure you won't find this review so unpleasant. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> "The Interview", 1998 www.imdb.com/ title / tt0120714 /
