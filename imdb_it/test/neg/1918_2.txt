Life is too short to waste two hours of Hollywood nonsense like this, unless you are an undeniable 16-year-old girl with no sense of reality and nothing better to do. Obtuse characters, poor acting (artificial emotion), weak history, slow rhythm and, most important for this film, they are imperfect: nobody cares about the excessively dramatic relationship.
