Well, I like to watch B-Movies with bad horror, because I think it's interesting to see the stupidity and inability of the creators to make really good movies. (I always compare these films with - for example - some of Spielberg's works and I still don't understand the huge difference in what I see.) I like Ed Wood's films because he's so inept that he's so funny. But folks !!! "The Chilling" is not funny and is not even "interesting". It is EXTREMELY BORANTE horror film without EVERYTHING that makes bad movies even watchable. There is no acting, script, direction, chills or even blood. It is an extremely inept amateur film. It is certainly the worst film I have ever seen (and I have seen many "worst films" - believe me). I warned you !!! 1/10
