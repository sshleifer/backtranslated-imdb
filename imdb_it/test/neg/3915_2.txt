I had never heard of this movie before taking it on television last night. I hope a movie has never been released as it would be an insult to the silver screen and to movie-goers. <br /> <br /> He had to be serious, was it supposed to be fun? Why the plot outrageously basic? Does anyone really care? ... <br /> <br /> Terrible movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
