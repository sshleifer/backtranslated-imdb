Mmmm, a previous summary says "if you like aliens and the predator you will enjoy this movie" I could not disagree, this film does not respect its weighted descent and has reduced two of the most beloved science fiction to little more than a horror movie teen horror, has no tension or presentiment present in the previous alien or predatory films and there is no recognizable main character, I really didn't care about any of the characters and I longed to see the stereotyped cast die as much as possible in the vain hope that replace them with something better, it really takes a super-human incompetence to make two of the most fearsome creatures ever invented fail to make a compelling compelling film, look at it only if you want to see how NOT to do it.
