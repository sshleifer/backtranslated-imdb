I did a review for the imaginary recreation of this director on BTK. I also saw this movie and it was terrible. Please save your money and time. This film was terrible and this director has no talent. I don't understand how these films are being financed. They are horrible. I decided to make sure to check who the writer, director and producer are, and if the name of this director appears, I won't waste my money. There's nothing worse than renting a movie on Friday nights, making popcorn, and then realizing that you've been deceived by the creative art on the front of the movie box. Stay away. So I guess I should invent things to fill the lines? I've always checked IMDb for reviews before, but I think I won't do it again. This is ridiculous. I have been corrected many times in my reviews. Not enough lines? You can cancel my account. Your site is a pain.
