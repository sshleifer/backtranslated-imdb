Unlike Terms of Tenderness and Steel Magnolia, I left the cinema feeling VERY disappointed. I started to enter the characters and in their complex relationships mother / daughter and father / daughter at the beginning. I even cried. But I didn't like the characters with the ending. The final act did not seem at all in line with the mother's character. So even though the acting was pretty good, I thought the film as a whole was disappointing.
