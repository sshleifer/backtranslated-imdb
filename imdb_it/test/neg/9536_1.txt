Wow! After the first five minutes of watching this "movie", I was rather tempted to put a bullet in my brain and end my life. It's really hard to describe what exactly this film is about. I honestly don't know what kind of human being would fund even a piece of excrement. The film seems to have been shot on video or 16 mm. Normally I have no problems with SOV movies, they are poorly made 16mm films, but this was just so horrible. And where did they find these "actresses"? I've seen some bad performances, but this takes the cake. Watch the first 5 minutes and see what I mean. BCI Entertainment should be boycotted for distributing this terrible mud. This must be the worst movie I've ever had the regret of seeing. I want my 74 minutes back! If you can sit for the first 5 minutes, without shooting TV or committing mass murder, then give yourself a chance. After all, what do you have to lose?
