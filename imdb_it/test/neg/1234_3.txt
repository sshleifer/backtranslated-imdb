the photography is good, the costumes are good, but the editing is very bad. The various scenes are cut off, or stopped at the wrong times, and the conversations are s-l-o-w and boring. This slowness continues the whole show. It's a very boring sight to watch. . . . I think other scenes have been added, but that would make it a longer show. It's very slow. The writers should have done it only for a night show, and not prolong our agony night after night. There is nothing else, otherwise I would change the channel (the first night). I feel bad for the Indians of the time, and I am angry with the white men for what they did to the Indians, but this is our story.
