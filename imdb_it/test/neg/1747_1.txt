Although the acting was excellent, I spent the entire movie waiting for the bad guy who caused so much pain to so many characters, get his final nemesis, and instead everyone else suffered except him and he gets the job of her husband of which he is the wife who causes death by running away from his friends, the girl to whom he overdosed and tried to rape wins. His friend also donates money to his father, but the butterfly effect fails to return to his cause. <br /> <br /> This is a very obscure film since every character that gets hit suffers from endless depression. None of the normal avenues for relief seems to be effective and the only thing the authorities seem to do is give quantities of stress pills. <br /> <br /> If this is normal behavior in Finland now, I will never go back in the event that I am suffering from such an amoral butterfly and end up destroyed as the characters in this film were.
