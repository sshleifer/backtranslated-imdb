This is a bit slow for a horror movie, but the quality is better than one might expect for a director's only effort on IMDb. The work and lighting of the camera were surprisingly good and the acting ?? even if variable ?? it's better than you can find in the indie genre movies. <br /> <br /> As the protagonist, Robert Field is quite stiff, which is particularly unfortunate given that his character, Claude, is the narrator of the film, as well as the center of his action. by Christopher (Brandon de Spain) that I considered the turning point of this film ?? and not in a positive sense. A twist is introduced clumsily, and the slow movement becomes pulled out and too verbose. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Pete Barker is constantly entertaining as Father William. It is easy to stand out in what is a fairly ordinary offer. While the first half hour caught my interest, I felt rather disappointed with the way things were done.
