Some friends and I have the strange hobby of looking for really horrid and absolutely obscure horror films (for good reason) and then looking at them under the influence of consumer goods that broaden the mind like alcohol and / or soft drugs. Surely a lot of people do it, but they watch films like the remake of "Godzilla", while we torment our eyes and brain with things like "The Loch Ness Horror". And, eureka, this is a bad prototype movie! We open traditionally, with pipe bag music during the opening credits. This is, of course, to emphasize to us stupid spectators that the story should take place in the Scottish highlights and not in Texas, the birthplace of director Larry Buchanan. For the same reason, the cast members have also been instructed to exaggerate tremendously and speak with atrocious speeches accents. US marine biologist Prof. George Sanderson arrives at Loch Ness with some brand new and sophisticated sonar equipment to track down the legendary monster in the lake. Meanwhile, there are many other festivals around the lake, like a group of children in a scientific field (what a boring way to spend their holidays), retired army generals looking for a Luftwaffe plane that crashed into the lake during the Second World War and a group of failed thieves and scientists who are strengthening the monster's egg. One might think that these numerous secondary plots bring a certain diversity and excitement to the plot, but unfortunately it is not. "Loch Ness Horror" is a complex and boring film with only a couple of noteworthy elements. The monster itself, for example, is a deliciously exquisite creation with cute eyes and a smoky breath. Even his teeth light up in the dark, which is very useful when you are stupid enough to get around by boat in the middle of the night. Towards the end of the film, the remaining cast members were more interested in the lost Luftwaffe plane than the monster, so it was time to finish. "Loch Ness Horror" is carefully recommended in case you are a fan of the bad B movies of the 80s, but keep in mind that it contains an overload of meaningless dialogues and a bizarrely hasty ending that makes it seem that the film is suddenly directed over budget.
