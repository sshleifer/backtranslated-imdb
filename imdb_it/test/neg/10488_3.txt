Okay it's terribly, and I mean terribly, easy to separate this movie. What do you expect with titles, synopsis and actors in roles like Carol Gilley, Ralph Baker Jr., Dorothy Davis, Bill Thurman and, my favorite, Roger Ready. Yes, star B John Agar is here as a sheriff to free the Texan landscape of a robot-like monkey from a NASA experiment that went wrong. The film has terrible shows, scary landscapes, terrible special effects and terrible lights. I really can't find much good to say about it except as bad movies, you could do a lot worse to find something terrible to seduce. It is short and has many moments of unintended humor. Lost cues, false step lighting, off-screen terror, an incredibly inanimate soundtrack, and of course John Agar who tries his best level to be the heart of the film with a serious performance in the midst of this manure. The beginning is the hardest part to deal with since it seems that it will take forever for these two teenagers to get their well-deserved run in the woods along the back roads of Texas, where the great monkey will soon make his revenge cringe in his terrible way ... Yeah, for sure! Night fright! Bah!
