"Shade" tries to be another "Sting", replacing poker for horse racing as a means to bring down an enemy, but fails miserably. <br /> <br /> I saw it all and I still couldn't. I understand perfectly why the boy wanted to double his partner. Was it because his partner stole his girlfriend? Is there a woman in the world that is worth facing so many problems? If there is, it certainly was not this shrew. He had absolutely no ransom, and really now, did he actually have a special room set up so that a surgeon could remove the kidney from anyone trying to get it in a bar? Dina Merrill makes a brief appearance as a rich woman who hosts, of all things, paid poker parties in her sumptuous home. And then the players say things like "I'll see your thousand and I'll give you another five thousand." Give me a break. You can't call ("see") and raise, do one or the other. All the children who play nickel and dimes at the kitchen table know this; you would think that adult men who play for such high bets - or at least the iron heads who wrote the script - would know it too. <br /> <br /> One of the other posters mentioned how no high-limit poker game would allow players to distribute their cards and agree. Do not allow two of the most famous car tricks in a game where the buy-in is $ 250,000 and then let them deal with each other. This is not poker; it's just seeing which one can cheat best. And I'd like to know which sane person would buy a game in which two of the most famous card tricks are playing and expects it to have a chance of winning? And above all, which head of the mafia would have managed such a game? Whenever Melanie Griffith came on the screen I was so fascinated by those giant red fluorescent lips that she completely lost the plot, and seeing her and Stallone together was more like a public service announcement for plastic surgery gone wrong than a love connection . Stallone says he used to be a grifter before buying the restaurant he now runs, but we don't know what kind of grifter he was and we never see her working with Stallone on their younger days, so we're left to ask ourselves if we're interested in it too. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is the best character in the whole movie, but he is killed right away and we are left with cardboard cutouts that all look like them "reading their lines from a teleprompter just outside the camera. <br /> <br /> Even the ending doesn't make sense: the child gets his cut from the game and walks down the street with a briefcase full of money and his partner can't be seen anywhere The mafia is not watching his every move "Everyone else just shrugs and quietly accepts the loss of millions of dollars without trying to recover any? But I don't think so. <br /> <br /> Above all, this film does great injustice to professional poker players of the world, insinuating that the only way to win is to feel the cards and play with "juiced" "bridges. And why are they always palming kings and aces? Sometimes you need a three or a nine to fill a staircase or a full house. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the whole movie are the tricks of prestige during the credits and start titles; everything in between is ridiculous.
