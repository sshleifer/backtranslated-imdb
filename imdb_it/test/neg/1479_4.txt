So boring you will fall asleep after the first 20 minutes. Sorry Mr Boutonnat, I admire your work (all these beautiful "films" you directed as "Tristana", "Sans Logique" etc ...) but here, the plot is extremely ... vain! Except for the magnificent photograph, everything looks silly and there is no envy to know what will happen to these "average" actors. Moreover, the dialogues are minimalist. The famous question "where are the children" is repeated so often seems like a farce. Believe me, it's a pure waste of time (about the plot), and 3 hours is a very long time. Certainly the real reason for this total mess at the box office!
