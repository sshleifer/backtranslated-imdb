Generally I don't review films I haven't seen in a while, so I insert or rent them to give a complete and fresh view of the film. In the case of "A Sound of Thunder", I remembered my vow to never see this movie again, so I'll just remember. In fact, I didn't think about how badly this movie was hurt until I read someone else's review and remembered the experience I had in 2005 when I saw it in the theater. My movie partner forced me to see it, even though I wasn't interested, and wow. (Later, I forced him to see "Basic Instinct 2" in the theater, reminding him that he showed me this crap. So, I guess this made us the same.) I certainly had my share of deep laughter (at the expense of the film, of course,) which didn't make him as happy as he really wanted to see it. The time-travel / butterfly film had so much bad graphics, the noisiest laughs I tried every time they showed the dinosaur (God, I liked to see that Dino and they actually were scared of it ?? it was fun!) Or simply, Ben Kingsley. It's great, Kingsley can remind us how human actors can be: go from 'Gandhi' and 'Schindler's List' to, uh, this. (Even a Meryl Streep can do a 'She-Devil' from time to time, so they are forgiven.) For months, I shot an MST3k with my friend, referring coherently to this movie for cheap science fiction movies Kingsley. Yes, the film would be a great movie to see drunk (or otherwise intoxicated): horrible exaggerated action, "special" FX that even the Nintendo64 would turn away and ridiculous twists. The biggest disappointment was that the Razzies didn't even nominate this movie for any prize.
