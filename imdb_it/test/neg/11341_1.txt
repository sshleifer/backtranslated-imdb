The racing fan Fabian (like Tommy Callahan) smokes, drinks and suffers blackouts while juggling feelings for the seductive brunette Annette Funicello (with the name of Francie Madsen) and for the blonde Diane McBain (like Annie Blaine). Complicating matters are Ms. Funicello's boozy boy car, Warren Berlinger (in the role of Eddie Sands), and her father Jan Murray (in the role of Pete Madsen), who encourages reckless drivers. Funicello's performance with cow eyes is sometimes pleasant; however, his drunk driving scene is unnerving. "Thunder Alley" provides slightly more excitement to NASCAR than its predecessor, "Fireball 500" (1966) *; be warned, it's not much. A wild party scene, characterized by a light joke, is the weak point of the film.
