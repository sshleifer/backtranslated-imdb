Oh what a disappointment this movie is. I can't believe it was directed by Wajda. There is practically no storyline and 90% of the film is composed of various people walking in and out of the screen, weakly trying to interact with one another while talking about the Katyn massacre. The most interesting part comes at the very end, but at that point I simply stopped worrying while trying to suppress my yawns. <br /> <br /> Almost the entire film is shot with a hand-held camera, which should convey the feeling of "personal immediacy", but there is nothing personal or immediate in most of the film. Instead, the constant jolt of the camera made me seasick. To be honest, there are also some great shots (no pun), but nothing that makes you go "Wow!" <br /> <br /> If you are not familiar with the Katyn massacre, the film will start scratching your head. If you're familiar, you'd even scratch your head, though perhaps for different reasons. Basically, the film affirms and reiterates over and over again that it was the Soviets who killed thousands of Polish soldiers in 1940. This point is repeatedly hammered as if someone in the audience needed to be convinced of this basic historical fact. However, the film never tries to explain why they were killed. After all, tens of thousands of Polish soldiers in other camps of Soviet prisoners of war were not damaged and were released in 1941. Furthermore, it was never adequately explained how many people died, even though the figure of 20,000 was launched in a pair of times. > <br /> The acting is adequate with only Komorowska (old) and Chyra (Lt. Jerzy) giving remarkable performances, but they can act for about 10-15 minutes in total. Certainly not enough to bring the whole film. Many other actors seem to have been chosen more for their matinee looks than for their acting skills, but I won't mention their names. Suffice it to say that I am absolutely NOT Oscar material, so any claim that this film has been "robbed" of the Academy Award is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Even the tone of the film is wrong. On the one hand it tries to be an accurate historical drama, on the other it resorts to cheap anti-Soviet propaganda, such as showing a Russian soldier tearing the Polish flag and using it to clean boots. Then there are some puzzling scenes that have absolutely no impact on the plot, like a couple climbing on a roof or winding up the University of Krakow. <br /> <br /> There are many missed opportunities to make this film more interesting, such as adding a political corner to the story, or showing the German discovery of the tombs, or even portraying Anna's journey from the Soviet-occupied side to Krakow occupied by the Germans. All these aspects could have been the main part of the film, but instead they are reduced to a couple of minutes. In the end, we get a collection of vaguely coherent, confusing and boring scenes about the reaction of Poles to one of their greatest tragedies of the Second World War. Not very compelling and not worthy of Wajda.
