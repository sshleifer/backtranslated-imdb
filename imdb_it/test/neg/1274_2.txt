I'll give this: he tried. He tried to make it good and also involved Luke Wilson. Luke Wilson is good, but he can only do so much. It fails to make up for the fact that the story was very flawed and that the characters were underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> The "gag" running with the bully was asinine. It was never fun and I got tired of the gag very quickly. And the barefoot boy was also a little weak. Did you hitchhike in Florida? Yes, OK. <br /> <br /> The film felt like a mediocre film at times with this underline mantra: stupid adults, intelligent children. And that piece gets boring. <br /> <br /> But the only fun moments were the police cart that Wilson drove when he lost his team. I love that little cart, especially when Wilson turned on the sirens. But apart from that, nothing else was worth my time. "D-"
