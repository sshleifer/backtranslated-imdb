Of all the children's movies I've seen over the years this was probably the worst. I took four children aged 7 to 11 and none of them liked it. <br /> <br /> The script seemed to be based on a Willy Wonka-style story but had nothing at all. <Br /> <br /> If you're thinking of seeing this movie, don't waste your time, it's bad. <br /> <br /> They're making a sequel, so it might be worth watching to see if they can make movies worse, but I don't think it's possible.
