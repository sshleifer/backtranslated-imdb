This film is not a horror movie. There's nothing scary about it it's more than a torture blow. And it makes no sense to me, there is a scene of a few with bodies disappearing. For instance he Woman In The Beginning Of The Movie. Who goes off to a scene in the bathroom with Nicole and her and she completely disappears. Then he kills the police officer to get him out of his misery and disappears PLUS had to shoot him in the head twice to kill him I don't think particularly when you can see his half-blown head and not kill him? The At The End stages The Killer's Truck On Fire. This, but he is not in it. He is standing behind her. Then he stopped at the rest has been completely restored and some people are in the rest area and a new girl arrives and Nicole asks for help as the first totally meaningless girl in this movie. Save some money and skip this movie.
