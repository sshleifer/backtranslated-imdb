I once heard this movie described how you will love it or hate it. From reading some of the other reviews and evaluations, I would venture to say that this is true. I am putting myself in the crowding hatred. I've seen some really bad movies, boring movies and even low budget movies. This film is bad on all three fronts. <br /> <br /> Island Earth's Exeter (Jeff Morrow), returns to its science fiction / b-movie origins as Dr. Les (without giant prosthesis). The doctor and his assistant Arnie (George O'Hanlon - aka the voice of George Jetson), along with his friend Vera, are following a meteor. This is the crux of the cast and is almost a double date. Les has Vera and Arnie has his "Susie" (Synchro Unifying Sinometric Integrating Equitensor - the computer). Let's just say that the relationship between George and his robotic maid, Rosie, (and his relationship with "Susie") is more credible than the cold, clam-like feelings Vera has for Les (and vice versa). The object of all their interest is not an ordinary meteor, however. It is really an alien art nouveau / art deco energy storage device that moves like a 3-legged dog. There is also the little alien "energy" being that controls Dr. Hubbel (aka, the chief scientist there). The alien is obviously and from the beginning, malevolent and evil. Is this the kind of science we are distributing? No wonder the Explorers aliens were afraid of us. From the vision of some of these films, we take up first. No need for questions later. <br /> <br /> The entire film is synonymous with observing really boring scientific experiments, such as boiling an egg or adding dye to celery. It is not the fact that this is a low-budget science fiction film or is a bit poor and old-fashioned. It's really, really, really boring. The whole movie is about trying to figure out what's going on. It is so. Most of the things we learn about what is happening are through monologues and self dictates. Now add a bad dialogue, a recitation of cardboard and cheap sets and you have the qualities of an Ed Wood clone (by the way, Ed also made some really boring movies - please avoid the Orgy of the Dead). Dialogue ... oh, dialogue. Jems like: <br /> <br /> "... from less than 2 miles of ocean? <br /> <br /> Why not ?! It came through a billion miles in space." <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> "Do you think you can respect a husband who probably pulled the scientific erection of all time?" <br /> <br /> This film is obviously trying to pull a Forbidden Planet, this land of the island, magnetic monster or in the same light as the outer limits, twilight zone. That is to say, a low budget (or television episode) science fiction film that is convincing enough to overcome technical difficulties and strange situations. At the center, these films are fun at a certain level (the story, the underlying meaning or the pure comic nature of dialogue or situations). This film has none of this. It's just 90 minutes of boredom. I couldn't even enjoy it at Ed Wood's level. I highly recommend skipping this and seeing one of the films I mentioned above instead. It's so bad that if my name was Dr. Forrester, I never thought I'd show this movie to anyone ... except maybe Frank.
