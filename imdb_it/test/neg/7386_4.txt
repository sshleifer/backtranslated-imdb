Although this is the first film in the group of broken lizards, it is the last I saw. After having pleasantly amused the Super Troopers, and managed to sit through the crap that is club and beer, I was surprised to hear that they made a previous film. Now I didn't sit with great hopes, but I was hoping for a fun campus brawl. My friend asked me to remember that they are younger (obviously) and that it is their first foray into cinema. I did and I was still disappointed. By not taking away the acting and comedic skills of the BL guys, they were OK. The whole film was boring, clich√© and frankly boring. Some of the other actors in the film were really poor in acting. And the game of Rugby didn't even look like rugby. Low visibility. They have improved dramatically with Super Troopers and have fallen since then. We hope they get back in shape with Super Troopers 2
