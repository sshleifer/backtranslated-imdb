I can't believe the actors agreed to make this "movie". I couldn't even bear to look at it for a long time for fear of losing I.Q. points for every second that passes. I guess no one on the net who ventilated this dribble looked at it before wearing it. IMDB assessments only go to level 1 for terrible, it's time to get negative numbers for cases like these.
