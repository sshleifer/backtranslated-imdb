"I haven't laughed so much since my grandmother got caught in the wringer," says one of the greats in this hilarious parody of all those movies dead for the death of Val Lewton and George A. Romero that we learned to love, depending on personal tastes) over the years. <br /> <br /> In this story, a young couple of actors play a macabre joke on the rest of their troupe later, on a spooky night, they visit an island in the cemetery. Their artistic director, Alan, pretends to revive the dead by conducting a highly stylized ritual. <br /> <br /> Too much screen time is poor; the amateur dialogue includes witty jokes, melodramas and other types of useless commentary (and Alan cannot stop irritating laughing ... too much!). Once the action has begun (which is nearing the end of this film), it is worth the wait. <br /> <br /> I saw it on a television program of the local station that broadcast movies very similar to this ... only this scared me at age 13 ... but then again, you could laugh up to the end ... ... which is probably the reason, nowadays, why very few people still wear striped hips.
