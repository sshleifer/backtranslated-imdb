The story was disjointed, the acting was of no caliber that can be catagorized. More than a serial pilot of a real movie. I wanted to love this movie, but I couldn't find anything that could please. Whatever made the boys on Lost so funny was clearly absent here. Even though he tried a lot. The hooks were placed awkwardly in the midst of what could have been an episode of Dawsons Creek with dark clothes, and the narrative arc was going nowhere soon. Very disappointing for me. The final scenes were the convenience of the special effects and the way in which the villain of the story planned his entire scheme ... who was he (or she) who tried to joke, spoke of naive. Attacked with films of this genre from the 1980s, when they had more than one idea.
