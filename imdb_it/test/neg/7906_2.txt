"Soul Plane" is a horrible comedy attempt that should only attract people with thick skulls, bloodshot eyes and hairy pawns. <br /> <br /> The plot is not only incoherent, but also non-existent, the acting is largely under-parade with a band of highly moral and terrible characters thrown out for bad measure, the jokes are often spotted ahead and almost never even a little fun. This film is devoid of any structure and is full of racial stereotypes that must have seemed old even in the fifties, the only thing it really has is that they are beautiful ladies, but in reality, if you want, you can rent something from "Adult "" section. OK? <br /> <br /> I can barely see anything here to recommend as you will probably have much more useful and productive time for hammering rats or inventing waterproof tea bags or other. <br / > <br /> 2/10
