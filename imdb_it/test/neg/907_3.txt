Sigh. I'm shocked when I see a short film like this getting attention and homework and whatever. I saw this film at a festival before the director caught the eye and forgot about it immediately. It was slightly annoying to see Grinch Who Stole Christmas's heart crawling along with the narrative, the design set seen many times before, the whole of Tim Burton's weak style, and the story that isn't going anywhere. And we had the "joke" of shooting crows with the 45 the first time, okay? <br /> <br /> But I imagine that what is really unacceptable is that it also erases its basic concept from a 1999 comic called LENORE, THE SMALL UNKNOWN GIRL of Roman Dirge! As will reveal any quick search on the Internet. I mean, what's this? Is this what a Hollywood contract is based on and opens the doors in Canada for a director? "Shake your head" as Don Cherry might say.
