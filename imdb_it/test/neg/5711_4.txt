Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke recite in this controversial story of a Wall Street executive and an art gallery employee who hooks up and starts a very experimental sexual relationship. While the acting of Rourke and Basinger is ok, the flim does not allow their characters to really shape Presumably there was still a lot of movies on the cutting room floor that dug deeper into the characters and the effects of the relationship on them - the character of Basinger who considers suicide - would have made the characters more involved for the viewer. How is a glossy, well-produced, with MTV-style editing of soft core voyeurism. 4 of 10
