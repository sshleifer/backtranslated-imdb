Standard "Outbreak of the disease in the remote area, expert who is on vacation in the film". There are only a few deviations from the norm. One is that the children involved are quite reasonable from the start. They are usually monsters that repeatedly work until they redeem themselves at the end. Another is that the man of local medicine / sorcerer who is normally an impediment at the beginning is never completely taken for granted or redeemed at the end. Perhaps since this seems to have been done for the faith-oriented PAX channel, they didn't want to seem too judicious about the faithful. In the end, there were no wicked local politicians / leisure time masters trying to cover the whole thing. The lack of these stereotypes was refreshing, if we had the PAX channel to thank, I might have to try some other offer. That aside, however, this was pretty standard stuff. You've seen it all before.
