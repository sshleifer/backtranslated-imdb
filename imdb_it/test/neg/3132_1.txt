There is something disgusting about this film, and fundamentally the way it turns a sinister and twisted character into a hero by exploiting our understanding for his overtly horrible situation. Sampedro, like many who have lost hope, chooses suicide. The fact that he has been contemplating it for more than 26 years probably worsens his condition, but the belief that we should do whatever someone asks, even if it means ending a life is in my opinion profoundly wrong. What a contrast to the edifying example of the scientist Stephen Hawkings, who suffered a far worse condition for much longer! And yet, with morality upside down, the film exults in the cult of heroes, and people who disagree are depicted in simplistic idiots. There is little room for subtly especially in the encounter with the priest (deliberately manipulating the encounter of real life he was with a much younger priest). In this way I suppose the film is on par with Riefenstahls Triumph of the Will. The insidious idea is that everyone should have the right to take their own life when they feel they can no longer live it. It makes no difference whether you are physically or psychologically damaged, there are people who believe that you have the right to choose. The same people are likely to sue for abortion. It's all part of the current trend to ensure that the suffering or the sick are not seen, brush them under the carpet, the mum will tell her. OK, and we all feel very happy with ourselves. So we go down the slippery path of believing that some lives just aren't worth living, and so we'll decide that because some people can't really decide for themselves, then we'll take the state to decide for them. Enter Adolf Hitler directly from that other Oscar competitor "der Untergang". Of course Hitler believes he is accomplishing exactly what nature does in the disposal of the weak. Under his regime, there were forced abortions among the "weakest tensions", the mentally handicapped were quietly put aside and the Jews were "humanly" liquidated using gas. He would have applauded this film, and because it is not in line with his philosophy ... "some lives are not worth living." It differentiates me from Ramon Sampedro, Hitler and all the people involved in the making of this film. Human life is sacred, it is not a right, it is a gift and an obligation: no one chooses to be born, so who can choose death, not it's about religion, it's about protecting the weak and the defenseless, something that this film does a lot to undermine!
