A mad dishonesty of mess on the lava that comes out of the tar pits of La Brea in Los Angeles. Even if you try to suspend disbelief by ignoring this thoughtful premise, you will continue to scream with laughter at the senseless dialogue, the absurd mishaps of the plot and the wildly reckless holes in the plot that parade across the screen. <br /> <br /> I have a theory: every successful actor is destined to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in his career. This was Tommy Lee Jones' turn. Even if he makes a decent effort, the script is so pathetic that he too is on fire (oops, I'm sorry for that). Most of the supporting cast is also suffocated by trivial writing; some of the actors simply call in their roles. Anne Heche deserves the special recognition of the Hall of Shame for her uncomfortable portrayal of a scientist. He is almost convincing in this role as Pee Wee Herman, and he too would have done at least a better acting job. <br /> <br /> Since the holes in the scientific plot are too numerous to list here, I would suggest instead that you project the film with friends and play a game of "Find scientific nonsense". The loser could be forced to listen to tapes of sad lines in the film like "Everybody looks the same" again and again. Here is an example of the kind of absurdity that can be expected: a scheme to blow up a building is conceived, designed and the dynamite set up and exploded in a space of about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Let us not forget the clich√©s of the catastrophic film: divorced, scientists who are ignored by everyone, hateful policemen, street kids, impertinent teenagers, greedy investors, etc .; all are present and in abundance. The film also hits your head with an inexorable burst of political correctness. <br /> <br /> Only for cheese lovers and nonsense. All other spectators: attention.
