"Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is a bad test in making a sequel in just one year. The first film was cute, cuddly and fascinating. The idea of ​​a dog playing on a basketball team is pretty far-fetched, but has provocatively pulled off enough stunts to save the concept. Even human history has had some explanation. Josh's father was killed in a plane crash, so he's sad. And the public also becomes emotionally involved. <br /> <br /> Now for the ill-made sequel. It's terrible. This is the worst kind of ugly sequel, the kind that changes good ideas and turns them into bad ones. The type that changes the main plot piece in one way, this time, the K-9 plays soccer instead of basketball. It's not crazy how much time is devoted to the subject, to the benefit of the doubt, to an open mind of an attitude that you have with a film like this, there is not a positive thought when it comes to making bad films. <br /> <br /> The sequel is played by Kevin Zegers as Josh, who is in eighth grade. He lives with his mother and little sister in a suburb of Seattle. In the first film, human history involved the loss of his father in a plane crash, to which the public can refer, most people know what it feels like to lose a loved one. <br /> <br /> In this film, the emotional plot is a bit more complicated. Josh's mother is still dating. He and Buddy, his dog who can play basketball, don't like this at all. Why? If I were in his shoes I'd like to have one more parent in my life, especially one so beautiful. The man's name is Patrick Sullivan, and Josh's mother, Jackie, met him by becoming a local veterinarian for Buddy. <br /> <br /> The history of animals is too simple. Josh is influenced by his best friend to try for the school's football team, the timber wolves. The team itself seems something of the funniest American home videos, capable even of catching a ball without tripping or falling into one another. So when Bud shows up one day, he proves he can play as a receiver for them, and he is undoubtedly the best player on the team. <br /> <br /> Buddy is extremely cute in his football costume. Oh, it's enough to melt the heart. The dog is the best in this film. Too bad that there were not enough stunts made by him to divert attention from the fact that no one ever asks questions about a dog playing outside a school football team. <br /> <br /> There is a terrible plot of Russian circus workers who love to steal fantastic animals, obviously they try to capture Buddy. But their dark minds are dominated by animals and end up doing what looks like a "Home Alone" scenario. <br /> <br /> "Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is much more stupid than the first. The Russian kidnappers add a lot of lamebrain crap that, I must admit, made me laugh, for the stupidity of it all. There are too many sequences that describe in detail the nature of a coward and too few scenes that describe the real reason why people will see this movie - see a dog playing soccer. <br /> <br /> Even the performances were quite embarrassing. I liked the presentations of Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanzo, but the degree of general acting would be equivalent to a D +. Kevin Zegers and Cynthia Stevenson were absolutely pathetic. <br /> <br /> There were some hilarious moments towards the end from a couple of soccer announcers, but it's not even worthy of mention. Will the kids have fun with this movie? Perhaps, but they too will get tired when the heart feels the discussions become too long and deep. Surely they will complain that the dog has not had enough time for the screen, and they don't care about the rapidly evolving script, and protest against the boring performances, and claim that this film is rubbish compared to the original "Air Bud" , I did it. <br /> <br /> I suppose they'll think the dog is adorable.
