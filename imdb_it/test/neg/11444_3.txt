This film has it all: it's a thriller, a chase film, a love story, a mass story, a comedy, a road movie ... well, actually it's nothing like that. <br /> <br /> For as long as you're waiting for something interesting to happen, but no, you're still watching the same boring, uninteresting and superficial clich√© of a movie with a very bad soundtrack. Even the acting of the star cast is lacking in credibility. A hitman with his quirks, a girl who is playing hard to get, mobs of people acting like tough and incompetent cops, yawning ... <br /> <br /> I recommend not looking backtrack. If you want to see a good movie directed by a famous actor, go see "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" by Tommy Lee Jones. Now this is what I call worth looking at.
