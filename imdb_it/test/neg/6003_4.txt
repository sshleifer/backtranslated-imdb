If I hadn't known better, I would have thought that Resurrection had been made in the late 80s / early 90s, when a crap sold as a movie in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why people like Christopher Lambert. He speaks as if he were reading the cues and turning into a fountain whenever he had to emulate. It was easily the weakest aspect of the film. The other actors were OK, nothing horrible. <br /> <br /> It's easy to see where most of the budget went: the special effects. The killings seem rather professional, but hardly compensate for the film's dullness. <br /> <br /> I would not say that the resurrection is a carbon copy of Se7en, but it certainly has a certain resemblance to it. Focusing on a religiously minded murderer in a modern crusade, detectives investigating his work must rely on biblical passages and Christian history to put together the killer puzzle. Resurrection, however, lacks the intelligent storytelling, cinematography, acting of Se7en ... well, everything that makes it good. Instead, the Resurrection is for the public and uses the Scooby Doo mystery method to surprise it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Resurrection was as bad as I expected it to be. I almost feel bad for criticizing this film because I knew it would be bad to get in, but ... call me.
