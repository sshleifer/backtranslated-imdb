I go to this game and it's okay I think. I was expecting just a little more. The main problem with this is that hacking is extremely difficult, even if you read the instructions you can't get. Even the graphics are not as good as Pandora Tomorrow and Double Agent. This game could do with some improvements, says that if the guards are in the water and you shoot a sticky shocker in the water, the guard will fry but nothing happens. In my opinion this is the worst of the three. I didn't play the first one, but I played Pandora Tomorrow, this and Double agent. However, this game deserves a 4/10. It could do with some improvements.
