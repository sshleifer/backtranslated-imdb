The premise of this film is ugghhhh. The guy is married and yet everyone on this site seems to think, "Yes, this is fun, cute and a good movie." What the hell?!?! What's funny about immature girls fornicating with a man married to a new baby? What's nice about cheating on his wife? What is wrong with them in finding some teen boys to have sex with before they start college? Noooo, this is not good enough, the boy must be married, off-limits, out of the market, this is what we must have. Stupid girls! Then one of the girls decides that she "loves" the boy. No, she simply "loves" the way she makes her feel. Two of the girls have fun, they think it's funny and nobody seems to have moral problems with what they're doing. It is simply shameless, but yes, it's good for everyone with this site. The dark-haired girl even has the audacity to have her father taken from the boys' house, under the guile of babysitting. This is a morally disgusting film and where is the wife? Poor woman who works and pays the bills while discovering the baby sitter.
