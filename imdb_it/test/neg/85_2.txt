I have no idea how anyone can give this film a high score. I didn't rent it thinking it would be the next big horror movie, the next big horror parody, or the next big low budget horror parody. Obviously, this is not meant to scare, but a fatal flaw with production has completely destroyed the joy of the visual experience. The sound editing was horrible. I had to work on volume control for the whole movie. You can imagine how difficult it is to get into something - even a low budget parody - when you increase or decrease the volume or try to anticipate the next time you have to do it. The regular dialogue is very low and all the screams, noises, etc. They are VERY loud. We are not talking about alternating between 5 and 7 on volume control, finding a happy medium at 6. We are talking about switching between 2 and 9 on the volume where it is practically impossible to leave the volume alone. Once again, this film could be a decent example of what it's meant to be, but you'll spend so much time adapting the volume control that you'll never have the chance to enjoy it.
