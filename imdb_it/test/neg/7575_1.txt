I absolutely can't believe my colleagues at IMDb. All the praise for how "original" this film is, it's as if they had never seen "Ring" or the million imitations that came out in the 10 years since that movie. And some of them claim to be fans of horror movies! I do not think so! "Shutter" is fine. Media, I would say. I give them 5 out of 10, but there's absolutely nothing original and great and "the scariest thing I've ever seen," as one reviewer said. Puh-leeeze, people. This is clear. It is predictable. <br /> <br /> I swear, if I see another ghost movie in which the hero traces the ghost's past to find out why she is so angry and after them, I'm about to scream. <br /> "Original"? Give me a break. You need to get out more. Or at least stop calling yourself "horror movie fan".
