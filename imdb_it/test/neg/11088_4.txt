It is difficult to write 10 lines of this film so-so-noir. There is not much to say about it. It's not memorable enough to add to your collection, and I have a significant amount of noir. <br /> <br /> Paul Henreid plays a tough guy here. It is not one that I would think of playing this kind of role, but it suits us. He's still a good actor. <br /> <br /> Everything, including cinematography, is ok, but not memorable. One thing that stood out: the abrupt ending. It was a surprise It was also a surprise to see this under the heading "Hollow Triumph". I've never seen the movie called that. It has always been called "Scar". <br /> <br /> If you read about a "tense film noir", etc., don't believe it. "Teso" is not an accurate adjective for this film.
