Oh boy, it's another movie that hits the comet. Coming in a year or two of Deep Impact, Armageddon, Space Cowboys and various other stupid rap movies in them, you'd think people would be burned by this concept. Apparently not, since I rented it, hoping it's not terrible: Dennis Hopper was involved, after all, and he's a good actor, right? <br /> <br /> I've forgotten something important: along with Peter O 'Toole, Robert De Niro and several other respected actors, Hopper has a weakness for appearing in terrible films. Not only that, but it seems to be preparing for them by taking forgotten lessons on how to act. His performance in Tychus is so terrible that you expect the Divine or Edith Massey to appear in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I don't know what else to say about this garbage, apart from the fact that if you find yourself in situations of crashing into the film land, look at Deep Impact, and then Armageddon and Space Cowboys in a tract. Forget the others altogether. This is really at the bottom of the pile.
