This film is about two killer women who go on tour to kill random men they meet. <br /> <br /> Wow, "Baise-moi" has just become the worst movie of all time on my list. The plot is crazy, useless and useless. The whole film is full of violence and sex, and I'm sure no sensible parent would want to show this film to their children. I don't understand what people are doing this movie or watching this movie. Perhaps someone somewhere has fulfilled his perverse desires. There is simply no excuse or reason for the existence of this perverse and depraved work. <br /> <br /> The only consolation I offer is that I looked at it fast, so as not to have wasted so much time.
