I was in seventh grade and this film aired on PBS during a series called "Wonderworks". I distinctly remember sitting on a couch watching the movie with tears running down my face at the end. In the movie Jesse, the main character, forms an unusual friendship with a girl named Leslie. Due to a very simple but careless mistake, one of the two dies. At that time, I found the story very powerful, because the fatal error is exactly the kind of mistake a child would make and therefore every child watching the film will find it very easy to identify and feel the emotional weight of the resulting tragedy. <br /> <br /> Last year I finally tracked down a VHS copy of the show. I probably should have stayed with my memories. Watching the show as an adult I was absolutely shocked by what was a horribly done film. My girlfriend also had a similar memory of the movie, and she too was pretty sad about how bad the movie was compared to her memories. <br /> <br /> Many adults probably have good memories of watching this movie when they were children. I highly recommend that these people leave their memories intact and avoid seeing this film as an adult.
