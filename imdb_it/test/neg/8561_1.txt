I can only say this: ee03128 from Portugal, I could not say it better. The worst movie I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot of shit! When I read your comment, I thought only of the thoughts I had while watching the film. When I saw who was a screenwriter I understood it. Balaguer√≥ uses the same tricks in all his films. And his scripts aren't even better. And of course, in Barcelona we have tons of temples and churches around the city, so we can keep cursed nuns to scare young Americans who come on vacation. Please be serious! And I don't want to talk about the quality of the actors ... There's also something extraordinary. It is right to recognize it. Compared to the usual level, all Spanish actors use fairly good English
