Amitabh and Jiah Khan aroused great expectations in their press conferences, although it was easy enough for the critics, and also for the fans, that after all, this highly publicized product, Ram Gopal Verma Factory, is about to collapse on his face, in all the odds! Because, because Jiah was so immature and childish, and Bacchan, confused and uncertain. they themselves did not know, what the hell they were talking about, to the press, in step with the line of demarcation, that some love stories must not be understood, or some of this nonsense! Why is the title Nishabd? Ramu needs to refresh his knowledge of Sanskrit, since Vidhu Vinod needs to study Mahabharata, cutting in line, another glorious flop of the year, Eklavya! The comparison with Sweet Hearts and Lolit's is inevitable, since the so-called plot is supposed to have been inspired by them. but, sadly, Ramu has just made a serious effort to dig deeply into the psyche of aging and young people. Is it a lollipop that sucks the last indicator of innocence? and contrary to that strip of childishness, the show of legs at the dining table, with a Vijay, who is Bacchan in that role, bursting into shameless laughter incessantly after the protections? this girl, in fact, is at her seductive game, attracting poor Vijay to think, she is in love with him. also the legs are thin enough, and that act of inserting the water tube in the legs, is down obscene. is beyond comprehension, how can a girl, who comes as a guest in a house of a body, be so bold, cheeky and too powerful? and why the hell is that stupid wife, played by Revathi, extraordinarily well, though badly scripted, and unrealistically characterized, encourages her husband, to dance with a young girl who says sexually? that part of Vijay, trying to earn some refreshments for his monotonous life, is an absolute bullshit. because, apparently, he seems to be happy as he is, with a well-organized life and a hobby to recreate. This is reminiscent of Blame it on Rio, the old dad, and his young love, superbly played by Michael Caine. Bacchan looks terrible in the foreground, and above all, where as Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons seemed relaxed and beautiful, and that's why young chicks sometimes attract older men, for their charming character, than the vulnerability of young boys of their age. the only good thing about this film are the green ones, sprawling earthy landscapes, winding roads and a pleasant cinematography. no substance, or even a sparkling spectacle of emotions, dramas, or even intriguing, stormy sexual relations as in Lolita, this superficial film is not surprising, it fell flat on his face, and had to be run over by the screens during the first weeks ! next time, before copying a similar theme from Hollywood, Ramu should do his homework, and Bacchan should think twice! You can't fool all the people at any time, Mr. Bacchan!
