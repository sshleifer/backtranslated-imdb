Blind Date (Columbia Pictures, 1934), was a decent film, but I have some problems with this film. First of all, I have not at all criticized the actors in this film, but more or less I have a problem with the script. Also, I understand that this film was made in the 1930s and people were trying to escape reality, but the script made Ann Sothern's character look weak. He kept going back and forth between the suitors and I felt like he should stay with the character of Paul Kelly at the end. He was really interested in her and his family and would have done anything for her, and he did it by eventually giving her a fickle Neil Hamilton who, in my opinion, was just out for a good time. The character of Paul Kelly, although a workaholic was a man who was whole and really loved Kitty (Ann Sothern) as opposed to Neil Hamilton, while she liked him a lot, I didn't see the depth of love he had for his character. Production values ​​were fantastic, but the script could have used a little work.
