This film is terrible, and not to blame Jesus Franco, because it's not his fault. <br /> <br /> This film was silently filmed by Welles for many years as he took the money to bring a crew and the actors together did a little filming. As the film that Welles actually shot is unclear, even if not the whole film or all the sequences are here since several "key" sequences, like the Quixote in a cinema, are in the hands of collectors or supporters who didn't want to give up to them. The film here is just under two hours and it would be difficult for me to imagine that it worked very long. I am of the opinion, based on several comments that Welles made before his death, that he never intended to release the film, but was putting it together as a personal toy. <br /> <br /> What exists here is for the most part beautifully filmed, but dramatically dead. Very little happens for the first hour except Quixote and Sancho who wander around the countryside. Boring would be a gentle description of the material. In the second hour, Quixote ends up in modern Spain and in a series of not very good sequences deals with everyday life. This does not mean that there are not some good moments, the windmill and the chicken sequences are quite good, but above all this is a huge waste of film and time. <br /> <br /> "Completed" by Jesus Franco, who was Welles' assistant director in the enormous superior Chimes at Midnight, we have a bunch of movie fragments that have been put together in the best possible way. Many people have crucified Franco as the reason why the film sucks, but frankly you can't make a good movie with crap material. A critic went to the news as he had seen a different cut in the film in the 70s, which meant that Franco had made this version by himself and ruined it. Although it may be true, I met stories of Welles that cut and re-cut the film many times over the years, since he would never have done it well. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible, no matter how you slice it. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I just wonder how good Welles was. Apart from Citizen Kane, almost all of his films have been plagued by lack of budget or interfered, so we remained with the excuse that many of his films "would have been better if only ...". How do we know it? How can we know? Maybe Welles was a less talented man than we thought and many of his borderline movies are not so good, and they never would have been. While this is not the place to discuss the place of Welles in the history of cinema, Don Quixote's surviving material, assuming that it comes close to what Welles meant (I think he does), it is a good case to rethink how we see man and his work. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 for good sequences (although 2 out of 10 is probably closer to reality)
