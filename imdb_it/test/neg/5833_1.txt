This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story was about a female prisoner sent into space to try to save humanity, but what actually turned out was that the prisoner was actually boarded on a spaceship with a nymphomaniac lesbian commander. The whole story was about having sex over and over again. There was no need for all this footage - just to create a soft porn movie. Obviously we had to watch the heroine of the movie having sex for about 2 minutes. I don't know what all this has to do with the plot of the film, even if I assume that men look at it. I gave 1 out of 10 just because there was no other lower rating. Don't waste money or time - it has nothing to do with science fiction, but rather a movie for teenage boys to watch to see t & a. The creature was only shown in the middle of the film and looked like the alien from the movie with Mr. Weaver. Sorry for entertainment.
