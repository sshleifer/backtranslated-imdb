A boring gangster movie that leaves you wanting someone to assemble it more ruthlessly. I would have thought the Las Vegas creation story would have been interesting, but it fails almost every turn. Warren Beatty's performance as the stupid and unpredictable Bugsy Seigel leaves you wanting to look at someone else. Once or twice he flashes through the fog of his performance to offer an interesting scene, but most of the time you don't care about him. Annette Benning gives an expert twist as her unreliable lover, but she too is only slightly more flavorful than him. <br /> <br /> I don't really want to worry about this turgid drama if you're not a Benning devotee.
