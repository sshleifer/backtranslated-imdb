In order not to get bored during "Love and Sex", first I tried to think of all the films that were imitative of: "Breaking Up" with Russell Crowe and Salma Hayek (even though he had a more original ending), "About Last Night "with Rob Lowe and many TV shows. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I was admiring how splendid Framke Janssen was, so I couldn't believe for a nanosecond that he might have trouble finding an appointment. It's certainly in line to give Julia Roberts a run for her money, literally-- and wasn't Julia in some movie with this same plot or anything? <br /> <br /> Third was trying to figure out why the writer / director took the trouble to give the character of Jon Favreau the Hebrew name of Adam Levy; he even refers with admiration to eating a ham sandwich. <br /> <br /> The fourth was trying to figure out why some critics had given a good review and that's why I was at the theater. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 9/2/2000)
