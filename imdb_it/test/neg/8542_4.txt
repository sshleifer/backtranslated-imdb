Jess Franco makes exploitative films and has made a lot of them. Franco is responsible for some of the most shocking films in the history of cinema, and God bless him for it. Unfortunately, The Diamonds of Kilominjaro is a really terrible film that doesn't live up to its usual standards. <br /> <br /> The exploitative films should be judged by stories, sex and cold blood. What else is there? This film fails on many of these benchmarks. The plot is very thin, putting a single girl in the jungle among the cannibals. We actually don't get information about why she and her father were there in the first place. As expected, his father is the "Great White Chief" and becomes a goddess, sitting on the trees, naked. Add makeshift hunters and gemstones, and you have your basic rescue girl for greedy plot line intentions. The characters are in stock, not adding an ounce of credibility to the procedure. <br /> <br /> Gore? None, or at least very little. This film is often mentioned in the same vein as the classic Italian cannibal films. Those looking for that kind of blood must run to the other side. This film offers surprisingly little blood and guts. <br /> <br /> As best as I can tell the only reason this film exists, so Katja Bienert, Aliene Mess and Mari Carmen Neieto could run around naked. In reality "Lita" (Mari Carmen Neieto) does the full frontal lifting, while the two women of the jungle are bare-chested. Yes, there are love scenes ... probably the most sterile that Franco has ever supervised. Women are beautiful, but there is nothing to really make this film an erotic classic. <br /> <br /> This movie only knows about low budget antics. The sets are ridiculous. The acting is horrible and the editing is confusing. There is no real story to keep this together, and not enough of a budget (or effort) to shock or titillate. I think Franco's fans expect more from the exploitation master.
