"The Core" meets "Crack in the World" (1965 made for TV). Acting is stocks, predictable suspense. Once you have stolen the entire plot torn from "The Core" - basically the manned drilling rig - you end up with the "Crack in the World" plot. "Crack" was a really excellent movie with Dana Andrews. His team of scientists, working in South Africa, analyzed the crust and "stepped" with a nuclear device to provide a constant source of geothermal energy. One of his subordinates, even a brilliant scientist disagrees. He believes the explosion will not pierce a simple hole, but will instead create cracks in the crust. (Possible spoiler) He's right. To prevent the resulting crack from destroying the earth, they must place another nuclear device in the path of the crack. <br /> <br /> Even if I put a warning on the spoiler, I don't know if I really ruined something for both films. And since "Crack in the World is only available in a very rare VHS format if my decision is not to reveal whether the counter-blast works or not is probably academic. <br /> <br /> All in all, vote" Descent just below average.
