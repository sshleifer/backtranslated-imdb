I saw this on a DVD of screener a couple of months before it was published. <br /> <br /> I liked the main characters and the general story, but some scenes are rather sloppy and confusing. The sets were suitable but some looked like leftovers from Freaks & Geeks or reminded me of a mobile phone commercial in a bourgeois home. Surely it is not what the DVD cover reads, "Destined to be the next classic stoner", hardly. <br /> <br /> Wardrobe and hairstyles are well done and yes, there are some really nice girls in this, always nice to see a good-looking cast. <br /> <br /> Almost all the scenes contained a guitar that kept buzzing. The sound design was a bit poor. I think the less it would have been the better.
