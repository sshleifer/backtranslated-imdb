At the peak of being unbearable. Somehow I was only slightly interested, but was it because I really wanted to know what the "secret" was (which, I should say, is pretty damn obvious) or why I hoped that Scarlett Johansson wore a sexier dress? This film is poor and what's more it is a shame for all the solitary, alcoholic professors of southern literature out there. Travolta wants his Oscar so badly that he is willing to cry drunk in the bathroom after peeing his blood. Sorry, buddy. . .You are more credible is "Staying Alive". Not everyone can take a Peter Fonda in "Ulee's Gold". If you want Oscar's brave antihero against the guy you should, um, really act. . . Not just pout on the screen. Stop this manager before he / she (the name is vague by gender) runs again!
