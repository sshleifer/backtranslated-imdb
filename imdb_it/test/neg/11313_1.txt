This morning, I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed. I found myself thinking, "Oh yes, there was a Mr. Magoo movie, wasn't there?" This is more surprising because I remember following the controversy surrounding this film (the defense group for the blind said that this film was humiliating). I even went to see this movie the day it was opened, because I'm a fan of both Mr. Magoo and Mr. Nielson, and I thought it would be an excellent choice to play Mr. Magoo. I even remember the early animated titles, because I thought they were pretty funny. <br /> <br /> After that, it's all a complete emptiness. I think it's a pretty sad statement on any film that is so lame, so insignificant, and so utterly unworthy that you can't remember ANYTHING. I understand that Leslie Nielson is not always known for appearing in first-class comedies, but I saw him on "Spy Hard", "Scary Movie 4" and "Police Squad 3" and none of these were great films, but I am come away at least remembering * something *. Mr. Magoo, however, is completely empty. I am surprised now if all the controversies surrounding the film were not actually generated by the studio that produced them, hoping to generate at least some interest in an otherwise totally useless film.
