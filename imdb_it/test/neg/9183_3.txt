This movie is stupid and very short to be a funny movie. The unhappy "unhappy" are not happy to be out of the west; so they hire a drunken wagon master (John Candy) to lead them back east. The sight gags weren't fun enough to wear this. And Richard Lewis makes you nervous very quickly; but then honestly I don't like it at all in what he does. Ed Lauter is as exhilarating as bad bumbling. <br /> <br /> The film was dedicated to Candy. He died of a massive heart attack ten days before the film was completed. A digital enhancement and support allowed the character of Candy to be seen in the final scenes. Candy was a very good comedian and gave us some good jokes on his knees, belly laughs in his career. This film was not the caliber of its best. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, in the film, you will recognize: William Sanderson, Gailard Sartain, Ethan Phillips, Ellen Greene and Rodney A. Grant.
