A stupid movie, with a stupid plot. They seem to have thrown every imaginable clich√© into a blender. I particularly liked the part where two teenage girls have the French president to clean the water. Because we all know how much America is dedicated to environmental conservation. Kyoto, someone ?? And the French chef, who apparently never saw or tasted a hamburger ... That's why people think Americans don't have culture. This, and the fact that we meet your children when they come to Europe to "see the world" (ie eat at McDonald's in foreign capitals). They are not as stupid as the two priests in this film, but they have almost the same amount of cultural lighting Manners.
