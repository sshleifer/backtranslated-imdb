Soultaker was written and performed by Vivian Schilling. He also starred Joe Estevez, Gregg Thomsen and Robert D'Zar as Angel of Death. <br /> <br /> The story begins with an introduction to Soultaker, played by Joe Estevez. Let's quickly find out what the role of Soultaker will be in this film. <br /> <br /> College aged youths prepare for a summer festival, aptly titled "Summerfest". In this film, the class battle is omnipresent throughout the film. The girls come from a wealthy class, and the boys come from lower-middle or lower classes. Class roles seem to play a role in the film for some reason that is not clear or relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> At Summerfest we learn more about the apparent class struggles of why Zach is not encouraged to go out with Natalie. Even Soultaker makes an apparition, with his head apparently the angel of death. Here the character of D'Zar indicates who must die and who is the soul that must be taken. It is also revealed that Soultaker will have a character conflict regarding Natalie, and how she behaves with her because of someone in her past. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile Natalie is abandoned by her ride to Summerfest, and Zach convinces her to go home with them. During the journey home, Soultaker takes an active role making them destroy horribly at high speed. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story surrounds the Soultaker that gathers the souls of dead passengers, and Zach and Natalie who try to outsmart him to return to their bodies so that they can continue to live. Class and character conflicts are found in history, but they have never been brought to the fore or solved. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt towards the end to drag some of the drama, there is a lot of chases and running that tends to be really boring. It's not really acceptable, and it would have been nice if it had been treated differently, somehow to increase the drama but not to bore the audience. <br /> <br /> The plot and acting are decent. The soundtrack is OK, and the production values ​​are also good. <br /> <br /> Robert D'Zar in his brief appearance on the screen does a good job as the Angel of Death. Joe Estevez is good, but sometimes his role is a bit flat. Vivian is pretty and does a decent job like Natalie, though maybe she does a little bit in some scenes. <br /> <br /> It may seem strange, but surely this film could have benefited from some useless nudity. Vivian teases us a little but it wasn't enough. <br /> <br /> In my opinion this was a rather serious attempt to make a film. The results are worth watching. Don't expect perfect production. <br /> <br /> 3/10
