Last night I came across this film on a local TV channel. Frankly, I've never heard of this movie before. I simply lost track of recent Seagual films, because everyone is worse than the last. Here, once again, we have a boring Seagal as if he had been insinuated by his girlfriend to make this film and accepted it strongly. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is below zero and there is not a single aspect that the film is not falling apart. I simply have no idea why Seagal made this film. Friend, it's even worse than "Out of combat"! If you watch this movie you will begin to feel sorry for Seagal. Seems to be short of ideas, enthusiasm and money. Avoid this movie and do something useful.
