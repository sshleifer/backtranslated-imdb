If Andrei Tarkovsky had been a hacker, he would have directed Mother and Son instead of Mirror. This is the single most pretentious film made in the world, I am convinced. A son, without a name, takes care of his mother, without a name. They love each other, I guess. No, I'm not, I'm sure. These are not characters. They are not even actors who play characters. At least it might be nice, but nature also seems ridiculously retouched and changed wherever it was needed with a Macintosh computer. And could Sokurov have come up with a trivial technique like a distorted look? You should be born yesterday to buy this junk. 1/10.
