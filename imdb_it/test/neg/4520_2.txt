Wow, even American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance have more adult stuff now than WWE (at least the auditions have a number of people abusing the judges) and here's the WWE, which struggles with one of the worst moves in TV history , changing into PG. Now when I change sometimes to see what is happening, this is what I get: <br /> <br /> 1) Hornswoggle, the ugly midget who shares his space with the main eventers for seemingly no reason other than to excite the young fans and obviously beating Chavo Guerrero, a capable wrestler, in every game <br /> 2) A guest host (arghh ....!) every week to ruin the teaspoon of fun that was otherwise present. All these hosts are cheap B-level celebrities who try to catapult themselves back to fame, breaking horrendous 5-year lines and making stupid references. <br /> <br /> 3) Cryme Time is a female wrestler (she has forgotten her name, most probably Eve) giving lessons on various "street" (sob) words that are neither street nor cool. They were funny before, they stole stuff and they made loud mouths. <br /> <br /> 4) Divas wear unwatchable clothes, tie their best to look "sexy, intelligent and powerful" (by the way, I hate this slogan Remember when there were Torrie, Trish and Sable? Those were the Sometimes these divas are bad fighters, which increases the suffering. I saw some old WWE games in the Vintage collection and the divas there were "professional" no 5) PG move limits so many things: almost no blood during the games , DX is terribly annoying, John Cena does even more than his act of patriotism, a crowd that contains many children (who are so annoying), almost without "heels" etc. <br /> <br /> 6) And yes, why keep the PPVs so often: one in each month, have they lost it? No real rivalry or rivalry ever created and those that are made seem fake and only-up to that of the PPVs. <br /> <br /> 7) Vintage Michael Cole and some of his quotes: <br /> <br /> "Ladies and gentlemen, you are wat ching the longest TV show in history" (every week "<br /> <br /> "The BRUTAL and VICIOUS assault of (does not use it for anyone else) Randy Orton / Legacy" <br /> <br /> "A vicious attack on Stephanie McMohan, the husband of Triple-H !! ! ??? "<br /> <br /> WWE is almost towards its end now. Hope Vince rises from her sleep and does something (reports TV-14 or attitude era) 2 out of 10 for the current state of the WWE.
