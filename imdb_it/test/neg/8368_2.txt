I'm a big fan of H. P. Lovecraft's books, and the background of Mythos has generated some other good stories and things like that. And in the last few years some guys have arrived who have made films about the work of H. P., ?? for most low-impact gestures? and showed them to the public in places like the H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival. Now, as I said, most of them don't have a big problem, but at least they know the heart and soul of Lovecrafts work and movies like "Cool Air" or "The Call of Cthulhu" - they are what I want to think - gifts for the fan base and other crazy people who love the creation of HP. <br /> <br /> And then there are people like Ivan Zuccon, who just snatched the name and created a movie that would be fun to watch if I directed it myself and shot with some friends down on the beach. This is what Mr. Zuccon did as it seems ... but, while guys like those of Aaron Vanek or Bryan Moore may have had no more problems, somehow they still had a lot to offer, like a story, real characters and some connection to Lovecraft! Only blatant names like "Nyarlathotep" or "Necronomicon" make a film not an adaptation of Lovecraft. <br /> <br /> In any case, this film will not only make fans of the Mythos thrill and hide, but people who love good movies won't like it, 2. they laugh at bad movies, 3. like a good C -generate splatter movies or 4. watch everything Horror wrote on the DVD cover. I won't go into the "plott" of this waste of time, as has already been discussed by others here on this page, but as I said, Unknown Beyond is like a movie that I would have made up with some geek friends ... Apart from that, it's missing of ideas for any storytelling and ridiculous "nonsense-but-he-is-art" stuff. The gestures made by you of this "quality" are fun to watch if you know all the types and ha-ha, see how XY is coughing the fake blood we made with tomato sauce and other things ?? but hey, you don't put it in a DVD wrapper, you declare it a real movie and you want money for it ?? <br /> <br /> I give him 2/10 because of I don't know ?? effort or something
