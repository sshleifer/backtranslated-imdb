I only saw it because my 10-year-old was bored. He and his friend hated him, but obviously liked being at the movies. This is the first time that I strongly disagree with Ebert over many years. There is not one thing to recommend this film. Willis is good, as always. But the story stinks, it's unbelievable, there's no real story, no action, no interesting cinematic sequence, no surprise, and worst of all, the baby star is A completely repulsive snail guaranteed to turn off any parent has a fat slob dweeby for a child. Stay out of the way with every vehicle and save your child - unless you want to punish him. There is no excuse for such bad direction or writing and it is hoped that these directors will suffer accordingly.
