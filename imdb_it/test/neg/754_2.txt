Sometimes, changes to novels when turned into films are not only necessary, but a good thing. However, in the case of Northanger Abbey, it is a very, very bad thing. Not only is the story itself torn to shreds, but the satire is almost completely absent from the film, and it is a mixture of romance and intrigue that does not even touch on the biting comment Austen has put into his work. It fails at all to be funny or satirical, and instead transforms the charm of the character with his fantasy world into a drama mostly. <br /> <br /> This also influences romance. It is tortuous and aimless. Chemistry and interest have never been established. The reasons why Tilney is attracted to Catherine are completely absent from the film, leaving the public to wonder what she sees in her. <br /> <br /> Hopefully one day soon, we will get a more faithful version if the satire of Austen.
