This Harold Lloyd short was not much; not one of his funniest efforts. Of course, I've never seen children as naughty or funny. This is what most of this story is, Harold and his wife, Mildred Davis, babysitting her in-laws two young children. One is a child who cries constantly and the other is a terror of four years that does everything but demolish the house. It was no fun for me to let the boy create confusion repeatedly. <br /> <br /> The best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple thinks that this big goon (Noah Young) is robbing their home. Half the time is the domestic cat that scares the couple, but overall, that segment is fun with some nice gags of sight, reminding me of another Lloyd short, "Haunted Spooks". <br /> <br /> However, the good ending does not save the entire image, which I probably would no longer look at. Lloyd has done too many other good things to waste even 25 minutes on this. It's not so funny.
