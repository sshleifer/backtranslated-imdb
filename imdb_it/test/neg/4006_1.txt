For me, being one was probably having a brain fart at that time to rent it. Anyone who buys it will appreciate using it as a coaster. Maybe a frisbee? This is a DVD that I actually found in front of where children could get to it. Since the DVDs don't seem to be in the position of being put into that story room with all the great VHS tapes, I find it rather annoying if they line them up next to a Disney movie. Yes, moving from Dinosaur to Erotic Ghost showed what we all think of Disney right? I haven't gotten so low yet. There is no acting here. The only interesting thing is that the old 1973 movie trailers for old ancient erotic films that I was amazed avoided being burned to hell. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (if imdb allowed zero it would be 0/10)
