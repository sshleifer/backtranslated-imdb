Once again, I seem to be the only person on planet Earth able to criticize Japanese films made before 1970. "Fires on the Plain" (1959) is another in the seemingly endless line of "classics" that get every sort of praise for no seemingly good reason. As much as I love to generalize and psychoanalyze all these spectators who have such a horrible taste in the film, it is still almost impossible to rationalize because someone could ever think that this badly made stuff like this should be proclaimed as a sort of "masterpiece". What I find really ironic is that fans of "classics" derivatives like "Fires on the Plain" focus so much on the film "inside the box" (orthodox classification standards such as script, acting, camera work, etc. .) it always seems that the most highly revered "classics" are the most lacking in these same standards. For example, one of the laziest scripts for a director involves a forced verbal exposition in which the characters explain practically everything to the viewer, even when the built scenario is totally artificial. Surprisingly, the very first scene of "Fires on the Plain" uses this indolent tactic to the extreme. <br /> <br /> After a funny slap, the following useless dialogue assaults the viewer, "Why can't we have grasped the situation? We landed in the west under fire to reinforce the units in Tacloban, we lost two thirds of our men, our artillery was sunk in transit, we tried to reach Burauen airport by crossing the central mountains but without impossible artillery: the enemy's counterattack forced a fanout across the valley. by telling another character something he already knows? Oh yes, it's true, the creators of this movie are too lazy to think of more natural ways of communicating this information, you see, a quality movie would actually show that these events are happening, or in the worst case scenario it would imply a dialogue that involves a character who has no knowledge of those events. A direct paragraph to the viewer would have been better than what happened here. <br /> <br /> Such examples of poor quality films are scattered in "Fires on the Plain" to the point where this film seems to have been written by imbeciles for imbeciles. For example, the main character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in Japanese clothes. Instead of doing the natural thing like ?? Oh I do not know ?? giving a depressed mannerism, the character spits "Japanese soldiers". Thanks mate, but I could have imagined it out. <br /> <br /> Worse, this film is filled with overly dramatic tricks. The most ridiculous scene is about a pair of boots. Imagine this. A soldier walks and finds a worn pair of boots. One might think that such a discovery is completely useless, but it turns out that the soldier's boots are in even worse condition, so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his SUPER boots worn behind. Well, I understand. Are the soldiers in difficult conditions? a fact that is already clearly emphasized with their boots worn to begin with. The scene is ridiculous, but I was ready to let it go, until the second soldier arrives! See, do you find the SUPER worn boots and notices of the previous soldier? get ready, why does it come here? that his boots are SUPER DUPER worn boots! Lucky man, he collects the SUPER worn boots and leaves behind the worn SUPER DUPER boots. But see, that's not all ?? because then comes the third soldier! Find the previous worn SUPER DUPER soldiers and inspect them, along with his SUPER DUPER worn boots. Since both couples suck, he throws them both aside and smiles as he continues barefoot. At this point I was ready to throw my TV through the window of my living room. The heaviness, the excessive drama and the absolute absurdity of this sequence go far beyond the bad film production. It's a bad direction by SUPER DUPER. <br /> <br /> There are a number of similar, completely stupid moments. Like when the protagonist asks someone: "Hey, are you dead?" How the boy is going to answer "Yes" if he actually kicked the bucket. I will also be the first to condemn the performance of the leading actor, which is the poster par excellence for the artificial reaction. I laughed out loud during the slap in the head where his slingshot returned to his place with this stupid and stupid expression on his face. <br /> <br /> The fact that this insignificant piece gets an average rating of 8.4 while a certifiable masterpiece like "A Tale of Two Sisters" (2003) only gets a 7.5 is the height of the stupidity of mass. And to think that some people delude themselves into thinking that "AToTS" makes no sense. Well, not all films can have completely outrageous SUPER DUPER worn boots.
