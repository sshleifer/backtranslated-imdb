I remember very well the bad press obtained from this film due to the order of the producers' court against Clayton Moore who used the name "Lone Ranger" or wore his black mask on personal appearances. Regardless of any consideration of the quality of the film, this was the absolute height of arrogance and short-sighted stupidity on the part of the producers and their lawyers. And I suspect the lesson was well learned after this film, which was widely perceived as a kind of karma for the cretins responsible for the court order against Moore. <br /> <br /> In more recent times it has become the custom, when reviving a legendary movie or television project, to invite the original stars or stars for cameo appearances, and rightly so. Show some respect, idiots! And even if he looks up to the potential customer, which happened, at least the offer was made. This is a positive proof that the film producers, studio directors and entertainment lawyers are not too stupid and arrogant to be taught by example.
