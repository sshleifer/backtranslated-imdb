Wow, I swear it never happened to me before ?? I only saw "Golden Temple Amazons" yesterday and already I don't have the slightest memory of everything that happened in this movie. This movie is so brilliant, I guess! Now I only remember being attracted to watch it because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover, which showed a torrid design of a voluptuous Amazon who prepared her bow to shoot an unspecified target. Do I often trick DVD covers? especially those of Jess Franco ?? and I have not yet learned to resist even after having literally hundreds of horrible experiences. Oh good?? After reading the other comments of the users, some parts of my memory are back, although I still suspect confusing this film with another masterpiece by Jess Franco that I saw the day before, namely "Diamonds of Kilimanjaro" ( and, yes, that was awesome DVD Cover as well. <br /> <br /> "Golden Temple Amazons" opens with a bunch of warm white African amazons ?? I am aware of the contradiction but I don't blame myself ?? of a fragile girl because they were trespassing into the ground with the intention of stealing gold treasures from the temple. After several years and hormonal changes, the girl returns to the jungle to take revenge, accompanied by a group of squalid adventurers who are less interested At the time of revenge, but I wouldn't mind taking some gold at home. The rudimentary premise is obviously secondary to all the demonstrations of female nudity and a free farce. s, Eva LÃ©on and the other nameless Amazons are all regular choices of Franco and they like to go around with their proudly exposed breasts. You'll have fun watching all these perfect female curves, as the rest of "Golden Temple Amazons" is a boring and incompetent disaster. There is almost no violence or action and no less than half of the film is pure filler, fragments of National Geographic documentaries modified in history and that kind of thing. The exceptional DVD cover would surely be a great addition to your collection, but opening the box is absolutely useless.
