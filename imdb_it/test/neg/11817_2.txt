This is a hell of a bleak movie. Like so many "women in chains" movies, this is full of lesbianism. However, unlike most of the previous films, which strongly implied this, BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA shows a lot of skin while a horny female prison guard watches women showering and having sex with one of the prisoners. For the early 1970s, this is definitely a soft-core pornographic film - a kind of GIRLS GO GO TO PRISON! It is also a bad rip-off of the DEFIANTS, even if in this case they are two hot females who hate each other who are chained together when they run away. Considering that the original film is considered a classic, this can only be considered a classic example of bad taste. This is because there is no subtlety and the film is cheap - cheap thrills, economic writing and very cheap acting. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier is the "black prisoner with an attitude" - a woman who was up and sent to prison on this hellish island. Margaret Markov is a revolutionary. When they escape, both cannot bear each other and have opposing goals. However, since it is driven by clich√©s, there is really no surprise in the way the film ends - with their friends becoming both (gagged).
