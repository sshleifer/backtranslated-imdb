Movies like these don't need sequels. Part of Don Bluth's advantage that moves away from Disney is that he didn't need to suffer their endless tirade of straight-to-video cash-in sequels, badly animated. But apparently it was a brilliant idea for someone to make a sequel to "All Dogs Go to Heaven", so we get this. <br /> <br /> Charlie Sheen replaces Burt and is not that good. Most of the film is just a sorry excuse for a sequel and it's not at all as dark, different or fun as the original. <br /> <br /> I am sorry for the future generations that will have to suffer without end sequel like this without ever knowing how it would have been a period in which Hollywood didn't totally rely on successful films like a crutch to release trivial crap. <br /> <br /> Please, no more sequels to the movies for kids who wear it they need
