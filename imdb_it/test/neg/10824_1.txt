What a bad luck, but also a lucky one, that two pot-holing films - The Cave and The Descent - should arrive more or less at the same time. Sadly for The Descent its UK release on July 7 coincided with the same day as the underground / underground atrocity of London terrorism that killed nearly 60 and wounded hundreds - not a particularly good evening / weekend to be released at the cinema, especially to see a scary-as-sheesh movie about pleasant women trapped in a deep, dark, claustrophobic system of underground caving. The two films have practically the same elements: half a dozen characters, lost in a previously unexplored speleology system, with no one on the outside aware of being trapped down there. There is a lot of water, caves, danger ... then some vicious creatures similar to humans or humans determined to predict them. Where the two are so different is that The Cave is unreal, absolutely incredible, more like an alien fantasy sci-fi adventure than horror or drama. The comparatively miniscule British film (shot in southern England, but set in the Appalachians) is terrifying with five pairs of trousers, a beating heart that makes the viewer turn his back on people coming out of the screening at first for the shock. Destroy the girls in any previous order - you really have no idea what to expect next - certainly not you! Even the descent is illuminated in a naturalistic way, which makes it even more frightening, unlike the ridiculously lit cavern that resembles a gigantic cave of Santa Claus Christmas, with a room in a dazzling cathedral in a gloriously blue light from ... who knows where, while the torches of the speleologists are used exclusively to artistically illuminate the heroes from the granite jaw (each one more like a puppet than any creation of Team America / Gerry Anderson / Thunderbirds). Fantastic equipment has also been transported, yet the impossibly deeply rooted actors have clearly forgotten to pack up any sense of imminent danger, drama or anything worthy of a horror film - it's strictly PG. And in this case the actors collide exactly in the order in which everyone expects: I quickly wrote a list after being presented to each character, obtaining Piper Perabo out of sequence. The screenplay of the Grotto is entirely in numbers, unlike Shakespeare a room full of chimpanzees could finally write it in less than a week ... Take a typical exchange between the black and white conductors of the "good friend" who goes; "How many times have we been in this situation before the sprout?" - "Too many" (responds Morris Chesnut). I swear, you could hear my London suburban audience panting for the obvious. The scariest thing about The Cave is that in the end there is a clear opening for "the sequel" - "The Cave 2: Overground" or whatever. Be afraid, be very afraid ... Or take The Descent instead and be really scared, very very scared. RR
