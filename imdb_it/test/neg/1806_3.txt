If you've ever heard the saying, "the book is always better than the movie", Heart of Darkness is no exception to the rule. I think it was much easier for me to understand the details of the novel during the film, because I read the book aloud with my English course. We discussed each paragraph in great detail, so I grasped the concept fairly quickly. I couldn't really understand the plot while watching the movie. This could be due to the fact that there were no discussions in class, but I suppose it's also because I couldn't paint my images in my mind of the events of the novel. If you are the kind of person who believes in that famous proverb, then let me watch the Heart of Darkness movie from your to-do list.
