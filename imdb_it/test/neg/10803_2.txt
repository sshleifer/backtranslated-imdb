The plot of this film is dangerously thin and the only "power star" if we can call it consisting of Joe Estevez. I don't know what is more shocking. The fact that this film was made or that some people actually gave good comments about it. If you see the cover of the video, you will be able to read them. Someone even went so far as to say that the actress / writer could be the protagonist of the 90s. Yes! And Joe Estevez could have more money than his brother Martin. If you want to check this out anyway, I highly recommend looking at the MTS version. At least you'll laugh a lot without going crazy.
