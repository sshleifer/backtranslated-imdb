OK, Number One: this "movie" is a 90s version of a lousy 70s show that nobody remembers! Number two: as soon as the film started, I was confused, it was as if I had entered halfway through the movie! There was no plot! it was very annoying! Horrible wardrobe! Call me crazy, but it's not credible for me that the skinny little Omar Epps can chase a big man without a gun and scare him to talk! It's a ridiculous "plot". I'm sorry, but for me, kids these days can't even put their pants on one leg at a time, let alone catch some "bad guys, underground, murderers". I left the theater and asked for and got my money back! I do not recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 12!
