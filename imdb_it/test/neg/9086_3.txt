Originally, the Spiders were planned as a four-part series, and show. I don't like serials; they are generally ridiculous, twisted and banal. This is no exception. In the first part of the Spiders, "The Golden Lake", a rich adventurer obstructs the plans of a gang of criminals - the Spiders - to steal gold from the Incas. The result is a silly love triangle, with the action of some Cowboys and Indians. The sensationalism and exoticism of it did not entertain me. <br /> <br /> It is possible to legitimately trace the themes of this two-part series to the next, far superior work by Lang. referred to as "Les Vampires" (1915). In Spiders, the camera is not static, and this movie is fast, thankfully. Coloring and lighting are also adequate. None of this is noticeable, though. It is almost inconvenient, however, how closely this series resembles Louis Feuillade's serials; the criminal gang dresses and behaves as in "Les Vampires" - only the names and, to a lesser extent, the situations have changed. <br /> <br /> For further comments on The Spiders series, see the web pages for this.
