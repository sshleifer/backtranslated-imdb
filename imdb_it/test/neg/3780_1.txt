This is the result of the city of Milpitas, in California, which makes a film at home and submits to you the rest of the world. Legendary in some circles as the largest cinema turkey, this film is rightly thought of as a bad movie. Comedy part, part of the monstrous giant horror film, this film is full of non-actor actors. the plot has something to do with a giant monster created by garbage and pollution in the area and go on a rampage. The monster, which we do not see until the last 20 minutes, is rather beautiful but not beautiful enough to deserve to look at the previous hour of boredom. Honestly, lovers of bad films will also find it difficult to overcome the end. This is a stinker.
