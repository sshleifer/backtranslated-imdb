Nothing can ever pass KOMODO with the adorable Jill Hennessey as a shrink (!), But KvC isn't as bad as I expected for a SYFY channel quickie. Make sure you watch it while you're drunk or busted, or while trying to fall asleep. The title without imagination says pretty much everything: a group of mostly unknown actors converge on an island where a government experiment to grow giant vegetables went wrong. The giant creatures that came in contact with the vegetables conquered the island and ate all of them. So now the government is preparing to blow up the island, regardless of the people there. The acting is wonderfully atrocious, in particular a mustachioed general from the TV series INCREDIBLE HULK, but this is typical of this type of custom-made schlock. CGI creatures are television quality, which means you know the cartoon monsters. However, two of the girls in the group are very pretty, and it's worth looking at them as they run around in their little tight dresses. You just want to eat them!
