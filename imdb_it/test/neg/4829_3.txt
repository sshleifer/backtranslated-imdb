The speed that I think is a direct copy of the Hollywood Cellular film (I didn't see this) gives the impression of a test match that is very exciting in the first four days, but eventually ends up in a very boring draw. I saw this movie today, on January 12th 2008, on the rented VCD. The release date is October 19, 2007. But fortunately for me I haven't heard or heard much about this movie before, except it's a box office flop. So, in this situation when I watch the movie, I feel that this movie could have been a great movie, but then the director falls into the trap of Bollywood traditions again and wasted a good chance. <br /> <br /> Obviously Bhatt must be copied somewhere else as a movie. But now the days don't matter to me if I haven't seen the original movie. I just found the main theme very similar to "Nick of Time" and "Badshah". In the film Sanjay Suri an intelligence agent is shown, but his wife thinks he is a chef. This brings back the memory of "True lies". The only new part was the use if the phone. But even what I discovered is now taken from the film Cellular. So when a film is made with the mixture of many other films, its future is clear enough. <br /> <br /> The things I like about the movie are its rhythm. As the name suggests, things happen really fast and there is not much time to think between the scenes. But this stops in the last 20 minutes when the film is set in the traditional style of Bollywood Dhishum dhishum. <br /> <br /> The film's plot is also quite interesting. Three stories that follow one after the other. One of Urmila's abductions, the other of Zayed trying to help Urmila, and then the prime minister's murder plan. These three stories naturally mix with one another while the film continues. <br /> <br /> But then ordinary acting and unnecessary extra style killed the spirit of the film. Except Sanjay Suri, no one else makes an impression. This also applies to Urmila, who is always promising in RGV films. Because of this ordinary acting some scenes do not really convey the feelings that the director wanted. For example. the scene at the end, where Urmila leaves all hope and cuts the phone, should have had a good impact. But instead we wait only for the end of that scene. <br /> <br /> Besides acting, a useless love for style demoralizes the film. Show bad villains is good for Hollywood movies not for Bollywood The background of London is also just to make style and not much smart advantage of this background can be seen. Especially in the end, all those dhishhum-dhishhum were absolutely useless. It could be the director has the impression that the climax in Hindi films must have such struggles. They seem unrealistic, increase the duration of the film and ensure that people leave the theater before the film ends. <br /> <br /> Finally, I find the film once watchable. If it comes on TV or you can rent it, it's OK. But then make sure you have the remote and forward button ready. Next time, when the movie is on TV, you can easily watch other channels.
