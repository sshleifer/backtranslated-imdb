I come from Australia and I have observed with respect the extraordinary culture that surrounds the rugby union in New Zealand. I can absolutely appreciate the comments made by the Kiwis in relation to this film. It was a total insult to a race of people and their beloved sport. <br /> <br /> Anyone involved in the making of this atrocious film should formally apologize to anyone who has had the misfortune to watch it. Note: people do NOT kneel and cry as they slowly recite Hakka. It was a pitiful scene. <br /> <br /> We should feel a kind of understanding for this idiot who almost killed his girlfriend, who refused to listen to any advice from anyone with half a brain, then apparently saw the light? What a completely unpleasant character (with visits to children's hospitals that do nothing to redeem his despicable personality). And why do people even make a film about rugby Americans? They are barely present in sport on the world stage, not enough to justify an attempt to make a film about it (yes, rugby is a 'world' sport, unlike the grid and baseball)?
