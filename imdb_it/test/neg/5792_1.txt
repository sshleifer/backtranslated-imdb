This film hurt my face. I don't understand it ... things simply happened, inexplicably, and usually led someone to break out in a number of songs and dances. I don't understand how people can praise this film with praise. There are B-movies, and then there are B-musicals, and then there's Rockula. <br /> <br /> The songs made me want to run headlong into a wall. The only thing that saves is that one of the musical explosions turns out to be a music video, which relieves pain, but still fails to justify why it needed to exist. The most terrifying section of the film is Toni Basil's creep dance that accompanies his strange song. But on the positive side, he manages to find the notes he's looking for, unlike the sensations of pop music Rockula (aka Rapula) and Mona ... wow, we can say dull tone. So if you want to question life for about 90 minutes, watch this movie. If you hate your life, then buy it.
