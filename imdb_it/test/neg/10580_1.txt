I happened to rent this movie with my sister hoping to see a great funny movie, which was fun, but my expectations were disappointed. This film was beyond disgusting and revolting for a PG-13 film, this should have been classified as R for the many mature references that have gone on in this film. I would not recommend allowing a 13-year-old to see it. <br /> <br /> Although no one under the age of 17 is watching this movie, watched by a really stupid movie, there is no humor in the film, just a bunch of lousy sexual references, including a little touch of pedophilia something that shouldn't even be joked. <br /> <br /> I'd like to know what happened to the PG-13 movies, which were actually safe for a 13-year-old? This is beyond a regrettable film and should be re-evaluated.
