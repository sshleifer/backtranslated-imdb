Rented this from my local Blockbuster with the title SPECK, which could be the way to look for it if you still feel the need to see it after this review. <br /> <br /> It's a film about serial killer Richard Speck, who killed several nurses in Chicago in the 1960s. Looking at the film, one has the feeling that it follows the crimes to the letter. Unfortunately, this is not a good movie. Another problem that I had was the almost constant music that made us know that this was a SCARY MOVIE, and some terrible narration that made us know what Speck motivating. The acting was average for this type of film; to give credit where credit is due, the film is very well photographed for my taste. Your mileage may vary. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you are interested in the subject, it may be worth it.
