The Giant Claw is in fierce competition with films like "Robot Monster" and "Plan 9 From Outer Space" for the worst movie of all time. A fake-looking vulture hawk attacks 'Lionel Trains' in this completely unconscious film. The script is so bad that everything the characters say to each other is ridiculous. No wonder this film is a primary focus in the film, "It came from Hollywood", where this gem is hammered for the line, "A bird as big as a warship", with chilling and endless needle-punching. The line opens inexorably throughout the film, so there is no way to avoid it. There are several hits from "The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms" and "Earth vs. The Flying Saucers", among other sci-fi films of the 1950s to reinforce the attacks of vultures. At one point the great vulture is responsible for some deaths, so the army puts the whole world in check and no one can leave home. Of course, the huge buzzard is mainly interested in pursuing the stars of this classic, Jeff Morrow and Mara Corday, wherever they are. Yet the director is so lame that he doesn't even provide a few shots of the beautiful Mara's honey in a decent dress and black heels for a little relief from the tedium of this zero-star thriller. This is the second time this mistake has been made. In 'Tarantula', Mara Corday struts in warm clothes throughout the film, but is relegated to pants all the time, 'The Giant Scorpion'. The budget for this film must not exceed thirty or forty thousand dollars and I doubt that Morrow or Corday have made more than three thousand. It seems that everything was shot directly from someone's garage.
