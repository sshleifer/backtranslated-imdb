I really tried, but this movie didn't work for me. The action scenes were boring, the acting was surprisingly poor, and some of these characters were too stereotyped to even be funny. Pam Grier tries, but when you have nothing to work with, even her considerable talent cannot prevent a disaster. Even by the standards of this weak genre, this film is pretty ugly.
