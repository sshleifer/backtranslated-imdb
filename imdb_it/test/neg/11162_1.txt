I love TPB but this was a lame episode. I didn't have the same feeling that the series or the movie has. He seemed to be hastily put together. I didn't like it at all. The so-called acting was horrible. The cast appeared as if they knew this was a stroke of luck in an episode to get to market quickly. I hope there is no next Easter special, because it will be for me. The writing of this episode was certainly the worst of Mike Clattenburg in the history of this show. The management left a lot to be desired and I almost felt guilty about the cast and crew of this weak attempt at a Christmas special. As I said, I love TPB but this goes to the trash.
