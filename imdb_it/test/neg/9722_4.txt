The TV commercials of this film showed the sorcerers to hit a truck head-on, then they were torn to pieces and reformed on the other side of the truck. I thought the special effects were good, but the overall style of the film was tiny. This is the TV series "Charmed" with three boys instead of three girls. <br /> <br /> The big surprise for the three guys who are about to become adults is that there is a fourth unknown member of the clan that is out to take them and consolidate all their power. In addition to driving on trucks, these children can fly up the sides of the houses, climb out of the windows, push one another in piles of garbage and blow the veins in their necks. But if they use their powers too often, they become prematurely old and weak. The father of one of the boys is the proof, while sitting in an attic composed of a mummy but he is only 45 years old. <br /> <br /> The three good sorcerers are all rich in their own, completely ruined, hateful and annoying. In any public school, these children were beaten every day. Their reflexes and facial ticks would not cut the mustard with the hooded boys. Unfortunately for all good people, these Charmed boys were sent to the Hogwart Reform School for warlocks who could not enter the Harry Potter class. <br /> <br /> So what was it? Three teenagers behaving each other and their friends. Another teenager who envies their power and money and seems to be a lost relative. After some scenes where the Charmed boys show off their powers and have sex with their girlfriends; the film reaches the plot of revenge of an unknown warlock wizard. Predictable things happen. The evil exterminate tends to ambush several friends of other sorcerers, and eventually starts to attack them too. The final clash happens, and that's all. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not bad, but nothing special. If you like to see fireballs, spiders and blue veins, then this is a good movie to watch.
