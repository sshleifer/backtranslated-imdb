No wonder this was free with the Mail on Sunday, slow going, poor acting, and filming (glow, near the start of the film, it's not even artistic) = Straight to the video, but not in this case, why not recover some of your (film production costs) by releasing it for free with a newspaper on Sunday in the United Kingdom, at least in this way you get an audience in captivity, and recover some costs. <br /> <br /> I didn't give this movie 1 out of 10, due to the effort to rip some old actors out of the shell, it was good to see old faces (Vanessa Redgrave, this is not Blow ?? Up) , but Vinnie Jones as the protagonist, and I think it was better in Gone in 60 seconds when he didn't speak. <br /> <br /> This movie is falling in the charts every day, I think this will find its true mark at 3-4 out of 10, in the very near future
