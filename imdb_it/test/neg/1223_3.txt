I looked at all three segments and I'm so disappointed in the plot. Zahn spends so much time mimicking Duvall that he doesn't do anything else on the show. And Tommy Lee Jones would never have been as weak as a young man, an unpleasant but never weak yes. We never see how or why they come back to Lonesome Dove ... which is a hole in the original ... why would they ever leave Austin where they are heroes ... to do nothing during the entire movie ... I was cheering for Blue Duck at the end of the film and he was completely destroyed. There is no warning about how many segments there are ... it simply ends. This mini series could have been "someone" ... tragic. It seemed to be directed by Parrot and Jag
