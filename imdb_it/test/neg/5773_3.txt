Oh dear oh dear. It annoys me a lot when a low budget, useless horror business tries to look interesting in the credits, making a group of good names appear in the cast, only to involve everyone in the smallest and most useless role possible. In this film, we have Richard Lynch in one scene, a momentary appearance by Martin Kove, a short spot for Vernon Welles, a little more screen time for John Philip Law and some time for Karen Black. This group of random cameos is not that great, although Richard Lynch and Karen Black raise some of the few smiles of this film with their appearances, and it's rather painful, since none of the main casts is very good. I couldn't help but think that if more scenes had been shot with any of the veterans of the film b above the film it would have been much better, but since there are only a few tempting glimpses of good entertainment without the film reaching really much value of entertainment. Of the main cast the only charismatic or funny performances in my opinion were Steve Wastell, like Axel and his girlfriend who I think was played by Elina Madison (I've never heard it before but it has a certain amount of presence on the screen and it's a good vision) . The plot in this is simple, the undead and miner goes after those who try to steal his gold, and it should be fun, especially since it is directed by John Carl Buechler, who did special effects for many of these sort of a of films, including having worked on all three major slasher franchises (Halloween, Elm Street and Friday 13) and small jewels like Mausoleum. Unfortunately, the film is sadly lacking in suspense, sympathy and satisfaction. There are one or two slightly bloody moments, but nothing is worth the effort of watching the film, I wouldn't say. In fact, apart from the cameos mentioned above, the entire film is really stale and turgid of characters that can't be revealed fast enough for my tastes and an unfortunate lack of real interest. I didn't even find it funny in a laughable sense of the bad movie, which is rare for me, since I love a lot of pretty bad movies. I would say, avoid.
