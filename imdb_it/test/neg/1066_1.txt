I really hate and despise this movie and the directors behind it. <br /> <br /> Of course, everyone is making a tough and honest film about youth and youth culture.1987 "River's Edge" is an excellent example of a well-made teenage drama. However, what I make exception is the childish, messy and sensationalist approach that the producers of "2:37" took. <br /> <br /> A prime example is how it raises so many problems and yet fails in any way to comment or reach a resolution even on one of them. <br /> <br /> My other big problem with this film, apart from its complete plagiarism of Gus Van Sant "Elephant" (surprised Van Sant did not sue) is his attitude as a 'bull in a store of porcelain 'to issues quite delicate as incest and in particular suicide. <br /> <br /> In short, avoid this movie like the plague and everything this filmmaker has ever been involved with. I heard that his motivation in making "2:37" may or may not be based on lies. Having seen the lower than average result, this does not surprise me at all. This is a glorious exercise for students who have no space in any cinema or DVD. Pure and simple.
