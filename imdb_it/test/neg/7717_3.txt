So lame isn't even funny. A zombie infection surpasses a small university campus and a government team of secret agents backs up a couple of scientists sent to find the origin of the epidemic. Damn collecting the DNA of the zombies is not easy. Once bitten you are one of "them". The entire university has been completely infected by the experience of the undead. <br /> <br /> This sequel does not redeem even the horrible original house of the dead (2003). However, meaningless entertainment is realized. Some glimpses of female nudity added to a herd of blood and exploding heads should make any zombie joke happy. Accredited cast members: Emmanuelle Vaugier, Victoria Pratt, Ed Quinn, Sid Haig and Nadine Velazquez. The word "F" holds together a script without imagination.
