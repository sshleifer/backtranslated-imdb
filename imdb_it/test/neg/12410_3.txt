Summary: a solitary swordsman, who lives in the desert and acts as an agent of other swordsmen, remembers how his life turned out to be as it is. He began with the fact that the woman he loved chose to marry his brother, making him leave his hometown. One of the swordsmen is Huang, who is in the middle of a complicated love story, in which a woman wants to kill him for getting rid of her promise to marry her younger sister. But the sister wants to hire a swordsman to protect Huang, and everything is put to the test when the woman and her sister are really the same person. <br /> <br /> Comments: I saw the version of Redux released in 2008 of the original which was released in 1994. As the two versions differ I can't say, but the Redux is strongly stylized in the Chinese mode of action of wuxia. This is a shame because that style seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and fun movie. An understandable story. But true to his style, the scenery and visual elements seem much more important and much more focused on the writer and director Kar Wai Wong. So there are many colorful scenes, very beautiful, completely foreign to the story. <br /> <br /> Even the editing and history of the story are poorly managed. Much is left out in the scenes, the timeline is broken and reorganized in a confused way. The very slow and calm scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and apparently groundless fights, only to be relieved by something else and unrelated. The result is a confusing and uninteresting film. <br /> <br /> Thanks to these brutal but very few fights, the film is included in the action genre. The poster and the photographs also imply this, but they could almost be considered as a false marketing. Only a few minutes out of 90 could be considered something like the action, the other could not be further from it. The film in its entirety is very slow, boring and therefore very boring. Not even the rare action-packed scenes help because they are so disconnected from the rest of the film. I could say that I'm not a fan of this Chinese style, since they often seem to be afflicted with these same problems, the most important thing is that the view is more important than the story, but Ashes of Time Redux is perhaps the worst example that have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 3/10
