Every great romantic comedy needs a conflict between the romantic parties to give suspense, anticipation and charm to the plot. This story is completely flat in this area. There is no conflict - at least no one that can inhibit the possible union of the two protagonists, and therefore the suspense is flat, there is no waiting, and there is really no charm. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane is representative of friendship at best, and with the talent of these two particular actors, I was rather surprised. During the film, I expected them to play checkers and chat about the weather rather than see a moving passion. <br /> <br /> Even though I'm a fan of both actors, I think the casting this movie was out of date, or maybe the management was off-base and influenced their deliveries. The writing was very weak, which could also affect performance; surely, the script could have used the help of some Harlequin writers who have a real experience in putting the warmth into the love story. <br /> <br /> This film could be worth watching on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but only after it is on the cheap shelf. <br /> <br /> (Excuse Diane Ladd and Richard Gere).
