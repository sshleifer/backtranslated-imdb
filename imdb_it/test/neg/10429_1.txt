Every film school student could make a film 1,000 times better than a piece of junk. As someone who had read the book, I expected that even a direct reissue of the book would make this film an honest film. There was the possibility that a talented director could go beyond Woodward's narrative and make a great film. <br /> <br /> Well, the director has gone beyond Woodward's narrative. He added a Hispanic angel named Velasquez who was not in the book. He had asked Bob Woodward to interview the dead Belushi in a morgue exchange. The film had all the intuition of someone stoned on PCP who was staring at his navel. <br /> <br /> If this is a spoiler for you, you'll thank me because it's absolutely the worst movie ever made.
