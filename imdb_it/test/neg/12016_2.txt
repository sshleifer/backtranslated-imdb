Seriously! You just have to watch this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it. He came out during the time when everyone was trying to make films for families that everyone could enjoy (little rascals, Mr. Nanny, etc.), but he had no charisma or enthusiasm. Every single character in the film is driven by anger, with the exception of Trixie's mother, who shows only irritation and fatigue, perhaps due to the tired clich√© enjoyed by this film. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, the film's biggest flaw was not acting, nor filming, but above all writing. The lines we receive are reminiscent of Disney classics, although this film lacks all the heart that IL 'Walt has managed to achieve. Junior's dad, (John Ritter) drives you crazy without even doing anything, simply because it allows Junior to run unattended, and only gives him a stern warning when he touches a 200-pound giant at a blackboard. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Junior's grandfather is particularly atrocious. For those of you who saw the first one, they found it nauseating and, therefore, did not see the second, "Big Ben Healy", as it is called in this film, is still a total douche. He basically breaks into John Ritter's house without being invited, settles in Junior's room, even though he says he hates Junior, and basically does nothing to speed up the film, or to support the film in any way. Rather, the public appears by becoming a free lazy person. <br /> <br /> Finally, we are introduced to a great variety of new characters, such as the smug, nasty Trixie, who carries dynamite in his backpack, which he first lights, then passes, to Junior, who simply stares at the eyes wide open. In addition, Gilbert Gottfried returns in this film, this time playing the hateful principal of the new Junior elementary school. If Gilbert Gottfried is not enough to get the point of view, I simply put it: this movie sucks! <br /> <br /> 2/10 stars, because the actor's beliefs shine through the film, even if the script sucks.
