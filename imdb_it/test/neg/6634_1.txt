First of all this film has the dumbest plot of any movie I've ever seen, and unfortunately I had to see it. One day I was looking through channels and came across this lousy excuse for a movie, and confirmed what I said for a long time. Carrot Top is not an actor and is NOT funny in the slightest sense. He acts as if he were a great comedian and thinks he has the attention of the public. Frankly, he has the acting ability of a 10-year-old clown, scratching that less than a 10-year-old child's ability to compare them with Carrot Top would be a serious insult to their good name. This film tries to be funny using a shabby halo that seems to have been raised from the 50s comics. In the end I would have done anything to erase my memory of this film, but unfortunately the memories remain with me. The only thing I can do is to warn others never to watch this movie. However it shows the rumors that the real Carrot Top cannot do anything worthwhile.
