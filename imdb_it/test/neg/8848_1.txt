Don't see this movie. In most cases, like that of Ju-On and The Grudge, the Japanese film is infinitely better than the American remake. However, this film was terrible. Ghosts, just like a trick or a treater dressed like a phantom sheet, complain and gasp in an attempt to scare in the absence of good makeup or special effects and acting is simply horrible. The story itself is inconsistent and confusing, not everything is explained by letting the film go from bad to worse. Don't waste your time with this film, it's not worth it and I'm sure there are other fun things to do - like looking at dry paint.
