This movie is bad. I saw the classified and unclassified versions. They are terrible !! Now, I know it's supposed to be a low budget, Spiderman's porn parody, but Spiderbabe isn't good at being bad-good. It's not funny! Not at all funny !! I wanted to laugh. I tried to laugh. But this film disappointed me. At least the unclassified version has a lot of nudity to look at. And it's me, because Mundae is not a good looking woman. From the waist down it's fine, but on the road it leaves a lot to be desired. He looks good in that school girl dress. Please, if you have to watch this spiderbabe, rent it first. Rated or unclassified, it makes no difference, they are both bad for me !!
