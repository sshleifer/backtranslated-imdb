Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! Drab, without imagination, predictable - and with all the usual suspects. Exactly the kind of film that the Irish film industry shouldn't do. And with the added benefit of a treacle-coated finish. A disgusting example of how talent and originality are ignored in favor of an almost aggressive mediocrity. Yes, children are sweet Yes, it looks like it's done professionally. But this is film making by numbers, a direct confrontation and grasping what the director obviously thinks is "success" - a film that protests and despises the public. It is rather surprising that Working Title pays 3 million pounds in this garbage. But then, they actually paid love. Don't waste your money.
