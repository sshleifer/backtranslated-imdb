Exorcism exercise based on numbers with a disappointing non-loyalty and use of the term "black water". The cinematography appears outside the base of the MOW cable that removes any semblance of marshy and turbid atmosphere. Furthermore, there is not enough blood, sex or interesting things to satisfy most of the film's spectators. That being said, the leading actress who plays the possessed has a sexy olive presence. What else must be said about this non-winner? Don't rent unless you have a thing for middle-aged adults who complain about their past and rush with clich√©s of priests, shrinks, Hispanic grooms who regret their past actions.
