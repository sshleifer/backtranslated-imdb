I saw this movie last night and I came online specifically to see if others thought it was as horrible as I did. <br /> <br /> Of course, obviously some people see a lot in this film that I haven't seen, so if you're one of those people, well, good luck to you. But I'm a patient person. I had fun with very long films before. But this was a torture exercise for me. <br /> <br /> I honestly felt that this was one of those films with little to say, and that it was more about style than substance - however, the style, too, made me feel like tearing my hair out. Virtually any interesting thing that happens during the course of the film takes place OUTSIDE FIELD. It is like a deliberate attempt to make a film entirely outtaken, that is the bits that would usually be reserved for the deleted scenes section of a DVD, if they were shown to the public. <br /> <br /> In the end, I find out EVERYTHING about the main character, Francois. I did not like any of the characters in this film, except perhaps the violinist and his goat, and the old man who believes that octopuses live at 300 because they are really intelligent. Seriously, I was excited when he hit Francois with a gun on his head. I felt so ripped off when even his inevitable suicide turned out to be boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Oh, and where was the publisher? Also smoking opium? I swear, I almost screamed every time I was subjected to a prolonged throw of absolutely nothing, except maybe someone walking back and forth, and then FINALLY there would have been a sharp cut to the next scene, and it would be ONE YEAR LATER and WE DIDN'T MISS EVERYTHING INTERESTING THAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE NEXT QUESTION, AND EVERYONE HAS STILL ALSO THE SAME BLOODY CLOTHES ....!?!?! ??? <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, if you liked it - great. But this review is intended as an antidote to the sown "you will like this film if you love cinema" which I have seen post here and elsewhere. (See? I hated the movie and I STILL included an astute reference to its content!)
