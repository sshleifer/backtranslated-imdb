This is absolutely nothing like the WWF and the Attitude Era of the WWF. I've always been a WWF fan and I've never looked at his competition. Now, sad the day I wanted the WWF to take the lead. At least the WCW would try something new and radical all the time instead of keeping up as a mask of the real intentions of the show and this also applies to ECW. The WWF has always had to deal with Hulk Hogan, Andre The Giant and other old wrestlers in this way and the 'Attitude Era' happened only to recover the radical ideas of the competition. The WWE is the same garbage that was before the Age of attitude was ridiculed and demoralized. The wrestlers are terrible, the split of the mark is a mental stirring, and the narrative lines and the clauses are non-existent. The WWE is so bad that it ceases to be an old shell of itself, pushing characters and wrestlers to the main event suddenly and maintaining the barriers of creativity. Of course, the show shakes the brains of sweet, innocent and easily brain-washed and skinny, stupid, pariah and stupid children of the Internet Wrestling community who actually consider the company something good. Anyone who shudders and leans on the thought that this show and this product is good can go straight to the devil.
