This is not a good movie. I can't believe that after fifty years this film received the National Award when there were gems from the Marathi cinema that were so systematically ignored. This is a very overrated film that has become very, very lucky. It has been awarded the National Award, collected the popular opinion and will now represent India before the international public. Anyone who also has a marginal knowledge of good quality cinema will know very well that this will not even be nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> I can't figure out where to start. There are so many things that are wrong and are missing in this film that was even considered for the National Award. That this film was awarded as the best film released this year goes to show the distorted judgment of people who hold the reins of Indian cinema and the slight understanding of people who blindly appreciate this film. <br /> <br /> The topic chosen is fantastic. Is it important that these films are made ?? but only by people who are able to manage them. Sandeep Sawant is not up to the task ?? not even close. His direction is nervous, confused. There is no clear thought process. He tries, but is not able to explore the depth of the characters, especially the grandfather. He is unable to show the initial horror, anxiety and desperate detachment and yet his grandfather's insurmountable courage. We waste our time in the hospital when we should have shown that time pairs spend together. He is trying to cram everything without any priority. He does not understand his subject correctly and this really counts against him. <br /> <br /> However, the cast doesn't even help Sawant. Worst job ?? Amruta Shubash. He's a terrible actor and a terrible choice for this or any other acting job. How did you get "Tee Phulrani"? Extremely lucky and / or extremely influential and / or extremely pitiful cast. Having said that, he does everything to do a still terrible job in this film. His MSW act should have gone to the most responsible actor ?? Sonali Kulkarni. Amruta Subhash didn't understand it. MSW's work is subjected to constant emotional stress and yet it is important for them to project a calm and strong appearance, as this is reassuring for patients. Amruta Subhash's Asawari seems even more frightened and in need of support from the people she works for. <br /> <br /> Second worst ?? Arun Nalawade. I have never seen a more woody face in the Marathi film industry (it is still present everywhere in today's Hindi cinema). He is the producer and therefore chose himself; no second thoughts, no consideration. Any good actor would have jumped to play this role even if he had to pay the producer to do it, but Arun Nalawade wouldn't let anyone else do it. More ambitious and dull, it helps make the film fall more than all the others put together. His acting lacks research and even basic acting skills. My choice for this role would be Vikram Gokhale. <br /> <br /> Music is not inspired. The film is technically lacking. It may have been a FTII project work. <br /> <br /> On the positive side; brilliant interpretation of Ashwin Chitale. It is incredible that such a young boy can perform in such a respectable performance. It has embarrassed many actors today. Perhaps involuntarily, but he brought his innocence to his character and this made his performance memorable. Furthermore, Sandeep Kulkarni really gave a very credible performance. Really put in all his efforts and shows. Even the script is well written. <br /> <br /> 'Shoestring budget' cannot be a valid argument to praise this film. Lack of dog funds all Marathi films. Cricket and Hindi films scour all the money and the rest is left to fight for waste. It is a state of unpleasant things, but it is not a sufficient reason to praise an immature film that comes out. 'Doghi' was a fantastic film and this too was done with a small budget. Even 'Doghi' was missing technically, but it was well studied and well done. He was rich in detail and supported by wonderful performances by everyone and this made him rich in cinema. Why didn't he receive the much-deserved praise? ?? just shows my point of partial judgment. <br /> <br /> The lack of research and not of funds, is what makes 'Shwaas' such a bad film.
