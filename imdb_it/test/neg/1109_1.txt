All I could think about watching this movie was, "Will it ever end ?!" It was unbearably boring to watch. I just wanted to turn it off, but I wanted to do justice to this review, so I fought the good fight and resisted the torture of watching this movie all the way so that you, the good reader, didn't need to endure that pain. <br /> <br /> This film seems to have an excellent premise if you read the premise on paper. However, the real film does not provide this premise at all. <br /> <br /> The opening scene features a mini-tree in the early 1900s, where children are forced to carry dynamite through tunnels that are not large enough for adults to adapt. This seems to be the premise for a interesting film. But after 4 minutes, it becomes clear that this is not the case. Adults who have committed these crimes are never punished; there are no consequences shown in the film for their actions. The opening scene is definitely better and totally irrelevant to the rest of the film. The last time an opening scene misrepresented a film so badly was the opening scene of 28 Days Later which was the only positive scene in * that entire movie. Wicked Little Things / Zombies (a film so disgusting that changed the title to try to mask its crap and sell it again) is exactly the same in this sense. The opening scene is the only manageable scene in the entire film. <br /> <br /> Instead, the film dances forward to the present day. A single mother and her two little boys with dirty mouths. Right here is when it would have been wise to press the STOP button and never go close to the film. <br /> <br /> In the first hour, the zombie children are just seen. They get maybe 3 minutes of screen time, total. All they do is kill a pig, that's it. The rest of the time is spent showing the stupid mother and her stupid little boys are buying things at the local store, running around the forest and having silly conversations with each other. The stupid teenage daughter leaves and hangs up with other idiot teenagers and smokes weed with them. <br /> <br /> There would be no reason to worry at all if the zombie boys sent someone in this movie. Every single character is both stupid and annoying, without any quality of redemption. Not to mention one-dimensional and clich√©. <br /> <br /> This film would have been * greatly improved * if the mother and her stupid children had been sent in the first 10 minutes by the zombie children as they were climbing to their new home, then the credits rolled. That right would instantly change the score from 1/10 to 10/10. Honestly! When the mute mother looks away from the street and almost crashes into a pedestrian on the street, her daughter scolds her: "You almost killed us, Mom!" Of course, anyone with common sense knows that if mom hit the pawn, it would be the pawn to be dead --- not the people safely locked * in * the car. I imagine that this phrase has been included in the film to show in first person that the absolute stupidity of the main characters knows no limits and runs in the family. <br /> <br /> Wicked Little Things / Zombies runs for 1 hour and 34 minutes, but it certainly felt like 5 hours or more for me. Trying not to fall asleep was a tremendous challenge. Not more than an hour has passed in the hour and 34 minutes in which the zombie children have taken the trouble to kill any person. Then the scene shows the stupid teenagers who drink beer and peek into a car and say phrases like: "If you want to get back in my pants again, you better start the car and get your ass back from here in this moment". Seriously, it's literally from the movie. Teenagers are so banal, one-dimensional, rude, stupid and annoying that when the zombie kids finally manage to hack 3 out of 1 hour and 5 minutes into the movie, it seems like a reason to celebrate. Obviously the "princess" stupid drunk beer smoker who smokes a hangover, daughter of her mother's main character, leaves without Scott. What a buzzkill! He was on the screen longer than the others and therefore the most annoying of the 4, and the most deserving of a pickaxe in the head. One more reason why it should have been sent within the first 10 minutes, as mentioned above. However, maintaining it for another 1 hour and 5 minutes is absolutely unforgivable. <br /> <br /> The reason for this is of course that feature films must be filled for at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. So, keeping his past far away when it should be, they have 27 more minutes to fill the film with her and her mother running through the woods. Within 1 hour and 22 minutes, it is the * second * time in the movie where the annoying daughter is trapped in a vehicle where the engine does not start while the zombie children are coming for her. <br /> <br /> Zombie children are completely generic. Never say anything. No character development for any of them. <br /> <br /> In the end, all three of the most boring and idiotic characters live. Which, in my opinion, is the way in which the filmmakers give a final reversal of the bird's gesture to the viewing public. In my opinion, the directors certainly know that they have cheated anyone who has had the great misfortune of watching the entire movie. Why not rub their face without even giving them the satisfaction of seeing one of the 3 main characters that should have been sent within the first 10 minutes, die. <br /> <br /> Avoid Small Things / Zombies like bubonic plague.
