This may contain *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Where to start in this particular empty desert? Well, it would have been nice if they actually had a storyline. Recitative talent, decent dialogue, suspense, humor, hey, even free sex would have helped this film. Unfortunately there was only a lot of cold blood, (even that was not well done), fired automatic weapons and was missing. <br /> <br /> There seemed to be no reason to attack the basic premise, a cursed Native American protecting the bodies of the tribe he killed, with his being tracked down by a team of federal special forces who dressed in civilian clothes (?). Most of the time it involved the violation of one of the basic rules of conduct in a horror film, separating from the group so that it could be chosen one by one. You would think that this team would do better, especially since they are actually the third team sent to investigate, the other two teams are disappearing without a trace. When they finally realize they are picked up, they make one of the many stands and shoot their weapons just to hit the trees a lot. The tree shooting scene is repeated endlessly in this film to save money. <br /> <br /> When they are not shooting trees, they are following this spirit that leaves no trace, (who knows how they are tracing it), and spitting a lot of macho BS. By the way, did I mention that most of this team are women? Interesting to listen to them talk hard. Not very funny, but interesting. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can find better films in the business basket at Kmart.
