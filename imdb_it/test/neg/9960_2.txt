OK, this film seems to have been well covered by the previous comments, but there are a couple of elements I want to add. The mad scientist produces a serum from the blood of a caged animal to turn a man into a werewolf. If we suspend our disbelief enough to buy us, that's fine. But the animal in the cage is a coyote. That would make a werote. In 1942, did the public not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote? They are easy to distinguish. This is weak. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this film was featured in the third episode of MST3k (on Comedy Channel). Joel and the robots took a number of episodes to get the most out of the steam, and they weren't there yet. They added enough to this snoozer to keep you awake until the end, but it wasn't one of their best episodes. They never even mentioned the dazzling omission of a real wolf, and THAT joke was simply suspended in the air waiting to be slapped.
