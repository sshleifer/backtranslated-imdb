The film is apparently based on a popular French horror novel, by Arthur Bernède, from 1927. Not that I had ever heard of it before, but Belphégor was a popular subject first for films and miniseries. The first film was released way back in 1927, at the same time as the novel. Arthur Bernède was part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously. The character Belphégor is one of his most famous creations. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time Sophie Marceau was a promising European actress who would conquer Hollywood. But now she's back in movies like this again. Nothing wrong with playing in French quality films, since it is the country from which it comes, but this film is just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The problem is above all that the film relies on its special effects, to make the film good and scary. Well, horror and special effects have never been a good combination, with some exceptions here and there. It is not as if the special effects were bad in this. Especially for a European film it is simply good, but it is simply out of place, since the film gave the feeling that it could have easily done without its effect. He would have actually made the film better and scarier to watch, no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> The film is never tense or engaging to watch, also because the film seems to have difficulty choosing the right approach. Sometimes the film takes a light and less serious approach, while in others it clearly tries to be a good scary horror movie. This is mainly why the film doesn't work at any level. You can say that the film is also a bit boring. All this certainly worsens even towards the end. After a while, stop worrying about this movie and its story and start wishing you had decided to look at something else instead. <br /> <br /> The assembly looks totally out. He uses cuts that are too fast, without much style, while quick assembly was obviously intended to give the film a good, modern style. Even the timeline is simply dirty at times, as if some sequences had been changed in the wrong order. <br /> <br /> Even the musical score is really annoying and sometimes it doesn't even seem suitable for the film, as if everything was long marked before the film finished shooting. I can't believe that composer Bruno Coulais is an Oscar nominated composer. The soundtrack is almost as annoying as the film, its sound effects. <br /> <br /> The film is full of many characters, but you don't really care. It also seems very unlikely that a woman like Sophie Marceau could ever fall in love with a man like Frédéric Diefenthal. The film also includes Julie Christie, who is pretty but doesn't add much to the film. <br /> <br /> A horrible watch. <br /> <br /> 3/10
