The ill-conceived sequel (.. the absurd idea of ​​having the killer snowman on the fury of a resort on the island where there is no snow or cold) brings back the spirit of the psychopath, returning thanks to a scientific experiment that provides elements strangers who reintroduce life to its molecules (.. is the best I could do to explain this absurd concept). <br /> <br /> I could investigate how to do it on the island to kill many tourists, but I simply have no reason to worry because it would be so exhausting. However, filmmakers think it wise to kill pretty girls not ten minutes after they arrive (I mean seriously, because worrying about introducing them to us if we can't enjoy our eye candy is no longer this ?!) . <br /> <br /> The scene of the "snow anvil" murder takes the cake. Ice icicles protrude from the sand of the beach so that a victim can fall on them. Oh, and another girl is stabbed with a pair of weenie pliers. <br /> <br /> Look, I get what's happening to me when I sit down to watch a killer snowman movie ... so a ridiculous supernatural asshole will tickle your funnybone ("Oh, it's a horror movie wonderfully croaking! ") or you have thought about why the hell you're wasting your time with this nonsense. Jack Frost has the power to freeze water (.. so how were they able to melt it in the first movie?) And it makes the resort's island snow. A sequence has Jack freezing the pool water, setting a swimming pattern under the sheet, resulting in her drowning without a place to escape. Oh, there is also a recreation of the "tongue attached to the frozen pole" by The Christmas Story ("Cowatonga dude!"). I have to deliver it to the cast, though ... they're real soldiers for trying to make this wretched material fun. Christopher Allport (perhaps unwisely) returns as Sam, to confront his old nemesis, as does Eileen Seeley, as his wife. The attempts of ironic humor (at least for me) have fallen flat, but the launched soldiers try to make the most of a very difficult situation, with humorous performances they do their best to overcome the pitiful premise and a painful dialogue. <br /> <br /> There is a development that increases the danger against those who still face Jack, his genetically altered water molecules, thanks to the foreign elements introduced, allow him to resist the refrigerant / anti - freeze, and worse still, can now reproduce ... through indigestion, Jack sets what appear to be snowballs that open revealing small snowballs with black eyes, mouth and sharp teeth! The snowman's murderous costume and small snowball puppets introduced later in the movie could produce belly laughs if you're in the mood for such cheats, but personally I found this junk pretty rubbish (.. that's the purpose behind it, I imagine, cheap laughter from those willing to embrace it) and unbearable. The offspring of the snowball is an obvious tribute to Gremlins where we get a bar scene where the little bastards are celebrating in numbers to terrorize the victims of the resort. The weapon against them..bananas! It was explained that when Jack went to kill Sam in the first movie, both fell into a truck full of antifreeze (.. an icicle emerging from Jack's belly was penetrating into Sam's chest when he pushed them out the window, and I imagine that in their being "bound" by the icicle, Jack has inherited Sam's banana allergy, or so it is what we are led to believe!) and in doing so "merged" in a sense. <br /> <br /> Phew, a film like this challenges a simple explanation. It's a film with such terrible effects and plot, you could find the presentation funny due to many failures.
