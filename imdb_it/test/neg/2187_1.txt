is the best film that takes first place in the most sick and useful films ever made in this poor country. you people really don't even know what the word cinema means and you vote for a film, I'm really curious to know how many P.P.P. or L. Bunuel you have seen. The score of this "faield experiment" reflects a lot of your way of understanding things and recognizing a good quality film when you see it. We Romanians have only ONE film and until now the state has not changed and that film is "Padurea Spanzuratilor". But I don't waste time thinking about how many of you have seen it. This is a film that respects all the required qualities of a film. From the script to the frames and even to the quality / clarity of the image, he also spent 41 years. I recommend voters to search for better films and then vote. KuDos will see us later.
