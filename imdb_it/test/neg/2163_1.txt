The Cyber ​​Zone, since this DVD was sold to Oz, is the worst category B junk I've ever seen. Regardless of an impassive and restrictive act by Singer, indicating that he knew how bad the film would be, the other actors were swaying on genuine attempts to deliver the lines (Swanson and Quarry) or absurd imitations of classic movie scenes. Mathius Hues makes the craziest portrait of dying after the Jim Carrey mask. All this without a common thread to suggest an attempt at falsification by gender, period or any common vein is simply annoying. Don't even try to merge the dots with the plot. It's Blade Runner, subtly disguised without content, actors or sets due to a very limited budget. "Get what you pay for" is never more evident. There is repeatedly annoying re-use of limited series, without any attention to the set dressing and a series of special effects that would have hit the cutting room floor for Dr Who in 1976. The explosion of the helicopter deserves a rewind to prove my point . Obviously there are masochists who will make this trip collapse, but if you are watching this movie for a bet, make sure you get more than your pay rate. At $ 2 this DVD will be an interesting and interesting beer coaster.
