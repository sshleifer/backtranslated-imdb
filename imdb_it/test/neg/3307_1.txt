OK, so it has no caller ID. When you're persecuted, GET! And no cell phone? When you are pursued, GET ONE if you are one of the few full-time parents who is the head of the family who does not already have one. This mother gets a big ZERO in the parent department. So her mother is in the hospital and she decides that a shopping trip will help her. Just a stupid movie. I'm glad to have Tivo and an FF button on the remote control. And what is with the minimum of 10 lines, I don't have much to say about such a bad movie. I imagine I could ask why he continues to open packages he has no idea who they are. Not even the son really added much to the film. The cops were also a big zero. Now go to the nearest Verizon and take the damn cell phone. @@
