The new celebrity deathmatch is terrible. They kill popular people and win low budget celebrities. I mean ... Andy Milonakis? Lil 'flip? Lil flip and Lil Wayne should both be dead. The flip sucks. the fight between Lil 'Jon and Lil' bow wow and Lil flip was dull and short MAD. They should just kill all of them. Why does Tobey lose to Jake and Christian loses to Adam? they are better actors and superheroes. They also spend too much time talking rather than fighting that can annoy viewers. Everything seems rushed for some reason, can't they just make a long struggle? the old deathmatch is much better.
