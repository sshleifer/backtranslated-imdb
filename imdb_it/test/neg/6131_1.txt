Jesus Christ, what the hell happened here? This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, how can they have ruined such a great idea for a movie. To tell you the truth I was so excited about this, I thought it was like Blair Witch but with real alien creatures chasing the camera guy. Damn, I've been reduced to quickly forwarding this stack of sh * t, and I never do it while watching movies. The high score here on IMDb makes me believe that real aliens are giving 10 for this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> The invasion is good, an invasion. The film begins by saying that all you are about to see is real, blahblahblah. Then they talk to me about a special camera system used in a car, as if I needed to believe their bullsh * t to enjoy this movie. The next thing you know is that I'm seeing the most boring car I've ever shot in a night forest. Is it a movie or a ride in a Disney theme park? The first 20 minutes are all boring dialogues between policemen watching the grass and a straight road with a torch. Where the hell were the aliens ?! They were sleeping, of course! Then we learn that acting not only comes down to school performances, since the policeman behind the camera gets out of his car to look for a missing man who was "fishing at night" and stumbled upon a mysterious meteorite. I wonder what happens to him? From nothing, we see the night fishing boy walking like a zombie. Apparently the policeman is too stupid to notice that there is something wrong with this man. Apparently he was really stupid, since the zombie / alien boy injects a sort of alien parasite into the policeman's ear, thus turning him into an alien. Then the cop / alien returns to his car, looks for a young couple who is having sex a while back in the forest, comes to them, turns the boy into an alien, and then the girl runs to the police car and flees. If this quick story introduction didn't bring you to mind that this movie was bad, then it will be the following 40 minutes. Watching this movie is as painful as stabbing yourself repeatedly with a plastic fork. The script, although it may seem interesting on the back of the DVD box, is badly directed and unfortunately there remains another tedious right to DVD atrocities. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me awake was the constant flashing and noisy (deplorable) sound effects. If seeing the same path in the woods for 63 minutes is not enough, we have to put up with poor flash techniques to "scare" the viewer and the constant lament of a bad actress who becomes old and annoying fast enough. <br /> <br /> If you feel that you have to rent this, I tell you, why? There are better SciFi / Horror movies out there. Even the dreaded Invasion of the Body Snatchers remake is more fun than this. For the love of all good things, don't worry about its crap. My eyes were bleeding and for the first time I wanted suicide. At 1/10, avoid this as a disease.
