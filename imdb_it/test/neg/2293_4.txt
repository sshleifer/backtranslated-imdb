A Swedish splatter film? Has the world gone mad? <br /> <br /> Probably not, but it is not yet a common sight in these days with Swedish fashion films, the b-movie business in Sweden seems to have problems these days, the days of gold of "Rymdinvasion i lappland". And this movie seems to have some problems on its own: it's just too much to talk about, but it still manages to be a little fun especially for the good FX, which is great for a b-movie. The script and most of the acting are still pretty ugly, but it really doesn't matter that much, it's supposed to be a gore movie and nothing more, that's where it hurts a little for some reason. There is simply not enough blood to fill the void. <br /> <br /> Every person who knows Gert Fylking will have a good laugh about his role as an sgt. though. I almost laughed my ass. It's really so hilarious. <br /> <br /> In addition to the good parts I've listed, there's nothing else to recommend here if you're not hungry for Swedish B movies. <br /> <br /> 4/10
