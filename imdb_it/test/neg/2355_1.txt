Rarely will anyone deny that Hitchcock remains one of the most creative, creative and prolific directors of all time, because it is arguably all of these things. It takes real genius to scare generations of spectators from taking showers and wearing ties. Saboteur, however, is not at all creative or prolific. Rather, Hitchcock set out with the intent of the soul to create a film to collect "American Pride", a certain call-to-arms title, support-our-troops that was a popular theme of the time. With this in mind, Hitchcock has severely underestimated other important aspects of the film, including, by way of example, a logical plot, a characterization, a credible dialogue and a flowing and flowing plot. <br /> <br /> Typically Hitchcock goes very well with espionage films, a few years before reaching cinematic greatness with The Foreign Corespondant and The 39 Steps, but apparently has lost pace in the creation of Saboteur and has simply recycled the same history once electrifying lines is its previous excursions readily provided. Without going into a great depth, here is a list of some of the main problems of this film: <br /> <br /> 1. Despite having his face glued on all the newspapers of all America, the only person who recognizes Kane is blind. <br /> <br /> 2. During dinner, Kane and Patricia do not want to run to the door because the bad guys could grab them and tell the party they were "door blockers". Logically, what prevents spies from grabbing them and telling them at any time during the evening? Also, does anyone need to remember that Kane is a wanted terrorist? <br /> <br /> 3. When can a fan band cut the handcuffs? <br /> <br /> 4. No one recognizes him ... his face is on EVERY NEWSPAPER !!! <br /> <br /> 5. Spies meet with Kane in the ghost town and assume he is the man Freeman sent to work with them ... shouldn't he have some kind of credential? I know spies don't run with photo tags and IDs but maybe a secret handshake? <br /> <br /> 6. The policeman picks up Kane who runs away from Freeman's house, it still seems nobody recognizes him. <br /> <br /> 7. How exactly does the FBI believe Kane without proof? They don't even show Kane talking to the FBI, the scene simply fades and we are forced to assume that everything is now kosher. <br /> <br /> 8. When the cops look for the Carnival Caravan how do they know that Kane is now with a woman? The blind believed that Kane's story so logically would not tell that his daughter had disappeared, kidnapped or, more importantly, that he was running with Kane. Why doesn't this film use logic? <br /> <br /> This is a current list. The film is not exciting, the plot makes no sense, and the world is full of people who happily take terrorists into their homes and cars every day because it's not a big thing. Hitchcock fails miserably on this.
