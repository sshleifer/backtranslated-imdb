Detective Sergent Vince De Carlo (James Luisi) and the company are on the case of a brutal serial killer / rapist. Can psychologist Carol (Susan Sullivan) help, or will she become the murderer's next victim? And what is the killer's hilarious White Dude Afro? <br /> <br /> Inspired by the case of the serial killer Ted Bundy, "Killer's Delight" aka "The Dark Ride" is a rather boring Serial Killer story from 1978 that doesn't offer much. If nothing else, it is more of a police procedural film than a horror film, as much of the violence occurs outside the cameras. Of course, we take mutilated bodies, but we don't take a lot of things in the exploitation department, especially considering that they are afterwards, and not during the crime. Those who are hoping for "The Toolbox Murders" or "Maniac" will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there is an impressive scene that involves a woman trying to escape the killer who gets the right tone, and is quite suspenseful. Furthermore, John Karlen is quite as effective as the killer, although his hilarious hairstyle (white boys with Afros always deserve a laugh) is more than a little distraction. <br /> <br /> "The Dark Ride" is too routine and mediocre to really justify a recommendation, as it lacks adequate elements of exploitation, and is also dated by the standards of the time. Those looking for a better example should probably turn to "Do not Go In The House" and to some others instead, as this is not enough.
