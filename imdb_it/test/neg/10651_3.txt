Don't worry about serious logical gaps, don't worry about portraits of melancholy characters, don't worry about casual writing, and you might like this movie. The main character of Alyssa had to be captivating, the heroine for whom one wants to be saved, (or in this case, to save herself) But instead she merely scratches herself, and is amazed, are they all really dumb professional dancers? His busy mother was obviously only needed to further propagate the illusion that the ballet companies were evil monsters ready to snatch your poor, innocent girl from your grip, with an ever present and biting artistic / bad director. And the clich√©s! Not only does he become anorexic, bulimic, drugged out of the ordinary and pathological liar, but within a few months. It is as if the writer read every horror story he could have invented about the ballet and decided to see how much he could fill in two hours (with commercials). Believe it or not, but I'm a dancer. This "revolt" or "rebirth" of anorexia and bulemia that is happening is non-existent in all the dance schools I attended. In fact, teachers are so frightened to even suggest that a girl could have a better chance of a few pounds lighter, most dancers in my classes would actually be considered overweight. I'm not saying that eating disorders never occur, but not to the extent that it has been portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> Another annoying problem that this film had was the style of writing "from end to end". Probably the boyfriend again had half an hour of screen time, all in the first half. The other supporting characters were just props, decorations to promote the story. Given the right dialogue, this would have been a very intricate mental study of a psychological problem. As it stands, it turns into a show for one woman, and Kimberly McCullough doesn't have the nerve to make it. <br /> <br /> For a non-dancer, this film would be an alleged "intuition" about what really goes behind closed doors in a ballet company. For a dancer, this is a very offensive film, which portrays dancers as stupid and infirm and informed parents. Those adjectives describe more correctly the people who have had this news in the foreground. 3/10
