I came across this movie by accident and I wish I didn't have it. <br /> <br /> Why make a sexually rude sequel (and some blood when a man is beheaded) of a well-known children's movie. <br /> <br /> Do not take small children to see that the title takes you wrong, has nothing to do with the original Snow White except to steal his characters. Better yet, don't worry about going to you, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> I could not look at everything, the poor graphics (compared to Disney) of cartoons, and no plot except on how to completely confuse a classic film made me want to give up and leave.
