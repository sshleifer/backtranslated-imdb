"Many of the films I made could probably have worked as well 50 years ago, and it's only because I have many old fashioned values." - Steven Spielberg <br /> <br /> Some points .. <br /> <br /> 1. Although this film is a remake of "A Guy Named Joe", he also borrows "A Matter of Life and Death "and" Wings of Desire ". <br /> <br /> 2. This was Spielberg's second attempt to be Frank Capra. <br /> <br /> 3. Spielberg has often claimed to want to make a "Frank Capra film" along the lines of "It's A Wonderful Life" and "Mrs Smith Goes To Washington". Judging by his recent attempts to get the "Harvey" remake off the ground, it seems that Spielberg still holds this dream, the director is not satisfied with his last three Capracorn adventures. <br /> <br /> 4. Critics at the time have beaten "Always", stating that the elaborate action sequences distracted from the film's love story, but this is not the problem at all. The problem is that "Always" needs many more special effects to distract us from the fact that Spielberg cannot film any line of dialogue that does not end in an exclamation point. <br /> <br /> 5. The film is full of comedy that just doesn't work. Spielberg's comic tastes are not very sophisticated and seem to have been ripped from the 1950s comics and Looney Tune cartoons. These exaggerated antics could work in a universe of cartoons, but in a movie it looks like a strange marriage. <br /> <br /> 6. The main couple of the film is presented as brother and sister, not lovers. Spielberg's films are always apprehensive about sex and intimacy, but this film does everything: it's a tomboy and an old spiritist. They are more irritating than engaging. <br /> <br /> 7. The film contains a good scene, in which John Goodman discusses with Holly Hunter, but for the most part the characters in the film are too annoying. There is no subtlety, every exaggerated emotion, every designed joke, every sequence full of useless activities. <br /> <br /> 8. "Always" and "Hook" taught Spielberg how to keep the public. After their failure (and the twin financial failures of "The Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun") Spielberg downloaded the funny color film of "Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun" in favor of the most desaturated "black" and "white worlds" of "Schindler's List", "Munich", "Minority Report" and "Saving Private Ryan". From here on, "less light" and "obscure cinematography" have been equated with "serious arguments". br /> <br /> 9. After the financial success of each "dark film" Spielberg returns to his color cinematography, and falls back on his face. "Amistad" followed "Schindler's List", "AI" followed by "Ryan" and "Lincoln" will follow "Monaco" These "color" films have always been crushed to be too sticky, sentimental, banal and picky, but the truth is that if you take away the desaturation, all these "serious" films will they would feel the same way. <br /> <br /> 10. Since the 1970s, Spielberg has tried to differentiate himself from other directors of brat packs (Scorsese, De Palma, Coppola, etc.), pretending to be an "optimist" and a "humanist". He would repeat it himself during many interviews in the late 1970s. The reality, however, is that it is probably the greatest sadist of all these directors, the very form of his films often weakens their content, their own box office performances always proportionate to their dazzling display of carnage. <br /> <br /> 11. Spielberg's inability to connect with one of the "Always" characters, and the taste that shows, instead, in filming forest fires, crashing planes, etc., Incapsula perfectly the rest of his filmography. The people who run from dinosaurs, sharks, Nazis, tripods, rocks etc ... this is what Spielberg likes. When his characters stop to talk, however, everything destroys itself. A film like "Amistad" failed, in other words, because not enough blacks died and too many whites spoke. <br /> <br /> 12. The film's flying scenes are not up to the standard set several years earlier in the mega hit "Top Gun". Obviously, when your "enemy" is a forest fire, it is difficult to make things cinematic. <br /> <br /> 13. Failures such as "1941", "Hook", "Always" etc. are often more illuminating than Spielberg's most successful films. They reveal the steel skeleton under the technique. They show what the amusement park looks like when it doesn't work, revealing the void under the broken car. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? There is a good sequence here (two actors in a room, simply improvising), but this is above all an annoying image with a predictable script. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
