This was a modest attempt in a film, even though it looked more like an extended television pilot. <br /> <br /> Some may find it unfair, but it seems that someone saw "The Brothers" and "Save the Last Dance" and thought "Hey, I could do it too". Well, not really. <br /> <br /> While I personally found the film predictable, a little misinterpreted and invented (watch out for the cookies), Carl Payne shows that he can complete a leading role, and should return to television. Even the main character (I don't remember her name, sorry) was plausible, but she keeps thinking about Julia Stiles (it was her at "Save the Last Dance", right?) Because this was really stuck in "white girl" mode.
