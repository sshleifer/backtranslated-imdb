Preposterosi twilight performed in a bewildering and inept way - or perhaps different from the incredible lack of continuity, tone, realism, plausibility, suspense, and much more are combined with Walter Pidgeon's fascination attempts to produce a cinematic curiosity to be classified with other wonderful failures of Fritz Lang. (I thought the German ambassador was actually played by Lang but apparently not - they could have been twins.) If you can't predict the ending from multiple time zones, you're not really alive. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to this DVD and I was totally surprised and disappointed by such a crap (even with George Sanders and John Carradine - maybe I can calm my mind by looking at Viaggio in Italia instead and for the umpteenth time) . <br /> <br /> Does anyone want a DVD once used? (There may be a film about making this atrocious film and how many talented people could be wasted so completely.)
