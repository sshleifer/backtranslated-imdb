Snakes on a Train is a film I rented for pure enjoyment of the thoughts I had about the film. Snakes on a Plane was a pleasant action movie, so obviously the directors wanted to cash in on the success, with this low-cost effort. At 85 minutes, Snakes on a Train is almost unbearable to testify. I had to keep taking a break in the movie to do something to entertain myself, due to the lack of events in the film. For the duration of the film, it is never completely explained why this girl has this curse, or why she continues to cough constantly with this viscous green / purple. Not only that, there is an endless boring dialogue between the two main characters, Brujo and Alma, who discuss how to get rid of the curse. I can appreciate the low budget movie. I'm not really picky in movies, I'm open to any genre or budget, but Snakes On A Train is really one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. Were the writers on Acid or something at the end of this film? Why did the woman suddenly turn into a giant snake? and, above all, why was he able to devour the train? <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Snakes on a Train is a film that must be avoided at all costs. Not being as intrigued as I was by the title, this is a film that is seriously bad. We put these snakes to rest <br /> <br /> 0/10
