I feel alarmed that people are not as critical of a job that deserves criticism. The many similarities, both structurally and literally, with "Amadeus" aside from "Copying Beethoven" deliberately chooses the easy path by putting the audience before art. And thus denying the world a discerning, intelligent and creative work. <br /> <br /> Let us now consider the following: is it not possible that the true story of the creation of the ninth symphony can actually be an engaging and powerful story and in the same way in a dramatic story? Was Beethoven completely deaf from writing the symphony? isn't it more interesting? How was the symphony conducted? Wouldn't it be nice to know? So ask yourself, what possible motivation could a director have for introducing a woman as a copyist? If there were a copyist, he would certainly be a man. What was his story? (try to be a little critical here, even if you like the invention of a woman composer). <br /> <br /> Fantasy should be much more than a distortion of reality at the service of a writer. For those who find themselves confronting and justifying Anna Holtz's invention with the invention of Salieri's claim to have killed Mozart in "Amadeus", consider confessing to a priest in an asylum (Schaffer uses this device with great affection in the movie ). 'Copy Beethoven' may have worked if Anna had been a fable of Ludwig's feverish imagination. But we are destined to believe that she is "possible" ... Yes and that Strauss was assisted by the aliens. <br /> <br /> Most of the positive reviews I've read here so far are often expressions of DESIRE for the film is good; almost a deliberate amnesia. Remembering the film for what you want it to be rather than for what it is. <br /> <br /> For those who believe that fantasy justifies the means then consider that you are not only accepting a lower interpretation of real events but also sacrificing the truth for the sake of a banality. <br /> <br /> Finally, a brief note on acting here that might surprise some of you. Ed Harris is NOT as good as Ludwig Van Beethoven. Do you fool yourself? It seems embarrassing throughout the film, much like an actor dressed, but offstage and standing at the catering table. Most of his jokes are said as hints rather than as answers to Anna Holtz's lines (ie he doesn't listen to the actor). Clearly he is an actor disguised as a character rather than BEING the character. <br /> <br /> Really, how many times does Beethoven have to roll into his grave before doing it right? Just ask yourself, would Ludwig approve?
