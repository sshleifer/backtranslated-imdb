This owes much to the plot of the CAPIINS COURAGEOUS. Although he is quite grown up, it is partly the story of a wealthy boy who is shanghaied as a crew member aboard a cargo ship and becomes a man in the process. Moran of the title is a young girl who grew up on a ship owned by his father. When the load burns, you and the crew members are evacuated from our boy's ship. However, the captain has smuggled into his mind and his intentions are not honorable towards Moran. It follows the inevitable - our boy falls for the mannish Moran and she for him. Eventually the evil is submissive and the lovers are united. Some interesting dialogues emphasize that Moran does not belong to any man - "and no woman". (A nod to Sappho here). Dorothy Dalton is appropriately asexual as Moran and not too attractive. Valentino does well in a romantic and action role. His sexy build and physique are put on display and the role is rather masculine. He is very attractive. This is not a great movie but time passes. What really shows is the beauty and sensuality of Valentino.
