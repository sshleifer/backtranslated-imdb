Are you looking for something shocking? Okay ... the image is that. That's all. This film tries to create deep connections with the public through various symbolisms and ends up being annoying. I'm not entirely sure if the director's purpose was to really represent a kind of profound message for his audience, or if he had only tried to hit him with blood, sex and violence. I think it was probably the first ... but in a failed attempt. It simply ended up being a piece of artistic garbage with a lot of blood, some unpleasant characters and an excessive dependence on religious symbolism. If you are looking for an independent film to criticize for your attempt to use the metaphor ... you have to do. If you are looking for a film of blood that will make you feel uncomfortable and uncomfortable ... here you are ... If you are looking for a film that irritates you not to end because you realize that in the end the message was stupid ... the film is been stupid ... and you will never get those minutes of your life ... this is definitely the movie for you!
