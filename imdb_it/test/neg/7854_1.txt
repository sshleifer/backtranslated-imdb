I am a fan of good historical fiction and was thrilled that someone would take a well-written and filmed series of books. Writing scripts is not like writing regular novels, but when you have a book you are adapting, it would be nice to actually follow the plot. <br /> <br /> The portraits of the Vespasians (the royal emperor, and his 2 sons Tito and Domitian) were horrible. They behaved like a sharp Caligula cookie, and were the "bad guys" in this adaptation. There was a scene with Titus that dispensed justice as if it were Caligula (from the movie of the same name). The way the Vespasians are portrayed in the books mostly follow the accounts of the historians who write at that time - they were just and healthy, untainted by the imperial Claudian madness. <br /> <br /> Helena (the love interest of Marcus Didius Falco) gives Pertinax (one of the traitors referred to in the title) the reason for the divorce was that he was a traitor, but in the books it was because he ignored her and felt that it would be better to marry someone who valued her as a person. <br /> <br /> Marcus in the film receives a slave named Justus, yet in the books he could barely afford his apartment, let alone afford a slave. There was certainly no romantic interlude between the nonexistent slave Justus and a female gladiator ... On the whole, if you want a good cookie cutter, Roman stereotypes take Caligula, if you want a good Roman of classic story point of view, take me , Claudio.
