I was expecting much more than what I received watching this movie. It's not that I oppose the literary license, (if that's the way it should be called) especially when there is no clear attempt to say "based on a true story". But this film is about Beethoven - a real historical person who is so widely known and deeply rooted in our musical experiences and I expected the film to be true to history at least in the primary elements. This film has taken such a big exception from the historical record that it could only disappoint. <br /> <br /> My assumption (because I hadn't studied the film at all) was that it was true. Halfway, I stopped the movie to search for it on IMDb. The rest of the film was a remarkably different experience. I was relieved that it was not accurate with the story because it was so hard to believe an important part of the story. To enjoy this film, I was asked to recognize it as a fantasy, a story of "And if so." The film lacked this honest disclaimer. <br /> <br /> What disappointed me most was the fictional conduction of the ninth symphony. The concept itself portrayed in the film has stretched my imagination to disbelief. I ended up doubting that anything was true for the story besides Ludwig van Beethoven and his relationship with Karl van Beethoven. I really liked Ed Harris's performance - an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and keep out of it and that was all and that's why I give him a 3/10. <br /> <br /> Those who claim that this film is as good as or better than Amadeus have no idea of ​​either of the composers' lives and are only looking for what this film really is, because in the end it was a novel economic of a story - pulp fiction.
