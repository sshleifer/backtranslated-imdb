This cheap and scruffy film is about a NASA test rocket being sent into space with a load of animals. He fades for a while, then returns unexpectedly, crashing into a forest, unleashing an evil mutant creature. <br /> <br /> Like many films of this type, Night Fright stages stupid teenagers who enjoy surfing music from the 1960s before being killed. None of the murders, however, is even remotely memorable, since we see nothing. One thing we see, however, is that one of the teenagers appears to be around 40 and wears a rather stupid haircut. <br /> <br /> For a creature to function, it must actually present the monster to the viewer correctly. In this film, however, we only get the brief glances of the monster. Seems to look like the Robot Monster alien. But I'm not sure; since the photograph was so dark, I simply couldn't understand what the hell was going on in many cases. Although, my instinctive feeling was that I probably didn't miss much.
