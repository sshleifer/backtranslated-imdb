I had a different experience with this film - it was never charming, or delicious, or fun for me. a big clue that this was not your typical movie was that the label gave no indication of the Ianguages ​​(i) spoken in the film. another was the lack of subtitle choices. <br /> <br /> I found the lack of dialogues annoying, especially if accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions as it almost always was. The wildly inconsistent development of the weak plot was disconcerting. Were there characters or only vague gestures? was there also a plot? <br /> <br /> on a separate issue, I am asked to correct the spelling of the "dialogue" with the suggested replacement of "dialogue". perhaps this film in its entirety, including the IMDb part, is designed to enigmish, or amaze, but I become more irritated than amused.
