Any person, claiming that this film is a classic ninja movie, must have seen this movie before the mid-nineties or less than 10 years before seeing it. Otherwise I can't explain this title of "classic ninja movie". <br /> <br /> The fight scenes in this film are simply intolerable. Instead of engaging Franco Nero as a ninja, they could instead hire some experienced martial artist. In any case the acting skill is not important in that type of film. Nero's fighting ability is barely that of a street fighter in a bar. His kicks and punches are lame. <br /> <br /> There is enough of old action movies with a good action. This is just a waste of time.
