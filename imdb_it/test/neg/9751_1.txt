I seriously don't understand why people are all like "Oh my God Step Up is the best movie ever !!!" It's a bunch of garbage! The acting, first of all, is ridiculous, and we don't even start talking about the dialogue because it was terrible ... Movies should be fun, and this, let me be the first to say, was * not * entertainment. Actually I was laughing because I was so embarrassed to look at him. Even music and dancing didn't do anything for me. And what is the "spiciness" of Channing Tatum that all the girls talk about? Everything. The film was pathetic. Don't waste time or money. Unless you're a dancing movie freak, but movies like that are * not * movies ... they're jokes.
