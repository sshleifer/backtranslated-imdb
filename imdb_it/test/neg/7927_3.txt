Where do I start? The plot of the film, which speaks of a love between two high school students during the war, while one is a living weapon, and their struggle to maintain that love is a very good plot. It is based on a Shin Takahashi manga that was also turned into an anime in 2002, both of which I haven't read or seen yet. <br /> <br /> This review however covers this live adaptation. Unfortunately, this honest kindness was a terrible film. It is not as if it were possible to identify certain aspects and say, for example, that the budget is at fault, or that the acting is to blame. It is, unfortunately, a series of disappointing and ineffective elements that make this film fall. <br /> <br /> The acting is poor. Not to mention that Aki Maeda and Shunsuke Kubozuka are bad actors, but they didn't have much to do with their work, and they seemed uncomfortable. Neither of them seemed to have the physical reach to draw the viewer into the story, as well as being too distracting to his parts. <br /> <br /> The script was weak, the protagonists acted unrealistically and behaved irrationally. The film also plays for the strings of the heart, but ends up being predictable, all the time not being compelling, and underdevelopment of the characters. There are also pacing problems. <br /> <br /> Visually, it is irrelevant. The film uses the green screen heavily and unnecessarily in too many scenes. The other special effects also have an economic aspect, especially when minimalist practical special effects could be used. There is not even a visual touch, as if there were no filmmaker or art designer to make the scenes coherent and stimulating. <br /> <br /> The music and sound effects were good, but insignificant. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is not without fun, and fans of the series should not be discouraged to see it at least once just for completion. People are not familiar with Saikano, this is probably not the place to jump because it is not a very good movie or melodrama. It is not the fault of the film or the cast and crew, it is not inspired, and this is what kills him.
