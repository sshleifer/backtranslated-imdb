The somewhat bellicose brother of a suicide finds that he and his mother grieve in much the same way (by reciting) but that father is a boyfriend and blames himself. Screenwriter and director Dan Harris gives us a broken dysfunctional family, characters with question marks hanging over them, and then puts the whole plot in the most obvious points: suicide! Secrets! Gay shame! Family sickness! With the ultimate goal of wrapping things up with a neat bow, Harris wants to be sure not to miss a trick, initially giving us thoughtful material to think about, but then spelling it all in an elementary and sentimental way. Sigourney Weaver's hilarious performance while the family matriarch is disenchanted and she is a joy - until Harris makes her a make-over (complete with a new sensible hairstyle). It is the cinematic equivalent of a patronizing pat on the head. ** from ****
