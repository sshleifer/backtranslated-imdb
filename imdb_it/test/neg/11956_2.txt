This is an excellent example of a terribly attractive b-movie. There are films worse than this (Titanic for example), but this certainly shares the heap of steaming shitty movies. <br /> <br /> OK, this was apparently filmed in Kansas City, which explains why everyone is so lame. The main guy looks like Steve Guttenberg, and he's even more lame than he is! I didn't even think it was possible! In fact, he and the main girl in the film are responsible for the WORST DRAMMA EVER! It's not just that the acting was too dramatic waaaaaaaaaay, well, actually it was, of course, that the script was terrible and that it combines for a deadly header in a terrible drama that is absolutely unwatchable. <br /> <br /> The scarecrow, let's talk about him. The whistle you hear every time he is around is stupid, and obviously nicknamed. Now his costume, I can't pass it - he's a guy wearing jute bags and a stupid mask! I'm just stunned, maybe if your 3 years with brain damage would have been afraid of him. <br /> <br /> One of the characters, the real black guy, used the phrase: "This could have the chance to earn my red wings" when referring to the attempt to score with one of the girls during his time . Wow, this is the kind of dialogue you can look forward to. <br /> <br /> Oh, at the beginning, when the skimpy girl is going through the wheat, why take off? I'm pretty sure it shouldn't be obvious, just one of the many obvious mistakes made in this "movie". Another is the bad dubbing for the musical number (yes, that's right), everyone is on the beach and the other gets up the courage to sing a song and play the guitar for everyone, and his so nicknamed so is fun. Fortunately, the scarecrow answers all our prayers and throws a spear through the boy's chest when he's finished singing. Overall the gore is pretty good, this is one of those movies when you're rooting for these people to be killed by the killer. <br /> <br /> OK, there's a scene where the 2 guys bury one of their friends in the sand, then get up, pull out their penises and urinate all over the guy in the sand. Who do it? Really, imagine "hey, let Joe be buried in the sand, then get up and take out our genitals like it's a big deal and piss on him" In fact, this makes homoeroticism appear in this movie, what the hell? A good part of the beginning of this film are the athletes who are lying around in their underwear in the locker room and in the cornfield while doing hazing. What the hell is there? Traditionally, in cinema and in real life, athletes do not have girls and nerds. This really doesn't make sense, since all nerds think of girls and sex, and apparently all athletes think that both sport and being around each other in their underwear, I don't understand. <br /> <br /> get to the sex. As someone who saw this movie with me, he said: "I've never been so disgusted with heterosexual sex in my life" and it's true. If you like the heat A cup, or ugly old lady, then this movie is for you. I swear, they found a girl with smaller breasts than ever and that's what they manage to do the naked scene ?? Then the ugly old nurse shows her bouncing a couple of times, and man, I didn't want to see him. <br /> <br /> Now, I have to talk about the temporal continuity of this film, this is really bizarre. It starts in the day, then everyone heads towards the cornfield, and in about 2 minutes its darkness at the time of night, when they come down from there saying they go to the beach - it's day again and apparently they stay at the beach until night, and until the day the next day. THEREFORE, in practice, these events in the film cover 4 days, without any of the characters needing to sleep or something, it's really strange. <br /> <br /> After the main killings have taken place, it flashes forward to "3 weeks later" and apparently none of these people really cares about having their friends brutally killed! The surviving people do literally a bit of champagne! And this when I realized that the budget wasn't going to the script, the director or the acting, everything went to that bizarre bottle of champagne. <br /> <br /> The finale. Stop reading now if you don't want the ending to be ruined for you, it's really fun. <br /> <br /> OK, so the end takes place in a church, and the scarecrow puts his soul into the body of the diabetic child, so he fights with the steve guttenberg type of man, and fights him with b-movie version of the power that the emperor had in star wars! I'm not kidding, it's so stupid! So, somehow, in the middle of the fight, the soul of the scarecrow jumps the bodies in the guttenberg jr. boy, and then with the last amount of will that he has of his own, impales himself on a cross in the church! It's wonderful! A little blood, but what's even better is that the cross is obviously made of cardboard! You can see the lower movement from the ground! Wow, they enjoy watching.
