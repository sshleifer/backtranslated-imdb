I posed this vehicle from Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy, and Murphy in particular the first time, but after seeing it again recently, I can see that it has some very fun parts. <br /> <br /> This is in no way to say that this is the greatest comedy of all time, but in reality what can be done for the already exhausted subgenre? What the director, Tom Dey, has tried to do is make it a satire of the clichés of friendly comedy and the media. At the beginning of the film, the executive of a cable network asks: "How is it different from the Cops?", When Chase Renzi launches the idea of ​​a reality show that deals with the character of De Niro, Mitch Preston (between the other a boringly boring name). That was when I saw him in a new light that I had not noticed before. <br /> <br /> The idea is to show all the elements of the comedy of friends and highlight them. De Niro's reluctance to act on the show and to collaborate with Murphy is right outside of any detective movie you can think of. You can say that De Niro is actually playing himself by asking, "Why should I make another movie playing a cop?" Chase Renzi is portrayed as a fake from Hollywood, but if you look at his opening scene again, she simply does it to save her work. She somehow sees the ridiculousness of what she is doing, but she wants to succeed despite that. One line says it all: "Who doesn't want to be on TV?" Perhaps this is reading too much in what is essentially a light film, simply set up to entertain, but gives it a little spin that I hadn't noticed before. <br /> <br /> As for Murphy. You must applaud him for watching this ridicule. Trey wants to be such a bad star that she's willing to sell everything she comes in contact with. Murphy was a big star and maybe it hit the brain that it's all so fleeting. <br /> <br /> The plot with the gun is obviously quite boring. The action sequences are nothing special, except the end that required a lot of effort from both the cast and the crew. One thing I noticed about the villain is that he is dressed as a pop star from the 80s. George Michael comes to mind and this adds to the whole media rotation. <br /> <br /> So, I trashed it the first time, but what the hell! if you want to do it, why not point out how ridiculous it is and De Niro and Murphy had a great chance to do it.
