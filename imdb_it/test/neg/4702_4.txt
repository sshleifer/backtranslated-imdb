Five years after the US civil war, Western people are more concerned about the centuries-old war between cattle owners and breeders. Cattle gather their goods, from Texas to the city of Abilene, Kansas. There, the cowboys find not only a lot of money, but also a great confrontation, with homeowners. High in the saddle Marshal Randolph Scott (like Dan Mitchell) tries to keep the peace in the city. Mr. Scott has experience in mediation between the hands of the trails and the customers of the salon. He also juggles with the most beautiful women in the city: the sexy saloon singer Ann Dvorak (in the role of Rita) and the beautiful lady of the church Rhonda Fleming (in the role of Sherry). County sheriff Boozy Edgar Buchanan (in the role of Trimble Bravo) offers more comic relief than shooting assistance. <br /> <br /> "Abilene Town" begins with some promising symbolisms and contrasts: the shots interrupt Scott and Mrs Fleming who sings a hymn in church; then, the camera switches to Ms. Dvorak who sexually sings her saloon number, which causes a man to shoot his gun. After that, it really becomes a western standard; it is somehow more boring than it should be, but not quite terrible. The young Lloyd Bridges appears as one of the owners. Dvorak's legendary costume is the biggest advantage of the film; in it, it's a real move. <br /> <br /> **** Abilene Town (1/11/46) Edwin L. Marin ~ Randolph Scott, Ann Dvorak, Edgar Buchanan
