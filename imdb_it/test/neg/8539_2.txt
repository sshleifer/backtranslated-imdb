I just saw this movie on the opening night. I read some other comments from users that convinced me to go and see it ... I have to say that it didn't hit me. I'm so indifferent that I feel the need to write this comment to save some of you some money. <br /> <br /> First of all "The Messengers" is very predictable, and not much of a thriller. It could be scary for someone under the age of 13, but it really didn't do anything for me. The climax was ridiculous and most of the audience had moved away before the film was solved. <br /> <br /> Furthermore the acting seemed a bit superficial. Some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the sub-par suspense scenes. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the previews for this movie, then you've seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot. This film is not worth seeing in theaters.
