And believe me, it's a rather surprising result. Take "Jolly Roger: Massacre at Cutter's Cove", change the killer from a pirate to a prospector, change his obsession with the treasure buried to the old gold, and his color from green vomit to deep blue. Now you have "Miner's Massacre". The problem is that at least "Jolly Roger" was fun enough, even if in such a bad way, to keep him watching for the whole two hours. There is no scene of murder in stripes or bizarre murders. I can't tell you how many times I've lost interest in "Miner's Massacre" and started making dishes or cleaning the apartment. And the ending is absolutely silly. The 49er guy randomly appears from nothing to kill the local sheriff, while the main actor and the actress are sitting in the sheriff's cruiser, screaming. A really horrible film.
