Directed by Jim Wynorski (Chopping Mall, Return of the Swamp Thing), Cheerleader Massacre is the fourth installment in the Slumber Party Massacre series. Think about it: it's the fourth chapter of a slasher series that nobody really cares about! So how could it even be beautiful? Well, it's not! But since slasher movies have to be good? The Cheerleader massacre is fun, that's for sure. But in the entertainment field, we've seen more, that's for sure too! As you can see, I'm not sure where I refer to this movie. Those who look at the coupons only for nudity will be more than satisfied. This movie has all the boobs, but unfortunately no blood, or not enough. I think I am generous with this film because I enjoyed watching it and I really enjoy watching slasher movies, even if they are as bad as sometimes. If you want me to be sincere, The Slumber Party Massacre Part 1 is the best and everyone else is a waste of time, so I think I have a lot of time to waste !! For more fun, look at Sleepaway Camp 2 and Cheerleader Camp.
