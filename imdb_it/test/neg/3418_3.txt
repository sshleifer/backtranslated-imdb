Geoffrey Wright, the director of "Romper Stomper", transplants Shakespeare's "Macbeth" into the contemporary criminal world of Melbourne, Australia. The result is an almost tremendous piece of cinema. Sam Worthington is Macbeth, and he goes around looking very aware and bored. Victoria Hill, who wrote the screenplay with Wright, is Lady Macbeth, and is neither terrible nor good. Lachy Hulme, who plays McDuff, is the only actor in the cast who emanates any kind of authority. The rest, including Gary Sweet, is wasted and diverted. Shot in HD by the late Will Gibson, the film's images lack character. Everything is too clean and deliberately lit. Wright's direction is not inspired by the extreme and the action sequences are confused and inept. Wrongly marketed as "the most violent Australian film ever", the film is violent at times and quite bloody, but fails to provide a single moment of impact. Slow and tremendously pretentious movement, this umpteenth filmed silver version of the classic game is the personification of the wrong.
