Jack Lemmon was one of our great actors. His performances in Days Of Wine and Roses, The Apartment, Some Like It Hot, Missing (to mention the first ones that come to mind) were all worthy of the Best Actor nominations. His only victory was for Save The Tiger, which is a pity. It reduces melancholy to a science, but it never puts it in balance with the driver in his character. In fact he made a similar character much better towards the end of his career in the only known Glengarry Glen Ross. <br /> <br /> As for the film, Jack Gilford's wonderful supportive work as Lemmon's partner and Thayer David as an arsonist, doesn't go at all because the rest of the script is a confusing mixture of clich√© cartoons , anguish, neurotic nostalgia and useless moralism. To be seen once as a time capsule in Avildsen's experimental 1970s-style direction.
