I imagine this is a movie for teenagers with "alternate reality" ... More precisely a Ferris Bueller type character as the leader of a cheat ring. Yes, I know it is not intended to appear on Ferris Bueller, at least not in an "orange-or-orange" way, but no less. <br /> <br /> Bottom-line: Galaxies are far from being even a minor classic. It's watchable, but only if you don't expect much. Having said that, the main character has a certain charm, but the premise is worn out because the writing is not intelligent. The film didn't produce enough laughs, twists or tensions to maintain my interest. <br /> <br /> To be honest I kept looking ... Looking with hope to see if something suddenly clicked. It was not so. So, elegant as it is, I would not recommend this film. By the way, it seems strange to see Mary Tyler Moore as principal. She is really misplaced, I hope the salary is extraordinarily large.
