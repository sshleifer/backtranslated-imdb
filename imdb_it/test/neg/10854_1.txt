Well, I was in a British university, in fact I went to the one in this movie, and it wasn't anything like that. This is a horrible film, badly made and played. The worst thing is that it could have been really good, if they had bothered to spend more than that 12p, in fact, if he really wanted to represent the real British students, he would have to act like one and take a loan of 15,000 pounds. He says nothing about the life of Uni, where was the bush diving, the tea he drank until 4 am, the endless chats about group dynamics ??? Where was diversity and fun? Maybe I'm just romantic, but I don't remember that Fresher Week was terrible, and I'm abstemious. And in the end the question still remains ... a bed or a wardrobe?
