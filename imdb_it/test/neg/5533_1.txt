The portrait of Wakayama Tomisaburo of the fugitive ex Kaishakunin Ogami Itto felt completely natural. His behavior, his voice, his appearance - everything spoke of displacement. When he entered a space, I, like the characters on the screen, could feel that he did not belong to him and that his determination to be there hurt. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that Mr. Wakayama actually took Kendo Training (Japanese sword) and this would explain his comfort with the katana, which he showed beautifully in every cutfest. If you watch movies, from the moment you draw to the moment you hide your sword, you feel like you're witnessing something inevitably ugly. He had even made the katana rotate quickly to remove the blood before wrapping it and it would have happened in an instant without effort. <br /> <br /> The surrender of Nakamura Kinnosuke is presented as a representation. It seems like he's trying too hard to be someone else or tell someone else's story. As a result, every time I tried to commit myself, I would lose my grip because he didn't seem to have a firm grip on the role himself. As if it was embarrassing for him. <br /> <br /> The art of the sword in the TV series was also old-school Hollyweird. The camera cuts to mask the embarrassment of Mr. Nakamura with the katana, the slow action, the stationary targets, etc. Extremely bad, from an observer's point of view. There was a moment in the episode The Castle Wall Attack when Mr. Nakamura drew his sword like a child. It was embarrassing. He handled it like it was heavy! I almost fell off my chair. <br /> <br /> And let's be honest: the story is about an excellent swordsman. Period. The art of the sword is a problem. <br /> <br /> Realism is not, however: the sword game in the movies was excellent and similar to the manga, as expected, I'm sure. (The cart for children was equipped with a group of rapid-fire automatic muskets operated by a 3-year-old child? Yes ... manga style.) It's how the plot perfectly intertwines historical cultural accuracy in, basically, the fantasy superhero that makes captivating movies. (Read Musashi by Yoshikawa Eiji [% historical legend]%!) I couldn't really go through the episodes of the TV series. They simply felt cheap. Watch the movies first and you'll know what I'm talking about.
