"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"! If IMDb would allow reviews of only one word, that's what mine would be. This film was originally intended only for children and it would seem very difficult for adults or older children to watch the film. The song, the plot, everything is opaque and faded, just like this print in the public domain. Like other comedy films, films with roots in traditional children's stories (such as the horrible SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE STOOGES and BABES IN TOYLAND survivors), this film has limited appeal and doesn't age well. Now that I think about it, I seriously doubt that many kids today find this movie funny! So my advice is NOT to watch this movie. If you have to watch a movie by Abbott and Costello, almost every other one of their films (except A & C GO TO MARS) would be an improvement.
