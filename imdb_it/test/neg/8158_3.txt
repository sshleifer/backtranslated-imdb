I expected to see a more exploited movie style, but unfortunately this turned out to be an inexpensive, badly done action film that doesn't have the talent to do it. Story is about a very beautiful woman named Teri Marshall (Heather Thomas) whose boyfriend Rick (Jeffrey Combs) works for a secret agency and invented a bike that is bulletproof and can fire lasers and missiles and has a helmet which can shoot lasers too. The head of the Bosarian agency (Martin Landau) signed a $ 5 million contract to sell it and sends two hired thugs to kill Rick and Teri and collect the bicycle. A tall blond thug named Rolf (Dar Robinson) and his partner Hanna (Dawn Wildsmith) manage to kill Rick but Teri survives. While at home, he discovers a videotape that Rick left describing his invention that helps Teri what to do next. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Teri is chased by several agents and is captured and tortured, but does not talk about where a piece of the motorcycle, but receives help from a federal agent named Waters (Martine Beswick) where he ends up using the motorcycle for a bloody fight. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Fred Olen Ray who made his career from exploitative films to very low budgets, but made a tremendous mistake by excluding the aspect of exploitation and trying to make a film of action. Apart from a fast shower scene at the beginning there is no nudity and the usual titillation that viewers are used to seeing in a Ray movie is not where it can be found. I don't think anyone expected Thomas to get naked, but he doesn't wear a sexy dress. Not that it kept me from looking at her in those tight jeans and admiring her in almost perfect shape, but Ray really blew up in this case. Like all his films, the cast is fun to watch and many familiar faces have roles like Robert Quarry, Huntz Hall, Troy Donahue, Tim Conway Jr., Michael Reagan and Russ Tamblyn. The stuntman Dar Robinson died shortly after he did it and it's his last act of acting and the film is dedicated to him. You have to ask yourself why Landau wasted time with such stuff, but I was interested in casting Combs in a very rare romantic role. Isn't Thomas good for this movie? Who cares! I think he proved to have become a famous movie star "B" if he wanted to, but it never happened. Ray wastes everyone's time with this effort even if the cast is fun to watch but has omitted the elements that make him a funny director.
