Snakes on a Train (2006, Dir. The Mallachi Brothers) A zombie curse is placed on a woman, who makes them have living snakes in them. Brujo, who takes care of her, tries to take her to Los Angeles on the train. After several clashes on the train, Brujo's snake collection manages to separate from their owner and hunt. While all this happens, normal everyday passengers relax, what is unknown to them is that something deadly is making its way and that theirs is no was out. <br /> <br /> After seeing the wonderfully funny snakes on a plane, I had to check this out. I knew it would be a rip-off and that the film seemed inexpensive, but what I found was the worst to watch. The whole plot of the curse was silly and should never have been included. The special effects are not terrible but they are not the best. I had no idea of ​​the ending. He was foolish to look at and pathetic. The acting was absolutely terrible and looked bad. They could not act to save their lives. If you want a good laugh, look at this, otherwise you should really avoid it. <br /> <br /> "We have a running train, I repeat, we have a running train". - Director (Stephen A.F. Day)
