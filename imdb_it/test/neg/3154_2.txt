OK, when I was little (and I mean 2 or 3, not 6 and 7), Barney was one of my favorite shows. Then I grew up and threw away all my old Barney tapes. So one day while I'm flipping through the channels, I see that Barney now plays in a tramp, and I thought, "Um, is this the right show?" Once I realized it was, I went crazy. Why did they change the show setting from a school to a CABOOSE? Since then, the show was absolutely terrible, and the only reason I'm giving him a 2 is a) because I'm cute, b) because of Riff, and c) because in the old days the show was tolerable. I hate it now. HATE. <br /> <br /> 2/10
