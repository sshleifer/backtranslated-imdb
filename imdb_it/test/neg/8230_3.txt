This is a strange film. In appearance it is no different from many other G-level G-films but in at least some aspects it stands out. First, the main character of the killer is really weird. How the hell a guy who's ever just clucked like a chicken has been paroled it's totally beyond me. What was that member of the female word council who thought, "is totally reformed and rehabilitated". He cluck! Another problem with Luther the Geek is the script / direction for women. The daughter is so pathetic and apparently stupid that if she were mine I would slap her. In an attempt to free her mother from the bed, she struggles with knots and seems not to think, "I take scissors or a knife." Later, in a similar attempt to disband her mother, she wanders down the stairs and starts looking in a box of scrap material for some scissors, eventually getting a knife. By the way, this is after the killer obviously got out of the car and just got back. Bizarre. On the plus side, the daughter did her kit for the shower scene, so it was nice, though again unusual. It seems that in many of these normal-level gospel films they happily show the throat that is bitten with gushing blood, but the sight of a female breast is somehow too strong for the public. In general, it worked, but it was annoying and bad, even though the naked breast made up for a bit of that.
