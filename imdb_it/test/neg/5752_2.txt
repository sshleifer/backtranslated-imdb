For many months I was looking forward to this release. The previews looked good, the first reports on the network were encouraging, and the gold eye and Timesplitters were excellent shooters (by the same people). It turns out that I was very misled! Haze had the potential to be up there with Call of Duty 4 and other next-generation shooters, however it looks, sounds and looks like something 5 years ago. I played Haze on a 1080 TV and was initially disappointed that the game's developers had limited the graphics to 720. The Haze universe lacks details and atmosphere, the feeling of "must really hurry to finish" is always there. > <br /> The controls are slow and bulky and I have yet to find an adjustment for the sensitivity of the x / y axis. There are many parts of the single player game that are very obscure (visually), to the point where you can't really see where you're going. Why not add a flashlight function like in Halo? or even better, night vision? The use of the drug "performance nectar" is interesting, but just as you get used to it, you change sides and don't use it anymore! Why worry? I could go on with many other Haze flaws, but instead I will simply say Do not BOTHER! wait for killzone 2 or play call of duty 4 and try to unlock the golden AK!
