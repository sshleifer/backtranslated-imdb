I really enjoyed the first film and when it appeared again, without thinking or checking, I brought a family of friends to see it. I was ashamed to have impressed so much. <br /> <br /> Disney developed the original film just as the human body processes a delicious meal - it takes something good and turns out ... well, you know. And having a dark-skinned person like the FBI man, the informant's fingerprint results were subdued. <br /> <br /> Considered an isolated film, I suppose it's not so bad if someone likes that strange kind of thing, but when one has read the book or seen the first movie - horrible!
