This was a film that would have been great if there hadn't been so many useless historical inaccuracies and if the actors had been chosen or made to look a little more like real people (not very difficult). Sissi didn't go to Mayerling to see her dead son, she didn't die on the street too; they took her on the boat and then back to the hotel, which was much more dramatic. I am not sure of the wedding night, but I find it exaggerated that a lady-in-waiting would strip the empress and leave her completely naked (and that in 1850) or that the emperor would proudly announce "yes, I finally laid her" to court reunited. As far as I know, this was immediately done the first night and no one rewarded her as if she were a prostitute. The saving grace of the film is really Stephane Audran, excellent actress and loyal to the character.
