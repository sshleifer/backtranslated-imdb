The fundamental issues at stake (God & Satan / Good & Evil) can be and should be tremendously convincing (as demonstrated by thousands of works of art / music / literature / film). Unfortunately, the end of days is nothing more than a 2D comic. Byrne's acting ability so clearly stands in stark contrast to Arnold's corresponding lack of ability and is further emphasized by a plot full of nothing but stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Does the single compelling scene occur at the beginning with the transformation of Gabriel Byrne's Character and his subsequent interaction with his wife? girlfriend? It is both erotically charged and repellent - modernizing vampiric themes, the seductive power of evil.
