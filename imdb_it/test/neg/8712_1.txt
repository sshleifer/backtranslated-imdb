I almost fell asleep during a screening of this. Of a boring story that seems to go on forever, it follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks. After a hot deal, the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they can't be together and how they have to go in separate ways. <br /> <br /> The male prostitute then proceeds towards a downward self-destructive spiral trying to find his "only true love", which returns repeatedly to the same places they frequented, looking for other clues or signs on where can find his love. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, he connects with a nasty guy (who I thought was also a male prostitute), a gay basher and a guy who ends up having a "three-second sex session" with him in an alley. <br /> <br /> It never ceases to amaze me How STILL movies portray random sexual acts as scenes that can take place in a short matter of seconds, like in this case where the make-up barely has trousers undone before to push three times and miraculously experiencing orgasm! <br /> <br /> All these random encounters end with the sexual partner asking him to call them, to which they discard their phone numbers. <br /> <br /> There is a brief plot involving the main character who visits his busy mother who seems to have no time for her lifestyle. There is also another short story that involves some casual conversations with a young woman who noticed him several times standing on the bridge from her window. And there is also another short plot that involves him showing the letter to a male acquaintance, but the public is not informed of his relationship with this person. <br /> <br /> None of these things really connect to each other, just to show us how lost and confused this young man is. It seems to live life like a ghost. There was a good scene throughout the film that involved him poking around in a garden sale looking for a particular record with the saddest song in the world. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this film seems to go on forever. Shot in black and white, it may seem very dreamlike, but sitting in the theater for almost two hours watching this movie will look like something more like a nightmare! <br /> <br /> I found the finish confusing because I wasn't. Am I pretty sure the young man was dead and gone to heaven? It would have been a nice gain to end the misery that both the public and the main character had to endure in this meaningless tripe. But since this is an "independent film", films with endings like these should encourage you to "use your imagination". <br /> <br /> For those of you looking for nudity, there are only short scenes and most of them are filmed in such a way that anything suggestive is cleverly hidden in the shadows. In other words, don't waste your time with this. <br /> <br /> My vote - 2 out of 10
