I understood it because, having spent time in the Albany region of New York, I knew a couple of people in the film and it happened to me by accident. Comedy attempts are limping, the obligatory girl-girl scene is disgusting, the plot is non-existent, acting is among the worst I've ever seen and it doesn't even start me with special effects. I realize this is a very low budget movie made by a small independent company, but if you're planning on making a science fiction horror movie with giant bugs, don't make the giant bugs completely incredible. People want to see giant bugs. It's half the fun right there. And if you're going to make giant insects incredible, at least make sure that the actors make a sort of ironic allusion to this fact ("You're an idiot! These aren't them! You've captured their double feat!"). Get ready to waste two hours of your life that you will never be able to recover.
