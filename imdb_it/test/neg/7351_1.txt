I agree with the user "SpecialAgentFoxMulder" that this episode is terribly worse than the whole show. Now I'm not fond of many episodes of the next series, but this takes the biscuit! It was little fun and not offensive. As for the ending, I'm sorry but it disgusted me more than any other combined episode. <br /> <br /> I mean, the guys think they meant well but the ending was so shocking that they think the whale belongs on the moon and the credits, we see that he's dead. The incident could have saved if the pranksters were able to confess what they did. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no outgoing message. Ok, South Park could be guilty of preaching too much and it's always nice to see it unclear (like Make Love Not Warcraft ") but this episode was simply wrong! Avoid at all costs! Helen xxxxx
