Piece of garbage, I would have given him a 0 if I could. The entertainment is good, but not good enough. The plot is absolutely the most ridiculous I've ever seen, and this is saying a lot! This "movie" has tried so hard to be interesting, but it has failed miserably. It is almost as if the writer had started a story, then he had another idea and tried to combine the two together. Don't waste time with this; believe me, you'll be as infected with yourself as I was. The only actor of any note in this was James Woods, and his part was peripheral at best. I'm all for doing things that are sharp, pushing envelopes, but that just didn't cut it.
