1 hour and 40 minutes of conversation - boring talk, and more talk and then some. It's hard for me to understand how an actress like Anne Parillaud, who shone superbly in Femme Fatale, would sign up for such a piece of shit! Unbelievable. If you need a small glass, this movie could help you, even if I would prefer good classical music. unfortunately, I just found out that I have to write 10 lines to make my comment appear - it's almost unbelievable! therefore, brief and succinct comments of one or two sentences expressing their basic film on a film are not enough. Damn, people. I made my point and don't waste time with more useless words, like this movie does. Wolfgang
