This film is sometimes called "The Story of O-Pt.2", which tries to go through a sequel (of sorts) to the French thriller S & M The Story Of O. Although I've never seen the original version, the I did, but I got to see this sad mixture of sexual and social politics. I imagine that the "O" corner derives from the occasional S & M shades (which were never so explicit (and unpleasant to look at) as those of "Mistress". Klaus Kinski is the only recognizable face in this Franco-Japanese production ( but he speaks his lines in English - at least in the version I've seen.) The unnecessary use of surrealism only succeeds in making this a bit boring example of even more pretentious pseudo porn (what they are trying to demonstrate with a piano that floats in the water?) It is obvious that after all the "porn chic" cinema trend has been exhausted (to say the truth, an unpleasant pun!) In 1975, the producers had to scratch the bottom of the barrel trying to please adult film experts, not to mention the Foreign / Art Cinema, so movie goers have had to deal with Dreck as "The Last Woman", and others like this.
