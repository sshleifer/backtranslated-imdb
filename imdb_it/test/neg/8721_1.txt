The Dune miniseries opens with a "flashforward" montage of action sequences. The realization soon realized that these are the * best * scenes out of the 265 minutes of execution, and are not good. Not good at all. Oh dear. <br /> <br /> But let's not judge a book by its cover (even if that's exactly what we are invited to do). Let's give Dune a chance to redeem herself. <br /> <br /> Well, here is the eagerly awaited Caladan water opening. But who is this petulant, strangely ugly man? Paul Atreides? * Is this * Paul Atreides? This generic plastic puppet? And why does it look so old? What is that? Is the actor only 25 years old? Well, don't * look * at it, and it's too old anyway. <br /> <br /> But at least it has charisma, right? Mistaken. Alec Newman is a mumbling jester. I'm imagining that he was discovered sitting in the dark in a corrective acting class because nobody liked him enough to tell him that the lesson was over, and he's too stupid to realize it. When your Paul Atreides has all the screen of soaked toast, and a recitation that goes from "petulant" to "white", your Dune production is doomed from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The other actors have pity on the poor. However, Alec, and offers uniformly insipid and incomprehensible performances, so as not to seem too bad by comparison. At least, I * guess * this is what they are doing. Because I am charitable, see. <br /> <br /> To be honest, they are not given any direction clearly. Casual gestures, empty or inconsistent deliveries, their brands are missing, that's all. This is like a master's degree in how not to do it. <br /> <br /> And of course, there are more elements of the book in this miniseries than there are in the 1984 film, but there are not twice as many, due to the whole. Pause. To fill. Time. <br /> <br /> But we can forgive all this because of the small budget of $ 20 million, or just $ 5 million per hour. No one could expect to do quality science fiction with that kind of budget. <br /> <br /> Except perhaps "Stargate SG-1" which does with $ 1.4 million per 50-minute episode, or "Farscape" for $ 2 million. And frankly, I'd rather watch four episodes of one of those while I was stabbed in the kidneys, rather than having to sit down again with the disguise that is the Dune miniseries again.
