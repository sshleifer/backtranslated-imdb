I only saw it because I saw a couple of good reviews for it, so I was expecting at least a bad movie halfway. Toybox doesn't even deliver it. There are so many problems with this movie, I don't even know where to start, so I will list a couple of major problems (again, spoiler warning. Just read them, it will save you the trouble of looking at this later). <br /> <br /> One, this film begins with, and often mentions, the mythical folklore of both Celeste Noir (A Witch, which the main character claims to be the reincarnation of), and the half-folker (or something like that, an evil man with a big smile who cuts open people with hooks and sells their innards in cakes). I liked it, it was a nice concept, anything to do with cakes is just nice. But then you watch the movie and everything revolves around this idiot girl and her boyfriend (And what was the deal with him? Was he psychic? Did he have powers? Why he kept seeing visions that even the so-called "Witch" didn't? ), and they meet their crazy family. Not really crazy, they fight a lot. This is what most of this film is, arguing, and they can barely touch the supposed myth again, except in a couple of confusing scenes that can't be done with head down or tail. <br /> <br /> In one scene, Berenice (the main character linked to witches) moves away and does a kind of candlelit ritual. It seemed pretty important, but absolutely NOTHING happened after he did it, he simply wasted more of my time. <br /> <br /> And who the hell was that guy with his dog? Do you see him walking towards the house from the beginning of the film with that evil red-eyed dog, and eventually he gets there and is killed? What the hell?? Was he a nosy person? Was his dog possessed? Has anyone killed the dog? They never really showed it. Moreover, any scene involving the Vicar was completely useless and served only to weakly explain the lame ending. It was like they had all these interesting ideas for the characters and they didn't go anywhere! The boy, who obviously had some kind of power but never explains them. Grandma, who also seemed to have some kind of witch power, but never used them. The Vicar, who ... OK, it doesn't matter, there was really no reason for his existence. And then there was Berenice and her stupid amulet. Could he really do magic or did he simply use it to reflect light and blind people? This was a total waste of time, and the only reason I gave her two stars is because a) Berenice is pretty nice, and b) She mentioned the cakes. Save yourself the money to rent this and dear god don't even think about buying it, unless the waste of money is not a new fad.
