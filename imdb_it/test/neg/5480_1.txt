This game was terrible. I think they worked too hard on the graphics and didn't do much with the gameplay, which is the most important part. I mean, the images are incredible, but is the game really "fun"? NO! I mean it's like "hey let's skip buildings" and all I'm doing is holding and A / X. The game isn't really there, and I don't agree with what Ubisoft did, because they had this sexy girl (the producer of the game, Jade Raymond), and they were like "OK, we have this sexy girl, we do the parrot" and if you go to game sites, you won't see Assassin's Creed gameplay stuff, you'll see her face with a microphone it will be like "We interviewed Jade Raymond about her favorite cookies!" He's like the man, close the F * @ K UP WHO CARES ?! Apparently ... a lot of people do it, because they bought the game and like it ... I mean compare this game with Super Mario Galaxy. A Wii game that does not abuse the Wii remote, but STILL is very innovative and offers the most important part, GAMEPLAY! They were able to do a bit of everything with Mario Galaxy, the graphics were still stunning, the music in the game was orchestrated and sounded incredible, and THIS is a game that deserves the game of the year. It's NOT Assassin's Creed, man, it doesn't even deserve to be a NOMINEE for Game of the Year. The clamor around this game where it was like "oh is the next generation of games" .... really? I do not think so! So let me know right away, because I think people who love this game will only appreciate it because they are Jade fans, so I'll tell you guys, JADE WILL NOT BE PUT WITH YOU OR NOTHING IF YOU LOVE OR DEFEND GAME! If you want a REAL game on PS3, get Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, if you want a REAL game for Xbox 360, download Call of Duty 4 (and a ton of other games) and if you want a REAL game only in all systems? GET SUPER MARIO GALAXY! I know this comment will be hated by many, but seriously, by pressing two buttons to do all these interesting things, is it REALLY fun? The only reason other games make it more complicated is because later it will end up being more innovative and fun. And this game is not. <br /> <br /> 1.3 / 10 To HIV!
