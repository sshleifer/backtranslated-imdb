This is one of those street movies that would tell you a lot about women, the universe, the best life, the terrible loneliness of the brilliant Manhattan architect who marks all the ties with everyone, including his three-year-old child which may seem irresponsible for someone - In reality the hero wins hands down when it comes to selfishness and the scene with his old schoolmate, which begins as a kind of conversation of the old days and ends with a threatening note is the oasis in a desert film. <br /> <br /> The scene with-the-father-who-left-at-home-when-I-was-a child was said and said and said. Of course it did not prevent the offspring from making their way When you see the attitude of the hero's wife, you may think you never heard of the freedom of women. <br /> <br /> The best is the soundtrack that includes superb songs by Willie Nelson, Tom Waits or Bonnie Raitt ... But you can enjoy them without this boring pretentious work.
