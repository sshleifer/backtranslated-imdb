Tony Curtis and Skip Homier both wear black canvas shoes in the scenes just before and after the pond and the tank is blown up. He must have been too hard on the feet of young stars. If the real Marines had been on a mission, they would have worn boots. In the first scenes they removed the leggings just before starting their little journey to find the farmer. When they went to the area where they dug fox holes, Tony and Skip wore combat boots, then later, when Lovejoy and Curtis came across the Framer and his daughter Tony wore "tennis shoes" but they were blackened. The film is about a true story, but do they really need love interest?
