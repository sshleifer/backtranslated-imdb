I loved the first "American Graffiti" with all the heart and soul that I considered the best rock and roll film along with the best teen movie I've ever seen. The first film generated the careers of George Lucas who would later do the epic "Star Wars" before making the prequels two decades later, making Richard Dreyfuss a star in Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and other films. /> <br /> Somehow without those two, the magic died down. <br /> <br /> "More American Graffiti" shows the public what happened to the rest of the characters in the 1960s, where Steve (Ron Howard) and Laurie (Cindy Williams) are protesting against the Vietnam War while the their friend Terry "The Toad" Fields (Charles Martin Smith) is at war and tries to get out. John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is still the rousing racer of California, where he never left home. The rest of the secondary actors in the Debbie movie (Terry's Girlfriend) by Candy Clark, to the members of the Pharaoh's band, along with Harrison Ford and others, actually don't do much. The original film showed teens roaming the streets without bloodshed with Buddy Holly's first rock n 'roll music, The Fleetwoods, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Bill Haley and the Comets, Buddy Knox and others reporting the bug of nostalgia in classical music. The soundtrack to "More American Graffiti" is a mix of rock, soul, country, hippie, and anything that suited the mood during the late 1960s of protests, drugs, sacrifices and more. <br /> <br /> After watching "More American Graffiti" he seemed to want to show the members of the public what happened after the epilogue of the title of the four main characters of the first film (with the exception of the character of Dreyfuss) where it was not necessary. Not even this film was necessary because I was glad to see that neither Lucas nor Dreyfuss switched to bigger and better projects.
