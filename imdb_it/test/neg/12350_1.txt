Not a balanced point of view. The director should not express his opinion as truth. The film has some criticisms of Fujimori but always gives him and his family the last words. So few critics of Fujimori have been given that it seems that the only reason they have been included is to be able to say that the film provides both points of view. But this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The film barely shows one of the massacres that Fujimori is accused of. And he gives him credit for the creation of the murder of the MRTA insurgents who took the Japanese embassy. It is well documented that the CIA did the planning. On the website published by Caretas magazine and in other newspapers there are even photos of a well-known CIA strategist. <br /> <br /> The fact that such well-known information was not used by the director gives us some possible conclusions: the director is pro-Fujimori and intentionally and falsely chooses to give him the credit; the director does not want viewers to notice that the CIA and Fujimori have worked together; or it was only out of ignorance since the director was not Peruvian and was not present in Peru at the time the events occurred. <br /> <br /> The explanation provided by other commentators, that Fujimori is still quite popular in Peru, does not excuse the lack of accuracy and balanced explanations. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the statistics provided in the film for Fujimori's actual support were the highest I've ever heard. Most statistics from the major survey agencies are much lower. <br /> <br /> Another point to mention is that the intelligence that was fundamental to the capture of the Sendero leader and discover the secret network was made by a police force led by Ketin Vidal and he had complete autonomy by Fujimori and Montesinos. <br /> <br /> Fujimori's first government experienced an improvement in general economic trends (GDP), but this improvement was funded by the privatization of several national industries with contracts that were not beneficial to the country in the long term. Furthermore, the gap between rich and poor continued to widen during the Fujimori regime. In its second term, the economy was suffering and there was nothing else to privatize and at the end of Fujimori's second term the economy was about to collapse. <br /> <br /> In terms of investment in Fujimori's regime infrastructure, the paternalistic model is uncultivated. They were created to increase support for Fujimori but were not meant to last long. These facilities needed continuous maintenance, but Fujimori did not provide political power to civilians to request additional investments. In fact, the Fujimori regime was able to destroy most forms of political organization such as unions and grassroots groups and the increase in informal unorganized work was immense. <br /> <br /> Finally, the director chose to spend most of the film he was talking to Fujimori instead of citing cases of massive corruption in favor of Fujimori (the Media, business owners, military, etc. .) that they were so widespread that it was impossible for Fujimori not to know about them.
