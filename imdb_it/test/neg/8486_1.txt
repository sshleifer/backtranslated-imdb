This film is a real pity, not only for the plot, the empty performance of the characters, it's for the director's and the crew's lack of creativity, this is perhaps one of the worst films of all time, and it's hard to believe which is the sequel to one of the most famous films of the 90s. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of The Mask, when I went to see this film I was expecting a film with a good sense of humor, a film with an acceptable plot, but I saw a bad copy of the films by Chuck Jones and Tex Avery, the film wasn't even fun for my 7-year-old sister, so I wonder: what was wrong with New Line Cinema ??? He was trying to repeat the success of the first film, or was he trying to create another masterpiece like The Lord of the Rings ??? Because if they did, they were completely crazy.
