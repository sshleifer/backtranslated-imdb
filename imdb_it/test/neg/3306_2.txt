Attention: this could contain SPOILERS !! <br /> <br /> First of all I watch a lot of Lifetime movies and I realize that they are just that .... Lifetime movies. Some are fantastic (really), some are good and some are bad. Unfortunately this film falls into the latter category. Actually it started with some potential ... single, divorced, hard working mom (who leaves work at 2:00 am) kills a guy on his way home from work and says he doesn't take it too well. Stalking starts immediately with the phone call and intensifies until his home is broken and completely destroyed. So he goes to his mother for the night and the next morning his mother's car breaks out. This seems to be just a puzzle for our heroine who takes care of it by going intimate and shopping for jewelry !!! So the police put her and her son in a local motel to keep safe and what's mom doing? He goes to work leaving the child all alone at night in a strange motel room and tells him to order a PIZZA !!! I could not believe! So it gets really stupid! And the ending made me angry just because it was so ridiculous and typical. Too bad because it seemed to have possibilities.
