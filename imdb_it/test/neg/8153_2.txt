Cyclone is a dreck piece with little saving value, even on the fun side. A friend of mine took the tape from an overflowing St. Vincent DePaul basket of clothes. Okay, it might be a bit uncertain, but it had to be a trash can, not a lousy old VHS, something that the less fortunate members of our society don't really need to improve their lives. It could be considered a pity. Watching a movie like Cyclone would really only add problems. In any case, the basic premise of a woman with a super-powerful motorcycle armed to the teeth with rockets and lasers is not even properly used. The two sequences of "high speed" pursuits involve vehicles traveling at speeds below about 40 KMPH and a super fast motorcycle that risks being overtaken by an old crappy station wagon is not such as to inspire when it comes down to it. There is only one scene where stupid weapons are used, at the height of the film, and it is ridiculously ineffective, or simply ridiculous, when it is. This includes laser beams that seem to come from the hands of an evil wizard in a shameless eighties sword and sorcery that produced large bursts of flames that seem to have no noticeable effect on their targets even when they hit directly. The rest of the film is just boring and hard to watch. Many bad actors, yes, even Combs and Landau suck us, many of whom seem to have been relieved from the set of a porn movie around by exchanging really bad dialogues in a desperate attempt to advance the coherent plot. There are some ill-prepared fighting sequences and some terribly funny comic relief scenes with some policemen and the owner of the motorcycle repair shop. Benny Hill's horny old man comedy can't stop staring at the variety of female pectorals. Basically the "money" scenes involving the bike that actually do things are few and lame and the rest is clumsy filling material. Salta.
