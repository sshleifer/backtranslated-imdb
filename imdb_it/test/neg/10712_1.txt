This must be one of the worst movies ever released by the Sci-Fi Channel. Here's how the film starts, women are the only humans on this planet due to the fact that in the near future chemical warfare is OK as long as it only addresses soldiers (in case you ask, men). Great shock) and all the men on earth slowly die. Then the entire male gender is condemned to die when the lady's president is killed and killed by a man. now we take between 60 and 70 years, two women scientists are working on the cloning of a female and one of them says "Hey, why don't we bring the men back?" The other says that no, the world is not ready for this, but readily ignores it and therefore a man travels the Oath again. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film assumes that all men who are not genetically modified are blood-thirsty monsters. Secondly, the writer forgot to mention that current soldiers are a good mix of male and female officers, so there is no real reason for having such a virus. This is the biggest time period you can find. This film managed to insult my intellect not only from the bad story, but also from the recitation of the Lifetime style. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I give him a 1 out of 10 but only because I couldn't go lower.
