Nishabd means without words. This must be the condition of the script before the start of the shooting of this film and therefore during this film cries for the content. What you get is an unusual love story between a 60-year-old man and an 18-year-old girl and what you get are very common, very common events that neither excite nor surprise. So what remains at the end is with the picturesque locations of Kerala shot brilliantly by the director of photography Amit Roy and the histrionic photographic camera of the rediscovered Jiah Khan. This does not cover the lack of a concrete script. Director and producer Ram Gopal Varma, who has a good movie reputation, needs to pull up his socks. As for Bachchan, I don't want to discuss it in the context of this film. <br /> <br /> During the review, I feel lost in words. I was speechless without words! <br /> <br /> Personal Opinion: This film can be compared to an equally bad film released some time ago called BLACK. I don't see the difference between the histrionics of the protagonists of both films. What did you just say? It was a world-class cinema, blah blah, and I have no taste for it. Well, take a walk. No, I don't mean literally but really to the theaters that show this film. Because in this case you could find this film as Oscar-level material.
