From the fertile imagination that the irresistible HERCULES (1983) brought to you, comes its even more absurd sequel (read goofier): immediately after we have another cumbersome "beginning of time" proverb that even seems to completely contradict these same events as established in first film! a condensed montage of lights from the same is soon followed by a sequence of scrolling titles similar to SUPERMAN. Narrative-wise, here we have four of the rebels who steal the seven very important (but badly animated) lightning of Zeus ?? a crime that, first of all, puts the moon on track on a collision course with Planet Earth! Is faster than what can be said "nepotism", Zeus (once again interpreted as a white-haired bearded man by the relatively young Claudio Cassinelli) sends his champion? who now rightly took his place among the elites thanks to, one presumes, the omnipotent tasks performed in the first film? to find his crazy lightning and to avert disasters in the shop. <br /> <br /> As soon as Hercules (Lou Ferrigno, as if you didn't know) touched the earth's surface that comes into contact with two beautiful bridesmaids (Milly Carlucci and Sonia Viviani) they need to get them out of danger! the first (who would become an Italian TV personality) apparently has the ability to talk to the Little People (!) ?? which seem strangely like the little sisters of GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA (1964) !! Only to be able to fool the film as unused as is humanly possible, the divine quartet of villains resurrects the good old King Minosse (William Berger again) from his skeletal sleep and sink it once more against his eternal enemy. Generally, is Hercules made to meet a number of potentially deadly enemies including a Gorgon ?? a terribly by-product sequence that should have led to a complete infallible plagiarism if the film-makers behind the much superior CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981) were concerned about watching this film (complete with the same "reflection in a shield" as-uppance and preceded by the muscleman who lets the audience into his tactics before executing them as if he wanted to show us how smart he is !! And just to make it clear that wearing his influences on the sleeve, Cozzi turned Hercules and Minos into a cosmic version of "King Kong vs Godzilla" for one of their battles and, later, King Kong faces a large snake, a raised encounter directly from the original 1933 classic. I swear: this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth! <br /> <br /> As in the case of the first film, the cast is full of old instruments like the aforementioned Berger, Cassinelli and Venantino Venantini (like a sorcerer with a bad hair day) and up-and-coming starlets ?? not only Carlucci, but also Maria Rosaria Omaggio (as a young Hera!), Serena Grandi, Pamela Prati and, once again, Eva Robbins (whose costume here easily surpasses her appearance in the first film); for what it's worth, the soundtrack of Pino Donaggio for this is recycled by the musical signals present in his soundtrack of the previous film. If you have remained faithful to this review so far, you must have understood by now that this is one of those films that is so incredibly bad that a reviewer is forced to choose which course to take: either reject it in an unflattering sentence or spend an undeserving time to dissect his faults. I'm sure I left out some of his ineptitudes but I wouldn't forgive myself if I hadn't mentioned the only great example of laughter in the whole movie that almost made me fall out of my chair (yes, he also surpassed the aforementioned titanic animated duel for me) , or the decor of the rebel gods' den which is shaped like a giant marble kettle !! <br /> <br /> At this stage, one might very well wonder why he gave this film (and its predecessor ) an evaluation instead of a (not entirely unjustified) BOMB: in the past, I had several long online discussions about the possibility that the star rating of a particular film reflected the overall artistic quality or its pure entertainment value ?? but these There are two cases in which I felt it necessary to be consciously influenced by the latter in composing my final grade. I don't know: maybe it's because I'm in a "sword and sandal" mood at the moment (with about 10 most respectable examples planned for the coming days!), But, after all, unusually for me, I decided to add these two films to my DVD collection simply based on the fun I had with them in this recent review ?? and only this must count for something, no?
