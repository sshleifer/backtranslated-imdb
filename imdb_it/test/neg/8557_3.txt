Edge of Madness is a tale of a woman from the 1800s who is carefully chosen by Scottish dirt who can't keep her penis in her pants. He has only one younger brother who is against rape and kills him, but he continually says it was an accident. This drives his wife crazy, becomes delusional and takes the fall because she loves George too much. <br /> <br /> As I said, this kind of thing has been done before. This is only more "artistic" because it is Canadian and is an indie production made on a limited budget with little known actors (except that little boy from Lassie, yes, he is in there). I don't know if this was an Oscar bait, but it was definitely boring. And this is based on a 40-page story. Half of this short story is incorporated into this film, and I'm happy. Otherwise, I would have died to death. Unfortunately, I had to watch it in my lesson on basic media principles, and I had an assignment on it. Read the short story and compare and compare the film with the story. BORING. <br /> <br /> You know, it's harder to answer questions about movies when you don't like the movie. Ah well, I hope this is the last type of assignment I and my class receive. For what it's worth, Annie Herron was completely sexy, she had a nice ass and I liked the bare parts of her in the film. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for boring, performance of bait Oscar and graphic sexuality ... more nudity.
