It is difficult to investigate with this kind of thing because there is absolutely no shred of reason, even partial, to look at it, let alone express an opinion about it. I don't know anything about this - I watched it for a laugh and stayed for the fake breasts. Apparently, it's an unofficial sequel to the "Slumber Party Massacre" of 1982, which I liked as a fun slasher. "Cheerleader Massacre" looks like an end-of-nite Cinema core soft film! And not surprisingly, chicks like Nikki Fritz and Samantha Phillips (prolific actresses T & A) are in this. A lot of nekkid horns and not much else ... A group of 20 year old high school cheerleaders, two casual boys, and the fat, stupid relief from comics run aground in the country and find a home where they plan to stay the night . The "Slumber Party" killer, recently escaped, is in the area and starts killing them. There is no gore or originality and I would not say that nudity is a real "selling point" since this is a boring and boring film. Absolutely terrible ...
