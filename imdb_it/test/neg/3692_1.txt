In Moscow, the priest Owen (Vincent Gallo) hires a team to guide him to the underworld to find his friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzija) who is missing while researching the legend about the existence of demons and an entrance to hell under the city. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD based on the name of Val Kilmer and the interesting photos on the cover. I'm totally disappointed that this film is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't understand how Val Kilmer agreed to participate in this production. There are two shameful reviews on IMDb promoting this film and they are generally false, written by users with only one review on this site. There are two ways to view this boring and terrible film: my wife and I have rested many times because of the monotony of this useless story, and we used the DVD rewind button to repeat every lost scene. However, the correct way would have been to use the fast forward or stop button, to finish this shit faster. My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cidade Sombria" ("Dark City")
