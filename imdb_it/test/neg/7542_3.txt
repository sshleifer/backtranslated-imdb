Apart from the fact that this film was made (I suppose it was a good idea at the time considering BOTTOM was so popular) the only thing that baffled me about GUEST HOUSE PARADISO was what happened to the lighting? There is absolutely no artificial lighting used in this film, and I watched it on network TV, so there was no need to watch a sloppy tape. In fact the film was shot so darkly that it was impossible to see what the hell was going on. But if dialogue was something to go to, maybe it's not a bad thing
