Dreck tired and confused. The chemistry between Argento and Madsen was as exciting as a wet donut. Their dialogue was dramatically uninteresting. The plot was a disaster. The forced acting. Cinematography has focused on the uninspired. Lazy and meaningless. Kim Gordon and his character had no reason to be there. Nor to anyone else for that matter. I couldn't have done two farts for any of the "characters". Their emotions jumped and jumped like a drug addict who hates his heroine. Empty and boring. Why do I have to write ten lines of text here to express my point? I think I summarized it in the first three words. But of course it's not enough. I think this is the last time I'll take the trouble to waste time criticizing a movie. Anyway, I saw "Clean" and thought it was quite ineffective. Again, I didn't care about the characters, whether they lived or died.
