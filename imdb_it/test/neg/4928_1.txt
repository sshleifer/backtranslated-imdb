I just watched this movie at Fantasy Filmfest BERLIN. I'm not impressed. <br /> <br /> As for the story. Too many girls return from their vacation in Mexico. While waiting for their luggage they meet a couple of guys, who then take the last one and, of course, a wrong shuttle bus to the city. On board there is also another older man, so strangely portrayed that you immediately guess that he is one of the bad guys. The other is the driver. <br /> <br /> The shuttle takes them into the industrial desert and then one after another, a bit of blood, a few cuts at the ends, a bit of violence, especially playing with the fear of girls end after some ups and downs, here and there, some not too new moments of fear, all are dead, but the driver and the girls. the girls end up in a garage, where one of them is killed, after confessing to having slept with the boyfriend of the other girlfriends. The other girl, which is the conclusion, is sold by the kidnapper of the left (yes, weir is killed) in a cargo box in Asia (a cargo port is the final image). First. History. Tons of loopholes, questions you ask yourself, pending parties, and a conclusion that is not a good revelation, but a total disappointment. I can't see how such a non-professional loser is supposed to have kidnapped dozens of women (as indicated by a drawer full of licenses ... aha) Second. Act. Mediocre at its best. <br /> <br /> Third. Fear factor. OK. but I WAS SUSPENDED by torture as a means to nothing but himself. Trading with humans could be a good reason for a horror movie, but it is not used as a single one, as a background. <br /> <br /> Fourth, Music and Sound. Some good attempts, but the sound possibilities of the industrial scene, the warehouse garage and the sounds of the trucks were not really explored. Music? It would have been worse without it, but apart from that. A few pseudo-synth synth moving themes for emotion when girls reach their final destination. OK, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Verdict: AVOID IT!
