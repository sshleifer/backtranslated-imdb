To say that this film is worse than the suffocation of its own diarrhea is a generous understatement. The only thing more pathetic than this reprehensible piece of garbage in a film is the compensation paid by the producers to register a group of accounts to post false evaluations. <br /> <br /> If you watch a film that is poorly interpreted, without suspicion, a film snoozer about Sloth from the Goonies kills people in a way that completely ignores all laws of physics (pulling the legs of a free person , making them tear from the torso) is your idea of ​​a good movie, so jump out. <br /> <br /> No carbon-based lifeform with a functioning occipital lobe would take into consideration a million eons that this film is scary or funny.
