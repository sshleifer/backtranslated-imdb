Tyra and the rest of the modeling world must know that real women like me and my daughter don't bother to see all the ridiculous models to sell something. Strange places, too many tricks and too much skin are not necessary. Sex doesn't always sell when you sell to women. The same is true of the walk on the horse's catwalk which seems unnatural. People come in all shapes and sizes and need to have it on the show. My daughter has a 36 "seam, she is tall and slim and a size 5, I am more average in a size 12. We would like to see both - I can't imagine how something would look when a size 2 wears it same way about me, I don't buy any more magazines because I'm unilateral on this topic, we would love to have the show consider women of all sizes.
