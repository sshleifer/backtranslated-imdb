They used the footage of some real protests with some women talking about a society without men to make it look like these people were rooting for the "theft" of men. The funny thing is that you can see a man rooting for his own death in the background. <br /> <br /> OK, the plot. Some women say there should be a society without men, and the crowd in front of her (which contains some men) thinks it's a great idea. So all the men are killed or something. So there are no more. <br /> <br /> So this blond scientist creates a man, but he removes some chromosomes so that he can't be violent. The male grows very quickly and is soon a grown man. Not long after, he takes the Volkswagen beetle of the blonde and drives into the city where he was discovered. Now you would think that the lone man in a city full of lesbians would be the happiest guy ever, but in no way. The police chases him. <br /> <br /> I haven't looked at the rest, but it probably ends up having to race against the clock and some people, or something bad, will probably happen. Somehow the man ends up in a stadium with other men who want him to lead the rebellion. These brave warriors hiding in a stadium could have had some sort of plan that described the details of how they would get rid of a planet full of women on their own, but I didn't look. And neither should you. <br /> <br /> If you're up late and surfing on the canal and this happens, don't look. Look at everything except this one. You'll find those ads for Bowflex or those with women in swimsuits asking you to "pick up the phone to meet women like these" in your area will be more satisfying entertainment. <br /> <br /> (Oh yes, there is this fun thing when they are pulling in their cars. I don't know what they did, they seem to have driven slowly and accurately but then tried to speed up the movie to compensate but it looks really weird.) <br /> <br /> The blonde girl was pretty and I feel generous, so ... 2/10.
