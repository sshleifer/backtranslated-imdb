Oh, how the criticism fell on itself to praise their golden boy Paul Schrader (author of Taxi Driver) when this film was released. I never saw the qualities they were picking up when I saw this movie later in the day, so I saw it again to see if I was wrong. Mishima is extremely uninteresting. This is a cold and insignificant film about an author who lives / works in a cold abstruse culture. Flat re-enactments do not attract your attention because they are emotionally adrift and rude. And the rest is just there to be horrible ... with the soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they engage in, hairs on purity, admiration of swords, etc. <br /> <br /> It must be a triumph when you learn that you landed Philip Glass; but then you have to get something from him. Glasses do not offer a minimum of distinction from his other works, nor do they provide the film with any perceptible value. In 2010 it should be clear to everyone that Schrader has wasted his career on a job without impact or importance (Cat People, Auto Focus, Light Sleeper, Patty Hearst, American Gigolo). It can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, faster than anyone else. Schrader has made a curriculum full of bad and amateur films.
