Because oh, why they had to try to make a sequel to one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time. The film is a railway disaster on every level and should never have been realized. Cousin Eddie's portrait of Randy Quaid is one of the caricatures of his previous releases as cousin Eddie. Furthermore, Eddie's character is not interesting enough to contain an entire movie. Even "eye candy" Sung Hi Lee failed to redeem this piece of vacation shit. Please don't waste your time with this move, look at the original again.
