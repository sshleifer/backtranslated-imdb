Everyone I spoke to said that this movie would be good and really weird, so I thought I'd rent it. In the middle of the movie I was thinking to myself what the hell was going on and what's the point of this movie. This film from beginning to end is so bad that not even the sick parts of the film bothered me. I mean what will they do with the next volcano 2 The return of the lava. I mean, getting into this movie is so stupid that the characters are so underdeveloped, and on the eve of Robert Englund the film gets worse, I mean it could also be turned into Freddy Kruegur and Spook. Actually I was rooting for the bad guy to win is so serious. I mean the father is a policeman who doesn't seem to care that his daughter is going through one of the most important moments of her life. I mean, if my daughter was treated like that, I'd do everything in my power to keep the boy behind the prison. It also seems obvious that the character of Dee Snyders turns out to be bad again. This is one of the worst movies of all time right there with Volcano and 8mm. Don't waste time, you won't like it ....! <br /> <br /> Grade If there wasn't a vote on this site I'd choose it, this is how bad this movie is!
