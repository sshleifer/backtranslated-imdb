New York lawyer plots to get rid of his senile mother after meeting an attractive and helpful woman. Screenwriter Robert Klane, adapting his novel (the type of pocket children who would buy for the dirty parts), doesn't seem to have any knowledge of mental illness: for him, it's just an excuse for itchy comedies and scatological jokes. George Segal - who, in the 1960s, acted mainly in images of war and espionage - had become, at that time, one of the greatest American comedians of the sad bag; his nutty reactions and crazy responses only compete with his mother's inscrutability. Segal is well paired with Trish Van Devere, and their moments of connection (even if played even for laughter) are actually the only sequences that can be gravitated. Ruth Gordon, as lovable as she is, simply hangs around too much - and more than her quantities unless. This is one of the worst direct and modified films I've ever seen by so-called professionals. Promising scenes that ultimately do not play for the full effect are randomly disconnected from other moments that shake to infinity, causing the self-destruction of the coarse and ramshackle film long before it is actually finished. * 1/2 from ****
