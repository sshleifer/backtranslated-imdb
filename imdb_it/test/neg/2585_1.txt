Well, obviously everyone has the right to have an opinion on one thing ... everything. The presentation was interesting: black and white film, year 1968, student demonstrations, general strike, youth, ideals, love ..... etc. Sorry but I didn't hear LOVE, ROMANTIC. A lover who is fine with his girlfriend sleeping, regardless of who? That is love ? But not only that, the film is very long and, without reason, I had to stop watching the movie several times because I simply lost interest. I waited for something to happen but ....... NOTHING. The only thing that struck me during the film: Gypsy violinist playing in the streets, yes it was nice. I don't think art should be complicated, encrypted, hidden in secret meanings, confused. Big disappointment and waste of time!
