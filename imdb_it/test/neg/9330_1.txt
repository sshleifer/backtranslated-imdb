How does a film become a biblical epic? Just by quoting a couple of scriptures and using some Bible names for your characters? The only thing that was biblical about this epic story was the names of the characters. Oh, I almost forgot the 3 kingdoms, including Israel, Egypt and Sheba. From where did King Vidor take the rest of his story? It certainly wasn't from the Bible. It was complete and meaningless. If you want to read about the reign of Solomon as King in Israel, read 1 Kings 1-11 and 2 Chronicles 1-9. You will also meet Adonia in 1 Kings 1 and 2. The Queen of Sheba, (who does not appear until King Solomon was king for about 20 years or so, which by the way is long after Adonia and Joab had been dead) can be found in 1 Kings 10 and 2 Chronicles 9. One of the first things that Solomon does is an affinity with the pharaoh taking his daughter. <br /> <br /> Yes, King Solomon got himself involved in worshiping false gods and this is why the Kingdom was divided after his death, not the Temple was destroyed by lightning. Furthermore, I think Solomon was too busy marrying and supplying temples to the false gods of his 700 wives and his 300 concubines to fight Egypt, not to mention a dead brother. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film was total nonsense. If you don't use history in the Bible, then call it something else. This could simply have been called Romeo & Juliet or Sid & Nancy. <br /> <br />
