This episode was boring and it wasn't even in the realm of horror, so far Masters of Horror has produced a really nice episode ... The Damned Thing ... it's still early, I trust the episodes will improve. I admit the vampire episode was ok but lacked a solid plot. The episode of the couple that captured the serial killer started boring, but the last fifteen minutes were really good. However, I am simply disappointed by the lack of originality and horror that the episodes of the first season had. Please save this season John Carpenter! I am confident that Pro-Life will redeem the whole lackluster season so far. <br /> <br /> "You're an angry little elf!"
