Bad, bad, movie, so bad that it's worth watching. As long as you watch this movie knowing it's bad and you'll spend 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie, it's worth it. The special effects are poor and the animals seem fake and the acting is very bad, but looking at the faces of the actors while trying to look scared is really very funny. If your sister is going to be eaten by a giant Komodo dragon, wouldn't you do something to try to save her? If it had been eaten, wouldn't you fall on your knees crying your heart? This guy sat in a chair and ran his fingers through his hair. How much is anti-climatic? Maybe he should have been in shock or something. He joins his sister in Komodo's belly - oh I didn't want to ruin it for you.
