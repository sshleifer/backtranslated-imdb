Fame has done something strange. It was not just a musical originally created for the screen (most is based on a Broadway musical), but generated a TV series and a Broadway musical. Let me correct that sentence. Fame is not a musical. Musicals have song numbers to advance the plot or to show the characters' feelings. Singing in this music is not used to do both; in fact, there is none at all. People sing at random to adapt to the plot. And this is not the kind of musical I know. <br /> <br /> The so-called Fame plot has an assault of characters (all of which are presented immediately - the last time I saw it in a movie [Gosford Park] had disastrous results) for the audition and admission to the New York High School for the Performing Arts. All of them are for different reasons, that is. acting, singing, etc. Quotes-unquote's drama takes place as these middle-aged men who pretend to be teenagers go through their four years. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that high school should be selective. After all, it's a free college, and they can't allow everyone to enter. So how is it that some people who are really bad enter college? Obviously so that the drama could arise between all these different people. And why isn't the superior person even in the film to the end, for no reason, except to make us feel uncomfortable? There are many disturbing situations in which these talented people enter, but you can't feel bad for them because you don't know who they are! These relationships take place between people whose names are not known. And these characters realize things about them during the course of the film, yet you don't realize it, because you don't know how they were in the first place. <br /> <br /> As for singing, it opens randomly (and should it be fun?) and does nothing. When the title song is sung, it is played in the middle of a street and before you can say Ferris Bueller, everyone in the middle of the street is dancing wild and off-beat. The song itself is fine, but the whole scene, like the entire movie, is not necessary. Fame is an unpleasant film, to say the least. I would say more, but most of the film is fortunately out of my head. Just don't see it. You'll do yourself a favor. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Vote R for the language.
