The synopsis of this film led me to believe that it would be a story of an unconventional woman who challenged the conventions of the society in which she lives. I like strong female characters and I expected a film along the lines of "Chocolat" with a less and more bite fairy tale. What I got was a cast of despicable characters. <br /> <br /> For a character-based film to be effective, I need to feel a connection or compassion for people. There was no one I could relate to in the film. Grazia (Golino, whose work I admired in "Rain Man") portrays a mentally ill female, probably bipolar, often rude, aggressive and violent. Her husband screams and screams when he doesn't hit or slap anyone. Children are rude brats. They shout at each other and the females in the film. They attack other children without provocation. Violence generates violence. This seems to be an island of insensitive, aggressive, violent and rude people all around. <br /> <br /> The management is not convincing. There are mixed scenes that try to be art, but instead bring the viewer. The location is exceptionally beautiful, but even that fails to be captured as far as it could be on the film. <br /> <br /> I should recommend you stay away from this movie failure.
