This film should take place in Milford NJ. I know the house on which it is based and the person. As you can see at the end of the film, she was killed in the World Trade Center incident. I know, because I was one of the police officers who helped me identify his remains. (It was the only one in our lost area). The nakedness of the film went a little further. I'm not an idiot but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two women without actually showing the whole thing. This movie is in bad taste and I can't see how his family will give us the blessing. This is an insult to the person on whom it is based.
