As the title suggests, there is a philosophical and meritocratic thread that runs through this film: if a man has the talent and tries to find his way in society and in money, what could be the result if he is denied for not having the factor X? This question was not satisfactorily addressed in this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's book and left me rather cold along the way. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is the Ripley of the title and, apart from the fact that he comes across a trip financed in Europe, he falls under the spell of his commissioned target, Dickie Greenleaf (law). Homoeroticism and social insecurity are intertwined in a violent conflagration that intensifies and becomes complicated for the rest of the film. Law, Damon and the incredibly pleasant Paltrow as Dickie's girlfriend are OK. I liked the cameos of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Freddie Miles, the friend of the bluff society that Ripley can never be. The problem is that the story is inflected without a bow - or redemption, for that matter - which makes it rather difficult to swallow. 4/10
