I still find it hard to believe that a good novel by Dean Koontz has been transformed into this real excrement. <br /> <br /> This movie is so ugly that it's disgusting. Whistle to all those who participated What a shame! <br /> <br /> P.S. The fact that sequels have appeared simply shows how little taste and discretion remain in Silver Screen Land.
