This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, don't watch it even if your life depends on it. <br /> <br /> This film by Laurel and Hardy is when they inherit an island, they become shipwrecked and I'm ready to hang. An incredibly boring film that isn't funny at all. <br /> <br /> This was the last film by Laurel and Hardy and as a very low note to end such an extraordinary career. The films of the 40s weren't great, this film was made in 1950. If you want to remember Laurel and Hardy, remember them in their first, from the 1930s. Short films are better than feature films, my favorite is "Me and My Pal". Another reason why this film is terrible is because it is nicknamed. The actor opens his mouth and the words come out three days later. Disgust of Absoulutley, but we end up with a high tone, Laurel and Hardy were, in my opinion, the best double act ever.
