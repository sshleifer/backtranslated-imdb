I made the mistake of buying it since I collect comics-inspired films. Even at $ 6 it was too expensive. I thought there might be some campy fun in it, a "so bad" maybe it gets a good atmosphere, I was wrong. I had looked at it for once and didn't remember any of this. Now I know why. I was bored by my mind and was looking for distractions to do something else. I'm all for the grrrrl power, the punk attitude and the absurd humor, but Tank Girl doesn't work on any front. The script is bad, you don't care about the characters and the humor is mostly lame, apart from some funny jokes. Special effects or positions are poor or often replaced by panels or comic animations that are too shocking compared to live action. It is as if they did not have the money to shoot interesting things and so they resorted to drawings, however fantastic they may be (an uncensored animated film would be much better for Tank Girl now that I think about it). The action scenes were vulgar but not in a fun way to film b. The tank itself was anything but impressive or dynamic although it was interestingly decorated. In fact, the best action scenes involving the tank were in animation. <br /> <br /> It has some interesting songs from well-known artists like Bjork, Hole and Portishead, but instead of improving the atmosphere, they almost always don't fit. Once they even turned into a ridiculous song and a dance number that was just senseless and horrible. I think it's when I'm completely tuned. I imagine that Tank Girl, played by Lori Petty, looks like trash punk but, beyond her "attitudes" and sometimes barely funny statements, she is more two-dimensional and superficial than the worst comic book characters. Jet, played by Naomi Watts, is probably the only thing that saves the film and it's amazing how a good actress was involved in this mess. Malcolm McDowell was not hurt by playing his usual role as a villain. It could be a cult movie for some, but please consider that it is very different from the original original comics and that the original creators were disappointed by the film itself (check out the voice of Tank Girl on Wikipedia). <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10
