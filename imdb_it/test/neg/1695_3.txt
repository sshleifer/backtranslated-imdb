Perhaps this was exciting in the 1950s, but this is one of those films that don't age well. He has that proletarian, sincere and oppressed vibration of a TV show "Playhouse" broadcast on Rod Serling. The "plot" is for the book, the restless background of Cassevetes' character seems stuck, and the love interest is not convincing and heartless. <br /> <br /> Sidney Portier gives an OK performance, but the man who was sure an annoying and haughty snot. If I had to work with this guy in a warehouse, I'd probably hit him with a grappling hook too. Jack Warden is good, because as usual he plays Jack Warden. <br /> <br /> Like 90% of the movies rated on IMDb (whether classic, mediocre or crapola) somehow this is evaluated with 7 points - Some-stars. It absolutely doesn't deserve this. Save time
