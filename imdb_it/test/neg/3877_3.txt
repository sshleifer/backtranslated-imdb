I don't mind sequels; sometimes they are better than the original. However, many times the originals are left alone ... especially when it is not possible to duplicate the cast. One of the main reasons why "The Magnificent Seven" was a success was the very popular cast. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not the "magnificent seven", when only Yul Brynner returns as one of the members of that famous group in "The Magnificent Seven". With six of the seven boys absent and replaced by much less well-known actors, this loses its charm quickly. In other words, with the exception of Brynner, these guys have no charisma! This is a bit like a championship sports team that deploys all but one substitutes. <br /> <br /> Brynner is good, once again: fun to watch, fun to listen with that deep and distinctive voice, but the story, not just the rest of the crew, is lame. This film should never have been made. In the original, we cared about "sects"; here, we couldn't care less.
