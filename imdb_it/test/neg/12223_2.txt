The Ten Steps basically has a reasonably good premise for a scary brief, but the execution is simply terrifying. The dialogue is terrible and the acting is of the kind so regularly tested in Irish short films. Really really embarrassing bad. The girl has to go down the 10 steps of the cellar to change the burned fuse. He calls his father who is entertaining his boss at dinner. The mother, an "actress" with very questionable acting skills, answers the phone and with a loudly scolding voice tells her not to play while Dad is 'trying to impress his boss'. The actress who plays the boss's wife emulates the poor mother's acting very well when she tells them that their house is haunted. The rest of the film is the father who coaxes his daughter down the stairs on the phone. The Ten Steps employs escort techniques in camera movement, lighting, and the music you'd expect in a substandard horror movie. Poor.
