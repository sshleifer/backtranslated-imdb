John Wayne's toughest worshipers will shudder when they watch The Lawless Frontier. Even for a poverty study, this is a stinkeroo. <br /> <br /> Unusual for a Westerner we have a criminal who is a sexual criminal. Earl Dwire plays a semi-Indian white and an Indian who for reasons that are not explained, pretends to be a Mexican, hockey accent and all. Dwire sounds like the Frito Bandito of the advertising fame of the past. <br /> <br /> He and his band take on Gabby Hayes and his daughter Sheila Terry. They really don't have anything worth stealing, but Dwire just wants an excuse to kidnap Terry and make his way with her. He feels the vile fate he has in store and she and Hayes flee the ranch. <br /> <br /> Where they meet John Wayne who is on the bandits' trail. They also meet a stupid sheriff who believes that Wayne is one of the bandits. Again for reasons I can't understand. <br /> <br /> It was a tough way to make a living by grinding the works of horses like these to the Duke. Fortunately the best things were coming.
