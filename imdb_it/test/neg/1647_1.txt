In his recent malevolent reality show, Mr. Shore admitted that his film work was better enjoyed. No, he must have said "better observed". While a healthy toke can see you through the end credits, there is little pleasure to find, except for some sporadic giggles at the photo, not with it. The absence of partial spelling is the least complaint. Another syllable, healthy Tiffani-Amber Thiessen (I challenge you to erase that patina of purity "Saved by the Bell") is miscible as a rural vampire; it's too round for treason. Mr. Shore, from time to time shows the strange talent for imitation (I thought I recognized a Jimmy Stewart there), but it is never properly used. The formidable formula "fishing out of the water" has yet to be rendered with less grace. Our hero, Crawl has a small and precious talent to explain for his fast and fascinating antagonists. In the end, I had to announce that it was ascertained: THE WORST FILM EVER. Post scriptum Like another fish, Adam Sandler fared better with "Mr. Deeds". It could serve a Riva to appreciate a Sandler.
