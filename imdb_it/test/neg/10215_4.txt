Mind you, it shouldn't be, but it is. As a child, I saw this movie in the theater (Being a great wrestling and fan of Hulk Hogan). All I remember from the night is that we were the only ones in the theater and that I didn't like it much. I obscured the rest, and for good reason. <br /> <br /> A poor film on a par with the big names like "Gymkata" and "The Pumaman", "No Holds Barred" is a film set in the high stakes world of professional wrestling. Well, maybe the stakes are not that high ... and frankly, I feel dirty just calling these "professional" people to anything. And really, apart from the first scene, there's no wrestling to talk about. So I guess the film is about the marginally low world of amateur bettors, out of this world. Sounds good, right? <br /> <br /> Hulk Hogan interprets Rip, the WWF champion (Never say that Hulk Hogan was a typographer, this and films like Thunder in Paradise showed how he challenged himself with profound roles that really pushed the limits of his talents). Essentially he is playing himself, but with a wardrobe that is more black and blue than Hulkster's red and yellow. He also has this hand gesture. It's kind of like the sign of the devil ozzy that people do at rock concerts, except that they hold their thumbs in the air, and curl their forefinger. My friend said he should look like an "R." Try and see for yourself. If that sounds like an "R", well then, Mars needs women. But. <br /> <br /> Kurt Fuller, with his exaggerated detector obviously in fritz, plays a TV performer with his heart a little homoerotic set to get Rip, which is obviously bigger than Elvis, on his network. He will not (and leaves the office with a triumphant hand gesture to no one except the camera), and so the film follows Fuller trying to increase the ratings and return to Rip. He does this when he creates his brilliant title entitled "Battle of the Tough Guys". Marketing genius, this guy. <br /> <br /> From the numerous hand gestures, to the rather idiotic fight scenes (all played as if the wrestling was very real and deadly serious) to the exaggerated, to the too frequent shots of Hulk in nothing but undies, This movie has everything you ever wanted in a stupid movie. It's frivolous, not too burdensome to the mind, violent, and includes the phrase "What is that smell?" "DOOKIE!" "Dookie?" <br /> <br /> An all-time classic.
