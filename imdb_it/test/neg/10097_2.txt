Eric Roberts "reads" in this Tommy Lee Thomas prison movie. He plays the head of a ring of corrupt guards. Although he is evil by most people's standards, his character is the kind of guy kind enough to give you support cables as you hang from the ceiling while torturing you with the "Lethal Weapon" electric prods. <br /> <br /> The film has an intricate plot about prison corruption that makes absolutely no sense. Thomas has Clint Eastwood's dark eyes, Dolph Lundgren's jokes, JCVD's acting skills and the body of the smallest boy you knew at school who took steroids after graduation. <br /> <br /> Martin "Cobra Kai" Kove's career shares this low point with Roberts, in the film it's hard to tell if Kove's character should be drunk for the whole movie or if Kove just arrived at that way. I couldn't blame him if he did. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for everyone involved, this film has a "so bad that is good" quality that it can be fun IF YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO BETTER TO DO.
