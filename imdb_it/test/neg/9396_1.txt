This film was apparently based on a non-fiction book. I'm not sure which book writers have read to write their adaptation, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the real life adventures of Frances Mayes in Italy. Instead, it is an uninteresting story that takes liberties at all times to hit men. Take note of the following examples: <br /> <br /> ************************************ * ******************************* <br /> <br /> DETAILS SPOILER <br /> <br /> * ************************************************* * ***************** <br /> <br /> Bash Number One: Lane's husband cheats on her and her marriage ends in divorce. <br /> <br /> Bash number two: Lane ventures into a local Italian city and is promptly solicited by all males on the street. <br /> <br /> Bash number three: Lane is saved by the crazy men of the city by a charming gentleman. He falls in love with him after having consumed an afternoon of love. He later finds out that he is already attacked and cheating with her. <br /> <br /> Bash Number Four: you have to broaden your horizon for this because the reference is certainly in the film. His lesbian couple friends decide to have a child with inversion fertilization (SP?). I was told that in most lesbian relationships, you have a person who takes on the female role and another who takes on the male role. In the film, after the female has become pregnant, the "male" lesbian decides to exhaust the relationship because she cannot manage it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film has nothing to do with booking that was supposed to be based on.
