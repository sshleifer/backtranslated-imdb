The growth of tax funds and sales and leaseback schemes has led to a series of unsaleable films that are collecting dust in laboratories and vaults across the British Isles because they seem to be made just because they fit the financial criteria rather than potential audience. Some lucky ones spend a week on a small screen in London before going to the DVD budget, but The Riddle stood out completely ignoring the cinema, TV or even the premiere rental market as a free DVD in Sunday mail. <Br /> <br /> It is all too easy to understand why this ended up being literally given away. Apart from a couple of problems (a boom microphone is clearly visible at a stroke) it is not particularly badly done, and while Vinnie Jones arrives as the modern version of Freddie Mills Mills's British cinema as the greyhound journalist who wants to go to crime desk and supporting cast turn from ham to vaguely passable, no one stands out here for being extraordinarily good or incredibly bad: mediocrity is more the norm here. The real problem is that, as in many films about sales tax funds, it's a "soft" film - there's no reason to look at it. It exists because the circumstances existed because it was done, but it lacks rhythm or impetus. He seems to be aiming for the teat time audience on Sunday (despite having been shot in Scope) but he doesn't cut it. There are a couple of okay ideas in this resolutely inoffensive story of an unpublished Charles Dickens manuscript and a couple of suspicious deaths in modern Limehouse, but the mysterious element is so painfully obvious - as is the last-minute supernatural twist ( you I will never guess who the real Jacobi tramp is. What, did you guess? - that you almost expect the Scooby Gang or the Double Deckers to show up to solve it. <br /> <br /> It is a very badly designed film for all kinds of reasons: some cast members are playing double roles when they shouldn't even play one, and the whole shock revealing the truth of Dickens's manuscript is completely messy because it is all narrated in first person by Dickens rather than the alleged character of the novel. The main murder of the film is awkwardly integrated into the main plot, with characters who suddenly remember Vinnie that he has already forgotten about that, announcing an increasingly desperate final half-hour that sees the secret of the evil developer Jason Flemyng put in some rohypnol in Vinnie's drink so he can have his evil way with him and leave incriminating photos behind "to make you look like a jerk with your girlfriend", leading him to have a dream where he talks to Charles Dickens ("You're Charles Dickings" "What's in a name?"), Which offers the slightly less likely suggestion that "Read too many books". But all this is nothing compared to the ending, which falls in absolute absurdity, with logic and common sense that go completely out of the window as it sounds like a bizarre tragedy of Jacobin revenge with guns on the banks of the Thames, with two guest stars of two days Flemyng and Vanessa Redgrave seem to prefer to be somewhere else (Mel Smith appears in a one-day cameo, so it's clear that the "names" of the film are mostly there for an easy $ 10k or to satisfy their food payments) . The final image of the film is so utterly absurd and useless as to make it almost worthy of being seen. <br /> <br /> A curiosity is a fairly important role in the first third for Vera Day, a sort of prototype by Liz Fraser and unique support for the British films of the 1950s - the bartender of Hell Drivers, the bartender of Quatermass II - promoted here to a pub owner, while comedian Kenny Lynch briefly introduces himself to give the best interpretation of an old school gangster. Oh, and the late Gareth Hunt makes his last bow - oh the irony - a coroner ... <br /> <br /> Just to complete the package, the freebie DVD also included a trailer for the other film of the director with Vinnie Jones, Bog Bodies, an absurd-looking British horror with transatlantic scientists and Vinnie in Elmer Fudd dressed as a duck hunter terrified by a 2000 year revived sacrificial victim from the nearest peat bog ("Be wwwy, wewwy qwuiet: I'm hunting dwuids "). I can't wait to wait ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I can guarantee, however, is that every indie producer in the UK will spend the next few weeks trying to find out exactly how much he paid for his mail for the license to press the DVD (Prince paid Â£ 250,000 for his new CD). With so many Indians for British tax shelters on the shelf and with money so difficult to find at the moment, this could become an interesting reserve market for British films.
