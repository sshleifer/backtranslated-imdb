Obviously, this is not the "Piranha" directed by Joe Dante and produced by Roger Corman. It wasn't so obvious, when I bought the DVD for only $ 2.95, since the DVD's cover matched that of Corman's "horror / piranha" comedy, the DVD menu (no features of course) matched the cover. Halfway looking at this strange film, my girlfriend and I started thinking, where are the PIRANHAS? Once we reached the climax of the film, we realized that we had to watch the wrong movie since we had seen the trailer, which had a completely different movie, that the blurb on the back of the DVD did not match the story we were watching and the titles queue (actors, producer, director) were completely different. Instead, we have a bit of jungle melodrama about a girl and two boys looking for diamonds and end up facing a ferocious animal hunter. This domesticated and exploitative thriller is boring and useless and is only slightly fun for the old school, field value. Strange that a DVD could be produced with the wrong film in tactile terms, but I suppose it's an easy mistake to show as if they were both B-movies with the same name made in the 70s. Reading other posts made about this film, I noticed that I'm not the only one with the wrong movie on DVD. How could it be an INTERNATIONAL mistake? Is there a sort of DVD phenomenon in which unsuccessful films try to get recognition by being included on the wrong DVDs? WHAT IS GOING ON???
