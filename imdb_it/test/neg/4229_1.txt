I just had the misfortune of seeing this really horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Think of that scene in Magnolia at the end with the slow pan on that woman. Now remove the pan, add to the mix men who are breathing and with a long beard, and you have what was the 2 and a half hours of Humanity <br /> <br /> The inspector is a real traitor, he is not even a betrayal, just a weak and slow simpleton. How come they solved a crime is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Mandatory sex scenes are horrible and rewarding. <br /> <br /> Any bad of the piece (he raped and killed an 11-year-old girl) is reported very early and it is no surprise unless you are similarly deceived. <br /> <br /> An uninspiring chamber work. <br /> <br /> The director was there to say that it is up to the public to provide their own interpretation of the proceedings. I presume he also intended to provide his own dialogue (there is all the bugger - adding to his level of boredom), an inventive job for the camera (only static shots, which totally strips the obvious beauty of the landscape in which the film is shot) and plot! <br /> <br /> Really terrible. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10.
