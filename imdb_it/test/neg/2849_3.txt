Terrible. Absolutely terrible. Long, confused and insignificant. After about three hours of this painful mess the finish is really the last nail in the coffin. Not even the magnificent, sexy, beautiful goddess Francesca Annis can save this poor adaptation of Agatha Christie's work. The plot drags and drags and time passes slowly and suddenly you realize that you have no idea what's going on. In the end, even with the usual explanation of the villain, there is still a lot that is not explained and therefore ?? it's over. A complete waste of time and undoubtedly one of the worst adaptations to bear the name of Agatha Christie.
