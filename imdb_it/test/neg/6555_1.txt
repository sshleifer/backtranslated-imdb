I was telling a friend of mine when my grandfather actually chose this horrible piece of shit for us to see one night at the theater. He never chose another one again! It was so bad! Anyway, my friend told me that his father wrote part of the trash. I thought he was joking. It turns out she was serious. He had never seen it and said he stopped abruptly at his father's writing career. I told her not to waste her time. But, if she had really collapsed and looked at her, she would have seen in the first moment why this had ended her days as a writer. I mean, even in the 80s, this crap is bad beyond description. I mean, Joe Frazier as Terrible Tucker? And why would two cops in the world worry about a house full of ghosts? And the movie poster? A ghost with his tongue out? What is it? Nothing on this makes sense. Well, I told my friend that this shit not only ended her father's career as a writer, but ended the careers of everyone involved. Or at least none of them has ever fully recovered from being in this junk of a movie. Let's say that I will always ridicule my friend for revealing to me that his father was a writer for this movie! Only this should say how bad this is!
