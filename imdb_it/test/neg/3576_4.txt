In New York, on a Christmas morning, a father and mother of the upper class go to their BMW in a private school to see the drama of their daughter. Then they go shopping and then return to their luxurious Manhattan apartment. In the night, they move to a simple apartment in a dangerous neighborhood, where they prepare drugs for distribution. On Christmas Eve, as he buys his daughter's Christmas present, his father is kidnapped and his wife tries desperately to raise a high sum to pay the required ransom. "R Xmas" is a misleading film by Abel Ferrara. The main characters have no names, they are anonymous and perhaps his intention is to say that in the bosom of a neighboring family in your palace they can have drug dealers; or that drug dealers can also have families and can be loving people; or that there are many dirty policemen, probably worse than criminals; or is it a simple excuse for crime? Everything! However, this humanization of criminals is a horrible message, and I did not like this film very much. In Brazil, for example, many drug dealers and criminals help their communities, due to the absence of the state in poor areas and slums, but this procedure does not make them models of citizens. In this film we see a loving family of the upper class during the day, providing drugs as a means of life, but the destruction of members of other families is not shown in history, and it is impossible to feel sympathy for any character. In the end, I wanted everyone to die. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Gangues do Gueto" ("Gangs of the Ghetto")
