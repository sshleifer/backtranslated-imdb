I can't believe I even tried to look at this filth. As a keen fan of the B-Horror film, I was more than drawn to the perspective of this film by horror director Herschell Gordon Lewis. Unfortunately, since the opening of the film, I could not, for the life of me, think of a film worse than this. Well, maybe Gigli, but I firmly believe that Dr. Gore (The Body Shop) is worse when I think about it. A horrible plot that moves incredibly slowly, the film drags on without a real horror to talk about. However, I will admit the sheer hilarity of a couple of scenes in which Dr. Gore is mesmerizing his future victims. The camera enlarges the eyes too large in the shape of a bulb, while all the time there is this purely putrid soundtrack to add to the fun. I laughed for the best part of 10 minutes. After erecting his "miraculous woman", the film loses about 20 minutes showing only him and his "girlfriend" while he is teaching her to talk, then they talk, joke between marigolds, picnic, etc. Unfortunately, there is only music playing throughout this fandango without any speech. This part of the film will leave you wanting to have cut your wrists with the dull side of a butter knife. I almost want to puke at the thought of this movie. If you like movies that are bad, look at this.
