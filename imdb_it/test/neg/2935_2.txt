Well, where do you begin to describe this celluloid debacle? You already know the great NADA that passes as a storyline, so let's say it's so PC that it's offensive. Hard to believe that Frank Oz, the same guy who gave us laughter like Little Shop of Horrors and Bowfinger, made this unjustified mess. <br /> <br /> So, this guy doesn't know he's gay until this actor points out. Ok sure. If anyone ever says I'm gay, I'll know the truth, even though I currently like girls more than George Luke $ I like a dollar. <br /> <br /> And how do you know the true nature of my sexuality? Well, if I like classical literature, dance and Barbra Streisand, I'm gay. If I dress like a blind man in a hurry (with half of the shirt hanging out), I'm straight. Oh, sure. <br /> <br /> And here is the cliché of clichés: no matter how you look, there is always a very attractive Hollywood actor who loves every trace of fat under the skin, or a top model that I will love your I zero, your ugly face and the ears that come out of you. If all those gay clichés weren't enough to make me angry, that was it. In the real world it seems important, people, and I know for sure. <br /> <br /> I see it coming: now you will say "Relax! It's a comedy! Don't take it so seriously!" If being a comedy gives something "white paper" to suck out loud, I think the world has a serious problem. Wouldn't it be much better (and more fun) to make a film to deny those boring old clichés instead of magnifying them over and over again? <br /> <br /> So one of the worst movies I've ever seen. 1 out of 10. If giving this assessment has something to do with my sexual tendency, please let me know. I'm interested.
