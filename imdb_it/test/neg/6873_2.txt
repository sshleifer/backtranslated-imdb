Here's another movie with front row characters that are totally amoral and yet should we be rooting for them? Not me. No character in this film was worth the trouble. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams plays the car salesman "Joey O'Brien". Man has no class, a loser in all moral senses and a boy who thinks he can get out of anything. Knowing Williams' ability to speak, he was good in this role. Even the women of his life are driving him crazy. Some of them are not much better than him. <br /> <br /> Tim Robbins plays a similar low life that starts the film when, full of explosives, crashes into a car dealership showroom and holds people, including his wife, hostage. Robbins, as normal in him, plays a disturbed and ridiculous character. I imagine these mind-boggling roles come easily to these two actors. Damn, I wonder why. <br /> <br /> There is so much to scream and scream in this film that it will give you a headache. Combine those two screamers with Fran Drescher's nasal voice and you really have an exaggerated fast food. It's like listening to chalk on a blackboard for an hour and a half. Is this the comedy? No, this is lame. <br /> <br /> In fact, for a Robin Williams movie only a dozen reviews published here tell you something. It is very different from his best film.
