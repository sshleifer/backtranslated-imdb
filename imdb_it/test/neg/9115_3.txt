The setup of "Nature of the Beast" is ingeniously simple and fraught with unlimited possibilities of suspense: the ferocious salesman Jack (a domesticated Lance Henriksen) collects trouble in the form of the hitchhiker Adrian (Eric Roberts), who seems to possess information incriminating against Jack. Oh, and over a million dollars was stolen from a casino and someone nicknamed 'Hatchet Man' is dismembering people in the desert. Sounds great, right? A bit like "The Hitcher" meets "Psycho". One or both of these men has a secret, and nothing is as it seems! Unfortunately, the writer and director Victor Salva (of "Jeepers Creepers" and "Powder") does not have enough ideas to keep the film going, the scenario does not arouse tension or suspense (poison for what is supposed to be a thriller). ") and the inclusion of an underlying homo-erotic tone seems out of place. Henriksen evokes an unusual Everyman, not really tied to the Earth (even if he has a large gut), but Roberts is scary and scary as an extra in "Death Wish 3"; we have never been sucked into the point where we actually worry about what is happening, and the conclusion slips into unlikely territory (I kept thinking that it would be "Fight Club" again, but I was wrong). Sin. "Nature of the Beast" could have been something else ... instead of anything else.
