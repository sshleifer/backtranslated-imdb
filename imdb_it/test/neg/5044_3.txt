Gargoyle starts late at night in Romania 1532 when a peasant (Daniela Nane) travels in her horse and her cart thinking about her business when from the clouds in the moonlight over a living Gargoyle she falls and attacks her, manages to escape the Gargoyle and happens on a castle of some description where an angry mob of villagers and a priest are able to end the Gargoyle, or so they think ... Cut to the present day Bucharest, where two CIA agents Ty Griffin (Michael Pare ) & Jennifer Wells (Sandra Hess) are going to negotiate the safe return of the son of a wealthy American ambassador from his captors. In search of one of the kidnappers, Griffin loses him on the roof of a building, but finds a large pool of blood and no visible signs of what happened to him. Meanwhile, Dr. Christina Durant (Kate Orsini) and her colleague Richard Barrier (Jason Rohrer) are renovating a church when Gregor (Mihai Bisericanu), a church worker, informs Richard that he has found some ancient relic, the two investigate and find a cave with lots of slimy cocoons and a very angry and very alive Gargoyle who wastes no time in killing them both. Griffin & Wells are on the case when reported as missing and soon realize that the local legends of the monstrous Gargoyles are true with a local priest named Father Soren (Fintan McKeown) who plans to flood the world with them ... <br /> <br /> Co-written, co-produced and directed by Jim Wynorski under his usual pseudonym Jay Andrews Gargoyles is another masterpiece that Wynorski can add to his credits, not. The screenplay by Wynorski, Ion Ionescu, A.G. Lawrence and Bill Munroe is crap, it's not exciting, boring and it's as simple as it gets. To begin with I would like to know if there is only one Gargoyle left who laid all those eggs because I'm pretty sure he couldn't get pregnant. How did you survive in that hole for 500 years? What did you eat? How did the priest know he was there? Why has no one else ever understood this? Why does the priest want to flood the world with them? To dominate it? Will the Gargoyles hardly take control of the world and then let a priest dominate him like a king and do what he has left to govern? Just like the guys who wrote Gargoyle, don't I think he thought about it? Regardless of the way I look at it, no matter how I approach it, from any angle I try to understand it, no matter how many times I try to square the circle, the Gargoyles make no sense and have a huge plot, lapses into logic and it's not so nice to start. The characters are boring and clich√©, the repetitive and unexciting action, while the film as a whole is a real bore to sit. People do illogical things and everything that happens is much more convenient, like when the priest tries to convince Griffin of the existence of Gargoyle and one suddenly shows up and attacks them. The cocooned cave is such a scam from Aliens (1986) it's embarrassing and the ending was lame. The bite on the big Ferris wheel at the fair was fun even when the boy made fun of the boys fearing heights and forced him to climb. <br /> <br /> Director Wynorski cuts costs and steals footage from other films, in fact Gargoyle's best scene is a car chase through Bucharest but was taken from Jean-Claude Van's action movie Damme Maximum Risk (1996). There is no shock, fear or atmosphere. The special effects are terrible, the Gargoyle CGI seems to belong to a computer game and has little interaction with the cast members, there are many scenes of people watching the sky and trying to look scarred. There is not even a valid gusset to make the thing watchable, there is a terrible beheading and that's it. <br /> <br /> Technically the special effects are horrible, but otherwise it's passable, the Romanian locations seem adequately Romanian. Gargoyle went straight to the video and shows with a rather cheap look. Acting is not by far, the personality bypass victim Michael Pare is the most boring of the obtuse heroes. <br /> <br /> Gargoyle is a shit movie, it fails to make a decent creature at all. A total waste of 90 minutes for me, one to avoid.
