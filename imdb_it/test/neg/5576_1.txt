I like to think I saw it all. SS DOOMTROOPER. The one about a family of rapacious tigers. The one about a pteranodon family. GOAT EATER. DEMON CHILD (a rubber doll as a child not imitated with horns stuck on the head.) Several SASQUATCH whiplashes, none of them good. A couple of endless HELLRAISER sequels, endless sequels of LEPRAUCHAN Sequel to JASON sequel. 'EM, which is actually a parade of an urban street recorded on a $ 199 camcorder. And so I saw part of an STV the other night about people stranded on a desert island with kickboxing until their death with a group of badly animated totems. I even ended up with DREAMCATCHER, as recently as yesterday evening - well, I should say that I talked about it in parts of it, after seeing it in all its horrible glory years ago. But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of young people trapped on an island during a storm, forced to fight with the aliens arriving in a meteorite. aliens, photography, acting and directing and writing is equally bad. I turned it off halfway. Good luck.
