I can't remember when I saw a worse movie. The acting was exaggerated, the dialogue was trite to the point of being painful to listen to, the second-level special effects and the ridiculous general story. <br /> <br /> I never wanted to go out on an extra movie and if I had been alone it would have been what I would have done, about 30 minutes, and I saved myself almost ANOTHER TWO EDUCATION TIMES of dialogue from nausea and a plot with more holes than a Swiss cheese "the size of Texas". I can't emphasize too much the miserable experience that has been found in this sticky waste of a perfectly good celluloid. <br /> <br />
