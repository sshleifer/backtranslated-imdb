After watching this movie, I decided that it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I knew it from the moment I was subjected to three screaming and agitated teenage girls when they (OMG!) Meet again, and then observe the same thing, done only by women old enough to be my mother. And it was only the first few minutes. Yeesh. So here are my comments ... <br /> <br /> 1. Middle-aged women + ridiculous dance moves complete with fashionable drives and costumes top = not a good idea. <br /> <br /> 2. Pierce Brosnan couldn't make his way from a paper bag. Nor could anyone else in this pile of excrement, indeed. <br /> <br /> 3. The songs were so random. It was obvious to me that they were thrown, willy-nilly, into the incredibly invented plot and STUPID. <br /> <br /> 4. My three-year-old grandson could have written a better script. <br /> <br /> I was laughing derisively or laughing during the film. And normally I really like musicals. Of course they are destined to be a little trivial ... but this was ridiculous. What a waste of talent. I mean, you have great actors and actresses in this movie ... I'm embarrassed for them that it's part of their career now. I'm sorry to waste my money and my time on this piece of shit.
