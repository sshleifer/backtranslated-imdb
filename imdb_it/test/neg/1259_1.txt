My website (theflickguy.org) lists "Michael" as one of the worst films of the modern era. The following is an excerpt: <br /> <br /> "Each of us collapses some time in his life, this was Travolta's turn. I still don't know what was the point of this terrible movie. Nora Efron proved to be a competent writer and director, so what the hell happened here? Archangel Michael makes a new turn here and is depicted as a mess of smoldering sugar, drugged and mushy, whose biggest contribution to the humanity (after sending Lucifer to hell) was invented "in a row". Yes, that's fun and fascinating. I don't find this offensive, I find it stupid. In his defense, I can say that the ending was always a little unsatisfactory as the rest of this painful attempt at fiction. "
