On the scale of 1 to 10, I gave this to 4. I thought the film was not very good, too much violence and not a character to love. <br /> <br /> On an erotic scale, I give this to 6. Many sex scenes are tinged with an underlying ugliness. I always like nudity and Nancy Travis and Faye Grant arrive, but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic.
