Friend, this movie stank! It is obvious that this film has helped dispel Hollywood's need to churn out tired sequels to appeal to the masses. First of all, it came out too fast, and secondly, it didn't have the same elegance that made the original film a success. No new terrain has been broken, and has turned into a rather trivial effort.
