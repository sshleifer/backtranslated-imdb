I'm still waiting for that dark muppet movie where we won't know how it will end from the beginning. I think Linklater could make an attempt with animation. This time I did not expect such a clever thing, but profoundly eager. <br /> <br /> Joan Cusack sucked. She moved to a level created for TV lazily by reciting this with cynical clich√©s. The muppets were more life than her. A delusion. <br /> <br /> But then the whole movie was, Pepe bar. I loved it. He was the only one who made me laugh (while Goldbergh as God made me suffocate and swear). If we can't see a dark Muppet than at least a PG: 13 one with more controversial lines than Pepe and Animali in testa di metallo, egg-nog-chuggin person. <br /> <br /> The Worst Muppets I also saw the boring Christmas Carol beat this out. The muppets must avoid this commercial holiday. <br /> <br /> 5/10
