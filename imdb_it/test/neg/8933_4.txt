"Flashdance" meets "Meatballs III" or maybe it should be called "Meatballs IV". This is my friend Wesley's all-time favorite movie, largely because he still has something about the J.V. As someone once said: "Okay, more than good, but when you get older you need to expand. Whether you want it or not, society requires it". <br /> <br /> "Give me an F" the greatest cheerleader of the JV of the cinema, Mary Ann (played by Beth Miller), who looks like a sweet Alicia Silverstone in front of her "Clueless" days. Wesley hates Miller's other film, the horrible "Teen Wolf Too" made three years later, where he plays a fickle southern beauty very similar to Martha Smith's "Animal House" character. I personally admire Miller's range as the two characters could not be more different and she is as convincing as both. <br /> <br /> However, Mary Ann is a naive novice cheerleader of Moline (a member of the "The Lucky Ducks" team) who comes to Camp Beaverview for cheerleader instructions. He made friends with Jenna (Karen Lee Kelly), the leader of the robust girls' team, rightly called "The Demons". Jenna becomes protective of Mary Ann after her main rival has been disliked by Mary Ann. <br /> <br /> Mary Ann then takes a crush on Tommy Hamilton, the lead instructor. Tommy spends his summer struggling with the dilemma of having to grow and move on, which is a problem as his only skills are teaching cheerleading and performing elaborate showers in the shower, for the entertainment of the spectators coming down to that kind of thing. Phoebe (Daphne Ashbrook) is Tommy's longtime companion, she has a well-adjusted attitude and an experienced perspective. He even tolerates Tommy's flirting with Mary Ann - trusting that Tommy will not actually take advantage of young Mary Ann. <br /> <br /> While these four characters are solid and their relationships have a nice charm, the supporting cast is almost as weak as the material they have to work with. Which is a shame because they brought some comic relief to the production that would have been a decent film. Jennifer Cooke plays Pam, a social climbing and terminally vivacious instructor who is pursuing owner Bucky, hungry for money from the camp. And there is another couple with something for the characters of "Mad Max". Since nothing is so much fun, all you have left is a nice semi-love story and some fantastic dance routines. <br /> <br /> It is tempting to create some suspense by slowly starting a final competition, but unless this is your first cinematic experience the result is never in doubt. And there is a backstory about some Japanese businessmen Bucky wants to get, but he doesn't go anywhere dramatically or comically. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
