Given the incredible reviews of this film, I was expecting something truly exceptional. Surely it starts well with witty and sharp dialogues, and a well done cast. A series of intertwined stories in a Robert Altman style envelop the viewer with compelling scenes. I found it fascinating entertainment until the second half of the film when, unfortunately, it collapses like a pack of cards. A series of ridiculous coincidences and right-wing messages accumulate until they leave me deeply disappointed and wonder what it is. Paul Haggis addressed the theme of the race in Los Angeles, and this seems to have elevated this film to a new level of interest. Since most of the Academy's voters live in Los Angeles and have experienced some racism, this film will surely have an impact on them. This means that the Oscar for best film will go to the race film or the gay movie. We hope it's the latter, because Brokeback Mountain is a bona fide masterpiece that deserves to be recognized.
