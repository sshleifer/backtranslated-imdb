I saw the version with pathetic American over-doppers, maybe this made it a lot worse, but from what I could see the movie was still pretty ugly. It seemed like a low budget. The images reminded me of a second-choice TV movie, a casual white dog replaced by Dogmatix, embarrassing the BBC costumes of the 1960s, etc. Above all, it seems to me that the characters in the film did not behave like cartoon characters, and as a result I never felt willing to even try to forgive the poor aspect of the movie. It will always be difficult to capture the feeling of comics in a movie without using animation, and I did not think this attempt was worth it.
