Actually I belong to the demographic that Zoey 101 in particular is trying to target, so I can see that as much as you try to be related to people of my age, the premise is simply too ridiculous for an ordinary person to relate to. The show revolves around the richer college in place, and the pretty, incredibly tanned, attractive band of unilateral characters who inhabit it. As is the tradition among the networks of children, the cast is a host of white and thin kids, with the token black, of course. <br /> <br /> The narrative lines revolve around Zoey and her band of friends who stumbles or creates a sort of little dilemma, such as not wanting to attend gym class, with Zoey devising a scheme to save the day for all his friends. Generally there is a line B that revolves around a one-way guest character, or puts supporting characters in completely unrealistic situations, like having a wasp hive in a dorm room and no one notices. These plots often play on stereotypes, such as any character who gets good grades in mathematics, usually lacking completely in social skills. Most of the episodes have a continuous and abused will - they won't - they have a Chase-Zoey dynamic. <br /> <br /> The characters, unfortunately, are all incredibly one-sided; there is Zoey, the perfect girl with a solution for literally everything, Chase, the constant still in love, but rather catchy Best Friend, Michael, the token black guy (thanks to Christopher Massey for managing some really fun one-liners) , Lola, the theater chick (in the sense that her hair dies and 75% of the dialogues talk about her celebrity dreams, despite the fact that she never does anything in the real theater), Logan, the feminizing narcissist, Dustin, the little brother and Quinn, the science geek. The few words I spent on each of these characters completely summarize each character. <br /> <br /> Zoey 101 can be fun at times, but the serious flaws in the value system it promotes are an important turning point. Zoey, who is set up as the obvious role model and the quasi-feminist crusader who is on the surface portrayed as flawless, continues to manage the main flaws of the characters. For example, when Lola was first introduced, she was believed to be a goth girl. Zoey tried to use this as an excuse to kick her out of their shared dorm to be "crazy". <br /> <br /> As for acting, it's pretty clear that Jamie Lynn Spears landed this role because of his name, not because of the talent. Although it has certainly improved over time, it is clear that she is not a born actress, who has a great influence on the quality of the show, since most of the lines of the plot revolve around her character. The supporting cast is surprisingly good, especially considering the material they have to work with. They offer a good deal of tailor-made jokes for comic relief, if the plot hasn't ventured into darkness yet. <br /> <br /> All in all, Zoey 101 is an imperfect view of high school life, and anyone who has passed their limited Too many years should not expect much from it.
