"D.o.a." is a non-thrilling thriller by directors Rocky Morton and Annabel <br /> <br /> Jankel. The acting is ok and the script is pretty bad. This film also has some moments that will make you laugh at how stupid the violence scenes are <br /> <br />. For example, someone is hit near a window. We see then from the outside <br /> <br /> the building that looks like that skipped person. I laughed my head when it happened. This film strives, but ultimately fails. Just watch this movie <br /> <br /> when you have no other choice. <br /> <br /> My opinion: ** <br /> <br /> Rating: [R] <br /> <br /> Votes: Violence and language. * <br /> <br /> * There was no reason for the classification due to his age.
