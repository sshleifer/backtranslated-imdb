I enjoyed the whole setup with Ceasar's Palace, the Roman guards and the toga announcers. This event also marked "the passage of the torch" with regard to the WWF voice. Gorilla Monsoon, who until then had played the game for every PPF of the WWF, opens and gives the typical introduction, making it seem like he is there to announce another PPV. But then he introduces Jim Ross who is making his WWF debut and JR continues to make the WWF comment to date. But outside of this, this event is pure junk. Good old scientific wrestling was thrown out the window and entered the birth of tricks. This was for me the event in which the WWF started to go to the bathroom, and did not recover until the era of late 90s attitudes. Here is a review of the event. <br /> <br /> Match for the IC title: Tatanka (Challenger) against Shawn Michaels (champion): A good result, but given what Shawn is capable, it was very disappointing. I have no idea why the WWF was determined to put Tatanka down. They had to realize that Shawn was the future and Tatanka was just a hyper wrestler in an Indian Gimick. The end of the game itself was very weak. Shawn grabs the referee and pulls it out, then is called for a count. While it was fun to watch Sherri get beaten afterwords, this game was simply forgettable. Shawn had to face this game and had trouble doing it. <br /> <br /> The Stenier Brothers Vs. The Headshrinkers: Steiners wins through a Franknsteiner. This match had its moments, but the crowd didn't seem to be involved. There was no heat behind it, I think it was a game just to launch two tag teams. <br /> <br /> Crush vs Doink the Clown: TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! This game is completely sucked. Two very lousy gimmicks. A clown and a Hawaiian dressed in bizarre colors. The ending caught everyone by surprise. In the following months, Crush turned his heel and Doink turned his face, but none of the fans seemed to care. Unfortunately, this was not the worst game on paper. <br /> <br /> Razor Ramon vs. Bob Backland: you have a brand new heel that is going very well against a forgotten wrestler about 10 years ago. Fans giggle and laugh when Backlund comes out. And like Hogan / Rock in WM18 and HHH / Owen in WM14, the heel wrestler arches harder in the face. Fortunately, this match was short. The right guy won, but I'd like the Razor to be totally defeated and crushed Backlund rather than win by a small package from nothing. <br /> <br /> Tag Team Champion Match: Ted Dibiase and IRS (Champs)) against Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake w / Jimmy Hart I would still like to know the full story about what happened in Hogan's eyes. Oh good. The crowd was really involved in this game, but had no flow in it. Hogan and Beefcake were clearly suffering from ring rust as both wrestlers had been on the bench for at least a year. Dibiase, being the great technical wrestler he was, helped bring the game from being a complete waste. The finale was a surprise with Dibiase and IRS who won the DQ victory. But to satisfy the crowd, Hogan and Beefcake did their usual game to the crowd eventually as if they had won the game. <br /> <br /> Lex Luger vs. Mr. Perfect: The best part of this game was the four hot chicks that accompanied Lex Luger in the ring. Apart from that, this was completely forgettable. Mr. Perfect's makeup was born for a role in the heel and he lacked warmth like a face. And Luger is just a waste of time, no matter what trick it is. Luger wins thanks to a slip, despite the fact that Perfect's feet were on the ropes. Then Perfect spends the meeting after kicking his butt. The first Luger hits him with his elbow running. Then, when Perfect regains consciousness, he returns to the locker room to find Luger just to get the shot from Shawn Michaels, creating an HBK / Perfect feud that has the potential to be a classic but the WWF has abused. <Br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzales: ABSOLUTE CRAP !! What was the thought of the WWF that involved a horrible wrestler like Giant Gonzales. Of course he had the size, but I'd rather see the Brooklyn Brawler in a game than he was. It is not even worth commenting. <br /> <br /> WWF CHAMPIONSHIP CHAMPIONSHIP: Bret Hart (champion) vs. Yokozuna (challenger) You have one of the greatest technical wrestlers of all time against a guy who is only one advantage is that he is a giant ass of lard. Bret was able to bring the game, but a rather predictable ending with Mr. Fuji jumping in the face of Bret. <br /> <br /> POST MATCH: Yokozuna versus Hulk Hogan Pure shit right here. Hogan goes into the ring for no apparent reason and Mr. Fuji challenges him to a game after Yoko has just won the title. Even the die-hard Hulkamaniacs find this to be a total BS.
