I have to be honest and admit that this film has done practically nothing for me, but it completely blasted me. It is burdened by a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women, who then connect to the discovery of a body over 40 years old. The story never seems to make much sense, especially when Robicheaux (played by Tommy Lee Jones) begins his conversations with Confederate General John Bell Hood (I never understood it). Jones was OK in his role, although I thought he was really starting to show his age here. Horribly miscast was John Goodman in the role of Julie "Baby Feet" Balboni, which I imagine is some kind of local mafia character. I just didn't think Goodman worked in this role, although I admit it might just be because I'm not a big John Goodman fan. Somewhere in the mix Justina Machado appeared as an FBI agent, although I never really understood what the FBI was involved with, which could simply mean that my attention kept wandering off the screen. If it was explained, however, I missed it completely. Fortunately, this is a fairly short film, so don't waste too much of your life on it. 2/10
