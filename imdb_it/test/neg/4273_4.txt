This is a big disappointment. The main problem is acting. Sylvestre le Touzel is rather poor like Fanny, and the rest is not much better, everyone is very pungent and unnatural. Also the camcorder is very 80s, for example cramps and nervous, for example of the P & P of 1995, for example. <br /> <br /> The script is, if ever too true to the book, and there are some deserving expressions that should have been cut. <br /> <br /> In any case this is far inferior to the recent film version, which although it took enormous liberties with the book, seemed much more faithful to the spirit of the book and was much more pleasant.
