Directed and written by the famous / notorious Edward D. Wood Jr, using a pseudonym (Daniel Davis) who plays the lead role of Glen / Glenda. This is an almost radical documentary on transvestism; Wood himself is a transvestite with a fetish for angora sweaters. It looks like miles of archive material and an inconsistent Bela Lugosi is used to stretch this strange and awkward film to 67 minutes. The police inspector (Lyle Talbot) seeks enlightenment from a psychiatrist, Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell), to better understand the emotional and the arrangement of the transvestites. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast: Delores Fuller, "Tommy" Hanes, Captain DeZita and Wood's sister, Evelyn. Of note: Farrell also acts as a narrator. And later Fuller helped write songs included in the films of Elvis Presley BLUE HAWAII, KISSIN 'COUSINS and KID GALAHAD.
