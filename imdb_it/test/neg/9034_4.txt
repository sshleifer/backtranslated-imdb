Marked for Death (1990) devotes more time to action sequences, rather than focusing on his characters. After his first two impressive efforts, Above the Law (1988) and Hard to Kill (1989), this third image by Steven Seagal makes clear the idea: anyone who opposes him should look crazy; the bad guys are there just to make it look good. <br /> <br /> Seagal was building permanently an audience that seemed a little bigger than those that follow the antics of Chuck Norris or Jean Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> In Marked for Death, Seagal sets aside any style claims and aims for full exploitation. This film contains a lot of graphic violence, gore and nudity that seem to be there for no reason other than to please the noisy viewers, who are unable to distinguish between action images that tell a story and those that simply spill out onto the chills without rhyme or reason. And he deserves a real fault for this failure of taste as a producer of "Marked for Death". <br /> <br /> Seagal plays John Hatcher, a retired DEA agent who returns to Chicago, where his family is attacked by a Jamaican street gang, which attacks his sister's house, and the film proves that he does not he is picky when Hatcher's niece (Danielle Harris) is shot in the crossfire. Hatcher gets angry and decides to collaborate with his old friend, Max (Keith David), a school gym teacher, and Charles (Tom Wright), a Jamaican policeman. <br /> <br /> Of course, Hatcher declares war on the leader of the villains, a Jamaican voodoo priest, called Screwface (Basil Wallace), a nickname that apparently means "outrageous outrage". <br /> <br /> And it is almost unbelievable in the way that Seagal chooses the various members of the band: it makes a boy's eyeball go out, a boy's back is broken and many arms and limbs are broken. <br /> <br /> All the logic for this film is thrown out of the window ... through the glass, that is. Why are Hatcher and friends not being charged for all damage to the properties they cause or the number of bodies that accumulate? And how did they get their auto-hideout from Illinois to Jamaica by plane without being discovered? <br /> <br /> Seagal has a stoicism of Clint Eastwood about him that the fans seemed to enjoy, and despite the three different characters he starred in all the movies, each dress in an oriental black robe and wearing a ponytail. One of the problems I have with some Seagal movies is that the main characters never seem to be in serious danger, and since it's the star, of course, nobody can give them a glove, except the villain. <br /> <br /> Seagal's heroes are all interchangeable, as are most lines and action sequences. Regardless of whether you are masquerading as a ship cook, a firefighter or a police officer of the L.A. wearing pearls of love, Seagal is always Seagal, which is exactly what his fans want. In fact, the similarity of these films is such that, if I wanted to, I could take an old review, change the names and have a reasonably accurate view of the new film. Not that I'd ever really do that ...
