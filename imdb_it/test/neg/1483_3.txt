One of those movies where you bet on who will die first and who will survive the end. There was only something in the film that got me excluded. I think because I keep looking back and thinking "yes still in that tree ... still looking at the water". Poor character development. I didn't feel anything when they were in danger. I was voting for the croc. I found it difficult to believe that a crocodile would try to overturn a boat in the first place and then, when it jumps on the boat, I find it really unlikely. Sometimes the croc seems too supernatural ("everything knows everything"). Even when the crocodile attacks his behavior seems very unrealistic. It is a killing machine and would not allow victims to escape two or three times in a row, especially when they attack in the water.
