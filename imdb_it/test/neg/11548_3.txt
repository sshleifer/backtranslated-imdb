This unintentionally funny mid-eighties TV movie is based on the premise that the sex bomb Donna Mills (in a mostly scary wardrobe) is a neglected housewife, yearning for her sexy past as a cheerleader. She escapes her empty life by fantasizing about casual sexual encounters with one of the many attractive men she meets, finally abandoning her fantasies and abandoning herself a little to the side, even if all she really wants is to rekindle the flames of passion with her husband boring James Brolin. <br /> <br /> There are many laughable aspects to this film, Mills's first foray into co-production (later, after his departure from Knots Landing, he found great success as a trash queen of TV movies mainly played during the melodramas of the end of most of the 1990s - he was usually a victim of some sort, clearly determined to wash his hands of the wonderfully evil and amusing connivant who had played Knots for so long. The funniest fantasy sequences are filmed as if they were destined for soft-core porn (wind and smoke machines, backlight, porn music), but since this is a movie for network TV, the scenes are all chaste and in the end not very sexy at all. The funniest (and bizarre) scene has Mills taking a walk on the wild side of the center among the punk-haired punks (complete with Robert Palmer's soundtrack). <br /> <br /> Less laughable is the terrible dialogue that the cardboard characters are forced to pronounce (to pity Cicely Tyson as a compulsory psychoanalyst, or Veronica Cartwright as the best obligatory friend, or even pre-Babs James Brolin with that kind of day soap of tight anger.) <br /> <br /> Of course, as in all these films, we learn that all problems can be solved through psychotherapy and then the film simply becomes silly, while we briefly explore the reasons of the "shocking" behavior of Mills (as if it could not be just that she wants a good fuck!) <br /> <br /> Emptiness.
