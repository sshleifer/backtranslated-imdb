Supercraptastic slasher rate, which feels too long at 80 minutes. Years ago, a group of "gypsies" who lived in the caves of a mountain, had been burned in a forest fire. Years later, campers are disappearing from the fire area. Obviously, a group of horny kids is heading to this area for a very weak camping trip. Despite a wicked welcome by the ranger (Jackson Bostwick) the children approach the mountain in any way. In a short time, the children start getting caught by the monster, which remains invisible until the end of the film, probably because the trick was so embarrassingly bad. No surprise to talk about: they are killed in the exact order that the formula for these films imposes, leaving the "final girl" to look after herself, even if in a pleasantly negative ending, the last girl ends up imprisoned and impregnated by the monster . <br /> <br /> The story itself does not hold the weight of the length of the feature, so it was completed by seemingly endless shots of wild animals and insects, which were obviously shot for another film and inserted here randomly as a means of making the movie long enough for a video version. On the plus side, the naturalistic movie is quite nice. Highlights include Bostwick speaking to a baby deer, a decent sequence of death for rock climbing, OK gore, and the great Jackie Coogan in his latest film role, as the clumsy local sheriff. He is very different from Charlie Chaplin, but it was still nice to see him. This is only for slasher completers.
