First of all let me start with the obvious: anti-Semitism has been a serious problem throughout history, present in many societies and the cause of the death of millions of Jews. That being said, the problem with this film is that it sees the United States - probably the most welcoming society ever to Jews outside of Israel - as a place not very different from Nazi Germany. Set in 1943, the film is about a man (William H. Macy) who mingles with a Jew after he starts wearing glasses! A number of very bad things happen to him later (he loses his job and cannot find a new one, his neighbors avoid him, all ending in a violent confrontation). From one of Arthur Miller's compassionate and paternalistic novels, the kind that gave liberalism a bad name.
