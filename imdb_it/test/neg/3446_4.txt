I like watching Robert Forster. This was the main reason I rented this movie. I also wanted to see a story set in the middle of nowhere, where the characters could work with each other very well without distractions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunitaly I found the film opaque. I couldn't be interested in the characters. I couldn't get interested in the story that seemed to wander anywhere. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie for an hour I turned it off. I will evaluate the film 4 out of 10. This falls well below the mandatory grade 7 which makes a film worth seeing.
