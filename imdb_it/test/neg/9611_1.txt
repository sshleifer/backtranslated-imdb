What happened to the shows with joint parental figures? Parents in this show are almost as irresponsible as children. Instead of punishing the younger child for being manipulators, they let her go away with murder. They can never agree on a course of action when it comes to dealing with children, and instead they do nothing. Yes, excellent plan. It simply ignores their behavior because they are "nice". This show tells pre-adolescent manipulators who observe that the "divide et impera" technique is the best way to "dig" their parents. Older children are constantly mad and find themselves in any kind of impossible situation, but there are no consequences for their actions. Yes, great television, that's fine.
