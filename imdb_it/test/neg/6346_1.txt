I'm not sure who should be blamed for this debacle - actually, acting is not so bad and the story is not as terrible as some Disney-made movies were. The story itself is superficial and undeveloped, but it is not surprising in a film of this type. The acting is more than a bit two-dimensional, but I give credit to the actors for having been able to do anything with the material they had to work with. <br /> <br /> However, in my book it is unforgivable to base an entire plot on the theory of having created a "perfect" pop star and then to launch an actress who can't sing to save her life. If the girl can't sing, someone can record the music! <br /> <br /> This actress is a TERRIBLE singer - she was so flat that she usually sang in a totally different key!
