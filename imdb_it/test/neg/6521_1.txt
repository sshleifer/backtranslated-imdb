This film is by far the worst film ever, the plot is weak and never shows what happens to people after the 20 have been left in their hands. This really makes me sick. It drags back and forth without any meaning, very boring. The only positive thing was the cast, WOW, many very successful actors and actresses. But beyond that it was horrible, terrible and repulsive, do yourself a favor, don't look at it. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 1 out of 10
