I just took this film on TCM and I can understand why George Murphy went into politics if this was the best MGM he could serve. It is so slow that the attempt to make a real film noir does not come out. There were two of my favorite <br /> <br /> players from Eve Arden (completely wasted) and Dean Stockwell (the best actor in the film), but what struck me was that the main character Frances Gifford had about 90 minutes (seemed longer!) without changing the expression on his face - his unconscious scene was comic. John Hodiak played his role correctly, but the script allowed him and the rest of the cast to get very sick. I gave 4 stars mainly because of photography. It would have been in the first half of the program when the dual features were the go.
