This film tried, but in the end it was a waste of talent. He tried to be "sexy". I'm not putting down the works of actresses like Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson (who will find something besides TV's "Le Femme Nikita" worthy of her talent). I didn't find it, even in the so-called almost seduction scene with Mrs. Barkin, any real emotion, even though I know the actors tried very hard to make the scene work. If the sexual elements of Wilson's disturbed sex victim didn't touch our heart (which he didn't even have for an end he didn't deserve), not even the homicidal element of the plot. Maybe it was the script or maybe the director, but I didn't feel for anyone in this film, and without this feeling, a movie doesn't work for me. If you are interested in a film about lesbianism, there are at least two films on both sides of the specturum to check: 1.) The gulity pleasure of "Bound" that works well in a noir environment; and 2.) The most honest and touching story of a lesbian raised in Hell's Kitchen called "All Over Me". It is a well-defined indie since the mid-1990s that deals with the problem of maturity with feeling, not forced sexuality. Both would be a better rent than "Mercy" which has almost nothing.
