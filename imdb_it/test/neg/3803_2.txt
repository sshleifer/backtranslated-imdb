I accidentally took this in the middle of launching the channels. I immediately recognized almost everyone in the cast, cutting "groovy" apart, and wondered what kind of film could attract such a big cast of stars from the past and the future? Not having seen the original, I imagined that it could be the Poseidon adventure, since it was evidently on a ship in danger. I was wrong! I cannot imagine for the life of me why none of these actors (or promising) actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with such garbage. There is no story, the performances all seem forced, the characters are a parody of the usual roles of a catastrophic film that are suddenly brought together by an event and begin to pontificate about the true meaning of life at the level of the bumper philosophy. <Br /> <br /> It is worth only seeing the unusually horrible performances of greats like Sally Field, Michael Caine and others. They must have needed bad money. Can we blame the director?
