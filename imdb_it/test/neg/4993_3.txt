Rise of the Undead begins as a huge nuclear-type explosion that runs through an unnamed American city, some people survive in a building by leaning against the door so as to remain closed and keep out the wickedness (!). They discuss among themselves for years, then a monstrous thing comes from nowhere apparently and starts killing them one at a time ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Jason Horton and Shannon Hubbell one has to say Rise of the Undead is terrible. The script takes it very seriously, but it makes little sense, the first thing I asked myself is if there is this huge nuclear explosion that is happening outside destroying the whole city, why are these people I am looking at still alive? Why is the building in which they are still standing? Then I wondered when something was going to happen, the first 20 minutes are set in a room, actually a bit more generous is a corridor as the protagonists claim. Then it turns into a Return of the Dead (1985) scam with a government-created virus that turns people into zombies before one of the most abrupt, unnecessary and seemingly random twists I've ever witnessed, which makes the most of what has just happened is a complete waste of time. Then for the last 30 minutes odd Rise of the Undead turns into something weird kind of science fiction as something that looks like a ball of energy floating around killing everyone, it's just me asking what this floating energy ball is and where has arrived since? Going back to what was happening out again what was the reason? Oh, it's true, we are never told Rise of the Undead is a mess, the characters are horrible and they don't even have a name, the halfway turn will make you tear your hair out of frustration, the dialogue sucks, it doesn't come explained nothing and there is practically no story here. The last 10 minutes (maybe a little longer) of Rise of the Undead do not present dialogues and the film ends suddenly. <br /> <br /> Director Horton and Hubbell were obviously working on a low budget, the whole movie is set in about two rooms and three corridors! The photograph is horrible, they use the annoying color filters seemingly at random and sometimes it seems that Rise of the Undead was shot on a video camera. There are no special effects, there is some fake blood sprayed around but no real trick to talk about. There are some CGI shots of the city that are wrapped in flames that look good, but the floating sphere of the energy creature looks terrible. There is a disconcerting moment when two people are sitting against a corridor wall and talking, for some strange reason, their heads are cut off at the top of the screen! They only see their lower bodies from the neck down, but nothing else is happening in the frame, they don't move and there's nothing else, but for some strange reason their heads are cut out of the frame while they talk to each other! It's really a strange thing to watch. <br /> <br /> With a very low budget of around $ 10,000 and according to IMDb filming in two weeks I have to congratulate the creators for finishing Rise of the Undead and distributing it but that's where my congratulations stop because otherwise this one has some terrible production values ​​and is set in about three corridors located somewhere in New Orleans, Louisiana, where Rise of the Undead was filmed. Acting sucks so I won't dwell on it. <br /> <br /> Rise of the Undead sucks, it sounds like a zombie movie but in all honesty it isn't, everything is submarine and I know the filmmakers were working on a low budget but it's not an excuse for that that concerns me. Definitely not recommended.
