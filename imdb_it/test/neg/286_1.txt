I had high hopes of entering this film. After all, Ocean's 11 was a truly exceptional Hollywood product. His rapid fire, the incredible power of the stars and the tight script made him one of the funniest caper movies I've ever seen. Of course, with all the money he earned, a sequel was coming, and I, for example, was excited. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I was really amazed by this movie. Frightened by how horribly the wrong things can go. This film had everything for him; the return of all the original cast, the director himself, the news of crazy adventures on and off-set. How could it have gone so badly? <br /> <br /> Start immediately with one of the most awkward and useless opening sequences ever and from there go down. After a series of rather silly short scenes between Pitt / Zeta-Jones and Clooney / Roberts, the film spends several minutes watching Andy Garcia waltz from scene to scene, telling every single member of Danny Ocean's original eleven that he wants the his money back. Believe me when I say that these scenes are only here to stop Andy Garcia's running time, because without these ridiculously embarrassing shots, his screen time would be GOOD under five minutes. <br /> <br /> This brings me to another great qualm I had with this movie. The rhythm is so irregular that the characters are completely eliminated from the story, and only sometimes are reported later. The character of Bernie Mac was removed from the script at the beginning and never returns except for two short scenes without dialogue. Garcia appears for the first few minutes and returns for an exceptionally short scene at the end. Roberts shows up for about 5 minutes at the beginning and is not even mentioned until about 20-25 minutes are left. Even Clooney himself spends a large part of the film in prison. <br /> <br /> It would be all excusable if the movie was fun. Not at all. 90% of jokes are completely flat and those that work deserve a laugh. The "plot" is undeniably worthless and made me feel cheated. At some point in the film, the team takes on a job worth $ 2.5 million of the nearly $ 100 million they have to collect before Garcia's two-week deadline. Several characters even recognize how absurd it is to waste time doing this job, but they do it anyway! Over 30 minutes of the film revolve around this work that they shouldn't even do, and one gets the feeling that this part of the plot was simply added to cope with the execution time. Furthermore, the equipment they use to pull this job CLEARLY costs millions and millions of dollars to finance. Just wait to see what they do to do this job and realize that it would cost a lot more than $ 2.5 million to spend. Obviously, because of this, they have to do various jobs to earn money. The beauty of the first film was the only big scam and how ingeniously and intricately it was pulled out. Here, they pull so many jobs, in so many different ways, that they rush through all of them because explaining them would make the film for several hours. <br /> <br /> We all know that we walk in this film that will be a great turning point in the end. So is the nature of the caper film. The turn at the end of Ocean's Twelve made me laugh; not because it was fun, but because I couldn't believe how foolish I felt. I will not give it away, because I know that many of you will be so foolish as to throw the money down to see this movie anyway. <br /> <br /> What I will say is that it makes most of the 2 hours you've already been completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled to see this movie, after having absolutely adored Ocean's 11. I left the theater feeling like I was the victim of a real cast by a scammer and the crew of this movie led me to to think that this film would have been worth watching. I've never given a 1 to a movie on IMDb.com, but there is a first time for everything. Consider yourself warned ... 1/10
