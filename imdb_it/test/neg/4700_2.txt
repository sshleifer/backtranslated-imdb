It seems incredible that the same decade that brought Star Wars to the silver screen disgusted this inexpressible tripe like this and many other "adventure" movies. I am reminded of the equally saccharine "Ashanti" outlined elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Any motivated A-list actor who signs up for such celluloid waste is frankly beyond this writer. They must have been very, very desperate. To be perfectly honest, Roger Moore's appearance in every movie is the kiss of death. Although extremely handsome in his youth, his entire acting career was based on his ability to raise an eyebrow. Every emotion from A to B is transmitted by this simple trick. His were James Bond's dog days. Lee Marvin, on the other hand, has participated in some very deserving releases, perhaps the most memorable "Paint Your Wagon" and "The Dirty Dozen". He has a vein of comics, but he's much better when he plays it straight. <br /> <br /> The excellent Ian Holm is a haggard film, barely recognizable as a dumb African. All others showed up for their checks. <br /> <br /> The only plausible and watchable element is the German cruiser. It looks like a very large model. But it is credibly massive and looks authentic - as does its crew. The rest is not even hokum. The childish comedy is full of brutality and violence in a story that goes awkwardly, as if the script had had too many tears of Lee Marvin's gin. Here is a director who simply does not know where he is going. There are hints of "The African Queen", a tear of "The Pride & The Passion", "Gold" and one or two other film rip-offs that the titles don't immediately come to mind. <br /> Strangely, I saw it 3 times, every time it was shown on television when I was put to bed with a cold or the flu. Perhaps this affects my judgment - but not much. <br /> <br /> Compare it with any Indiana Jones movie and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> I gave him two stars; one for the battleship and the other because it finally ends, even if the sky knows that it takes enough time to do it. <br /> <br /> Time for another Lemsip, I think.
