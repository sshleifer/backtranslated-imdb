Bloody birthday opens on a shot of Meadowvale General Hospital. There three children are born at exactly the same time during a total eclipse. A caption informs us that it is now "Meadowvale, California, June 1, 1980". Two teenage lovers, Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Annie Smith (Erica Hope) are working on an open grave. They hear noises and Duke investigates. Both Duke and Annie are killed. Sheriff Jim Brody (Bert Kramer) is baffled and has only the handle of a skipping rope from a child Annie was holding as a clue. Unfortunately before Sheriff Brody manages to solve the case, his youngest daughter, Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and two of her friends Curtis Taylor (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) and Steven Seton (Andy Freeman) kill him. Just as Sheriff Brody is finishing up by another young man in their class called Timmy Russel (K.C. Martel), the three murderers are not aware of what he saw. Shortly after the incident Timmy plays with Steven and Curtis in a landfill. Curtis locks Timmy in an old locker. Timmy manages to escape and tell his sister Joyce (Lori Lethin), but she doesn't believe him at first. The three children continue their murder. Their strict teacher Miss Davis (Susan Strasberg), a couple of lovers (John Avery and Sylvia Wright) in a van and Debbie's older sister, Beverly (Julie Brown) are among their victims. Joyce starts having her suspicions about Debbie, Curtis and Steven that makes her and Timmy a target for the evil trio. Will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent 10-year-old kids are really soulless killers? <br /> <br /> Co-written and directed by Ed Hunt I have an intense aversion to this film. I think it's absolutely horrible and doesn't look nice at 83 minutes. The script by Hunt and Barry Pearson gives us no explanation for the motivations of the murderous children beyond the solar eclipse that blocks Saturn and therefore for some bizarre astrological reason these three children have no consciousness, so these are the only children ever born during a total eclipse? If it is true why do they wait until just before their tenth birthday before starting their murderous madness? I guess you suddenly kick in, right? To his credit it is quite reasonable, but I found it incredibly boring and boring to sit. The film as a whole is very little exciting and predictable, the children are revealed as the killers within the first 10 minutes and as I mentioned below no reason is given. It's also very silly at times. Take a look at the scene where Debbie stops Steven throwing a bowl of water at him! The death of the sheriff is put down by him, going down a few steps, yes the very wounds suffered by that type of accident will not be the same as those who have been beaten to death with a baseball bat as in reality, any competent doctor or pathologist he would have identified it within 5 seconds. There is not a single drop of blood spilled throughout the film and all lame murders are boring and unimaginative. There is a bit of nudity outside the place that Debbie charges 25c to get the boys peek while her sister Beverly strips. There's an early scene right after the 5 minute mark when Joyce goes from the kitchen to the living room and the boom microphone is clearly visible at the top of the screen, and not even a little of all this damn deal. The general incompetence continues throughout the film. The entire production is insignificant and immediately forgettable. The acting is mediocre, those three guys are very annoying and they gave me nerves from the beginning and I made this film go even further than a job, especially Curtis with his glasses too big and brilliant. I really hate this movie, it's simple. I can't think of one good thing to say about it. Definitely one to avoid.
