This is a poor biography of a black and white minstrel star, a Dixie Boy Johnson. I don't know if this person ever really existed, I don't know, but considering the cast lists a certain "Lee Lasses White" and Roscoe Karns who also plays the character, I assume that the man existed and that this is a washed white ( sorry for the pun) of his career. The plot, as it is, follows Dixie Boy from career peaks to depression to the death of his wife during childbirth, his abandonment of his child to his friends, his return to his daughter's sixteenth birthday and his stage debut for reconciliation. Another forgotten man, Benny Fields, plays Dixie Boy. The man has a beautiful baritone voice but no acting talent and is a boring lump on the screen. Gladys George does his best to make the work come alive without success. Judy Clark does the best Betty Hutton imitation I've ever seen, though I think she thought she was herself. The score full of many musical numbers for his short 70-minute playing time earned him a well-deserved Oscar nom. It's worth a look.
