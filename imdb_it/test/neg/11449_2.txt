The topic was good, the management was OK. Mohanlal was efficient in his role as a major. The acting of the secondary actors was at most amateurish. The casting director and director should be held accountable for this debacle. Hawaldar Jai was terrible, he distinguished himself as a sore thumb with his poor histrionics. He didn't look the part or move like a soldier. There was a scene where a satellite feed of the skirmish with the militants was required and they were showing it from a camera angle. The satellite is hundreds of miles in the sky, so the only angle is from above. It was a pretty awkward moment. These days readers are mature and recognize when trying to pull wool over their eyes. The director is a major so the story could be out of his personal experiences. No problem, but the film is only as good as its actors and directors. So if Major Ravi is going for other projects he should pay more attention to the casting.
