A woman who deals with art starts having a passionate love affair with a man named John. They make love wherever they go and play sexual games. The problem I had was all they did. There was no plot for this movie or I just didn't see it. Erotic passion was the best thing about this movie, but I wanted something else to happen. Maybe he could have been a serial killer or he could have had a secret. I just needed something and all there was was a lot of love scenes. It's not that it was ugly or anything, I just wanted more to happen in the film. Perhaps even a colleague was sleeping with him. Nothing! I was very upset that this was all there was. Mickey Rourke was so hot at the time. I wonder what happened.
