The Boston Blackie films have some strengths, especially as the pace is fast and the hero is cheerfully annoyed even in the worst circumstances. But the plot is often atrocious, and the relentless comics often kill the rhythm (if the plot seems to be uncharacteristically good) or are just funny and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> This involves the Blackie who chases a fugitive from the kindergarten (Steve Cochran in a really mediocre performance) that is set on the beautiful Nina Foch (who does a pretty fine acting job). Inspector Farraday, of course, believes that Blackie has become a homicidal maniac (at least he has some evidence for that), and he is incomplete trying to imprison him while Blackie chases the real murderer. The plot has possibilities, but whenever real tension occurs, we have a non-entertaining comic routine. It does not seem that anyone at Columbia has realized that, in a film about finding a really dangerous maniac, the small and comic scenes of comedy that hide an awkward body from the inspector interrupt any voluntary suspension of disbelief. (One concludes that our brilliant hero is an idiot - deadly for a film like this.) <br /> <br /> This is not worth the time. For a well-traced episode of this series, see Alias ​​Boston Blackie.
