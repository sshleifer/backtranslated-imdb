The width and height of the scale of this film overwhelm me. About a week ago I published a commentary on the silent episode of 1926, MACISTE IN HELL, which referred to it as "staggering". Then I met the Pollonia Bros. BLOOD RED PLANET. Wow ... <br /> <br /> It's all about the scale of thinking behind it. Pollonia Bros. and colleague John McBride were thinking so big that the reflections of Arthur C. Clark and Stanley Kubrick of 2001: A SPACE ODESSEY are fortunate that he was released thirty-two years before this boyfriend. In fact, Kubrick had it easy with pattern makers, a budget, real actors and the studio's main support for his little repudiation of "Star Trek", and all Arthur C. Clarke had to do was write that damn thing. What's so hard about going around a typewriter? On the other hand the Pollonia brothers had to think radically, outside the box and in a hurry. They recruited half a dozen of their friends and colleagues - including a beautiful girl - they bought a bunch of colored light bulbs, broke into the dumps of office supplies for every keyboard, monitor and headset of the hands-free phone they found , they all identified black turtlenecks, made with every tin for cakes in the county, they learned enough 3D modeling and skinning to animate a couple of space flights, spent a couple of hours playing a script, performed what is easily the scariest monster of the space from that terrible little monster that Jabba the Hut brought with him was fried by R2D2, spent literally days working with a VHS camera and an Amiga to shoot and edit their film, and they came out winners. This is the best D.I.Y. direct home video fan epic movie space I've ever seen, and in proportion to the amount of talent and resources available to dwarven directors also LOGANS RUN or BATTLESTAR: GALACTICA (the original series) as a chilling look to our future, up to a journalist wearing a mismatched and unsuitable second-hand suit. As a species, we are doomed. <br /> <br /> Seriously for a minute, though, it's a great improvement on subsequent epics like THE DINOSAUR CHRONICALS or PREYALIEN: ALIEN PREDATORS, which is fun since one of those masterpieces was first made. Somewhere along the lines, Pollonia has begun to take it easy: this film is run with a certain conviction that makes you believe you can really breathe in a vacuum wearing a dust mask and two bottles of motorcycle stencils. And the scene in which the alien beast consumes a member of the miniaturized crew immediately made me think of where I had seen it before: GODZILLA VS. THE MONTH OF THE SEA, where the giant unleashed monster scares two canoeists and eats them on the camera. This made me cry when I was a child. <br /> <br /> It made me cry as an adult because here I am wasting my time trying to be a sort of critic, writer or writer / critic and these guys are having fun, making a real science fiction feature with lots of colored lights, a hot chick and a sliding talking projector called KAL. One of the flight crew members even brings the black space baseball cap backwards and glistens with his goatee like that Metallica clown. Should this be a joke? No. It is an epic statement about humanity, humanity and humanity that deserves to be seen by anyone with the ability not to take them too seriously. Look for it on a 2-disc set called GALAXY OF TERROR in your favorite discount retailer's DVD clipping box, which is probably where it belongs, but how many of us can say "Yes, they have a couple of our movie boxes for sale at Best Buy. "<br /> <br /> 4/10: Anyone with no sense of humor may want to try SILENT RUNNING or maybe TRON. But one day an alien civilization on the other side of the galaxy will intercept a broadcast of this film and decide that we really shouldn't be messed up. Good work, guys !!
