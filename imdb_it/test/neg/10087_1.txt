This is by far the most stupid, idiotic, insanely stupid show that has ever been on the air, and this comes from someone who remembers "San Pedro Beach Bums". <br /> <br /> My wife loves watching reality shows - and there was an episode of this drivel in which aspirants had to develop a "walk". The final result came directly from Monty Python's sketch "Ministry of Silly Walks". I couldn't laugh hard enough. <br /> <br /> And then there's the omnipresent Mrs Banks (as in laughing until ...). She must be the most annoying and boring woman on TV since Rosie O'Donnell left "The View". As if modeling were doing great things for humanity. Please. I've never found her attractive, and I don't find her smart now that she has the temerity to open her mouth. <br /> <br /> Someone has to tell these human hangers to eat a healthy diet and they actually look like real women.
