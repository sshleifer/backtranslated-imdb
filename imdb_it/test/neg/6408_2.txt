Not just because of that theme in the film. Which was an excuse for something reminiscent of the plot. No. <br /> <br /> I saw this, knowing I wouldn't like it. I HATE numerology. Whenever someone starts talking about models with numbers, I feel the urge to slap them. My brain starts to shake from empathy. And fully aware that this is a film just on that topic, I could not resist the urge to look at it and maybe have a good laugh. But it wasn't funny. Just exactly the stupid type of "Isn't it so scary yet incredibly beautiful?! I can turn any shit into 23!" dialogue of which I was afraid. As soon as the son started playing, I knew this movie is an asshole, no matter what happens. But I almost never stopped watching a movie that I started. I sat through it. I like pain. <br /> <br /> The film pretends to make fun of numerology under disguise to show how obsession can end badly. But ride that wave as much as it should crush it. I don't see that message. I only see people who are enthusiastic about a stupid number with a plot to justify. <br /> <br /> Find out with the usual "surprises" - try to give another turn to throw yourself out, that doesn't make sense, and you almost believe for the quality of the narration up to there - and you get an empty piece of creation of the film. This seems to be centered on the subject I disdain. If only he hadn't tried to be serious and rather had been a hilarious movie with actors I don't give a damn about. But I was starting to love Carrey ... while it's not his fault, he's trying. It's not even nice to watch it with a group of friends and run away from it all. <br /> <br /> My expectations were low enough for someone to stumble over them, but this film managed to live up to the worst I've ever seen.
