I saw this movie on TV yesterday. I had just finished reading the book in which the film was apparently based. In the opening credits he said "This is a free adaptation of the novel by Eça de Queirós". I should have turned off the TV at the time. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​"free adaptation" of Vera Sacramento is turning a story about the Church's influence on people and the hypocrisy of people who claim morality in the late nineteenth century in a story about sex . In fact, the only thing he adopted from the novel was the part of sex, which was only slightly mentioned in the novel by Eça de Queirós. And, of course, the name of some characters. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, in the novel, Amélia and João Eduardo were victims of the influence of the church. Amelia was seduced by Father Amaro and was controlled by him all the time. João Eduardo, her fiancé, was excommunicated by the priests, because he dared to criticize them. In this film, Amélia seduces everyone she meets and Father Amaro is just another victim. João Eduardo is a trafficker in illegal drugs and weapons. <br /> <br /> Vera Sacramento transformed a novel that criticized the moral customs of an era and transformed it into another film with lots of (bad) sex. Worse still, his story was completely devoid of ideas. Two hours wasted! Eça de Queirós certainly did not deserve it.
