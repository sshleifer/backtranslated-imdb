absolutely useless ... having been there, I have to say that with the subject in question I have to say that it captures the club atmosphere without any respect. He could have done it if the characters weren't just mouthpieces for a terrible and unrealistic infringement. So many worthy scenes that would have shamed The Office (not a compliment for this film). It could also have contributed to having a semblance of a story, a point, a message, a comment, anything. Seriously, Kevin & Perry Go Large have had more to say about the subject than this film (a term used very freely in this case). There should be negative numbers reserved for films like this. -10 (extra turd)
