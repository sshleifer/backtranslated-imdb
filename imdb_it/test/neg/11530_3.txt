Badly written conversations, badly modified, clumsy, flat characters, failed adaptation of a novel. It's not much worse. A decent acting and a good popcorn saved me for an hour and a half - I felt more than three hours - of boredom. Occasional very good jokes. <br /> <br /> David is a dull young man who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. He puts his trust in a mumbo jumbo video of Chinese philosophy, although this doesn't seem to have helped him much in real life. David is a member of a band of debt collectors, in which each member has an IQ below sea level. A missing script, along with non-creative shootings and even worse modifications, make what could have been a pretty funny episode of failed collection like a home reality show. <br /> <br /> David rents an apartment from a primary school teacher, Haraldur, who convinces David that he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in Iceland by dropping a couple of sentences about his importance. A seriously lacking script does not offer David anything to base his opinion on. A couple of scenes that showed Haraldur something that David could misinterpret would do the job. The potential of the film as a media, unlike the text of the book on which this film is based, is not exploited. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, David's connection with Haraldur increases his status within the debt collector gang, but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces David to show where his loyalty lies. <br /> <br /> The film's plot is fine, but then it is based on the book. This could have been a much better film. A good screenwriter could have done something about this material. Unfortunately, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> Acting is generally good. Pétur Jóhann is excellent and credible as David. Eggert Þorleifsson doesn't have much to work with, but he does his best with what little material he has. Ingvar Sigurðsson and Michael Imperioli (in a small role) manage well. <br /> <br /> General opinion: what could have been a funny and amusing film about an obscure anti-hero hero in a band of debt collectors, becomes a boring, poorly made film, made after a poor manuscript. Staring at your toes for an hour and a half would be more pleasant.
