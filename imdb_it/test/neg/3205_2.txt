This is a shame for the name of all the amiable and ridiculous saga of Critters. Because writers feel the need to make the film unbearable to look at with all quality standards. The Critters are cute and adorable as ever, but the deadly behavior has been transformed into that of a killer child. They are not so terrifying, gruesome, some of them ruthless and amusing as in previous films. I liked their hedgehog shots but now it's hidden as if it were meant to be repetitive and boring. And what is murder and not eating. I thought this movie would have been nice but everything was so wrong. Because Ug had to be evil and killed by what is known as Charlie. This movie hurts me. Shame! Shame! DISGRAAAAAAACE !!!!
