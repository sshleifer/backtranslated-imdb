I've never reviewed on IMDb but this documentary is so overrated that I felt compelled to let it go. I wouldn't even finish looking if I wasn't a guest at someone's home. The film was poor on many levels: first - the Treadwell movie was conceived. The more I looked, the more he seemed to act as a desperate person to be famous instead of acting out of conviction. <br /> <br /> Second: the others in the film, with the exception of Treadwell's parents and the airline pilot, were just as artificial and brave as he was. God, they looked artificial. Third: Treadwell's mission to protect bears does not even make sense, since it has done more damage than good by making bears accustomed to human presence. I think Treadwell really loved bears, but there's a lot of research that indicates his efforts have been misled. Sometimes we have to sacrifice our fun for wildlife to really help. <br /> <br /> Fourth: the value of the film's entertainment was not half that of other wildlife films such as "March of the Penguins" and "Winged Migration". The directors, in my opinion, have done a terrible job of sequencing scenes and have given little incentive to keep watching. <br /> <br /> As a person who loves Alaska, bears and other wildlife, I would like to see more people dedicated to the conservation of our wild lands. We hope their efforts will be less centered on people.
