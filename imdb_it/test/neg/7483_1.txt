I don't think I've ever given anything to 1/10, but this easily gets the denomination. I find it hard to just go through one of his lines. It's not just that the jokes are so ugly, but combining them with the fact that Carson Daily has zero charisma, it can't create or finish a punchline, and you have a late-night comic recipe that will really make your stomach spin. <br /> <br /> I have seen the show, never in its entirety, but many more times. It insinuates me just after Conan. I usually watch a minute or two just to see if Carson is still the worst talk show host ever. Actually, if you ever see him interviewing a guest, it's just that, an interview. I feel so sorry every time he has a guest and their confused smiles try to mask their screaming body language, "take me away from this strange monster!" I recommend watching the show, not for a laugh, but for meditation, how it went on the air and what it still does there. Look as much as possible, I think you'll find his complete clumsiness ... interesting.
