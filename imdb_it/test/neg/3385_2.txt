Wow, where do I start? After suffering for this miserable rent of $ 1.00 (thanks to LOT, Family Video) I had to make just a few comments. I didn't bother to write the names of the 3 actors in the film, but I hope you know who I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> A monster truck terrorizes the countryside and chases two college mates in their destiny. They meet a sexy girl wearing slutty clothes. I mean, it sounds great in theory. I was laughing hysterically at the DVD box as I accompanied her to the girl behind the video store counter. <br /> <br /> Acting: the sexy girl, played by Aimee Whatever, visibly laughs through many scenes where she should be scared. The other two main actors in the film, the grumpy fat guy and the vanilla guy are both terrible. The fat guy thinks he's Jack Black. He is not. The other actor, our hero, emulates emotions and loses all his signals and looks like a generic character you could see in a Nickelodeon movie about skateboarding in the early 90s. Look: I don't expect great shows in films like these, but at least the actors can make an effort not to be annoying. You can be an incompetent actor but still be pleasant (ie John Wayne). At least Aimee gal is attractive. <br /> <br /> Script: Holy ****, who thought this dialogue was fun? I would not have the courage to interpret it in front of my school acting class, much less to talk about it as a film script. Incredibly bad. More information on this later. <br /> <br /> Production: OK, this is the only place where the film is sure to succeed. The quality of production is incredibly high. The appearance of the film is very good. Apparently the only talented person who worked on the film was the director of photography. OK, here are my biggest flaws: 1) The guy driving the car never drives faster than 25 miles per hour. /> <br /> 2) The guy driving the car is in the countryside before realizing that there is a fat man with a mask in the back seat. He is supposedly meticulous in recording gas mileage and keeping his classic car in good condition but doesn't notice a 300-pound Jack Black imitator in the back? Come on. <br /> <br /> 4) The characters never change clothes. There are two hotel scenes. Presumably, the showers are available for our characters again during the 3 days in which this film takes place, none of the characters worries about changing their clothes. <br /> <br /> 5) Comedy. The carefree comedy and slapstick does not merge with horror. Period. You can't let our characters run away from a monster truck for a second and a second after verbally joining them with some light music / comedy. This type of rhythm virtually ruins any tension in the film. Movies like Evil Dead 2, which mix comedy and horror, understand that the tension can be relaxed but never completely eliminated with humor. Monster Man does not understand. <br /> <br /> I am irritated by the fact that what could have been a VERY funny horror film was ruined by a director who thought he was much smarter than he really was. Oh good.
