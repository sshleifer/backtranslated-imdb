I was invited to watch this film at a small screening of an art museum. I had no idea what to expect. At first I was optimistic about the opening credits to see Judd Nelson, Bill Paxton, Wayne Newton, James Cann, Rob Lowe and Lara-Flynn-Boyle. However, after some disturbing crude scenes (which did not contribute much to the progress of the story), this film quickly became a weapon of torture. The expedient of the texture of the rudimentary growing arm is never really developed. I patiently kept waiting for this movie to be cashed. In the end there was a small reward, but having to invest and sit through the endless, crude, sexually perverted, in-your-face, the drunken gore costs too much for me (even for a clear view). What were these established actors doing in this horrible movie? The art direction was very convincing and gruesome. At a minimum, it should only be a 75-minute movie. This is a film that Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld would have embraced.
