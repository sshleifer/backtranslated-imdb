This is nearing the worst movie I've ever seen. The writer puts you in touch with Jasper (Josh Hartnett). When he did absolutely nothing wrong, Sam (Leelee Sobiesky) left him for Kelley (Chris Klein), in a way that left you crazy about Sam. You are not allowed to enter into what you feel, so your feelings with Kelley are not real to you, and their relationship is bogus. It drags you in both directions, and becomes rather tiring and annoying. The only positive thing about this movie I saw was the cast. <br /> <br />
