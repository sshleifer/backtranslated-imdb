* THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILER ... OR MAYBE. NOTICE IS THE SAME FOR ALL * <br /> <br /> Dang it. Just when I thought SCIFI Channel had used all its ridiculous movie ideas, they gave us THIS. In reality, the plot itself is nothing that we have not seen in films like Snakes On A Plane, Deep Blue Sea, etc ... This means that a monster / animal / threat of some kind is lurking in a nearby environment that threatens a group of people. In this case, a foreigner in a train. Wow. <br /> <br /> I must say that when I first saw this thing on cable, I couldn't stop laughing. No SCIFI film had prepared me for this; he was so incredibly pathetic that I couldn't believe it! The actors are all a group of characters of a stereotypical genre. But since they are not so famous (to say the least), I didn't expect much from them. Except for Diamond Phillips. There are no comments there, but I think the boy was desperate to find a job. The problem was something called "special effects", horrible even by SCIFI channel standards. That model / toy made us believe that it was a real train (not to mention the model / toy helicopter, bigger than a train wagon), the meteor came HORIZONTALLY from space, the "child" alien (a puppet with socks, and I 't kiddin'), regular aliens who seemed pretty ugly ... while they were static; when they started to "move", it was terrible, the explosions (the terrorist exploded LITERALLY! And what about the exploded helicopter! ... And I'm not going to talk about that apocalyptic ending, at that time I didn't know whether to continue laughing or crying. If I remember correctly, I did both. <br /> <br /> It is an ideal film to have a good laugh, alone or with friends. But be careful! it's so ridiculous at so many levels ... and you need a lot of suspension of disbelief ...
