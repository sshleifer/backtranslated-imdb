LORD PROTECTOR is child's play, but for whose children? Obviously shot for television or STV, this amateur KRULL has several standard characters - a magician, an assassin, a warrior, a scientist - on the trail of something or other to defeat the Dark Forces that are about to be unleashed on their planet. Wrongly written, played and staged in California towns such as municipal parks and a ranch, LORD PROTECTOR has nothing to recommend, not even a waste of time. Jay Underwood is the only "name" actor, and most people, especially the intended five-year-old audience, are not likely to remember him from such ancient Disney stuff as NOT HUMAN HERE. An unnamed actor who plays a magician with a non-perfect silver wig plays it at least with his tongue firmly planted on his cheek, while those around him act as if they were in a theatrical production by KING LEAR. I was hoping at least for a decent action or a sequence of special effects. Alas, the action sequences are pathetically staged and the few special effects are those old-fashioned cartoon cardboard gags we saw in the fantasy films of the 50s and 60s, like THE MAGIC SWORD by Bert Gordon. The directors have planned a sequel that fortunately never arrived. Often, such low-cost Hollywood back-lot productions use a combination of legitimate actors and porn. I kept busy during the film's seemingly endless running time, trying to figure out what the place was in this. I didn't have much luck
