This is like a previous 1987 film "Masters of the Universe" based on the "He-man" comic. Basically, you have a great old world and for some reason have to have almost all the action of the film on modern earth. Well, I guess it's not the modern earth now and it's an ancient world now of strangeness and a lair of the good old days. Well, I guess I can understand why in fact they put almost the whole movie in modern times in this and that movie. To save money on costumes and sets. It is much easier to recreate what happens in the present of a strange world like that of Eternia in He-man or an ancient world with cults and strange pyramids, sacrifices and strange creatures that embrace you until death. This film is forgettable and not very funny, your first clue that it will not be the best film in the world is that there is Robert Z'Dar. The only thing this is doing is that animals are not as prevalent in this as they were in the last. Marc Singer is back and it is sad to see him in this state, the boy was a good actor reduced to trying to make a sequel to a film that he didn't really need, and even if he was five years late.
