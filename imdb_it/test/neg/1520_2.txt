Being a big fan of the cross-country series, I couldn't wait for this movie to come out. I was impatiently waiting for a laugh at the roller coaster ...... alas. <br /> <br /> Where do I start on this mess? I think it's a good start to say that his poor wealth and eddie on our screens, first of all, like none of the jokes and liners that they usually offer so well are fun. I was still waiting for the first laugh after a full 20 minutes of viewing. Many aspects of the story have been pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments that they felt and decided to leave the final cut. <br /> <br /> the sets and the atmosphere surrounding the film are dark and dirty which I suppose are good if they want to portray the 'terrible' guest house that the 2 buffoons try to run, but for me it's just a damper even higher in an unpleasant state of shooting that should never have been created. <br /> <br /> Acting is sometimes pathetic.Fellella Fielding is wasted like mad Mrs F oxfur and I've seen Simon Pegg make better releases. <br /> <br /> Council Paradise Guest House to anyone who is blind drunk because he might appreciate the terrible puns much more. But any basic fan who has not seen this movie and expects a real demand and eddie action has been warned
