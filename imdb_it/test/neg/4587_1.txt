This film enters my "Worst Films Ever Made" file. I have a copy of this movie that I watch when I want a good laugh, and this is not even a comedy. I'm disappointed that such great actors have agreed to be in such a piece of garbage. This film is inaccurate (in its interpretation of hockey), offensive (for Canadians), and I wasn't even very impressed with acting. The story was also a bit weak. If you've never seen this movie, you're in luck. If you have it, I'm sorry.
