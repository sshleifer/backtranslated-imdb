I've never been disappointed in a Kurosawa movie, but this is probably the first one. "Doppelganger" is the worst I've ever seen from this director. <br /> <br /> Tartan Films is publicizing it as "Kiyoshi Kurosawa's scariest movie". What? Kurosawa's most terrifying film is definitely "Kairo". And if you think this is horror, it surprises you. This cannot be classified as horror or thriller. This is a drama, and quite a bad one. A lot of the scenes that were supposed to be shocking turned out to be fun, and a lot of the plot is really confusing. And since it's Kurosawa, the pace is slow. But it's so slow that you'll lose interest for forty minutes, and you want to do something else. The thing that bothered me most was the use of CGI. Now the CGI, if used well, can be really beautiful. But if done with little care ... it can be a disaster. I think he describes a scene here that has a very minimal use of CGI. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can give "Dopppelganger" is that it has really good acting. Koji Yakusho offers a great performance, along with the rest of the cast. But it's almost everything ... <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor, and go look at "Kairo" or "Ko-Rei" if you want to be scared. This is a bad, bad attempt at a smart drama. Which is smart, but ... Well, they miss a lot. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for good acting.
