I went to this film full of hope. With so many capable and humorous actors directed by Sir Ben, I thought it would be a little pleasure. <br /> <br /> Oh, how I felt about munching my eyes as the credits flipped. That I had wasted 93 minutes of my life in this film that was clearly DOA. There are some real problems with this film and it will probably be easier to list them; 1. No kidding, I'm not particularly hard to please comically - high or low front - but there's really not a laugh in this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. Sir Ben mumbles through every single line if he is supposed to be drunk or not?!? 3. There is no effort to start, let alone develop the relationship between love interests in this. 2 randomly meeting people in the street will have more relationships immediately. <br /> <br /> 4. All the acting talent assembled is completely wasted. Don't be fooled by looking at this because of the names. <br /> <br /> 5. For a cold-blooded murderer he destroyed more people in Gandhi than this flaccid waste of time (about the dyed beard it looks really scary) I hoped it was a slow burner but in the end the only which could inject every life - and justice - in this is Frank pulling out his 9 and offering the entire cast from Tea and ending up with himself - I'm sorry it was so bad.
