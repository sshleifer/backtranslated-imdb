This is 1 hour and 24 minutes of pure boredom !! <br /> <br /> In this action movie, the gun used by Baldwin (HK G3A3) also sucks. It was sent for recycling by armed forces around the world in the mid-1980s, and is now used only by terrorists, bank robbers and military museums. <br /> <br /> If I had known that this movie was so bad, I'd rather watch 10 episodes of MacGyver saving the planet. <br /> <br /> No groove, no drive and no sensation. Look at the Tupperware channel ?? it's more exciting than this sorry excuse for a movie. This film does not deserve a "0" on the scale. Better luck next time, Baldwin. Until then, will I be sitting here watching my nails grow ?? is much more exciting than "Target" ??.
