I found the movie a bit predictable and boring, but I'm 14. <br /> <br /> I was really annoyed with my cousin as it was very hyper that day so I saw a movie on the Disney channel and put it on and told her to look at it. <br /> <br /> she is 6 years old and she loved the movie, some songs she didn't like as the ending, but I didn't realize that it was Eddie the star of the shoot video I thought it was Jordan's video ?! but she had fun. <br /> <br /> I noticed the mistakes as Jordan was not playing the guitar, but he never did. <br /> <br /> is definitely a movie for whether you are seriously bored or 10 and below. <br /> <br /> has calmed my cousin well. <br /> <br /> even though she was singing for the rest of the day.
