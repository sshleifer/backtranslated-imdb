This film was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot could have been made to work, if the film had been written better. Acting was one of the worst I've ever seen. I was very slow and it made me want to leave / turn off the movie several times. I watched the whole movie in the hope that the ending was worth it, but it isn't. I think this film should be evaluated in negative numbers. (In my humble opinion)
