I'm not very much a fan of Abbott & Costello (although I like "Who's On First") and, to be honest, there wasn't much in this film that could inspire me to look at their other works. It wasn't really bad. He had some slightly funny scenes, and actually a very convincing giant played by Buddy Baer, ​​but somehow, given the duo's fame and the esteem in which they are generally held, I have to say that I expected more. As the story goes, the couple stumbles upon a babysitting job, and while reading Jack & The Beanstalk as a bedtime fairy tale (with the child reading it on Costello), Jack of Costello falls asleep and dreams in history. There is a certain kind of "Wizard of Oz" for the story, as the characters of the dream are all the equivalents of the acquaintances of Jack's real life, and the film opens in black and white and moves in color during the dream sequence. The fight scenes between Jack and the giant and the dance scene between Jack and Polly (Dorothy Ford) are among the fun parts of the film. Polly, of course, also leads to one of the questions in the film: what happened to her? Apparently Jack and the gang left her behind in the giant's castle! I know - it was just a dream, so who cares. Still - I was wondering. There were also a couple of nice songs and dance routines. My 4 year old chuckled a bit during this, so she was able to appreciate a bit of humor. I found it an acceptable timewaster, but certainly not something that convinced you of Abbott and Costello as the genes of comics. 4/10
