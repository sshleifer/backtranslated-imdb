<br /> <br /> Very boring and laborious adaptation of the amusing satire of Amis. The hero is portrayed not as a nice loser, but as a simply obtuse fool. Most of the rest are caricatures as well with only Helen McCrory putting in real quality and providing something of the novel's ingenuity. The setting of the period is encamped as if it were 1920, not the post-war period of horror and rock'n'roll comics. A real disaster even for bad UK TV standards. <br /> <br />
