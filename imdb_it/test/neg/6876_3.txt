Yes, the title line actually appears in this film. Why? I'm not sure. When the line was actually spoken, did someone who was not part of the crew laugh at one point? I would have liked to see the outtakes of this film, especially since I think they would be more fun than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Director Helmed Jim Gillespie, ("I know what you did last summer,") comes a teen slasher movie that seems to assume that we've never seen a teen slasher movie before. Of course, you should not blame him completely. There are also three responsible authors, and this is somehow based on a video game still in production. The title of this game is "Backwater", but looking for information on it I have found absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> And so we start the film ... I would like to say before it continues I didn't expect this to win an Oscar. When I'm in the right mindset, I enjoy a funny horror movie to pass the time. I think there is an opportunity for an effective, original and intelligent slasher film. "Venom" is not this film. <br /> <br /> There is almost no character development. All right. You don't expect much. However, in place of a well-made cast of a few, this film decides to introduce us to the following cliché characters from many horror films ... <br /> <br /> 1. The Final Girl: She just broke up for her boyfriend. This means that at some point in the film, when they are in danger, they decide to come back together again. Which more than likely means he will die and she will be the last survivor of the film. "Eden" is played by Agnes Bruckner, without much enthusiasm, I might add. <br /> <br /> 2. The Boyfriend: He is around to coexist with The Final Girl until his death. Sure, he can save her, but he's doomed and we know it. "Eric" is played by Jonathan Jackson. <br /> <br /> 3. The Bimbos: Usually horror movies only need one of these, but here we have two. They steal, steal, can show their breasts (not in this case) or they could be alcoholics. A staple like that. They also wander in the dimly lit areas all on their solitary, usually saying things like "Hi, is there anyone there?" "Tammy" and "Patty", appropriately named, are played by Bijou Phillips and Davetta Sherwood. <br /> <br /> 4. The Jackass: Sure, it looks nice, but it's the idiot in the movie that is inserted purely to be an idiot. He says stupid things, he does stupid things, obviously he has never seen a horror movie, and it is one of the pleasant killings for which you look at this kind of thing. "Sean" is played by D.J. Cotrona. <br /> <br /> 5. The Girlfriend: She adores Jackass although hardly anyone else does, and it's usually the one left alive for a while, so she can scream and cry until she starts tripping and stays back. "Rachel" is played by Laura Ramsey. <br /> <br /> 6. The Creepy Janitor: In this case, The Creepy Gas Station Attendant. Enough said. "Ray" is played by Rick Cramer. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think you have the photo. The remaining characters are not so common as they are equally killable. There is "The Gay Guy" (Pawel Szajda in the role of "Ricky") who has been definitively robbed regarding the screen and "He who knows what is happening". Obviously none of this is important, because in the beginning everyone always thinks that one is crazy. "Cece" is played by Meagan Good. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of other characters, namely a deputy starring Method Man, but he and the others are killed pretty quickly and get an even lower character development than the following cliché. <br /> <br /> So, you're probably thinking, "why does this film require such profound analysis? It's just a summer horror movie, to cry out loud!" Based on this question, do you deliver the goods? Yes and no. Acting is not particularly convincing, also considering the amount of talent involved. Bijou Phillips was hailed for his performance in Larry Clark's Bully, and Agnes Bruckner has been an emerging talent for some time. <br /> <br /> So what about the blood? There are some This is really about it. Many of the juiciest pieces are cut. That is a scene that involves someone's face and a sandblaster used to remove paint from cars. <br /> <br /> To the credit of the director, there are a couple of interesting scenes. I liked the piece in which a part of a house was literally torn so that the unstoppable villain could reach the characters. <br /> <br /> If all this was centered around a smarter script in which the characters did not make the same stupid mistakes that literally hundreds of characters from horror movies had made before them, they could have created an experience more pleasant. All the most interesting characters are immediately eliminated in the first third of the film and then becomes a not particularly interesting countdown until we know that it is only The Creepy Janitor and The Final Girl. <br /> <br /> I suppose I should be a little tired, but as a fan of the horror movie, I wonder why I should have worried about writing a better script easily. I won't even mention the numerous cases of terrible CGI.
