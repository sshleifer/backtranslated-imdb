Franco's films can be divided into 4 categories: the "earlies" (often black and white and inventive), the "naughties" (late 60s / early 70s that often involve Soledad Miranda), the "nudies" (of various periods, but using full female frontal nudity as a plot) and "the rest". <br /> <br /> This is part of the "rest". It's not a cannibal movie at all. It is certainly not a gorefeste. The few women in the picture do not even lose their clothes for loins and there are few complete frontal things. The image quality on the German DVD I saw is poor. The film disappears (to the extent that it catches fire). As a Franco fan, I would tell others not to disturb. Do something else with your time ... read a book ... get a copy of "Women in Cellblock 9" ... anything really ...
