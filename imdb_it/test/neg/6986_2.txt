Don Wilson plays the role of a policeman who occasionally enjoys a virtual reality fighting game, but things go wrong when the people behind the game decide to take virtual reality to a new level by making people real from the video game, in reality make cybersex models as a prototype but the main villain of the video game wakes up and starts killing people and now the only man who manages to defeat him is Don Wilson, who in the meantime falls in love with the cybersex model. Actually with all that I considered my biggest confusion, he was trying to figure out if people had come from virtual reality, they were robots, humans, cyborgs or just some kind of unidentified computer program. It doesn't matter, because this is just an excuse to watch one of the worst actors the butcher has ever faced as if he were running a deli. Don Wilson's total lack of charisma is the biggest flaw in the film, since someone doesn't like the boy, he's too good, his voice is too high and doesn't seem very impressive in the action sequences. What saves this festoon from my lowest rating is Athenia Massey who looks super sexy with high-cut clothes and who strips naked on occasion. Also on board is Loren Avedon (A good martial artist), Stella Stevens and Michael Dorn as the main voice of the villain, but their efforts are in vain because they are all hidden by Wilson's bad acting. Another flaw which is the biggest mistake of the film is the lack of action, since we are asked to observe the story but, apart from Massey's nakedness and perhaps some unintentional entertainment due to acting in a ridiculous and unconvincing way, not there is really nothing interesting. This also extends to the action sequences in which they are choreographed flat, badly directed and completely drained of any possible excitement. Making it practically invisible. <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
