I haven't seen such a horrible film for a long time. I was hoping that at least Adam Sandler could be fun ... hopeless. It seems that some teenagers have written the script and that the father has pushed this far, that someone has agreed to shoot it. (Film) The world could be the best place without this, whatever it is.
