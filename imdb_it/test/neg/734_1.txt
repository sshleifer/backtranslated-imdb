From time to time, a movie comes around by pure chance that makes you doubt your sanity. We have just finished studying the novel "Northanger Abbey" at school and decided to refresh our memory of this uninspiring piece of garbage without humor with the BBC adaptation. <br /> <br /> The fun thing about Northanger Abbey is that it actually makes you want to kill yourself. The film is NOTHING like the book, for example, the subtly evil characters seem to have been transformed into transparent stereotypes. John Thorpe looks like a goblin on acid while Isabella plays the slutty role. Catherine, the main character, is the most depressing and irritating actress on the land of God (she looks like an addict, her eyes are like basketballs) while Mr Tilney looks and acts like a retired porn stunt. The plot goes completely off the rails at certain points in the film, I don't know what the hell the director thought when, for no reason, a 7-year-old black kid we never met before takes the main character out of the abbey and starts to roll in front of her. Yes, it's true, cartwheeling. Such nonsense is occasionally interrupted by Catherine's "fantasies" in which she is carried around by a cathedral from an ogre. <br /> <br /> Northanger Abbey is basically visual euthanasia, so if you want to kill your boss or something like that, the BBC has practically discovered a new way to kill someone. Northanger is a film that is barely ridiculous. Don't watch it unless you're in a padded cell.
