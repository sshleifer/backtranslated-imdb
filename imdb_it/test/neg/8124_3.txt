I still remember when Frog Baseball first aired on MTV. In a sort of strange, surreal way, cardboard has captured the stupid actions that I think every boy growing up in America is committed to. Now I think back to how I burned a crippled grasshopper using a magnifying glass, but at the time it was interesting for some reason. Growing up in the 1980s, we all knew the "stoners". These were the children who brought Iron Maiden t-shirts to school, grew long hair, had an immature mustache and were at least two inches taller than all the others because they had failed a grade or two. We laughed at them because they were so stupid even when they weren't stoned. So it was easy to understand Beavis & Co because we already knew them, some of us were even theirs. To the extent that GenXers like me reject the excesses of the 1980s and embrace the grunge movement of the 1990s, Beavis & Co was a strange postmodern hymn to us. Strange because like Beavis & Co we didn't care if we had a hymn. It was just an internal joke that we immediately got even if it was horrible.
