*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** What's going on here? <br /> <br /> Barbara Hershey, who looks decidedly intoxicating - as if she had stolen her grandmother's wig - stages an unconvincing performance like a woman who kills a man's wife has had a relationship with self-defense "after having struck forty times with an ax. <br /> <br /> Like Lizzy Borden, she is acquitted but after the most unconvincing argument ever presented to a jury by the representative of an innocent defendant I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Lizzy Borden took an ax and gave her father forty lines when she saw what she had done - she defended self-defense <br /> <br /> I don't think so <br /> < br /> I find the defendants guilty of having presented an unconvincing portrait and I have no alternative but to assign to this film a sentence of 4 out of 10 (which would have been lower but for the previous good behavior of some of the subjects involved) > <br />
