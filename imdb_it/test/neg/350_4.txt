That's exactly what the title tells you ... an island inhabited by fishermen. The doctor Claudio Cassinelli and the crew are shipwrecked on the island, they have been taken by the fishermen or forced to work for the crazy mad hunter Richard Johnson. Cassinelli discovers that Johnson, who believes he has found the lost city of Atlantis, held the scientist hostage Joseph Cotten and his daughter Barbara Bach hostage for 15 years, so that the fishermen can discover a treasure under the sea. Cotten, of course, is a complete fool. Bach and Cassinelli have great chemistry. This madness was directed by Sergio Martino and is not, surprisingly, without merit. It has a fast-paced, reasonably well acted rhythm and the fishmen seem quite convincing (although it is unlikely that anyone can prove that these things DO NOT seem real fishermen). There is an excellent soundtrack by Luciano Michelini.
