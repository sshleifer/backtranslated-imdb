I'm sorry to rain on everyone's parade. A bit of history about me: I like and know a lot about Asian cinema, especially Japanese, Chinese and Indian. I must admit that I am a novice when it comes to South Korean cinema, but, if this is the best of the best, I'm sorry. I just want you to know that I'm not at all narrow minded when it comes to appreciating foreign films and I'm not suited to the stereotype of the "stupid American". . . well, not perfectly. <br /> <br /> I cannot believe that the praise of this piece of nothingness is conferred. This is a disgusting film * and * ridiculous. Hammy acting - everything is badly done and exaggerated, like begging for the attention of those who have not studied. Horrible photographic work, with an insistence on senseless close-ups derived from the aesthetics of MTV. <br /> <br /> The plot is more full of holes than a giant piece of Swiss cheese. No one expects a thriller to be 100% realistic and for the sake of entertainment I would be happy to close my eyes to small, unconscious details. But, excuse me, what's going on here that * can * endure even a summary exam? This story of an incredibly complex and contrite act of revenge is worse than the worst scandal story that can be read in a row at the supermarket. (I don't want to spoil your "enjoyment" if that's the word, so we won't go into the details of the plot.) The fighting scenes are violent, unbelievable, downright stupid (the main "hero" who takes dozens and dozens of opponents in same time, after having trained ONLY while he was in prison, punching a wall!) The truly "exceptional" features of this film are two: the filthy and incestuous sex (brother on sister and father on daughter, well, we evolved from Oedipus , isn't it?) and graphic violence. The cut parts of the body - hands, teeth, tongues - along with industrial quantities of spilled blood (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die to make this film?) They have no aesthetic function / motivation. <br /> <br /> A party for the S & M tended, let's face it, but, even for those, a party without merit or subtlety. The skies, even the recent and much-discussed work by Mel Gibson on an almost similar topic was NOT so bad. <br /> <br /> The invariably good at pressing this pretentious, exaggerated, exaggerated piece of free blood from the Korean coast gets me wondering what's going on. I don't consider myself the best example of taste and I am often ready to accept that a film that I don't like can be better than I was able to perceive. However, I have no qualms about calling this the same as I see it: bad, bad, bad. No saving qualities. My 2c? Find something better to do with your time.
