Anyone who writes that this is good there, the child may have worked on it or put money into this terrible university experiment. It was bad, slow and painful to watch. The running time of only about 84 minutes seemed like three and a half hours. The only person to blame is the director, who knows nothing about how to direct a scene, where to place the camera! 95% of this terrible film was shot from long twists. Two or three people in the frame who talk or scream forever (or what seems like always), No close-up !! No medium shots !! There are two so-called fight scenes that every filmmaker with a brain would shoot for first or foreground. They seemed very amateurish. The scenes with the screaming father and son would have worked better if there had been a cut of the father alone or only the child who acted, or reacted. Tri-C must be very mortified to show this everywhere. I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time some of them are funny because they are so bad, this is not one of them.
