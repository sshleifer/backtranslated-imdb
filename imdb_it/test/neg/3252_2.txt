This film should never have been made! It stinks, it's horrible, it's not good, it's bad, it's terrible. Starting to see a model here? Jackie Mason is certainly not Rodney Dangerfield. Gone are Ted Knight and Bill Murray, who, along with Dangerfield, were essential to the first film. It seems that the three of them (the stars) all knew a stink of a script when they saw one. The one who did not have the good sense to abandon this was Chevy Chase, which got stuck, but was foreign to both films in my opinion. This film is simply NOT FUN. Nor does it have other eye-catching qualities. This thing counts a lot on anti-Semitism to work and works to its detriment. I hated this thing. A waste of time for everyone.
