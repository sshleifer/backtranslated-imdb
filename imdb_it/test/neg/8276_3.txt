The title of this review summarizes what I feel for this film. I can't imagine what audience there would be for this thing, if it weren't for the hardcore fan of the slasher movies of the 80s who simply must see - all-from that time. Otherwise, don't waste your time on this either. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to most films of its genre: something terrible happens to one of the characters in the opening scene, which inspires a bloodthirsty assassin to go on a murderous fury. I've been there, done. To be sure, none of these 1980s cutlery was known for their originality, so I can't see the point in the film about the film alone for this. <br /> <br /> But where the film fails it's in its state of suspense and murder sequences. I've seen some pretty scary 80s slasher movies that had much lower budgets than this. This fails to create any real suspense. The director throws some nice shots and some semi-professional director touches here and there, but they mean nothing if you're not scared. Even the gore is quite meek, so anyone who looks at these things with the intention of seeing some fantastic 1980s make-up effects will be sadly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film manages to crumble rather weakly. Honestly, the key ingredient of almost all slasher is the fast pace: you have to keep things moving quickly and keep the pieces of the crime staged at regular intervals, because, let's face it, we don't look at these things for great characterization and graphics stellar. But the rhythm, because of the script or editor, is all out. The murders are interspersed at irregular intervals, leaving us with some lengthy scenes (no doubt destined to build "characters") that only serve to bore you and let you pray for the next killing (which, as I said, is usually not done very well anyway . <br /> <br /> As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even scary remotely. He (or she?) wears a jogging suit, a fencing mask and his (or hers?) "Primary weapon is a sword. I bet the writer just got wet thinking he had invented an original," cold "murder weapon, but the idea turns out to be impractical and silly. There is not much emphasis on nature" whodunnit "of the film, as if they forgot or didn't worry about putting some false track in the mix to throw us out. <br /> <br /> We guess that the people behind this are trying to create something decent and respectable, and to sometimes, they show their intent tions were probably a little more authentic with regards to the making of a quality film compared to countless other direct elimination shots of the time. the attempt fails for the most part, but there is a pretty good acting (at least for this type of film). There is an attempt at characterization, but none of them ends up meaning something in the end, so ... Here, all you can do is get bogged down in the plot and make sure that the murder sequences seem like they can't get enough soon. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you really like the old '80s cutters, at all costs, take a look, if only to say that you've seen it. There's more in all of us, but don't expect to be swept away or anything. What we have here is a very funny slasher film that doesn't leave a real impression.
