If you want to see how to ruin a movie, study this closely. In fact, it's so bad that people should buy it just for this reason. Above all, note that most of the scenes look like being downloaded in about 5 minutes. Realism escapes this film at every level. The general impression is that someone has been given a screenplay below average, brilliant actors, an average director and absolutely no budget. With a formula like that, she had to be condemned. <br /> <br /> I rented it once, and I swear I became dumber to look at it. If you are a humanitarian worker, buy this horrible and horrible film and burn it-UNWATCHED- as a favor to the world. It has no recognizable plot, bad acting, and then throws women into something bad just to really plug it all. I'd suggest looking at the dry paint before this stupid waste of duct tape! Seriously. The paint would be better. I wish I could give this 10 star negative.
