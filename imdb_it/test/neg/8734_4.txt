Although Embryo may have been a potentially challenging bioethics exam, it degenerates into a stereotypical parable of Frankenstein, highlighting the now monotonous lesson that there were some kingdoms that man was not destined to enter or study. <br /> <br /> The scientist Rock Hudson is experimenting with ways to prevent the death of failed children. After success with a dog, he immediately jumps to humans - violating medical ethics and any sense of plausibility - with the equally unrealistic assistance of a hospital administrator. His experiment works too well, with some very unpleasant side effects. <br /> <br /> Although Barbara Carrera is reasonably good in her role, and some of the animal trainings are spectacular, the film suffers from being too imaginative. Although a message to the prologue assures viewers that this represents contemporary technology, the described scientific work seems far-fetched even for the twenty-first century, not to mention the mid-1970s. Furthermore, the scene in which Carrera is able to find a cure for the side effects of bioengineering simply by typing a question into a computer is ridiculous.
