I rented the DVD in a video store as an alternative to reading the report. But it's just more terror. <br /> <br /> While the film may present some information about the drama report, you are taking the word from the producers - there is no reference to the commission report anywhere in the film. Not one. <br /> <br /> Acting, all around, is pretty bad, practically all the stereotypes of government agents "hot" and bitchy, all of whom think they know more than anyone else. There may be some truth, but it really does have a stereotypical Hollywood smell. <br /> <br /> The ratings and feedback from IMDb user communities tend to be more fair than wrong, and I started taking a look at the ratings before renting when I can. <br /> <br /> I'd like to have on this.
