"Escape from hell" is not done with enough artistic talent to hide what it is: gross exploitation. Direction and writing are both sloppy: for example, the work with the camera during the fight between Cintia Lodetti and Ajita Wilson is so bad that you can barely understand what is happening; furthermore, if the alcoholic but kind-hearted doctor had not killed the director, the guards would never have followed him and the girls after their escape - the "false wound" plan had worked until then, but he had only had to ruin it. I would have given this movie a 4 out of 10 (the sweaty lesbian scene is not bad and Christina Lai has an extraordinarily beautiful face and body), but a particularly nasty abuse scene forced me to cut 2 more points. Obviously some bewitchers will take it as a recommendation. After all, one more disturbing thing about this film is that some people actually gave positive reviews!
