A copy of Roger Corman assembled for what appears to be practically zero budget. All the special effects were originally used in "Battle Beyond the Stars", and I suspect that a good portion of props, costumes and sets have also been reused from other sources. The story seems to have been written around these elements, so it's not a film as much as a recycling project. Third-class "Star Wars" garbage was not needed then or now.
