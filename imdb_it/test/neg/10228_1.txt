HOW MANY FILMS ARE IN THIS LOCATION IN WHICH AGAINST ALL ODD, A RAGTAG TEAM BEATS GREAT KIDS WITH ALL MONEY? !!!!!!!! There is nothing new in "The Big Green". If anything, you want them to lose. Steve Guttenberg had such a good resume ("The Boys from Brazil", "Police Academy", "Cocoon"). Why, OH WHY, did you have to do this kind of film during the 90s and beyond ?! So avoid this movie. There are many good movies out there, so there's no reason to waste time and money on this stuff. Obviously, the "green" in their minds was money, because there is no creativity here. At least in recent years, Disney has produced some smart movies with Pixar.
