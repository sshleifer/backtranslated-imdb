I watch a lot of movies and enjoy B's occasional movie but this movie was awful. Apart from the quality "homemade" of the film, it was very slow and seemed to make no sense. I'm just commenting b / c of another comment I saw here that said it was great! WOW! Maybe it's OK to watch a rainy day when nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> The characters were disjointed and did not correspond to any visible model of reality. The dialogue between the characters has been forced and, at times, very confusing. <br /> <br /> I imagine that if I were very interested in the whole area 51 and understood some nuances of other comments, it could be good - but for me - the Average Joe - I don't understand!?
