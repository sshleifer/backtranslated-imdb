After watching the film, I feel that both father and mother are reasonable people, although they are not perfect at all. On the contrary, I do not like the author and his two sisters. <br /> <br /> Is a person's diary an accurate portrait of herself? No. Most of the time, people only write problems in their diary because they want to solve the problem. So a diary is always a more negative side of a person. In this film, the author judges his mother's life from his diary. Not a wise choice. <br /> <br /> The author's older sister is so ugly, external and internal. First, he said his father's second marriage was "not right" for his mother. Then he said he doesn't love his mother. Therefore, he does not love his father as much as his mother. I doubt you love someone in the world. His face is so ugly, just a reflection of his heart. Through the film, I feel that the author and his sisters are lacking in love and respect for their parents. However, I feel that the father is a mother who loves their children very much, even the author tries to portray them as cold and deceitful people.
