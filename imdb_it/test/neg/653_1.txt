Renee Zellweger is radiant, but the rest of this film doesn't work. It's like a burger and jelly salad - an interesting idea, but who ever thought it would work on the film? I like the two previous films by director LaBute: they were ruthlessly honest and spiritually funny. This film only manages to be ruthless and chilling - with huge chilling junk. (As a high concept, think: the Doris Day-Rock Hudson film that Sam Peckinpah could have done - now reduce your expectations to fit the current mass-produced Hollywood state.) Those talented actors like Freeman, Kinnear, Eckhart, Vince and Janney ALMOST makes their scenes come to life is a testament to the immensity of their talents to rise above the material that simply is not consistent. I would have found Freeman's triumphant speech at the end of the film funny (in a Lynchean way) if it hadn't been for the annoying suspicion that this unconvinced morality was meant to be accepted seriously.
