Why is it impossible to write in French? Very Kitch! This journey to the center of the earth is a despicable technical possibility, however current in 1976. These great "Casimir" monsters are completely ridiculous! The film still deserves a "remake", as was "KING KONG" (the last), with a scenario a little more supplied. The professor has similarities with Professor Calculus and is quite funny. David (the character) is quite inconsistent but crosses (spends) on people from under a good message "join you and I'll overtake you!" We would say a film made in the 1940s. Now that I have said everything (or almost) the evil I was thinking about, we can say that if the brain gets tired or something has to see something else, then the thing (matter) is also quite funny. Hugh! This is my opinion! (translation from French to English with "Reverso": sorry for any errors!)
