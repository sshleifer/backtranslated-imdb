We brought this film as a joke to a friend, and it could be our worst joke to play. The film is barely watchable and the acting is terrible. The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff gave a lower than average performance. The plot is shameful and in some places we were so bored that we were wondering what the hell was going on. Try to be gruesome in places but it's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Simply terrible
