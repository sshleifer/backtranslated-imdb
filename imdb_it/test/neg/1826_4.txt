I had high expectations for this film, but unfortunately I feel disappointed. I bought it for $ 5 in a used VHS place, and the version I bought was the dubbed English version. Dubbing is terrible, so be careful. "Lola" was not really good in this film as in "Run Lola Run", and the bad guy came out of nowhere. And "Lola" starts to understand what's happening when she arrives at the university. Seems unrealistic to me. I was also wondering if in the original version there were American songs in the soundtrack ... they seemed extremely out of place. Too bad for this movie, I really thought it would be rock.
