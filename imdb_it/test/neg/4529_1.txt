This movie sucked. The problem was not with the cast. I think the cast was great, a lot of good talents, a lot of great acting. But the script was TERRIBLE! It seemed to be mostly just a framing job in which Steve Carrell could make his improvise. And that's what it does best, but it didn't work here. The script was difficult to follow, the story was not sensory and the scenes were random and without direction. Furthermore, much of the action was extremely elaborate and ill-conceived. It was a good effort, but as Max says, they lost it from THIS MUCH! I'm shocked to see how many positive reviews there are for this stinker here on IMDb. Obviously, film producers are making sure that people write many positive reviews about their films and fill in the rumors about IMDb. If you read positive reviews and comparisons to negative reviews, it's pretty clear what genuine reviews are from regular users. <br /> <br /> This film was full of problems and jokes that simply didn't work. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchor Man, and I like his comedy and his style. But I'll tell you that I never laughed once while I was watching this movie. Yes, I had a couple of light moments, a few laughs, but no real laugh. Nothing that struck me. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert! A ridiculous scene was when Max had his hands tied on the plane and went to the bathroom to try to escape. Use his special Swiss Army knife ... but instead of using THE KNIFE BLADE, try to SHOOT the binding with his miniature crossbow. And while the crossbow fails and shoots small arrows at him over and over again (almost putting out the EYE), Max doesn't give up and doesn't try the blade instead ... no, he keeps shooting himself with the crossbow. What did he really expect to do with that crossbow? It seemed to be the WORK on the knife option to try to remove the bindings. It makes absolutely no sense. <br /> <br /> This is a good example of the typical circumstances in the scenes of this film. They were ridiculous, ill-conceived, poorly motivated and made of pure absurdity. And this really distracted me. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film was a big disappointment, and I suggest you avoid it. A note for the IMDb: you should do something about these false reviews that people are leaving. Degrades the authenticity of the site.
