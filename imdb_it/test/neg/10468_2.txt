With the exception of the beautiful rack on Clara Evans ... this show was pretty bad ... so why did I see it? Too much coffee, and had to relax before hitting the bag. Watching BB change in his biggest Big Chief suit, it was fun at most, at worst ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I could have created a better Skeltor and special effects on my Dell. <br /> <br /> Boxlietner has seen better days, this boy is a year younger than me, and seems to be increasingly similar to the Scarecrow of his TV series in the early 1980s ... women with sweet eyes they need to go back to acting school, even though Evans size 40 and a 17-year-old girl (about 20 years old) was a trait ... the Sci-Fi channel did better than this ... but for us people who don't go out to bars much more, I suppose we have to take what we can get ... after all, everything that takes you away from CNN, MSNBC and the Election 2008 Fox coverage these days is a good thing.
