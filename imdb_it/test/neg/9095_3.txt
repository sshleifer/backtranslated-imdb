This is a candidate for the worst movies I've ever seen. He wanted to be shocking like "Silence of the Lambs", but he has neither the style nor the intelligence mentioned above. The trick is excellent, the acting is pretty good, but the story seems to drag on for years and the murders are so creepy that they're more disturbing than funny.
