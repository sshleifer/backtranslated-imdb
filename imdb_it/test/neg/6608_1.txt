Brodzki's creation is a great example of how NOT to make a movie. First there was a book written with great humor. Book that has numerous fans who would be happy to provide help when the producers for some reasons decided to hire people who barely heard of the book in the first place. Then came a screenplay with no sense of humor and full of nonsense as much as possible. At the same time, the script was written so that only those who actually read the books could understand something of the plot. Not that anything in this film makes much sense anyway (ex: "I'm like a piece of ice. You can burn yourself" said Yennefer as a word of warning - warning that logic is something that this film is seriously missing). To add that we must mention that, regardless of how much money was supposed to be spent on the film, everything looks like an amateur production with two (2) computer effects one of which is a transparent dragon. Even the costumes seem to be borrowed from a really poor theater. This is the best way to look at it this way. And to add that we have some "nude scenes" put there just so they will be in the film because they have no explanation in what can be called mercifully plot. The film has only one force that can hardly compensate for the rest: the music is not bad. Even if I had to choose I would prefer to have it separately. It seems better if you don't have to look at this super production failure.
