I have to admit, I love horror movies ... especially the films of the 80s. To hell with it, I also love cheeses like the Sleepaway Camp and Night of the Demons. But I didn't think much about this movie. The death scenes were not very well done, the CGI was terrible and the acting was a ho-hum. The worst thing was the story that made no sense. I'd say you save your money, but chances are, if you want to watch this movie ... you'll do it anyway. I didn't hate it ... it's not very good. Overall, it's just another lifeless and meaningless horror film that lacks life (it's not surprising that this was published on Dimension for over a year after its completion).
