Sad to say that this is one of the most foolish of John Wayne's western series for Lone Star Productions. Here is a US marshal on the trail of a known bandit only, no joke, like a shadow. <br /> <br /> No, it's not Lamont Cranston, he's a guy who gives his orders through a secure open wall so his men don't see who he is. But the voice is unmistakable, you'll know it within 10 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> And another reviewer here is completely wrong, there would have been no publicity or squealing because Gabby Hayes was still acting in a variety of roles and he is well shaved here. He had not yet found his niche as the adorable assistant of various heroes of cinema cowboys like the Duke. <br /> <br /> He will then lead his men quite openly in the climax so I'm not sure what the point of the original trick with the safe wall was. I don't think those who wrote this knew. <br /> <br /> Wayne takes Yakima Canutt as an Indian friend here and the relationship is almost the same as an unmasked Lone Ranger and Tonto. <br /> <br /> It's all rather silly if you ask me.
