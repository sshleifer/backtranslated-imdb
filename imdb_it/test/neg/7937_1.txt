Is it just me, or is it a TRUE movie? I'm going with an AWFUL movie ... <br /> <br /> Knowing perfectly that it is a male film (usually defined as full of car chases, accidents, shootings, explosions, etc.), I still expect a small degree of credibility. If I can't believe the premise in some way, the movie WILL NOT WORK. So, let's get to the problem with "Assault on Precinct 13." <br /> <br /> Not one for spoilers, I never reported the details of the plot. However, I will make an exception here, because the plot is SO crazy. The villain is imprisoned in Precinto 13. Friends of the bad boy want to kill him. Surprise. The companions of the villains are actually corrupt police officers. The brooding policeman, restless, but heroic saves the day while making fun of the girl. UGH. Yes, it's really that simple, and stupid. <br /> <br /> "Assault on Precinct 13" takes place in Detroit. It's not a bad crime and corruption scenario (I spent 3 months there at the end of 2004, so I know what I'm talking about). Even so, it is outrageously violent and offensive to the police and the citizens of Detroit. I spent a lot of time in downtown Detroit, but I can't imagine how the chase in the downtown Detroit forest ended. I must have lost it ... <br /> <br /> There are no refunds for watching bad movies. Save your money. In 2005 there were too many good movies to waste even $ 3.00 on Blockbuster on this. <br /> <br /> FINAL RATING: 1 <br /> <br /> (Just because I've seen worse movies.)
