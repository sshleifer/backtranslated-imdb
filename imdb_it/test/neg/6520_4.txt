There is nothing bad or bad about this movie. It's terribly boring. Photography is boring --- the film looks old and faded and faded. Maybe it was even 16mm exploded to 35mm, I don't know. Opaque is the script, which is boring and 'Jules Pfeiffer'-ish. That is, a kind of bossa-nova cocktail party from the 1960s to fashion. Like our beatnik grandparents they could have talked if they were trying to look really straight. The characters of the "slice of life" were mostly annoying. True, they were real for life, but hey, if I wanted to see really normal people doing ordinary things, I'd just look at myself. I won't intrude on the cinema and play five pounds, and one night, watching someone else do it. <br /> <br /> I expected a fun, bright rom-com. What I got was more like what two talented and moderately talented young men of 19 or 20 could produce on their first day with a new camera. <br /> <br /> I gave this 4 out of 10, because it looks like someone tried, at least.
