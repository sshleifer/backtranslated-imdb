In the aftermath of September 11 in New York, this drama about American firefighters was conceived as a tribute and a tribute to their professionalism. The story is told with a series of flashbacks, in which firefighter Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) crashed into the floor of a burning building and radioed with Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta). The flashbacks basically show how Jack becomes a recruit, seeing Kennedy as a paternal figure, as a fire legend. Of course, to this day, Jack's firefighters are trying to reach him, but they are too late, and in the end, let them go, and forward him to his funeral, where he is praised as one of the best firemen who have known. He also played Jacinda Barrett as Linda Morrison, Robert Patrick as Terminator 2 as Lenny Richter, Morris Chestnut as Tommy Drake, Billy Burke as Dennis Gauquin, Balthazar Getty as Ray Gauquin and Tim Guinee in the role of Tony Corrigan. The flames of the film are in the end everything I could pay attention to and I enjoy seeing the characters face them, the rest is a bit too talkative for my taste. Adequate!
