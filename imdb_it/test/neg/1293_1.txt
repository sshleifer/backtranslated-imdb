I really tried to give this film a chance, but when I realized that most of the movie was told by a bunch of boring officials who were running around and talking on the phone, I knew it was over. A lot of this film also seemed to be stock footage. It's just crap. <br /> <br /> The camera has continued to make these rapid rapid zooms for NO REASON! It bothered me so much, but I was wondering why the hell they thought it was a good idea. It adds nothing to a static scene of two people talking. This is not NYPD Blue or some police show or something. <br /> <br /> How could they not have realized that telling this kind of a story from conversations of people in conference rooms and what not, is BORING? !! Haven't seen this mess? However, this was just a really boring movie and it seems that whoever did it doesn't understand a good story in the movie. <br /> <br /> They hurt the movies ... it's just wrong.
