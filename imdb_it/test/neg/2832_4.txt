As a big fan of Brian Yuzna and most of the movies he was involved in, I thought I'd like Progeny. I didn't do it, even if in ways it has its moments. However, if you expect something from the likes of Society or Beyond ReAnimator, you could be shocked. In a sense this is similar to Society, being a tale of a seemingly ordinary world with a horrible supernatural side ... but that's where it ends. <br /> <br /> I am not covering Yuzna when I say that the fault is not really with him, because the bad direction is bad direction, but the direction is healthy. What affects the film is both screenplay and acting. Stuart Gordon (ReAnimator, Dagon) wrote a clever script, but that doesn't really work with Yuzna's directing style, leaving him paused on actors who offer long dialogues when he really wants to throw that camera and put himself with his bad self. The issue makes the movie quite embarrassing, but it gets worse. <br /> <br /> If the film had been made with great actors, the film would probably have played its part. Unfortunately this is very far from the case. The acting is wooden, in a shocking way, even for a low budget B function. The inexplicable success and renowned Arnold Vosloo destroys every damn line with almost punctual precision, delivering one of the worst performances I've seen in a long time. The man is able to transform every line of well-studied dialogues into the type of prison line that will be thrown at you from fellow drunk the next time you're at the pub. "Hey Bob! GOOD GOD, I AM GOING MAD! WHAT IS ... COME FROM ME! NOOOO!" In fact, I could try it again next weekend. The last-minute addition of the veteran genre (and his favorite) Brad Dourif, instead of enriching the film as it should, almost seems to give Dourif the film in a last attempt to stop Vosloo, but frankly Dourif seems deeply uncomfortable (perhaps waiting for the next assault of bad acting) next to Vosloo, and even an eccentric turn from him fails to resurrect the movie. <br /> <br /> If the acting was better, this film would have gone well. Hell, it would have been pretty funny, but the lack of character makes the film a soulless affair, and makes the horror element seemingly attacked and tasteless instead of an organic part of the film. found the alien torture / rape scenes a bit difficult to digest, but the fact that the characters were so lacking made them look free and unpleasant, leaving an unpleasant taste in their mouth. <br /> <br /> So, if you really like science fiction and have no problems with bad acting, pedestrian rhythm and a really unpleasant rape scene, Progeny will probably be your cup of tea. But since I do it, I'll probably never look at it again. Once it was enough. On the plus side, this is the only science fiction film Yuzna has ever bothered to do, so obviously he wasn't really happy about it.
