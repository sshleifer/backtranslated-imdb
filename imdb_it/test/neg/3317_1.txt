Now don't get me wrong, I like to see half-naked chicks squirming. It's part of the fun of a Moroccan restaurant: watch the belly dancers. But it doesn't do much of a plot. <br /> <br /> My first big problem is music. I have a feeling that when Ann Rice wrote "The Vampire Lestat", the Cure was more the style of music she wanted (though I could be wrong). I know that talking about current "goth" music might have seemed like a good idea, but they did a horrible job incorporating it. Lestat was an actor with a presumably beautiful singing voice. It is heartbreaking that they chose Jonathan Davis to be his stage voice. <br /> <br /> Second, and someone else said it, crushing two very intricate books in a lousy movie is a bad idea. "Lestat" could have been a movie in its own right, and damn good if done right. I honestly don't think "Queen of the Damned" lends itself very well to a movie. Although I would like to see a film that incorporates a story of creation, there is too much, like saying this, "inaction" in the book because it is a very interesting film. And the retelling got it pretty bad. Now it's clear, it's been a long time since I read it, I always thought that "Lestat", "Tale of the Body Thief" and "Memnoch the Devil" were much richer in action and would have made better films. /> <br /> I know a lot of people (hey, including me) who like a lot of squeamish vampire crap who thought this was absolutely the worst of its kind to be an important movie. I tend to agree with them there. Aaliyah had a beautiful body though.
