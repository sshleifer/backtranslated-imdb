Rating: * 1/2 on **** <br /> <br /> "The Net" is one of those movies that won't stay in your mind until the next hour. Well ... only if you keep thinking how bad it is. It's a mediocre piece of trash, miserable, empty, ridiculous and predictable. One of those adjectives I just used above is the reason that made me add 1/2 star to what I would have given. So is it a case of "so bad it's good"? No. It's a case of "so ugly it's ridiculous". <br /> <br /> Bullock in a (very bad!) very bad performance he plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is always at home. She works at home, has no friends and her neighbors don't know her. Suddenly, she sees herself involved in dangerous situations, after her colleague dies and the same thing happens to her almost. Your identity, your bank accounts, etc. Etc. They are all canceled and now it is Ruth Marx. The conspiracy also involves the government and ... Wait! Haven't we seen it before? Yes, thousands of times. "The Net" tries to be modern, to be the portrait of the 90s, showing the computer as a villain. Big deal! It's a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes. Take the scene of the boat accident. I just laughed when the camera started to slow down ... <br /> <br /> What makes it all the worse is Sandra Bullock. How horrible it is! Have you already made a decent film? "A time to kill", ok. But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic faces in every photo she takes. <br /> <br /> The advantages and disadvantages of the computer have already been shown in "2001: A Space Odyssey", the best, the most intelligent and most complex film ever made. It is not necessary to compare "The Net" with it, is it ...? <br /> <br /> The only reason to see "The Net" is to laugh, as I said, and to see what it proved to be The results, well, it's a shame. <br /> <br /> CLEAR this movie from your mind!
