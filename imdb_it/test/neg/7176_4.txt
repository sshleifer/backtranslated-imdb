I admit this is not a great film. Practically screams "low-budget", but strangely I still found myself nice for the film because, although it lacked quality, it abounded in energy. It was as if Little Engine That Could and a movie merged into one! <br /> <br /> The film takes place on a radio network and covers some of their low-level employees: two guys on the page (one very intrusive and brash and the other a wuss) and a new receptionist. All three have visions of radio stardom, but for now they have to settle for their humble jobs. <br /> <br /> In this story appears a murder that seems a little out of the blue. I didn't know it was a mysterious movie for murder and was taken by surprise. However, like most B-mysteries, the policemen are lamebrain and it is up to our intrusive hero (Moran) to try to save the situation. During all this, I had difficulty deciding whether Moran was unpleasant or appealing. I'm not sure yet !! <br /> <br /> There is a moment in the film that is at the top of the 'cringe factor' and that is when the two pages try for the roles of radio comedians. They appear in black-face and make an imitation of a third or fourth version of Amos n 'Andy. Besides being very insensitive, it wasn't even funny. Fortunately, the producer of the show they were trying to seem to feel the same way. <br /> <br /> In general. it's easy to skip this movie and don't blame yourself if you do. However, the strange and frantic pace of the film seemed to really compensate for the film's artistic deficiencies and I'm glad to have seen it. A good movie? No. But one that still deserves a peek for old Bs fans. By the way, maybe I don't have much good taste, but I thought BOTH female divas were singing really poor voices despite the way everyone in the movie is fascinated by their bad words. Listen to yourself and let me know what you think. I couldn't believe anyone was allowed to sing on film, even if it was only for Monogram Studios.
