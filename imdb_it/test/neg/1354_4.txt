I believe that an entire book can be written about the odyssey to remake the classic film on which this film is freely based. When Hollywood started talking about this feat, the reaction was always negative because there were too many aspects that could go wrong, starting with the solid set that made the original unforgettable, and this is exactly the point where things start to dry up here, with the selection of actresses who otherwise can do a remarkable job, but who are not suited to the parts and, unfortunately, have been directed with the heavy hand of a director who does not understand or appreciate the original material. <br /> <br /> It seems that there is no focus or direction, or as if the direction that was taken is to delete everything that was good in the original film. This is called an update, as in Let's drain the story from humor, snappy dialogue and any interesting premise. Above all, we show that women have come a long way, except that the problem is that we don't get (at least watching this movie) where women are really going. <br /> <br /> The starters, the casting of Meg Ryan in the central role is almost fatal to the film because somehow it seems to have closed in a kind of limbo in which women do not really change appearances, even after 20 years of film work. Her Mary, who turned out to be a difficult role in the 1930s, somehow grew out of her interaction with other stereotypes, like Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz" by learning, observing and realizing she had a choice about it . It may not have been a choice that women would have celebrated today, but it was a fun run, and part of the fun, it was the routine, silly, sometimes slapstick that elevated that movie into the realm of the sublime. Here, we are down to earth with a thud. Changing the nature of Sylvia, the film has lost much of its spark, and is in no way the fault of Annette Bening. I couldn't help but admire the way he tried to save this sinking ship and felt himself sinking as he struggled with the horrible lines she was handling. Luckily I enjoyed watching some of his fantastic clothes and kept reminding myself how talented this woman really was. His Silvia is wise but imperfect and could have been a great creation. Unfortunately the English lady paid no attention to her work and loses control of a character who could have turned the film in a new direction. <br /> <br /> It was not the greatest blasphemy of all of them. In the original, we have Joan Crawford who probably does one of the best interpretations of a woman. Its crystal is legendary, with conniving lines, incendiary moves, duplicate maneuvers and very sexy poses. It was the bond between the male and the female, and through her we knew what the whole catastrophe was. He provided the tension between men and women. It was dangerous, sexy, the last femme fatale. A woman of intelligence that we feared and admired and, more importantly, we wanted to destroy to save our heroine. Eva Mendes, however wonderful, is two-dimensional in this release due to weak writing and, once again, a bad casting. <br /> <br /> There are other atrocities in the film, such as the addition of a terrible role for Mensing as a dedicated mother who lives to have children, and Pinkett's rather annoying lesbian turn. Then comes the biggest waste of talent in the film, as Bette Middler, who is a bit unrecognizable in her makeup, shows the spark of what could have been. Its acid administration reminds us of the contemporary angle that the film could have taken. His words revive and put a great deal of nastiness into the film, and it is exciting to see that he could really fly, then he left. She's in the movie for six minutes, and she vanishes in the midst of chaos. <br /> <br /> Here is a film that has raised our level of anticipation and really disappointed us, a film that could have joined the success of "Sex in the City" that made an incredible transition to the big screen because he respected his original material and did not compromise. He gave us a bigger, bigger and better adaptation. He really updated what had made the first success. "The women" in her current reincarnation needs to go back and rework herself, just like "The Hulk" did it this year, find more suitable interpreters, a really good writer, and above all, someone who really takes into account what are the good films of.
