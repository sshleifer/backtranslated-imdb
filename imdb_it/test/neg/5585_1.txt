6 of the 8 comments on this topic have rated this film as worthy of being watched, so allow me to correct the balance. <br /> <br /> If this is the best that British filmmakers can offer, then they need to pack their cameras now and find work in another industry. Unfortunately for me it has been 82 minutes that I will never see again and I hope that I will save some of you wasting 82 minutes. <br /> <br /> Although the idea behind the film is interesting, it is not sufficiently developed to keep the viewer connected. Student characters are bland and uninteresting and frankly you won't be interested in what happens to them. The soldiers are practically caricatures of all the villains never seen in the film, I kept waiting for Captain Markovic to spin an imaginary mustache. Some of the effects were quite good and showed a little imagination, but these were ruined by the incredibly bad acting, the bad script, and the work with patchy machines. The budget could have been better spent sending the "actors" (and I use this term roughly) to the acting classes or to the Thomas Brothers to film the school or maybe on a spell checker because the subtitles were written incorrectly. The fact that spelling errors have not been detected and rectified speaks of the immaturity of the entire production. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the positive comments are staged by the directors, or that they were watching a completely different film. I implore the Thomas Brothers never to give up their daily work because if they continue in this field, they will surely die of hunger.
