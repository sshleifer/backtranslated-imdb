Am I the only one who thought that the point of this film was graphic violence? I knew nothing about Leigh Scott when I rented it, and I wouldn't have done that if I had known that most of his previous films were horror movies. I don't care at all, I was just waiting for an informative document of the 9/11 report. <br /> <br /> Instead, I got an almost incomprehensible and violent film. The only positive thing for me is that it made me want to read the report, to understand what the hell this movie was. <br /> <br /> I wrote this because I am shocked that we have become so immune to violence in movies and on TV that it was not even worth commenting on the bloggers I read the reviews about.
