Time travel is theoretical, so I can give a little margin to the script. <br /> <br /> I also understand the concept that by changing just one variable, you can potentially change the way the story unfolded. <br /> <br /> What I fail to understand, however, is the way the change has occurred over time. We are subjected to a series of "time waves" that progressively evolve the planetary evolution. Although this is a convenient plot device, as it allows our heroes to have enough time to solve the problem, it makes absolutely no sense. Surely, if you change a variable and the variable has significantly altered, or even completely, the planetary evolution, then when you return "to the future", the evolutionary process has already been established and there would have been no need for waves ? After all, why did a change 65 million years ago need to wait until now to be effective? The fact that the moth was projected forward in time could give it some credibility, but the life of that moth 65 million years ago was significantly altered, ergo, any change in evolutionary history would have started then, and not be dependent on a return to our present time. <br /> <br /> To solve the problem, the team goes back in time to prevent the change in the variable from ever happening. By doing this successfully, we see that changes in evolution have never happened and that nobody even remembers the events! Surely, what works for the solution should work for the original change? I like a nice science fiction adventure, but unless it's set "in a very distant galaxy", it needs to have at least a foundation in the theoretical possibility of making it really fun. <br /> <br /> Good premises, bad plot, reasonable acting and, in all honesty, only a turning point on Jurassic Park. <br /> <br /> Not on my "look again" list.
