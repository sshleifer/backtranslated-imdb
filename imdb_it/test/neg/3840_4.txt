Like most of those who see this movie, I did it for stars Michael Madsen and Dennis Hopper. The two are extremely undervalued and unfortunately, because of this, they have to claim a lot of shit. In this film, Hopper plays a guy who accidentally kills a blackmailer and gets help from the mysterious Madsen. <br /> <br /> The movie really isn't as terrible as it could have been. I have seen both of them much worse, both independently and working together (LAPD, horrible film). The direction was rather poor and the script needed some rewriting, but both offer the best possible performance with the material offered. The ending is also pretty strong, so you can say that the story has potential. But when a brilliant film review is "It could have been much worse", it doesn't say much about the movie itself. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one that can easily be skipped if none of these actors involves you. But if you're a fan of both or both, give them a watch. Both offer strong performance that eclipses the obvious flaws in the film. Trust me, there are much worse options.
