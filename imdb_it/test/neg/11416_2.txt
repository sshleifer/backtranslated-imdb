"Stop while you go on" is a phrase they will never learn. Typical scenario of Hollywood sequels: if the first film was just shocking, the second no, expect the third to be the worst thing to hit the screen this year. Even worse are the prequels, whose events have already been explained in detail. If you haven't seen the first two films, you won't like this. It's like starting to watch Lord of the rings or Star Wars with the latest film in the trilogy. So "stand alone" this film is not. <br /> <br /> Remember in the first movie about the revenge of the Luciani? Remember the second on the wild brother, long lost? Well, if you've seen those two 5 minute moments and pasted them, would you have gotten ?? a 5 minute prequel. But the creators' ether thought that these 5 minutes were historical events of vital importance or simply wanted to give some actors, cast and crew a job and maybe earn money in the process. "I have a lot of money, I make films for a living and I'm bored, what am I going to do? I know! I'll make a movie." So anyway you get this 5 minute prequel and you stretch it for 90 minutes ?? this is the film And you know what will happen to the main "immortal" characters, so there is little suspense. By the way, the whole drama of the film is in those 5 minutes. The only thing that made me raise my eyebrows was the death of mum for begging the movie. Ill. The rest was the Braveheart remix. If you want a comedy, see Braveheart before this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to yell a bit ?? the film put me in the mood. First, who invented the concept of "vampire versus werewolf"? He is older than me and he aged just as fast. And why do vampires look like Goth girls in heat, while werewolves look like psychoactive bears? Hiding bad movies behind the neckline fails. Isn't it about time we have leaner werewolves with an upright posture? How can their immutable werewolves raise if they all rip to shreds? And why didn't vampires dominate the world with all their powers? Blaa, blaa, blaa ?? What a waste.
