As LIVING THE DREAM has managed to enter the West Hollywood Laemmle 5 is beyond me, since it is the worst film I have ever seen in my life. I should have known when the first scene opened in fits and starts, Eugene, Oregon, that this movie of characters with movies you like and feel sorry about their days of exclusion from high school, but they can't, since they're so losers, it's so wooden and atrocious with a dialogue that goes beyond evil. <br /> <br /> So, clich√©, the three losers of high school end up in Los Angeles, and this is where the film could have been realistic if he had shown them trying to find a career in acting. But no, one works as a used car salesman, the other is a real loser in a garage sales center that sells magazines. Even the bastard who runs the place has more public appeal than that terrible actor with the horrible foreign accent. And, fraudulently, they receive money from an insurance scam to create an inexperienced executive recruitment company, simply showing "the alleged good life" in Los Angeles nightclubs with a cast of actors so woody and bad, better not to have SAG cards ... <br /> <br /> I could go on and on about this bad movie, but I ended up leaving the theater, which had six people at the beginning, and when I left four men they were the only ones in the audience . I wanted to love this film, but I couldn't find any merit in the story, the characters, the writing, the dialogue or the actors. Anyone who projects this film should retire. Amen ... enough ...
