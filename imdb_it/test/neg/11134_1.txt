OK, so I'm relaxing in my room when Mom knocks on the door. I open the door and what do I see in his hands? "SLEEPY HOLLOW HIGH". I think it should be an older horror movie, because now there is someone who could be so stupid as to name a film after the blockbuster "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp. But to my surprise the film is at least two years older than the original. Only this should have prevented me from inserting it into the V.C.R. But I didn't have to risk it, I had to believe that this film could have a small ray of hope. I didn't know that the rays where nobody was seen. <br /> <br /> Number one, the plot is so ridiculous that it is probably true in some suburban country. Two, the actors seem more like real life people who are surprised on the set when the director shouts. Three, almost all the films with the director are always horrible. But the funny thing is that this is yet another film directed by Kevin Summerfield. I started relying on his film to bring me to the ground with cracked laughter. <br /> <br /> Where to start this movie? I know, let's start with the jogger in the woods. The illumination of the camera was so bad that I led to believe that the jogger was still and that the cameraman was running. I love the stop for a woman to eat a candy bar. I mean that it is just darkness, or just light, which could mean with camera lighting. And she stops running to eat a candy bar, I mean a BAR CANDY WHAT THE HELL. So he ends up being the first victim because of stupidity, and I'm ready to break the tape, find the director, burn his small hands. <br /> <br /> Then out of nowhere some guys like trying to fix a car that was probably broken for a few years. Then come the fake Mack 10 and a very real prostitute, who happens to be part of our main cast. <br /> <br /> The film is about a group of guys who get themselves all in trouble. And the possibility is given to collect the garbage in the park of Sleepy Hollow or face the suspension forever. We are sent into the woods with one of the teachers (Mr.E or Kevin Kampfield) who suppose to watch over them and make sure everything goes accordingly. The funniest thing is how far the statutes are not developed. I mean what is with the fake Mack 10 friend and who has ever heard of Hacker trying to kill himself. And some of how one of the students had an affair with the teacher Mr. E, before all this crap of community service had arrived. Yet the school still thought it was a good idea for them to let it go. There is also a student named J, whose purpose in the film is to continue to appear annoyingly out of where to try to blow up the audience, when all he really does is add to the convenience of the movie. The sound was so horrible in this movie. I mean, there was one seen when two boys are fighting, and the guy beats the other one in the belly, and outside the T.V. comes this sound effect that looks like someone who pounds a stale wooden box. It started horribly and ended dangerously stupid, even my tastes. I'll say it anyway, the music on the back has made the scenes a bit tolerable. But not so tolerable. My conclusion is this, if you want to leave yet another film that Kevin Summfield has taken seriously, buy "Sleepy Hollow High. <br /> <br /> PS I'm still thinking of shooting myself to remove those images of the fake Mack 10. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
