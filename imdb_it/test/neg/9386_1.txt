This show is terrible. I can't get over the total waste of great talent that this show contains. This is not an improvisational play, it is just a cheap attempt to put famous famous actors on stage and show them in a badly improved scene. Actually I did the improvisation job as an actor, and this show is not improvised. <br /> <br /> What the public is really laughing at (if they're actually laughing at this show, it looks pretty fake) is the embarrassment of the host star being lost like a deer in headlights. Stupid, completely alien things that come out are what people laugh at. And if it's not part of the scene, the actors will tell them it's wrong! I find this show a disgrace to art, and it makes me cry for shows like Whose Line anyway, that was very talented, great improv games, and in addition to everything else, it didn't make me want to change channel.
