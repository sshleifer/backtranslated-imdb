This film must have looked when it was launched in development and get a Redgrave and a Jacobi on board must have thrilled men's money. All I can say is that clearly they had nothing in that week. Jacobi accamped him in the way only Jacobi can do and I thought he looked more like the actor who parodied in his cameo role in Frasier some years ago. Vinnie Jones is not exactly bad, he is clearly out of his depth as a guide man. It's really quite amiable in everything and if this was a pilot for a TV series, it may have just been picked up. However, scipt and camera work have been terrible. Enough because this "journalist" and a Met press officer would never work together will never be explained. Certainly it may not have been because of sexual chemistry, of which there is none. There is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and far-fetched storyline that you can leave as original, but the whole thing is so inventive that the two stories simply don't make any sense. It was as if two stories had been confusedly changed into one only to recover two hours. Go look at some paint for a couple of hours. Your life will be more satisfied than looking at this garbage
