This film has one of the worst protagonists of all time. I say this because it is meant to be the hero when, in my opinion, everything that it does in the whole movie ruins people's lives and causes problems. He can't do anything right, yet the movie makes him look like the cool guy that everyone should watch. He has tantrums at all the wrong times, he has all the wrong positions about things that end up making people mad at him and getting people killed, he's too nosy, too intrusive, too macho, too unhappy, he takes all the bad decisions and no common sense. <br /> <br /> It is a private detective hired by a successful painter to find the woman and son he abandoned years ago. The detective finds the woman and what he thinks is his son. However, all sorts of things happen to make this story full of crime, drama and twists. It's made for TV, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> However, the film is pretty funny. Johnny Depp is very young in this and has a terrible 80's cut. He chews the gum and tosses a soccer ball around for about 5 minutes and that's all we can see from him. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the out-of-print VHS version of this sells for $ 40 in online auctions. It must be only for Johnny Depp collectors. It could not be due to the plot. It couldn't be. <br /> <br />
