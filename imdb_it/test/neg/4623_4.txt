Wow! That James Purefoy looks exactly like Thomas Jane! <br /> <br /> This is the deepest thought I took with me after seeing the rather overwhelming George And The Dragon. For a fantasy comedy, the plot was very boring and the effects were not spectacular. <br /> <br /> The problem was not acting. James Purefoy is a good rider, and his various side kicks are not bad characters. I thought Patrick Swayze was also a good idea in this role. Piper Perabo with a flat chest also had good potential. I also liked the baby. <br /> <br /> But the story and everything that happens, and the * way * that happens, was just "eh". Not interesting. Compared to another recent fantasy comedy, Ella Enchanted, which was actually fun, this film looks terribly short. I'm sorry for the decent actors who were in this tiring yawn. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
