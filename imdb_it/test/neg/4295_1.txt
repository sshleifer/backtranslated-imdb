I just wrote a comment on "ACES HIGH" (1976) and this reminds me of this film I saw as a child when it was released; since then I've only seen it once and this was more than enough. As Kevin says "it's a complete waste of time". Apart from dog fights that are well done, the rest is a sequence of badly patched scenes with actors struggling with a horrible script and an equally bad direction. I don't remember the silly German accents mentioned by Kevin in his comment, but this is another pathetic mistake; if Corman tried to make the characterization of German pilots more convincing, why did he not use German actors or did he have the parts nicknamed? On the other hand it is a good example of the scary Hollywood style of movies with their "bad guys" so clearly identifiable, not only from their cruel actions but also from their grotesque accents. <br /> <br /> Speaking of "cruel deeds" the ridiculous scene was that Lieutenant Hermann Goering killed the English nurses during an attack on an air base is an absolutely disgusting piece of propaganda done with "historical hindsight . If you want to see a real, moving, well-made and direct film about the air war during the first world war "ACES HIGH" (1976) or the wonderful classic "THE DAWN PATROL" (1938) you will not be disappointed.
