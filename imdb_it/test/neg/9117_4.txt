The critics were like "a movie that will break your heart" etc. So a friend of mine and I had high expectations when we decided to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I will make sure that it is short and leave it up to the others to write about its contents. This film tries to touch you, to reach your heart. But it fails. At least for me. And also for my friend. <br /> <br /> Everything that happened happened only on the screen. There was always HERE, not HERE, where I am. Most of the time I thought "hmm, something is happening on the screen, but it's only on screen, it's not real." <br /> <br /> Movies that have MUCH MUCH better touched me: East of Eden (1955), Terms of Endearment (1983), Jerry Maguire (1996), Babe (1995), Mies vailla menneisyytt√§ (2002)
