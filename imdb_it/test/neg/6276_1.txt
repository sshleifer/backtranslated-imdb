This film resembled the out-takes of scenes deleted from a high-school film-class experiment. It didn't make sense! It was well acted, but I was only sorry for the characters because they had to appear in this slop. The alien machines were created with Pentium I technology and no creativity, they were crabs! The under-illuminated and just-seen aliens were Frisbee with their legs. WHERE WERE THE TRIPODS? The assembly, made by the director / writer / producer / make-up artist / gripper Latt, jumps everywhere, with some scenes repeated numerous times. Most seemed to have been filmed in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The next time Latt wants to make a movie, someone needs to slap him. In 2005 alone he produced 11 films! This does not include writing, editing, directing or visual effects on other films. If the rest is like this snot, then it makes fun of us. This was a slap in the face of Spielberg's film, nothing more. I look forward to "BackBroke Ridge", "X-Man IIV" by Latt, "The Hillocks have Eyes".
