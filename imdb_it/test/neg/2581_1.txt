"The Patriot" staring at Steven Segal is a thriller / action movie of the late 90s that is not really a thriller and is not really an action movie; rather it is Steven Segal who plays Steven Segal with another name, but this time he is a native American country doctor who gets his ass kicked again. Discovering the obvious gaps in the plot, the film itself is absolutely amazing in terms of the obvious disregard for character recognition. <br /> <br /> From a marketing point of view, I was asked: "To whom in the world were they aiming?" The plot of the bio-thriller is decidedly inaccurate for the middle-American public and Segal, like a silk cowboy, would never sell it to anyone, even if you have fried it in depth and put it between a creamy and creamy donut. The whole movie has just come out of there, even for Segal fans, because it just doesn't translate to any level.
