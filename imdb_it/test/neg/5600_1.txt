I did not expect "Citizen Kane" but I was hoping for extreme guilty pleasure! The screenplay is very bad, but the external shots of the school were obviously made with the same 5 extras on the same day and the exterior shots of the dormitory were easily shot during a hurricane. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe was exchanged so much, I was hoping that the wardrobe lover had good strong soap to wash her panties. I know the budget time, but do you think they could have bought a couple of different styles of underwear? What overhung the vampire vampire wore boyish panties under latex pants? I was relieved to see a loincloth appearance in the penultimate scene. <br /> <br /> Positive aspects: the actors were all * very * attractive and the girls had natural tits. Too bad they never took off their bras. <br /> <br /> The special effects were neither effective nor could they be described as special, if they had ridden the short bus to the modification room. The final scene in particular is horribly, ridiculously bad. <br /> <br /> - Lizzzzzzzz
