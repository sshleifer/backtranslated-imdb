This was the most unrealistic film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can't believe the writer and director didn't see that almost the whole movie looks like an SF. <br /> <br /> For example: <br /> <br /> 1. It is impossible for the killer to remain on the cold icing and after 10 hours get up so fast. <br /> <br /> 2. You can't be electrocuted through a water pipe like in the movie (believe me, it's my domain) <br /> <br /> 3. With a saw you can cut 10 pipes in 10 hours very easily. Let's say the chain was made of steel but the water pipe was rusted and made of iron. <br /> <br /> 4. If you try to cut your foot with a saw you faint (at best, it is more likely to die because your deer fails) before reaching the bone (shin). <br /> <br /> And there are other other examples.
