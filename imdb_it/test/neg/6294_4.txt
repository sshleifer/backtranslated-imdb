as I'm sure other people have said that this guy is not a very useful topic. of course, our society has a morbid fascination with death, and it's fun to hear him talk about how much he smokes and how much coffee he drinks, but he's giving himself a worthless mystique. however, the bottom line is that he is a racist moron who uses weak methods to try to deny the mountain of holocaust evidence, and as such should be forgotten by time. but Morris is in love with any kind of curiosity, which normally I wouldn't blame him.
