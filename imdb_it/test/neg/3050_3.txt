Before Stan Laurel became the smallest half of the greatest comedy of all time, he worked under contract with Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of low-cost articles, many of which were parodies of major Hollywood films. Most of the films on Laurel's parody are only slightly funny, and even less fun for the modern audience who haven't seen the original film that Laurel is parodying. Fortunately, "Mud and Sand" illuminates a film that is still well known: "Blood and Sand", starring Rudolph Valentino. 'Blood and Sand' was released only nine weeks before this parody, giving you an idea of ​​how quickly Broncho Billy's films were distributed, edited and distributed. <br /> <br /> Various sources (including IMDb) claim that Stan Laurel's character in this film is called Rabarbar Vaselino, with a final 'o'. I projected a print of 'Mud and Sand' with the original titles (in the Hobo font), so I report that Laurel's role is actually crying rhubarb vaseline, with an 'e'. But I agree that "Vaselino" is more fun. Laurel copies the elaborate bases that Valentino wore in 'Blood and Sand' (he should have done them longer!), And there is a parody of Valentino's dressing scene of that film, which made the women of the cinema faint in 1922. A señorita named Carmen in the original film is a parody here as Caramel (a girl I would like to sink my teeth into). <br /> <br /> This film (like the original) apparently takes place in Spain, yet there is a gag of prohibition. Laurel uses a characteristic upside-down gesture here that could have become a trademark for him (like Hardy's distinctive tie pendant), but I've never seen it in any other Laurel movie. There is a funny dialogue: the rhubarb Vaseline tells the other matadors "Save a bull for me". When Vaseline becomes a successful toreador, a footman tells him "The bull is without, sir" ... which is funny, but I was disappointed that Laurel did not answer "Without WHAT?" <br /> <br /> There is a funny moment here that almost certainly was not planned, when Vaseline presents herself for the bullfighter auditions. Laurel bursts into the arena, and - before you can say "corrida querida" - throws a bull over the fence, where it lands with a thud near the other auditoriums. The bull is obviously a fake, but the gag is still fun ... and, yes, there is a business card with a joke about the 'throwing the bull'. The fortuitous moment occurs when Laurel repeats the gag and Vaseline throws a second bull over the fence. This ends up on his ass, and he balances himself in an upright position for a moment before toppling over. Very funny! If anyone has programmed that gag in this quick comedy, I greet the unknown gagmith ... and the technical man who rigged the bull to land in that position. Most likely it happened thankfully, and the director and publisher were smart enough to keep it inside. <br /> <br /> During the era of silence, whenever Hollywood made a big-budget feature set wherever people wore I speak English, it was a common cinematic device to show a piece of text or an inscription in local jargon , then dissolve in one click of the same text in English. I was surprised that this low-budget comedy spent the money to copy that device here: we see a bulletin board out of the bullfight with a message in Spanish, then dissolves into the same text in English. Unfortunately, photography in this film about the cheapo is so obscure that the effect is wasted. <br /> <br /> The actresses of this film are attractive ... including Broncho's wife Billy Leona Anderson and Stan Laurel's wife, mae Dahlberg. ; the second makes a nice dance. (Mae had danced in Stan's vaudeville act). I was surprised to see Charlie Chaplin's half-brother Wheeler Dryden in a short role, since Chaplin had nothing to do with this movie. In 'Mud and Sand', Laurel makes a fun show that is very different from her later known Stanley character ... but this movie is a lot less fun than her brilliant work with Oliver Hardy. My rating: only 3 out of 10. TRAVEL NOTE: Twenty-three years later, in Stan Laurel's last American film - "The Bullfighters" (1945) - he again played a Spanish bullfighter (with his Spanish post-dubbed Spanish voice) ). Coincidentally, that film used footage from "Blood and Sand": not the Valentino film, but Tyrone Power's remake. 'Mud and Sand' is more fun than 'The Bullfighters', but not much.
