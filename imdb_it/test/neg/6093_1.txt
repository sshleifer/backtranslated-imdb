If you make a suspense movie it is important that the "bad guy" is no longer understanding the "victim". And this fails miserably. It was so terrible and frustrating to observe that I was actually moved to register and comment. OK, so the husband is rich and arrogant. There are worse vices, and the cabana boy and wife show a lot. The husband is an idiot because he didn't approve the cabana guy who physically assaults that woman - the witch who has absolutely nothing to do with the BTW plot. The cabana boy threatens her husband and repeatedly tries to seduce his wife. Then he forces himself on her - that the woman finds him so hot that he stops thinking about the rape and starts thinking he wants it. Uh Huh. The complex misogynistic and inferior thoughts shown by the director are simply disgusting. It's one thing when a good movie like American Psycho deliberately tries to make us empathize with the bad guy, but on Survival Island I felt like I was watching a movie about Ted Bundy but the director couldn't make it unlikely and instead he got hated his victims. What was he thinking ???
