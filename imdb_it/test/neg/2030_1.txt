OK, I wanted to see it because it had some good reviews, but this movie was horrible ... Simply awful. The characters were one-dimensional and nothing that the actors could do could ever give them life. The story was abysmal ... The wind stopped turning into a plot device in half ... It's completely forgotten. The images while they were fantastic were sooooo taken out ... 5 minutes of a boy crawling on the ground, 3 minutes of a girl who is putting on make-up. I don't know what this guy is trying to pull off ... it's like he has no storyline and the movie had to work so long, so don't let us change the scenes ... Foreign films are great for creating a story without using a lot of dialogues, this film makes me think that there is no way American cinema can ever do it. I want to give up watching movies altogether ... Bad Bad Movie!
