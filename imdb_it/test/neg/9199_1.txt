It's just a bad movie. Not bad as R.I.C.C.O. but bad. It made me fall in love at first and then totally lost me. The acting went away then going away. I don't see this movie at all costs, TRUST ME WITH ALL MY HEART !!!! The directors who are brothers are not the next HUGHES BROTHERS, who have made really great films like DEAD PRESIDENTS, HELL, AMERICAN PIMP and MENACE II SOCIETY. The only person who showed me this was the acting of Paris Campbell, who will be a great actor one day if he makes better films than this. Even Christina Caparoula did a good job for what she got. I hope the SELLER is 10 times better than this piece of shit!
