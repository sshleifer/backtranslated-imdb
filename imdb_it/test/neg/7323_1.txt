Diane Keaton is a pathetic actress. She is so boring and fake. She is the same on and off the screen. I saw her in an interview with Ellen Degeneres and she behaves exactly like in the movies. His silly facial expressions make me want to change channels. It was in a couple of good movies, but it would have been better if someone had been chosen for the part. Even Steve Martin does not add much to the film. He also acts and ruins even an old favorite. The ridiculous part of Martin Short only adds other nonsense to the film. I tried watching the movie twice but both times I had to turn it off.
