I thought "the ringing puppets" were pretty low, but I don't think the Carlos Mencia show even qualifies as comedy. Its main objective is to make the audience incredibly uncomfortable while using the word "beaner" whenever possible. I've never felt compelled to write a review that declared the horribleness of something on IMDb before, but I really hope this show will never be renewed or replicated. <br /> <br /> Mencia is trying to be the next Dave Chapelle, and maybe he was hired by the net just because they hoped he would fill those shoes. It's obvious until Chapelle's intro tear (blues guys vs. mariachi band). However, Mencia has absolutely * no * attitude, and does not delve into the popular opinions of Hispanic culture enough to invent a creative touch on it every time. Instead it sticks to a small number of nicknames that shock its Latinos and makes "jokes" about immigration. Occasionally take advantage of the slight darkness of his skin to make fun of someone else, like the cultures of the Middle East. These lines consist mainly of repeating every joke or stereotype against culture, and perhaps some incredibly old subjects (such as 9/11), in a mouth-watering style, while laughing at himself to cover the public's style. I think he is too afraid to really offend anyone, so it makes the viewer feel uncomfortable. He also beats to death. If you've ever seen "Why the fuck is this news?" you'll know what I'm talking about. At the beginning it is fun, but at some point it is fun and becomes Captain Ovvio. <br /> <br /> It is a shipwreck that is purely painful to watch.
