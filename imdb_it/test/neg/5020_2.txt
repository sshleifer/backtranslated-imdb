First of all I want to say that I like the liberal on a political level and I found the film offensive. I was able to see the whole dishonor of a movie. This film brings low and original ideas. Yes, my 2 stars were original instead of 1. Are our film writers so creative that they can only find this? Acting was horrible, and the characters were mostly unlikely. The protagonist of the story had no good qualities at all. They turned it into a bad guy and I didn't see it at all. Maybe I missed something, I don't know. He was the most important and important character in the film. I didn't pay money for this junk. I almost wish PETA would come to the rescue of this horrible and offensive film and make a protest. DISGUSTING is all I have to say anymore!
