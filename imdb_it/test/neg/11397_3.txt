They said it would be a bigger movie than Turks Fruit. How dare you <br /> <br /> them? It is not even 10% of this classic. Bad acting. The only person I liked was the one played by Angela Schijf. His acting was the best of the whole movie. The story could have been interesting, but it wasn't. Some scenes were filmed very beautiful (lights and camera), (the opening scene <br /> <br /> for example), but the bad acting made the magic disappear <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I really don't understand why so many people voted this movie so <br /> <br /> good.
