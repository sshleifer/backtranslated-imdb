Poor quality and acting is just as bad. This film is a fine example of current England and the mentality. There is no mention of Jesus in this film, nor does the film present any type of Christian scripture as most know it. <br /> <br /> I am also very surprised because this film is a BBC program and the BBC is well known for its quality programming, but it seems that the BBC's attempt to rival the psychos / Hollywood dramas they are failing completely. <br /> <br /> Poor acting, poor plot, poor culture that seems to be without religion. I wouldn't even bother buying it, rather try to hire this or buy it when it goes to the $ 2 bin.
