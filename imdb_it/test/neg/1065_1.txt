This film is so copy-cat, cliché-ridden, clumsy and tiring, I find it amazing that no one can feel deceived by the experience of sitting through it. <br /> <br /> Here is the range of idiotic clichés, ridiculous psychologization and narration simply unattainable in this "hard hitting" representation of high school: the tough guy is a homosexual. The A-student is unhappy because his father pushes him and somehow this makes him commit incest. A teacher is bad for a student who wets the pants in the classroom. A girl who is dating this jock is really in love with him and "just wants a family". <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only thing that saves are the student consultant scenes that are vaguely interesting, but most of the devices in this film are so leaden that they beg beliefs. <br /> <br /> This film does not show me any knowledge of adolescents and I will not be surprised when it bombs, especially with teenagers. People who like this movie seem to be parents worried about their teenagers, and the boy is barking from the wrong tree if they think this movie will help "understand" the problems of teenagers. I mean, what's the moral of this movie? "Hey guys, let's look at each other and hug each other" GIVE ME A BREAK. Anyone who thinks you can switch to a fourteen year old with that kind of message has to think again. In the 80s we were watching Kentucky Fried Movie, Xtro, Porky's, Evil Dead, Terminator, etc. This film would fall on deaf ears. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is right there with another Australian "indepedent" movie, "One Perfect Day", which was as bad as this turkey in the movie. Thank God no taxpayer money was spent on this boloney. <br /> <br /> AVOID !!!!
