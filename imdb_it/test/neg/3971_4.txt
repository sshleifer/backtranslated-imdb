The only reason I'm giving a 4-way movie is because it was made in an episode of the Mystery Science Theater 3000. The horrible direction is only slightly obscured by the characters' total inability to act. The protagonist is an actor I've never seen in anything else and shows. No chemistry with love interest and so bland that you almost don't care what happens to him. Dick Sargent was unconvincing because a villain in particular had to assume he was a super villain ... he was more annoying than anything else. Peter Graves was the only person to whom the film was not terrible, his part was small and even he was not able to compensate for the lack of talent of his co-stars. In 2004 someone tried to do all this mess again, it was called The Island ... Personally I didn't see that movie but from what I understand it's the same movie. If you want to laugh about this movie, the MST3k episode is really fun ... full of enchanted references and biographers that make this movie finally watchable
