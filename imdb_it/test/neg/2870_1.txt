I'm like Bam Margera, so I was curious. <br /> <br /> But watching a home production with someone else's friends and family, with a decent camera and a healthy guy, is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> Writing, directing, acting and editing are at most abysmal. But I've spent half of it. And why? <br /> <br /> This film offers perfect examples of what not to do, it's a film student's dream of what to avoid at every stage of the process. Cram in the curiculums of the film school everywhere! <br /> <br /> I know thanx Bam! Now I know that Jackass is real, because you're not trying to win an Oscar, friend :)
