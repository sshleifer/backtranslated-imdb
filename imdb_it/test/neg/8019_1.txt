A couple of teenagers have sex on the beach in the 1960s. That's all. They say they are fifteen while one of the actors is really twenty-five. Perhaps this film was quite revolutionary in 1978 in its way of touching "taboo" topics, but I can't imagine that at that moment anything shown in Esmiko Limon was considered taboo. <br /> <br /> Superficial dialogues are mixed with disco music that is even more superficial. The selection of songs involves nothing but the well-known "classics" that are still heard on every second radio station today. The plot of American Pie is not very different but it is at least a little fun. Eskimo Limon is boring, flat and not aesthetic. Almost unbelievable that he had six sequels!
