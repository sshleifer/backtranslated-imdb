Although I'm sure the idea sounded good on paper and fascinated me when I heard about it for the first time, this film often falls and falls flat, and when I look at it, I just want it to end. The beginning and the end of the filmmaking of the film on Lou who has to babysit a troublemaker is at best devised, even though I found the part of high cop funny. However, I found little to laugh with the bottom of the headgear that was thrown together for these two great comedians. I thought it was a mistake to put them in a musical, and it smells like "Wizard of Oz" rip-off (with songs and in black and white in color format). I would not recommend this film to anyone but A&C fanatics. Everyone else will be disappointed and have many better films.
