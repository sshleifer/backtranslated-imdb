Ah Animorphs. I loved the book series and eagerly devoured each in middle school and when I heard there was a television adaptation, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> Boy what a disappointment was the final product. I think for me, this was the time when Nickelodeon stopped being interesting and more generic programming. <br /> <br /> So what was wrong with the series? Allow me to count the ways: 1. The characters have been FULLY mixed. In the books, the Animorphs were between 12 and 14, the television cast was at least 18 years old. I remember being horrified when I saw the cast photos. <br /> <br /> 2. Horrible recitation / bad writing. I don't know what the fault was, so I'm massing in the lumpy mass that it was. Maybe it was the fact that the accelerated age of the cast hindered the humor that is at least cute coming out of a thirteen year old because Marco - it's not funny. In fact, I don't remember a single comic moment in the group and there were some. The actors certainly weren't helped by the writing that was bland at its best and turned out to be pathetically pathetic at its worst. <br /> <br /> 3. My lord was stingy with the budget. The end result of the Andalite alone would have to convince Viacom to pull the plug ... Their heads had slits that clearly showed what the helmet was. <br /> <br /> 4. Back to the cast - Rachel was by far the biggest disappointment, far from being the warrior woman in books, the best equivalent in the TV series was "scarecrow". Also, I know that Cassie was an idealist but there is a difference between "idealist" and "idiot". <br /> <br /> 5. One of the worst opening titles ever. Was the music so obvious? 6. Answering question 6, "yes" because everything else has been obscured, so why the less attentive spectators should not receive a thick as a brick song from a rap-rock rip-off or whatever it was. <Br /> <br /> Since then, there have been great disappointments (Iraq, 2004), but in case I'm not clear: this show sucked and was an abomination for the series of books from which it should have been based .
