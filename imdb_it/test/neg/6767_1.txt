THE RAP, the book on which this film was based 'was one of the most difficult books I've ever read. Yet I couldn't put it down. Vulgar, vulgar, vulgar, obscene ... call him, he has it. He also had some of the best features of any novel I've ever read. <br /> <br /> Well, as for the movie ... it was regrettable. I mean, Tim Mcintire like Wasco? Wasco was the meanest of the muthas ... he talked about WASCO ... Mcintire like Wasco is like throwing Tim Conway like Charles Manson. <br /> <br /> What happened to the main character of the book? Little Arv. He doesn't even exist in the movie ... Fast Walking WAS NOT the main guy in the book. Why even name this thing with THE RAP? None of this spirit, atmosphere, wickedness or drama of the book has been captured in this film. <br /> <br /> For me it was not just a disappointment, but a total waste of time and celluloid.
