I must first mention that, as a group of companions, we often find entertainment in knitwear films that are known to be terrible for the value of comedy, hence our Camp Blood rental. <br /> <br /> Camp Blood was the first movie we rented what had been shot on what looked like a video camera, and it was so junk that it wouldn't even be fun. <br /> <br /> The DVD has been returned and a refund has been requested, with the addition of a few suggestions a sort of quality control is implemented to prevent such garbage from being stored. <br /> <br /> Not doing what I did, and letting curiosity get the better of you, it's so ugly that it's not even funny.
