Cronica de un desayuno combines the worst flaws of Mexican cinema, a rare feat today. <br /> <br /> It is pretentious: it wants us to believe that it is profound, only because some scenes are blurred, another is pseudo-surreal, yet another plays with the Eisenstein-Infante-Caifanes tradition of faces that laugh at crepapelle, the edition is fragmented, and it's all so solemn. <br /> <br /> It has a weak script: the main one develops a little, so it has three other smaller and useless stories, stuck together. They are only good for making the film last longer. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting is bad. A real feat, bearing in mind that many of the most notorious Mexican actors have been cast. <br /> <br /> There is an abuse of useless vulgar language. To the point that the character of Paloma, which symbolizes the dreams of a child's freedom, uses it thoroughly. <br /> <br /> It is homophobic. The character played by Eduardo Palomo is the most painful and most punished representation of a transsexual I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's very boring. I ended up envying the people who left the theater before the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Whatever you feel, it has been done better, in Mexico and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> In other words: "Para partirte la madre, nada como una mala pel√≠cula"
