I found this film immensely interesting but a little tired, talking about violence and what it's doing, I still don't see the point in becoming terrorists to stop terrorists. We have similar people in the United States and other countries that justify the use of violence and war tactics because they think they are right. Think of the Puritans and the Christian crusades against the Islamic people during the Middle Ages. A lot of blood and death far outweigh the violence today, the Western world has had a negative impact on religion. I do not justify their actions, but Western culture in the past has had a very negative effect on some. But I still remember that the majority of the Islamic people is PACIFIC! People of any nation feel a kind of patriotism, but to start a war on the fact that I am right and that your wrong must be rethought. Once again I repeat that you cannot stop the terrorists by becoming like them.
