I knew this was destined for disaster after looking at the clock within 7 minutes of the flight time. The plot: two people get married. They move into the house of his wife's parents. And the husband doesn't get along with his father-in-law and if you haven't seen this plot before, you probably haven't watched TV in the last 15 years or so.
