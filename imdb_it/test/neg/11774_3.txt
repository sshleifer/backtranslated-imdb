What is it about drug addiction that attracts first-time directors to offer their opinion on the subject? This topic was done to death. Drug abuse is bad. We have it. Drug addiction is painful to watch. We take it too. But the sad argument does not grant the filmmaker the license to make a sloppy film. Each film does not necessarily have to be Hitchcockian's masterpiece of cinematographic excellence, or use Orson Wellesian's profound attention, but it is still a narrative film. Verite does not mean pseudo-documentary. Even the consumer mini-DV cameras are able to produce black and white whites, and this director is simply lazy, he does not reproduce scenes in contrast with the existing lighting: the subject is quite dark without artificially forcing it with a poor cinematography. And even documentary films have a sound mix. Vera Farmiga is very talented, given the right material, but the director obviously directed her too much and sucked her life out of her performance. People with addictions can live in a fog, but they still have emotions, but none of these characters seem to exist off screen. Support players simply handed over their lines without creating real people. I'm sorry to be so tough, Debra, but some things are true if they want to believe it or not. I'm sure your next movie will be better, but please, not another drug movie. :)
