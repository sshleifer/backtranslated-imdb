This film has the heart in the right place, but unfortunately it's not a movie. It is more than a documentary in the guise of a narrative. Bamako is basically an editorial piece of newspaper put on celluloid. However, your well-documented editorial is much more convincing and concise than any other presented here. The director is trying to convey to the viewer the difficulties of African life, particularly the country of Mali, due to the unethical practices of the IMF, the G8 and the World Bank, using the setting up of a simulation process against the aforementioned. There are another 10 minutes scattered throughout the film that make a lukewarm attempt at narrative plot, and a bizarre Hollywood western-style shootout scene, in which the director seems rather satisfied with his intelligence (hence the frequent comparisons of Godard). <br /> <br /> Of course, at the beginning of the film, what and who is on trial is never explained, but as we know by now, the French refuse to feed the public. <br /> <br /> There are many exciting arguments made, but they are often verbose, delivered in a shrill monotone (one that becomes quite easy to tune after a while), and very light on specifications. The last point is the most frustrating of all, since there is a well-argued specific case to be presented against institutions under trial here. Unfortunately, all we get in 2 hours is that the IMF and the G8 are evil oppressors and should forgive third world debt. We are given nothing but the occasional hint at the specific reasons why the processed organizations are guilty, but never a clear case. The arguments of the fake trial and the shooting of the surrounding village make clear the suffering of these African residents, but one wonders why one should expect two hours, when a far more precise image could be depicted in a Newsweek article by 20 minutes or episode of Bill Moyers. In the end, there is something very important to say about this subject, it is simply not presented very well, or very clearly, in this pretentious and indulgent piece.
