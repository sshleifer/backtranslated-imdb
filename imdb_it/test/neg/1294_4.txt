After huge economic disaster films set in America like The Day After Tomorrow and Deep Impact, it was nice to see something on a smaller scale like Flood. <br /> <br /> Using mainly unknown actors and actresses and actually focusing on England was a welcome change of pace in seeing the Empire State Building demolished. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a strong film on any basis. While being pretty shocking to see all of your favorite landmarks in London that were demolished by a false CGI wave, Flood doesn't really offer any good. <br /> <br /> The performances are insignificant, saved by David Suchet's pit of hell and his quietly calm performance as Vice Priminator. It is perhaps a little too calm for what is happening in the film, all that fake water that gushes out in London must have made him rather annoyed. <br /> <br /> It is understandable that the effects would not have been as good as TDAT and DI, but the CGI was at best, on average. <br /> <br /> Bland, disappointing and sometimes even boring. Look at it if you have to, but look at something else immediately afterwards.
