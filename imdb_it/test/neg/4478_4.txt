I had great hopes when I entered the theater: after seeing the trailer I was exalted as the next person to see the great talent participate in the realization of a story with a beautiful premise. <br /> <br /> However, it is disappointing to see this talent devastated by the poor composition of the songs - the words are big and poor, probably because it was composed with a more western theme. I would not find it difficult to imagine the same melodies with texts in French or English. In Mandarin, they simply sound weird. <br /> <br /> Even musical objects were badly cut - too quickly to be enjoyed, and the shots of distressed actors lasted too long. <br /> <br /> The special effects are the next disappointment. Suffice it to say that it is very obvious where the special effects start and stop. <br /> <br /> It is not Moulin Rouge, nor In the Mood, despite the theme of the occasional slow (and very similar) waltz. Overall, it's too long an hour to tell a simple story.
