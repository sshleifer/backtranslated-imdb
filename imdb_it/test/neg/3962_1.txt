If you're like me and watch the original "Benji" phenomenon from afar, finally seeing the movie for the first time over 30 years later, you might be shocked to find out how truly awful and more mystified it is about its popularity. in 1974. <br /> <br /> My judgment is not entirely objective since I tend to have a favorable prejudice towards children's films and for this reason I cut them considerably. On the other hand, I've always hated this particular dog, a feature of the last two seasons of "Petticoat Junction". Never a great show, the first episodes without dog were at least a beautiful showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog cut in their time on the screen. <br /> <br /> Benji is a mega-dose of 86 minutes of the dog, following him on several daily circuits through the city of McKinney, Texas. If this sounds boring, we advise you to give "Benji" a large birth and never let your remote fall into the hands of a "Benji" fan (if there are still out there). <br /> <br /> Unlike "My Dog Skip", "Monkey Business" or "Because of Winn-Dixie", the human actors in the cast are extremely weak. "Big Valley's" Peter Breck plays the stern serial father and seems only embarrassed at the idea of ​​appearing in something so lousy. <br /> <br /> If one of your children (of any age) seems to find "Benji" funny you should consider reducing the drugs. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
