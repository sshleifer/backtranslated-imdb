I just saw Descent. Gawds what a horrible movie. At first sight they represent a lava geyser and a note says that it is miles below the surface of the state of Washington. Folks, there are no geysers deep in the Earth like this. They thought it was clean and in typical Hollywood style they threw it inside. And then there's that well that spewed up lava. He dropped a stone and I heard a crash. The steam would burst from that well before a lava flow could, if ever. <br /> <br /> And even acting was pretty bad. Micheal Dorn has sunk into new jobs. <br /> <br /> What a movie dog. I bet the vote won't exceed 3.5 <br /> <br /> It doesn't seem that SciFi Channel has spent much more than making the handsome boy Perry as an attempt to draw.
