Director John Madden, from Shakespeare in Love, gives us another bad movie in Ethan Frome. The plot centers on a new reverend who arrives in the city of Starkfield where he learns the story of the sick wife of the paralytic Ethan Frome and the romantic first time with the maid. Adapted by Richard Nelson from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel's author Edith Wharton, this film is not at all interesting, thanks to an abysmally weak script and a bad direction that transforms scenes that should be moving into laughable schmaltz. However, there are other aspects apart from the film that work - the film is well done, Rachel Portman contributes a good score, and while no one is at their best, Liam Neeson, Joan Allen, Patricia Arquette and Tate Donovan work well in the their roles. But overall, Ethan Frome is only marginally useful and is easily forgotten.
