This film was not as bad as the story went, but the camera work is what makes it difficult to see. I simply don't like the so-called "realistic" camera work that is done nowadays; you know the type, jumping from the center, turning around, etc. What particularly upset me about this film was the novelty that they threw into the mix by shooting some black and white frames in each scene. I think the film would have been much better if the camera work had been shot in a much more conventional way, because I couldn't focus on it and instead found myself analyzing the camera's work. Perhaps if more people express dissatisfaction with camera work like this, the directors will finally have the suggestion.
