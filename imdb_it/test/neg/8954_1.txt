The fact that this cruel series can elicit dozens of comments (much less hundreds of "votes") speaks of the decline of Western (or at least American) civilization. <br /> <br /> Read Proust, idiots! ! Or at least Dave Barry or the anthologies of Calvin and Hobbes. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris. Wrap your brain in the fact that to evaluate or write about this series you should have spent minutes ... or HOURS ... looking at this poor clod that tramples the boards and lines that spew with a less emotional impact than the girl used to call the exact time on your local service. <br /> <br /> PLEASE DO NOT LOOK AT THIS SHOW !! SHOOT YOUR REMAINING BRAIN CELLS!
