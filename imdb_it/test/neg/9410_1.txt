This film was absolutely and unmistakably terrible. The plot was so predictable and boring and the script so insignificant and pretentious that I finally wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen. <br /> <br /> I don't normally write reviews, but I was stunned by the number of positive reviews obtained. While I admit that the acting went well in some parts, the lack of the script more than made up for the decent acting. The only reason I saw it is because some of my friends were watching it, introducing it as probably the worst movie ever made, judging from the trailer. We were not disappointed in the least. His only thing that saved me is that it contained my new favorite pickup line: <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I just want to meet you. <br /> <br /> GIRL: You just want to get into my pants. <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I want to enter your mind, your heart, your soul. In this equation I don't see you wearing any pants. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would say that this film is the worst movie I've ever seen and that it's taken seriously.
