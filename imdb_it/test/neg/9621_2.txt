"MirrorMask" was a terribly disappointing film for me. I had expected a lot from a Jim Henson production and found favorable reviews comparing them to "The Labyrinth" and "Alice In Wonderland". Unfortunately, the film ended up in one of those stacks of "above the substance" films. <br /> <br /> While most children dream of running away from home to join a circus, Helena is a little girl who grew up a circus (child labor, anyone?) who wants to escape to join the real life. Helena wants her mother to die, which is a bad move for a spoiled brat with a princess complex in a child's fantasy movie. The next thing you know, Helena's mother falls and, for some reason, is suddenly transported to another world. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I felt like I was being transported to the Museum of Contemporary Art with a pair of foggy sepia glasses. <br /> <br /> The showcase of creatures and backdrops generated by CGI was interesting in the beginning, and I liked the Orbiting Giants. It was a little too tiring after a few minutes, and I felt my mind wander ... <br /> <br /> Without the sense of narrative and MTV-style clips and soundtrack (the sphinxes reminded me of Basement Jaxx's "Where's Your Head At"), I didn't feel involved in the difficult situation of the protagonist and even frustrated, while we waited for the film to guide us wherever we wanted, we hoped for the "Exit" signs of the theater ...
