I honestly do not know what legal or illegal substance they - the writers - were when he wrote this horrid piece of tripe! <br /> <br /> The cast - sucks The plot - sucks Assembly - sucks The whole premise of the film is that a girl with psychic / telekinetic powers encounters a sisterhood of lesbian vampires, you just have to be totally out head to watch even 1 minute of this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I got to see it - it was on here! network as part of a purchase of two images and the film that came after what I wanted to see. I took a quick step forward and was amazed at how stupid the double-speed movie was! <br /> <br /> Do not rent, buy or watch this movie .... the movie vampires do not suck as much as the overall film and production! <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie about lesbian vampires - The Hunger with David Bowie, Susan Sarandon and Katharine Deneuve - great movie to watch / own / rent on the spot of this piece of pure sh * t
