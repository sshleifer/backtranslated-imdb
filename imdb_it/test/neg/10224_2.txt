This film seems to have done for the sole purpose of annoying me. Everything I hate about movies is present: fake sentimentality, extreme sloppiness, bad child actors and much more. This is ignoring the fact that it describes the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football has the shape of a lemon. What?! This is a rugby ball. The story follows a group of non-hopers who get a new teacher they like (which, by coincidence, teaches the class with a short skirt) and makes them interested in football. Of course, they are all disgusting (don't forget, they are not hopes) except a child who has moved from El Paso. Blah Blah, etc. Etc. And the children still do not become good footballers, but the good heart follows and the non-hopers are transformed into a group of boys in the round. Hell, even adults start coming; drunks turn into caring parents, illegal immigrants get into trouble ... they moan. <br /> <br /> This film is played by Steve Guttenberg. Now, before rushing into your local video store to get a copy, hold on a minute. Guttenberg is rubbish. No, no; Come on, let's face it, why was this guy ever in a movie? I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this film to give me an idea. Olivia d'Abo plays Steve and does not impress either. He simply seems to be going through the motions and looking pretty while doing it. Although I have no problems with the second part; his interpretation does not give credit to the film. The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you'd expect from a movie like this. Many of them are disgusting and / or annoying and do not make the vision pleasant at all. There is a goat in the film who plays the mascot and does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't worry about seeing this movie.
