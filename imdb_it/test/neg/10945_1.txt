Now, I like Bollywood movies and I'm very happy to have recently achieved success in the UK. However, Suneel Darshan's latest effort is a deeply flawed film from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a modern Bollywood film on Amadeus was quite exciting, until the two alleged "musicians" did not appear on the scene it seems that they never touched a piece of manuscript in their lives . Upen Patel is a handsome man, and the film plays with his narcissistic sensibility, but he is never credible as a modern Mozart. In terms of acting, all he can do is stand there and pout. His expressions, hair and clothes all look the same, including the scene where he is supposed to be dying, when in reality he seems to have nothing but a slight hiccup. Bobby Deol, playing the role of Salieri, does his best to rekindle that little wooden script that is there but, alas, he comes across a little anger when he is supposed to be furious with jealousy. <br /> <br /> Bollywood films are widely known for their fantastic set-pieces and color combinations, but Shaklaka looks like a dramatic dramatic reproduction of the BBC. In fact, the closest thing that Shakalaka comes to mind is Hollyoaks, because it blatantly hides a really bad script behind the beautiful people who look, well, beautiful. "He has not yet reached mediocrity" - the same can be said for totally forgetful songs. <br /> <br /> In short, Darshan's latest offer has no boom, bang, wallop or twang. Instead he just walks with his head down hoping to get your attention with a light tap on the shoulder. And this is not good enough.
