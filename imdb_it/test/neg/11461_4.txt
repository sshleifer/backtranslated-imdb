This sequel to the above - and the final entry in the "Kharis" series - is slightly more fun overall but is even more elaborate (hell, we even have a bartender / maid singer!): Peter Coe is easily the least charismatic of the various priests Egyptians we saw during these films, and Martin Kosleck as his henchman seems uninterested in the proceedings; Kurt Katch, therefore, is fascinated by a ridiculous accent like the man who discovers princess Ananka, reincarnated: the latter, in the form of Virginia Christine (later a much used character actress) gets her "role" more substantial and, indeed, the sequence of its resurrection from the marshes is a culminating point not only of this film but of the entire series. Unfortunately, even here, Chaney has very little to do as once again the emphasis is on Ananka, as I said; his Mummy (to which he returned more often to Universal - apart, of course, from his starring role in The Wolf Man!) remains, without doubt, his least memorable monster for the studio.
