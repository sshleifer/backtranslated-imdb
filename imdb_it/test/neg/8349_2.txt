As a geology student, this film describes Hollywood ignorance. In the scene where the dog grabs the bone from inside the burning house, it is less than a foot of lava that has an average temperature of 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit. This stupidity is again witnessed when "Stan" goes to save the subway 4. His shoes are melting on the subway floor while the rest of the team is just a few steps away from the flowing lava. And to finish this monstrosity of a film, they come up with the most illogical solution, stopping a lava flow with the K concrete rails. Earlier in the film we hear a journalist's voice saying that nothing can stop the flow that the fire brigade tried with cars and the CEMENT. Common sense dictates that this film is an absurd and gross understatement of human knowledge.
