Altioklar's populist approach manifests itself in all its titles, from the worst to the best. He doesn't care (or has no idea) about art, all he cares about is making people believe they have a kick in the groin by watching his films. The problem is that the effort is too obvious, and while the events unfold with all the senseless exaggeration kneaded over them, the effort fails badly. <br /> <br /> In this "Turkish" film (who knows where the original or originals were created, since it seemed extremely Hollywood to me, Altioklar is trying to be a sort of Tarantino. (Mr. Tarantino, if you are reading this, please watch the film for the best comedy of your life!) It does not use subtle moves to do it, all it does is use extreme things, and it becomes unbearably absurd and laughable. <br /> <br /> Levent "Üzümcü as the forensic guy with cow licked hair is just hilarious. I hope to meet him in person and ask him how he felt himself in this movie. Because I really found the offensive role for him. Even Demet Evgar gropes his genitals "It has been chosen and has done nothing but make everything look fake. Another specifically idiotic aspect of this film was the 100% incorrect rhythm setting. When things have to be taken slowly, the scenes flow abruptly. And other times , it makes you sleepy to see the slow ridicule going on. <br /> <br /> If Altioklar is so deeply in love with the superficial Hollywood superficiality, he should use Michael Sixarrows instead as his name. Even such a move would not be half the ridiculous of what he did in this film. He should first learn not to imitate the directors whose levels he will never approach, then understand that he is not in Hollywood, and then take private lessons from Zeki Demirkubuz or Reha Erdem on how to put the flow of ideas into the plot. This useless film cannot be saved even by those, but perhaps it can make films that can be watched in the future by following these steps. <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw some infamous failures like Propaganda and Otostop and I still can't take it away from saying that this was the worst Turkish movie ever.
