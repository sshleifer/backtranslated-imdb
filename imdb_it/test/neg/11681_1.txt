I rented a copy of this from Netflix - big mistake. The DVD version entitled "The One-Armed Swordsmen" was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be better appreciated when they were all glued together in a single chapter rather than as part of a coherent and sequential story. Part of the story has been left in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the DVD is still a disaster. Don't rent or buy it. Not that there was something wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense. As much as I liked to see Wang Yu at the peak after all these years, this is a complete waste of time. I had dishwashing detergents that made a better film than this. What the cropped DVD version shows us is that, no matter how silly a Chinese script may seem, you have to see a sort of story to interest the way combat sequences are revealed. <br /> <br /> But "The Swordsmen with an arm" offer you the chance to see both Wang and Shaw Brothers, the brave Lo Lieh, who beats the pretty and graceful boy David Chiang - it's always a pleasure to see him happen . He interprets it a sort of bad of the second string here, and serves as a prime example of why some people really need orthodontists. The film is also honored by the participation of Taiwanese actor Chang Yi as a magistrate. <br /> <br /> Another comment above mentions the mandatory scene of the fight in the inn (there are two in fact) where Wang and Chiang are attacked by a pack of comic barbarians who use what appear to be caveman weapons, making Bruce Lee sounds as they fight. None of this makes sense, but it's okay if you don't expect any clarity or common sense. It was still fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Another peculiarity of this production is that there are no significant female characters. There are a couple of female roles, but they don't play a serious role in action or plot. <br /> <br /> If you can find a copy of the original Shaw Brothers One-Armed Swordsman movie, the one that explains why it has only one arm and why it uses a broken sword, try it.
