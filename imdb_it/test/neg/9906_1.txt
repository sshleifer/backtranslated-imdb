This was really terrible. Looking with fascinated horror, I kept asking "why did they do this?" That is, resumed all the scenarios from "The Day after Tomorrow", "The Perfect Storm" and "Twister" and remixing them in a three-hour miniseries, directed by long-time junk TV director Dick Lowry, with every catastrophic clich√© film known to man and not an ounce of true suspense. Many of the casts were unknown Canadians and location shooting was done in Canada, Winnepeg doubled for Chicago, so no doubt tax breaks had something to do with it. Although some ambitious special effects have been attempted, the performance is so poor that you don't get a decent show. Actors can be a competent lot; the script is so bad that no one has had a chance to show it, except perhaps for Randy Quaid as Tommy the Tornado chaser, who went right over the top and that was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, since then the producers have created another of these Canadian disaster turkeys called "Category 7 ?? the End of the World" which has been shown very tastefully on CBS in the States United just a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina. How can the network of Ed Murrow and Walter Cronkite do such a thing? In the early evening? PT Barnum "no one has ever been ruined by underestimating the taste of the public" has proved just once more.
