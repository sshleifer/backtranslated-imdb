How was it a bad idea to redo an almost Oscar-winning movie ?! MOSTHLY MARTHA is MUCH BETTER, has depth, finesse and so on and above all: a wonderful and talented actress in the lead role (Martina Gedeck). It's a joke and ugliness with the handsome Aaron and the whole atmosphere ... again a ridiculous effort by Hollywood. There are more and more remakes and the films are full of schemes. Is there anyone who can create a good and new script? Or is this a security solution for making remakes or movies from well-proven cartoon figures? Movies are becoming much less interesting nowadays. Oh yes: if you want to see a REALLY good movie, look at the original one. It is certainly worth it.
