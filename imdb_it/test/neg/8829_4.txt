I love Japanese movies - having seen at least 100-200. So it's obvious that I'm not afraid of Japanese films. However, sometimes there are Japanese concepts for films that don't fit Westerners well. They could be successes at home, but abroad they simply don't seem, well, normal. It's like the live fish my wife ate during a business meeting or odd PS2 games like dating simulators or Katamari Damacy - things that are accepted there that confuse non-Japanese. This is probably how others see things that Americans take for granted, like American football, fried Snicker bars and Paris Hilton! Well, the king of strange Japanese films that don't seem right to Americans could be simply ATAMA-YAMA. Now the style of animation is not the problem: it is different but quite nice. No, it's the same concept of history and the rather bizarre ending. This is what makes this film really unusual and goes like this: there was a stingy man who, for no apparent reason, had a tree growing out of his head. At first he was a little small and he simply interrupted him, but again and again he grew again - so he decided to let it go. And after a while, people started to live in the head under the shade of the tree. Strangely, while they were under the tree, they were small, but when they left, they were again life-size. Then, after finally getting sick of this and pulling out the tree, the man drowned (!?) In the hole at the top of the head where the tree was! The end. <br /> <br /> See! I told you it was very, very strange - but not in a positive sense like TAMPOPO or HAPPINESS OF KATAKURIS - just strange. O-D-D .... weird! And unless you have a very high tolerance for this sort of thing, I doubt you'll mind knowing that this Oscar-nominated film didn't win. Frankly, this makes me happy, because I DON'T really want this film to stimulate similar films. The only reason why he earns a 4 is due to a pretty but not spectacular animation. <br /> <br /> This film hurt my brain ... I hope it's not a sign that I have a tree!
