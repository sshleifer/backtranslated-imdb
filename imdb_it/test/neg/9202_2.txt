First of all, this film was made in 1978. So this tells you that the film will still be ugly. But I'm not saying that all the old movies are bad. Second, the special effects are terrible even for that time. Finally, the acting was so bad, Bozo The Clown could have done it better. It makes you wonder how people get the money to make movies so pathetic. This movie sucks!
