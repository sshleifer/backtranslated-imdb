After an intriguing start, this little drama quickly descends into the ranks of pure mediocrity. The beginning of the film sees two women (Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) meet while they wait for their boyfriends to come home from their holidays. Natasha Gregson Wagner is an adorable actress and plays Louise; a cute girl whose beloved boyfriend is a well-rounded entertainer; you call it music, film, it does. While telling the other girl, Carla (Heather Graham), about her wonderful boyfriend, it soon becomes clear that the similarities between their two male friends are too many ... and it is obvious that the two girls are dating the same guy . Oh dear. Join Robert Downey Jnr, the slut who has two girlfriends, while a poor boy somewhere has to leave without it. Downey plays the kind of girl that women like, but men find it annoyingly repellent; he is basically a mom's boyfriend. Even the worst kind; on the phone the mother constantly rings, continually making her girlfriends with ambitious promises (even if empty), etc. It's enough to make a normal boy sick. <br /> <br /> The film consciously rips out the upper three-way love triangle films like Jules and Jim. But this film doesn't work; mainly due to the fact that his story is so incredible. Seriously, if two women had just discovered they were dating the same guy ... they wouldn't stop talking about it. Another reason why it falls is that it is so swollen. There is no end to the possibilities for the outcome of the situation that this film presents, especially with the claustrophobia of setting it all in a small apartment; but all that the film does is lost in the masses of dialogue; badly written dialogue and badly delivered, that is. Even the film is massively exaggerated; it is not credible that people behave as they do in this film after finding themselves in this situation. Robert Downey Jnr is one of the many things that are wasted in the film. With Natural Born Killers, he has shown he can play brilliantly funny, and it is something that this movie could be useful for. The two females are not wasted because no one expected it anyway, but Downey could have been better used. Altogether? A waste of time. Don't worry, see Jules et Jim or Natural Born Killers instead. This is my advice
