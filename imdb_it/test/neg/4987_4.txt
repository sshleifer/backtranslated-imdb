Underdog creation story and adventures fighting against Simon Bar Sinister in a live action format. First, Showhine was taken from the street and taken to a scientific experimentation lab where Simon Bar Sinister works. He recovers when Sinister tries to inject him with a chemical and an accident occurs, he gets superpowers and the laboratory explodes wounding Sinister. On the road Shoeshine lashes out against Riff Raff, another dog and is captured by Jim Belushi who was a guard at the lab. Belushi's son discovers that Shoeshine has all these powers and eventually Shoeshine becomes Underdog, who will once again fight Sinister. <br /> <br /> Once you decided that he would be a real dog under the dog, you just limited yourself if the movie worked or not. For me the film works in the middle and in the middle no. The part that isn't all that stuff you see Shoeshine, the dog, like a dog with his master. Some of the answers are fun, but it drags on further as we introduce ourselves to Sweet Polly and her lover and we go through all the typical, let's see what can be done. It's a deadly 20 or 25 minutes and effectively kills the movie. It's painfully boring and it seems like it takes forever to cross it, which considering that the film is 75 minutes without credits, it's something you don't want to do. <br /> <br /> The parts that are good are anything with Simon Bar Sinister (Peter Dinklage is an explosion) and anything in which Underdog goes into action. Some like somehow managed to find a way to be both twisted to the spirit of the cartoon and update it. Of course I could be wrong since the middle section is so boring, but I think not, since I can't wait to resume the end of this on cable. <br /> <br /> Overall it's probably as terrible as some people have said, but if you can expect the cable where you can stumble on the good parts, this is a film adaptation for movies. (But really waiting for the cable)
