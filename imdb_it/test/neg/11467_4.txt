I just went to see this movie with a friend. I quickly looked and read a brief synopsis and thought it sounded interesting. We came out of the cinema not feeling very safe if we didn't like it. <br /> <br /> The acting was pretty good and the connection with the characters was OK. The main character I thought played a lot like someone like Van Helsing. Yes, it was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> But the plot seemed to me to be used by other films. The script was a bit weak, I don't know why every time something bad happens, the main character says "Oh my God" every time. <br /> <br /> The special effects worked well, but (sorry for this spoiler) the main main climax monster reminded me a lot of the Balrok of Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film was OK but it seemed to me that it had already been done. Go see what you buy, but don't expect too much.
