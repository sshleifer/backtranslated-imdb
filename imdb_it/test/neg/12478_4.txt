Lucio Fulci, a director not exactly famous for his subtlety, mischievously challenges his hand to black humor in Touch of Death, a TV movie about Lester Parsons (Brett Halsey), a psychopath who seduces and kills the rich widows for <br /> <br /> Starting with a wonderfully bloody scene in which the lethal lothario has its latest victim through chainsaw, meat grinder and hungry pigs, Touch of Death starts out quite promising, but Fulci soon loses control of the procedure, introducing a strange sub-plot involving a mysterious script killer and some "comic" heavy-hand scenes. There are many other graphic murders that, in true Fulci style, are extremely violent and gruesome, but even the high level of bleeding does not prevent it from being one of Fulci's weakest efforts. <br /> <br /> As I found with many of his other films, an understandable storyline isn't exactly on top of the agenda when Lucio is behind the camera. This film has many peculiarities that have left me more than perplexed: why didn't Lester dispute all his victims using the dismemberment method seen at the beginning? Why are all his victims hairy or disfigured? What the hell ends here? <br /> <br /> Fulci is considered by many to be one of the "greats" of horror cinema; I don't understand his popularity, finding most of his films I've seen so far generally lacking both decent narrative and technical expertise. Touch of Death certainly does nothing to change my opinion.
