While listening to my parents watching this (after giving up 10 minutes in the movie), they have absolutely no idea what's going on. When "Charles Dickens" stared at the camera, I almost expected it to turn into a demon (yes, it looked like one). Unfortunately, this did not happen. <br /> <br /> This movie had various reasons why I didn't finish it: one, it was unbearably slow. I mean, seriously, it was SLOWW. You can only understand 10% of what is said, and the characters have been introduced badly. <br /> <br /> If you have an English accent and you like a LOT to talk, no action, terrible acting, cheesy laughter, and the same sound / music effects played again and again and again, this is THE movie for you ... <br /> <br /> 1/10 - completely horrible. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
