OK, I'm really interested in King's stuff, but this is just terrible. Throughout the film, I expect the main character to do something profound with his new youth and power. I can tolerate the worst of the movies, because everything is better than watching a movie with advertisements in it. but this takes the cake. I gave a 2, and I would never recommend it to anyone.
