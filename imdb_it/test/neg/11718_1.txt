This film provides a cinematic example of the word without value. It's terrible, you can forget the plot or decent acting, because it's not there. And with the dismissal of any decent story or acting or even the trait of being a little terrifying, there's usually only one point in favor of a horror movie. The appeal to those who love soft core porn. This movie doesn't even have that. Women show a little skin, but actually no more than the Xena show says. Except the main star who isn't particularly attractive and has a couple of poor, and I mean poor sex scenes. In short, if you like good films you don't care about this film, if you like cheese you still have no reason to rent this film, if you like erotic and soft core porn you really have no reason to rent this film and, above all , if you appreciate your time in the minimum, you can't do better than avoiding this movie.
