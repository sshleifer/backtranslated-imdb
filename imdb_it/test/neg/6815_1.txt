Like another reviewer, I really wanted to like this movie. I went with my father, who was the greatest lover and supporter of classical music, but none of us could have put up with this film. I wouldn't even call it a movie. A better description could be the recording of some chamber concert pieces. As far as I can remember, the camera never moved. Rather, I sat on a tripod for the entirety of each piece. The only attempts at dramatic effect were at the end of each piece, when the film turned into trees that swayed in the wind or small undulations that lapped a beach. I'm sure the director would have preferred to have used the footage of some very large waves, but the best he could find was a few inches in a nearby lake, and again using a fixed camera. Really pathetic. I can't imagine how anyone can justify the evaluation of this film above five. When we left, my father and I were completely disoriented about how it was possible to make such a bad movie. I don't know any good Bach films. The world really needs it, but just because it doesn't exist is not a reason to see it. Someone will one day. Until then he continues to review _Amadeus_.
