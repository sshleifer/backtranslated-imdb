This was on SciFi last weekend, and I had to take a look. After all ... it was science fiction, with vampires and Erika Eleniak. What could go wrong with this B-movie? <br /> <br /> Very. <br /> <br /> For starters: It can't even be classified as a "B-movie", because it would put it in the same league as Roger Corman ... and this film doesn't even meet its expectations. Most of the money spent was on contact lenses for vampires. <br /> <br /> Secondly: the casting was horrible. Yes, the choice of Udo Kier as captain of the Demeter was a smart move ... but the director clearly could not even convince Kier to memorize his lines. Casting Eleniak, in a vampire movie, is also a smart move because it means that a group of horny guys are about to buy / rent / record this movie to see it seduced by a vampire. But even the director, writer and producer have ruined everything. Sure, they took some money from the poor, unfortunate souls who love watching vampire movies with sexy women in them ... but no one will remember this movie in another two or three years. <br /> <br /> Third: little things that only emphasize laziness in this film. For example, Van Helsing calls a cross with a "crucifix" and, when Mina is put in the coffin, the viewer can clearly see the fact that his "chest" is nothing but cushions. <br /> <br /> Oh and another thing: why did they choose the George Hamiltion-type Dracula instead of something that would have looked pretty scary? Does George Hamilton have a crushing grip on our future? Why didn't everyone who saw Dracula just laugh at him for his awakening? <br /> <br /> A waste of time. Even with a TiVo remote control in hand.
