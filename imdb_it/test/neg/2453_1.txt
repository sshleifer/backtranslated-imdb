I looked at about an hour of this film (against my will) and could not finish it. I would classify it as a 0. The writing was bad, the plot was predictable and the one that was made too many times. The most annoying part of this film was the acting of Melody Thomas Scott. This part didn't require anyone to appear snobbish, but he could in every single scene I saw appear as a snob (harsh) or someone who was about to launch something extremely sarcastic or cruel. <br /> <br /> The two love stories that seemed to turn into something serious almost during the couples' meeting was a bit too much. <br /> <br /> I should know better than watching TV movies. If there is absolutely nothing on television and this is the only choice, read a book.
