I didn't see this film when it originally came out, but there were a couple of songs that share the title and the term is still used from time to time and I thought there was something more, so I dug it out given a view. Now I would like the approximate hour and forty-five minutes of my life (it seemed much longer). There was nothing particularly ugly in the film, the acting was good, there were no big holes in the plot, obviously there wasn't much texture to have holes in it. There wasn't much for the film. There was a little chemistry between the two but nothing irresistible about their relationship; Nothing interesting about their history. Towards the end, when he tries to chase the train to catch his love story on the run, neither my wife nor I wanted him to take it. We honestly thought that they would be better off each other and if they came back together we didn't care. What about this love story when even a romantic twenty-year-old of twenty as my wife had no emotional investment in the relationship. I should have left this in the "lost" category. <br /> <br /> Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html
