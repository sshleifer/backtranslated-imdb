Seriously, science fiction has to stop making films. They are all horrible. And there was John Rhys-Davies in this and he couldn't help the film. Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito) captures the legendary Mexican goat-eater, the chupacabra, and takes him aboard a cruise ship captained by Captain Rudolf (John Rhys-Davies). The creature escapes and begins to kill crew members and passengers. Captain Rudolf and the crew then go after the creature, the ablazin guns. But they can't stop it. So they call in the navy. They can't stop it either. Then it kills all 5 (or at least many of them are there). Then the captain and his daughter along with another boy find out how to kill him. Stay away from this movie. The chupacabra looks incredibly mischievous, the men of the navy shoot at the slightest movement, throw grenades on the ship and the acting is horrible. 3/10.
