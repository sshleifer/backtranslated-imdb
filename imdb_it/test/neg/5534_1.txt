I was very excited when I saw this film in competition at the Montreal Film Festival. Along with Elephant and a few others, I thought that the issue of American arms violence / culture would be treated intelligently and in a compelling fashion for film-goers. The press release promised (in so few words) a "Red Violin" for the firearms public, something to make us reflect on our NRA-shoot-em-up mentality in this country. <br /> <br /> After waiting until 9:15 am to be seated for a screening at 9:00 am (what technical difficulties they would encounter is beyond me), we finally entered the venue to watch the movie on DV (where did the 35MM advertising go?). I think I just answered my first question. <br /> <br /> The result is an aberrant mess. We get the "pistol", in a cartoon with the most unrealistic "biker" I've ever seen (and I know more than a few). The film then turns into irrelevant "character development" just because the characters are or. stereotyped, b. losers, c. stereotyped losers, and / or d) racial caricatures. It takes another 30 minutes to get to the movement of the plot, and once we're there, we want senseless conversations between couples and / or motorcyclists and pedestrian brokers. <br /> <br /> The film finds its conclusion, but not without leaving any clich√©s untried. I didn't care about the white-trash characters that came into contact with the gun, and the depiction of minority characters should immediately make the NAACP scream: all these people are chasing a gun, because they are at the bottom of the social garbage heap and will look an opportunity wherever it was found. at least he would have provided some soul searching on the character side. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is the unsatisfied promise. The plot was fantastic. In the hands of a P.T. Anderson or Gus Van Zandt could have been a powerful piece. But because of the bad script, the management or both, it is an absolute mess that must be ignored at all costs. <br /> <br /> My biggest question is who at MFF thought this was competition material. Better to bury it on Showtime at 3 am. <br /> <br /> Art Blose
