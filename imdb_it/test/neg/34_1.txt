Jacqueline Hyde starts like every other normal day for telemarketing single Jackie Hyde (co-producer Gabriella Hall) until her boss (Robert Donovan) fires her for taking personal calls to work, but not all the bad news like the call was from a lawyer who informed her that her grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) died recently and that he left her his villa and his fortune (why do things like that never happen to me?). Jackie, very excited, heads that way and gets comfortable, as she searches for the thermostat late one night Jackie stumbles into a secret room where her grandfather hides the bright red formula he invented and which allows the drinker to change appearance. Being a little piggy, Jackie finally settles on the glamorous Jacqueline (Blythe Metz), however Jackie's alter ego becomes more complete ... Written, co-produced and directed by Rolfe Kanefsky I thought Jacqueline Hyde was a complete and complete shit from beginning to end and it's so simple and straightforward. According to the opening credits, Jacqueline Hyde was "inspired" by the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", frankly if Mr. Stevenson could see what he was doing to his story here he would turn in his grave. To begin with, I think Jacqueline Hyde was / is destined to be a horror film, the IMDb certainly notes it as such but there is no horror in all of this apart from how bad it is. I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is more a soft-core porn than anything else and extremely domesticated with it, why sit and watch this softer than a soft porn shit when you can look at the right hard-core things that actually deliver the goods? Why, this is the question I ask here. It is not even a good porn, besides being too soft it is boring, boring and the sex scenes not worth mentioning are few and far between. The most intelligent aspect of this film is the title that would have been smart enough if it hadn't been for the fact that another film used the title of Jacqueline Hyde (1998) during the last century and judging by the plot summary of IMDb Sounds a lot better than this piece of junk. This is one of those movies that you have to watch to see how ugly it is but I just hope I never have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> The director Kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but it's not an excuse these days, shot on a digital video camera, the film seems cheap and the few instances of CGI seem to come from a Nintendo Gameboy, the last "shocking" turn has probably the worst morph effect I've ever seen and is good enough for a laugh as is the scene where Jackie's breasts grow through more terrible CGIs. This is something else, the film takes itself too seriously. The subject sucks, it's too predictable and makes it a poor movie, but maybe if the dialogue was intentionally funny with some pornographic chatter the movie could have been more fun to watch, unfortunately it is not. Forget any horror, violence or dignified blood as there is nothing other than a surprisingly bloodless beheading in the end. <br /> <br/> Technically Jacqueline Hyde is a home-made film, photography is of the flat-hand fixed point and variety of shots, music, production design and special effects have a sufficiently low standard to match the film script. The acting was horrible, seriously this is a bad thing. Jacqueline Hyde, in my opinion, is a bunch of crap, there is not a positive thing about this turgid film that comes to mind. A real movie buff will have an almost impossible time trying to find some ransom value in this shit, definitely to be avoided.
