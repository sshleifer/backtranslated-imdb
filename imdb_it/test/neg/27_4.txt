"Cover Girl" is a lousy WWII musical that has absolutely nothing memorable, except for its songwriter, "Long Ago and Far Away". This film came out before Gene Kelly really reached his artistic pace, and while there is evidence of his growing talent here, most of him plays sidekick with Rita Hayworth. And there is the problem Rita Hayworth is wonderful, no doubt. But she is not simply a compelling film presence. I've always found myself eager to like it more than it actually is, and this movie is no exception. She is simply not a very good actress, nor is she a good dancer. As beautiful as it is, there is something vapid about her, and this film suffers because of it. <br /> <br /> Vote: C-
