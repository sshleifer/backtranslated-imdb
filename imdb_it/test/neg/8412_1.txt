I usually try to find good ones in the movies, even the bad ones. Unfortunately this film is one in which I fail miserably - and the fact that there is barely a positive review on this forum shows that many IMDb reviewers share my pain. <br /> <br /> I don't usually watch sequels but I had to see it because I love Rosemary's Baby so much. What a mistake it was. It simply reaffirms my belief that most sequels are bad, although fortunately very few are so bad. Actually in my mind this is not even a sequel, it's a satire on how bad a sequel can be. The film was very well advised not to be seen at any time.
