As a Henriksen fan (I liked the "Millennium" series) and obviously Lorenzo "Renegade" Lamas, I expected at least SOMETHING for this film. Sadly, the plot is predictable, acting is bad and the computer graphics used for most stunts don't work. Sometimes they even seem to have captured some shots of Microsoft Flight Simulator. <br /> <br /> Cinematography also sucks. The useless funky movie camera at first only belittles (from the cheese dialogue) and gives the film an economic appearance, made for the video. It works in hiphop and Jet Li movies, but it seems out of place in this movie. I would have liked this movie 10 years ago. I was 11 then.
