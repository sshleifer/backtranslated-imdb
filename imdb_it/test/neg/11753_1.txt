Hitchcock's original classic has benefited enormously not only from the performance of, but also from the "look" of Anthony Perkins. He has projected a kind of net innocence: a young type of adolescent idol. He was not an actor who had played the bad guys before this; nor was he physically suited to the role of what the public could have imagined as a psychopath, especially in the 1950s, when this ultra-chilling aspect of mental illness (divided personality psychosis) was relatively unexplored in the film. Which is exactly why the casting of him as Norman Bates was a slice of Hitchcock's true genius. The public was taken aback to put it simply. <br /> <br /> That is why this re-creation does not work, although a little, although we try to be an exact copy. While Anthony Perkins looked like someone you never thought was a serial killer, Vince Vaughn is easily imaginable as one. He lacks Perkins' fragile gaze and his costume designers are clearly inferior, at least in this role (honestly - was there ever an actor who could convey nervousness as genuinely as Anthony Perkins?). Even if it was a useless remake, the disquisition of the most important character in the story completely sucks in this film. <br /> <br /> As a side note, I feel that the propensity of Hollywood to redo great films because "young" people refuse to look at everything that is not filmed in color, not only does it smell like high heaven corporate greed, but it is exceptionally disrespectful to the original work. As for viewers who can't watch in black and white - it's their loss. We hope they will mature in the future and will no longer require bright colors to get their attention. When they do they will find that sometimes black and white works much better. With the attenuated background, the plot and the performances are much more frontal and central. And in many cases the atmosphere or atmosphere created through black and white cinematography is simply not reachable in color.
