If you are a guy who loves fairytale "real life" adventures, watch it. If you are a guy who loves children's movies, why not see it? :) If you are a parent who goes to watch a movie with your children, you are better off opting for the squirrel! <br /> <br /> The beginning of this film was a bit fun, and gave the best conditions for the events. But after the kind of funny introduction of characters, settings and potential conflicts, the story turned out to be a bit boring. When more or less the same things happen for the third and fourth time, the word "predictable" repeatedly comes to mind just like the parts of a dented LP or those advertisements I really hate. And the culmination of the plot ... * oh sigh * ... poor, poor, poor!
