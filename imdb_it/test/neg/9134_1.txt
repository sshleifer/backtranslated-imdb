Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are both beautiful films, but this latest installment of the trilogy is a big disappointment. They were taken away with repertoire material and photography, so little content. The executive producer puts his image in the film ... It's simply pretentious. Maybe if they had more than $ 3 million to spend maybe it would have been something. In fact, I thought Steven Soderbergh directed it because it was so bad, but Godfrey Reggio, the director of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, directed it. I have to assume that they didn't have the budget to make a decent movie. You would think that Francis Ford Coppola wanted to be part of this film and help get more money together.
