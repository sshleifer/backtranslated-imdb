This should not have been turned into a movie. Everything was idiotic and I don't think I once laughed either. There were pieces and pieces that were fine I think, but that's all. Many parts were surprisingly similar to many other films that made them much better. There were some famous actors / actresses in this, but no one did a good job, they simply had to take care of it. This is one of those films that tries to have a "cute" ending but was so idiotic that it literally had no ransom value. Carrot Top is probably the worst comic out there right now. Do yourself a favor and keep from it! <br /> <br /> Final decisions: <br /> <br /> Film: NOOOOO! <br /> <br /> Buy DVD: Absolutely not! <Br /> <br /> Rental: only if you've seen EVERYTHING else and you have a free coupon, but again it's not worth it.
