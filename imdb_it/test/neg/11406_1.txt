Demon Wind is as much fun as breaking your legs. It's definitely a terrible example of a movie. It's so terrible that I don't even consider it a movie. I describe it more as a thing ... a monstrous thing. Something that must be stopped at all costs. My friends and I first discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of videotapes at my friend's house. It was a late evening and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some bad horror movies (unfortunately we chose this one.) Well, during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost have threw up . The thing is literally useless in every sense of the word. It's just an economic and badly made scam of the Evil Dead. The whole "story" seems to be nothing more than a boy who wants to throw his friends down by inviting them into an abandoned house and letting the demons tear them to pieces. I bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed. I've seen bad horror movies before (Manos, Troll 2, HOBGOBLINS !!!) (shudder). I must say that Demon Wind could certainly compete with all these films in terms of pure stupidity. Just watch it if you enjoy laughing at silly movies. <br /> <br /> Fun fact: this movie is like a cockroach on steroids! Just like the Ouija board, every time we try to get rid of it, it always seems to mysteriously reappear. Kind of scary eh?
