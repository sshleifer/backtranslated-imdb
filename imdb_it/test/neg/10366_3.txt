This film has some flaws and most of these flaws is the lack of anything to happen. Probably the biggest film to show the roughness in Fly-Over Country, "Rolling Kansas" is a film in which nothing happens and nobody cares. Like life, it starts, moves, and then ends. Some attempts at humor are made, but everything becomes very flat. The occasional cameo simply reminds the viewer that they could waste their lives doing something besides watching this movie and the only rock song they bought and used in every single instance. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and go see a good movie. This is free and repeated frequently on Comedy Central because nobody went to see it, nobody wants to see it, and it is marginally better than the dead air. Not with damn praise, but it's worth listening to the rock song of the movie. Too bad the film is not worth watching.
