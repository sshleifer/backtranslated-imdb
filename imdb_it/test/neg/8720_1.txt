This is a piece of total shit. It's an insult to the fantastic book by Frank Herbert. They destroyed the story and the characters. Acting is medium to bad. The only character done well and played well is Duke Leto, played by William Hurt. Unfortunately, he dies quite early in history and then it's all downhill from there (not that it's a very high hill to begin with). <br /> <br /> The 1984 movie was directed by the legendary David Lynch. I wasn't too impressed by the film, but considering the technological limitations of the time, they did their best. Surprisingly, the small series of shit makes it seem a lot better by comparison. He was at least somewhat faithful to the book, which I really love. <br /> <br /> They had the chance to do it this time, unfortunately it was not taken.
