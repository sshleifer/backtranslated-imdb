There are rumors that a fourth Underworld is about to happen. If so, that the third part, which is also a prequel, would be in the middle of the franchise. With prequels that happen to the original films, you always ask yourself in what order you should watch the movies, so that it makes sense ... <br /> <br /> In this case, I imagine it doesn't matter much. The third Underworld movie is not up to the other two. They also had their obvious flaws, but this lacks a few things and seems like a profit. It seems that he is not going full throttle, which is a shame, because surely the actors could have used better material to work with. <br /> <br /> The story is OK, but it's nothing special. A beautiful film, but Rhona Mitra could not fill Beckinsale's shoes (yes, she plays another character, I mean the void, which Kate B. left) ...
