I took it during a short run in a theater in Philadelphia. Despite his local provenance (and his relationship with a tragedy from his hometown, namely the grueling death of Eddie Polec in 1994), I really need to get down to it. The director, for reasons better known to him, has decided to shoot the entire film in a guerrilla style, with steady hand cameras and rapid cuts. This technique could work for scenes of violent violence, but it is absolutely inappropriate for the rest of the material, which makes up most of the film. A walk along the sidewalk, a brother-to-brother discussion on a sofa, hell, even a kiss on a first date are all filmed in cusinart style, distracting this viewer from entering the drama. Martin also subtracts his narrative tracing too many arguments: in addition to the birth of violence by the mafia, we have anorexia, alcoholism, divorce, racism, abuse of parents ... did I miss something? No doubt a better cast (and a better focused direction) would have combined these threads together, as Martin surely intended, to show how a moral flaw carries in and sustains a myriad of others ... but good intentions are not necessarily a great film they do. Just a messy mess. Martin, I know you're from my city, and I'm down with you, I'm really ... I just do a better job next time, like you did with Two Plus One.
