I'm sure I saw FUTURE KILL for the same reason as most people: the fantastic poster by HR Giger. And like everyone, I was disappointed to see that the film could not match the poster (Giger said that director Moore actually begged him to do it). When I first saw him at the age of 14, I thought it was the worst movie ever made. I still think that if I hadn't seen some movies on MST3K since then. <br /> <br /> The plot has a bunch of boring college kids leading into the "mutant city" to kidnap a gang leader for their fraternity. That's when they meet Splatter (Ed Neal), a mutant / cyborg / psycho who kills the leader of the gang and blames the friars as an excuse to drive them out and take power. The rest of the film consists mainly of chases. A hand full of friars tries to get out of the mutant city (which I think should be LA, even if it was made in Texas). There is something pseudo-political about the frat brothers' society being pro-nuclear weapons and the mutant society is anti-nuclear. There is talk of how Splatter has become a phenomenon due to radiation. Most people develop cancer from radiation, but they simply squirt shoots and slaughter the girls. Yes, this makes sense. At one point, our heroes save a mutant girl from two pro-nuke cops, and she shows them "how she lives the other half." The other half, it turns out, are all punk boys who dance around a pop band from the 80s. So our little epic is both stupid and dated. This is really all there is to it. Frat boys who run into messy buildings while guys who look like bikers try to kill them ... Oh, and it's the future. <br /> <br /> I don't think you'll have any doubts about why Ron W. Moore never made another film. This thing is a real stink. If you like Giger, buy his books (they have the poster without the horrors of the film), or look at ALIEN again. FUTURE KILL is a waste of time that nobody needs. <br /> <br /> If this description makes the image healthy, there is another lousy film that does the same thing, only bigger and better: AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK. It's crap, but it blows FUTURE KILL from the screen.
