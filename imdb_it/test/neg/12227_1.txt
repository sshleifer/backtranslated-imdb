We arrived at the theater too late to see Rendition, which was our intention, and "The Comebacks" was the only film that had not started yet. I had the impression of how bad a film was after reading the short sequence on the ticket counter. The theater was empty when we arrived and only two other people entered before the film began. <br /> <br /> The writers and the director have thrown every imaginable clich√© on the sport onto the audience without creating a single laugh, not one during the entire movie. Think of all the football films that have been made and the millions of dollars that schools and fans spend each year on football and you realize how mature it is to be parodied or given back. If you add Texas to the mix, you should find the sports version of "Little Miss Sunshine", not a big yawn. <br /> <br /> The first film that came to mind when we left the theater was 'You can't stop the music' In comparison, this was 'Can not stop the Music' without Bruce Jenner, Valerie Perrine, or the Village People. <br /> <br /> If the film had a single note of grace, he was seeing Matthew Lawrence grown up.
