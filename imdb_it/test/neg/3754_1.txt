Full disclosure: I was born in 1967. At first the premise tickled me, after all, if you were a teenager growing up in the Reagan age, a journey into oblivion was worth a laugh or three. Pop Rocks, Atari and Rock 'em Sock' em Robot? Beloved, not * despite * the fact that they were stupid, but * because * they were stupid and foolish and funny. But when VH1 decided to make the series "I Love Last Tuesday", I knew it was enough. Does Goes Hal Sparks have nothing better to do than read from a teleprompter like Slinkys idiots? (Wait, let me check ... hmmm, no. No, it doesn't look like it.) Slimness, arrogant drunkenness, posture has its place, but enough!
