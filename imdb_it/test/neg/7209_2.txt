SPOILERS: The original Road House is one of those films that I know to be clich√© and not original, yet it's done so well, I'm embarrassed to admit that I really like it. It turns out that many of my friends, whose opinions on films I respect, think the same way. So when they try to make a sequel and it's like it was written by some high school kids who have been given the right to make a sequel, it's just bad; Really, very bad. <br /> <br /> Strangely, Johnathon Schaech is listed as one of the writers and I can only hope that his WGA registration will be revoked. The screenplay was very bad and all the authors of this film should retire for complete lack of originality and for some of the worst dialogues in this millennium. Schaech already seems to be the king of the straight-to-DVD sequel (8mm 2, Poison Ivy 2) and now after seeing this and 8mm 2, I'm thinking his acting ability is non-existent. It was horrible, just awful. <br /> <br /> And it's not the terrible fighting scenes that make this movie terrible, but take it from me, it's bad. Each combat scene is a slowly released fist (but continues to emit the "wiff" sound in the air) which is then blocked by the opponent, who returns a punch that sends the first guy to the ground. This is repeated throughout the film, worse than any bad 70s show. Or the fact that many of the people involved in the fighting seem to have a mouth full of cherry aids for some reason. And we should believe that Will Patton is a fighting machine; his fighting scenes seem so incredibly fake that I honestly was embarrassed to look. <br /> <br /> It is the complete lack of logic in this ridiculous film that makes it terrible. For example: the character of Johnathon Schaech is in town for a day and already tells a girl that he barely knows who has no idea which way it is, "I'm with the feds, but don't tell anyone." The wicked woman, who fights the good girl in an acrobatic fighting scene that rivals any superhero, yet is easily restrained by Will Patton, "old", in another scene simply by holding both hands while pronouncing some ridiculous line ( "stab me once, shame on me, stab me twice, it won't happen", no, it's ugly) and then he throws it out. Jake Busey's villain shoots the feds while he is caught in the middle of a drug deal, yet no DEA agent or anyone simply picks him up after he is actually simply released because "this is the sheriff's territory". Busey wants the bar because he is "in a great position" for the drug business, yet his house looks just as good apparently offering all the benefits the bar should have. The character of Johnathon Schaech should be the son of the character of Patrick Swayze in the original, yet the surname of the character of Swayze is Dalton and that of Schaech is not (nor is he the alleged brother of the character of Swayze). And Johnathon Schaech looks like about 50 in this movie. I've looked up, he's 17 years younger than Swayze, but he looks awful. <br /> <br /> But my favorite absolutely stupid scene in this film was the most famous fighting scene that ended up in the movies: the villain is defeated by a window on a second floor and while looking down I'm thinking "please don't tell me it's impaled on something ..." and sure enough, my worst fears were realized. <br /> <br /> Actually, I could go on for another half hour about the things I hated about this movie. Suffice it to say that we end these ridiculous straight-to-DVD sequels of theatrical films, at least those with Johnathon Schaech.
