An impressive sight, and some hot chicks with swords flying around, oh and even those hypnotic Chinese violins ... Let me think, "Crouching tiger, hidden dragon"? <br /> <br /> I liked CTHD, with its simple simplicity and well-developed characters, which still leave enough space for you to enjoy the vision without having to think about DEEEPAA. It means that it is. <br /> <br /> "Hero" on the other hand is painfully pretentious and demanding both visually and conceptually. The greatest moral of life was horrible. I mean, sacrificing your life, sacrificing your beliefs, sacrificing your love so that your powerful nation can succeed ???? WTF ?? <br /> <br /> No thanks. <br /> <br /> Ma, hay, Mao and G.W.B. would be proud! <br /> <br /> Viva
