I can only think of a reason why this film was released. To capitalize on the imminent fame of Guy Pearce. This film has no value and unnecessarily destroys the memory of Errol Flynn. The homosexual encounter was pure speculation. The contempt shown for Flynn in this film is palpable. A simple way to slander an actor who died years ago. Horrible and embarrassing. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time in this total junk. Watch my evil wicked ways if you want to get to know this good actor or read his autobiography. This movie is NOT the way.
