This filthy sound film by Harold Lloyd doesn't have to laugh, and one wonders if this Lloyd is the same one that made all those silent and delicious. <br /> <br /> Lloyd's male sympathy becomes insane and limping when we can hear him speak, and a slow and restrained rhythm replaces the funny antics of his silences. Lloyd plays a young son of a missionary who grew up in China and then finds himself transplanted to the modern city of New York with no idea how life works outside his Chinese village. He finds himself an unlikely winner in the elections for the mayor and quickly attracts the ire of all government organizations because he refuses to look the other way in the face of rampant corruption. When framed in an attempt to make him fall, he decides to play dirty like everyone else, and stages a false execution of every crook in New York as an intimidating tactic. This darkly satirical ending feels out of place alongside anything else in the film, but it is the only part of the film that comes to life remotely. Everything else is boring. <br /> <br /> I don't like having to admit that a Harold Lloyd film fails, because I like it so much, but I have no choice with that. <br /> Grade: D
