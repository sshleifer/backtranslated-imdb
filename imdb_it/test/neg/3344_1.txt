This film is so unreal. French films like these are just a waste of time. Why watch this movie? I didn't even know ... why? What? The famous sibling sex scene? Although the sex scene is so real and explicit, but the story on which it is based is so unreal. What's the use, then? Can you easily find in life, little brother doing things like that? <br /> <br /> Did I learn anything from this movie? Yes: some people love spending time making films, stories like that, nonsense. But for those who like nihilism, nothing in life, or just a hopeless life, then here you are ... you have to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Only one worthy of adoration, though: CATHERINE DENEUVE. She is such an extraordinarily beautiful woman.
