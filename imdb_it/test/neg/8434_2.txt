And one of them is a bad movie. The title, as it turns out, refers to a killer of the human male variety, not to the fish. This is not the "Piranha" directed by Dante of '78 (which had fish) and is also known as "Piranha, Piranha". A trio of photographers, 2 men and a woman, befriends a local hunter / hunter named Caribe somewhere in the Amazon jungle. Unfortunately, they are not familiar with the film curriculum of William Smith, who plays Caribe; otherwise, they would know immediately that he was the villain of the piece. Smith may have even refused to film the ending or cut before the shoot was over (see the end of this comment). <br /> <br /> As mentioned elsewhere, this photo has a lot of filler - long photos of the local fauna (birds) - and the central piece, a motorcycle race, which lasts too long. The reason he gets a second star from me is, of course, William Smith, who can't really save this mud, but again shows why he was the "go to" guy 30-35 years ago if you needed a nasty rogue ; at its best, Smith could be really terrifying. He is the type who likes to kill, possibly in a sadistic way, and you get that sense of the evil grin that he usually puts on when a mood hits him. Physically, it is very impressive, and you know that the other 3 characters are practically doomed within the first half hour. This is what Smith brought to most of his roles; it seems hopeless for the other characters against this human monster. Unfortunately, the film continues to confuse things until the end, as if a minute of shooting was lost - a confused and incomplete climax.
