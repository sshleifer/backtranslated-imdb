I think this program is a bunch of junk. All they do is argue and slap one another in the face and call this acting ?! These people get paid a lot of money for this and most of them can't even take action to save their lives. Also, the stories are horrible and after watching them for a few minutes, I get bored. I like the way Harry Hill takes the mickey on his TV program "TV Burp", e.g. the weak joke "The princess and the pea isn't exactly Shakespeare is it?" who had Sonia and Naomi in points. I don't see how funny it is. I think this is a waste of everyone's money for their TV license, so this can be shown 4/5 days a week. Is there nothing better than this?
