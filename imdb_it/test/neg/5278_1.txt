I've seen a lot - maybe too many straight-to-video movies, without a budget and I've developed a taste for the "good guys", or those that are less crappy, however ridiculous it seems, hahaha. DR. CHOPPER, that's what I kindly refer to as ... absolute shit. Nothing is fun - acting sucks, characters suck, the killer sucks, blood is minimal ... and sucks. It is a group of college friends who go to a newly discovered family hut, owned by the parents of one of the children. It is thought to be a relaxing retreat, but little they know that a former plastic surgeon suffering from death - gone bad, along with his two assistants, is looking for tissue that can be used to save the doctor. He has been called Dr. Chopper since he is out on a motorcycle and, of course, with his ribs. This is just a terrible movie, not worthy of anyone's time. Enough said.
