Hubie - like Stanely the troll of Bluth's A Troll in Central Park - lacks the spark of personality to be the main character carrying an entire movie. We should like him because he's cute, but that's all he is. <br /> <br /> His character design is unattractive. The upper part of his head is a sort of narrower dome than the plump lower half of his head. <br /> <br /> And penguins shouldn't have teeth. I know that Iago, Aladdin's parrot, had teeth, but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor, Gilbert Gottfried. Hubie, with his little voice (provided by Martin Short), looks funny with that big set of chompers in his beak. <br /> <br /> Tim Curry, who is usually delicious to be bad, makes a kind of a happy surfer dude accent like bad (it may have been a good voice for a comedic comforting accomplice, not the alleged bad main) . <br /> <br /> The whole plot revolves around the love of the hero and the villain for the female penguin Marina, who is as boring as both her suitors. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is the rhythm. We continue to cut the wicked to see him threaten even more Marina - this time in dialogue, this time in the song ... Barry Manilow could be a great composer, but in animated films like this and Thumbelina, his songs feel floppy and listless - especially the ballads. The only song I liked was the song "Good Ship Misery" from the 1930s. <br /> <br /> I read that the distributor made some cuts in this film against the director's wishes, and this could have caused some of the problems - although I suspect the real problem is that they didn't cut the rest; ).
