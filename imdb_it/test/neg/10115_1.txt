At what point does a film become so bad that it's okay? Exciting in its terrible nature, Darkhunters stands out as a brilliant example of cinematography c ** p and for that reason alone, it probably deserves a sort of prize. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the old battle of Paradise and Hell for the unclaimed souls of the recently dead. In the case of Darkhunters, the representatives of good and evil manifest themselves variously as a pack of cats, a hooded figure of the Grim Reaper with a face of flickering flames similar to a charcoal electric fire, a Philip Marlowe-a-like with a serious bad manicure and a female psychologist who seems to be leaving Kwik-Save. <br /> <br /> The protagonists are competing for the soul of a newly dead teacher who spends most of the film around a field of fog and strangely, a kennel for boarding in an attempt to escape the his pursuers. <br /> <br /> The plot is thinner than a diet sandwich without character development or attempt to create suspense. Acting is ridiculous, comparable to a school play - although it would be an insult to many schools. And the dialogue .......... oh, how my hips hurt! With the unclaimed souls of the dead being described as "unwanted gherkins of life" by the fiery flame demon, you wonder if Hell is really a McDonald's. <br /> <br /> But it is strangely irresistible, you find yourself looking just to see how bad it can be - in just over 80 minutes, it's worth the time spent on involuntary giggles.
