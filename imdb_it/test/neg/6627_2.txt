Or at least a forced retreat! This film is horrible, horrible, terrible, rancid, rotten ... well, you have an idea. NEVER look at this rotting piece of trash unless you have a death wish, because it will surely kill you. (I survived only because I lost the first half hour.) Carrot Top is a bad comedian and an even worse actor. I CAN'T BELIEVE you got someone to finance this huge waste of time and money. This shows that some people have no qualms if they think they could make a buck or two (literally ... I can't imagine that this made more than $ 2!). <br /> <br /> And someone please tell me what possible reason Courtney Thorne Smith (a decent actress halfway, certainly above all that) had to sign on this pile of steaming dung. Was she the one who was bored during that 3.5 second dry period between Melrose Place and Ally McBeal? Or did he owe some karmic debt with the most annoying person on the Face of the Planet (aka Carrot Top)? <br /> <br /> I give him a 2/10, and it's probably too high. I try to save my "1s" for the films that make me sick, and since I didn't see all this the contents of my stomach remained content. I don't think I'll watch it again to find out if it's really worth 1!
