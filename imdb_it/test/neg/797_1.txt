Be careful, the next time you see "Richard Kelly" involved in any production, run away. Fast. <br /> <br /> Kelly proved to the world after his latest film, "Southland Tales", which is a pretentious director. He was indulgent and twisted. Not much has changed in "The Box". <br /> <br /> I can imagine what his field would have been for Warner Bros, and I bet the studio executives ate it to the core: a feature film based on one of Richard's old Matheson stories "Twilight Zone ". <br /> <br /> Big mistake! Don't read anymore unless you don't want this movie to be COMPLETELY spoiled for you: <br /> <br /> Norma (Cameron Diaz) presses the button. <br /> <br /> We find out that Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) has an alien who uses his body as a ship to conduct "experiments" in which the fate of humanity rests. His face is scarred because he was struck by alien lightning, which killed him, but then brought him back to life to do all this testing with the red buttons. Obviously since Norma presses the button, knowing perfectly well that someone could die, she must suffer the consequences for not having considered someone else's life for her. Eventually she and her husband (James Marsden) choose to kill Norma instead of raising their deaf and blind son. <br /> <br /> Kelly dances around the "message" of her film, trying to make the public understand what the moral of the story is. Obviously, every person with a brain says at the beginning "And if I were the dying person?" Richard Kelly doesn't even let his character have this normal HUMAN conversation. In reality, they avoid it all together. They both seem educated, work in a prestigious school and also for NASA, so why wouldn't they both have a better ability to LOOK OUT OF THE BOX ??? <br /> <br /> If he had the principal the characters actually have this conversation, the whole movie could have ended up right there! Instead, we have to watch marriages go on forever, NASA and the NSA take pleasure in Arlington Stewart taking on these government programs, teleporting to show Marsden's life beyond our world, so it will be "easier" to kill her wife, and the drones controlled by Steward who can be anywhere and anywhere, at any time. <br /> <br /> The most painful part of this film is the rhythm. Nothing happens. It is a mixture of confused ideas that are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It is unbearable how this film is marketed. Advertisements make it seem "Saw" and even use the music of those movies to sell it. Actually what you get is a slow, boring, ridiculous (yes, half of the theater laughed at the visual and acting effects), and a messed up film that is neither imaginative, interesting, nor cohesive. At one point, Cameron Diaz and her son are kidnapped and then suddenly, she is back in the NSA's big black car with her husband as he returns home. Where she went? Why did they take it? Do we really care? You will no longer not do it. <br /> <br /> In the end you don't really care what happens to any of the characters. You'll be rooting for all of them to die so the movie will end. Go see whatever else is playing. Don't waste time or money.
