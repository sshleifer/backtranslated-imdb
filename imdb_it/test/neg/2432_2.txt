All this show is, it's the same plot. Kuszko (spelling?) Is in danger of failing school, he needs to pass to become emperor. He needs to learn something, he thinks it's stupid, then he uses / learns more about it and realizes that he's not that stupid. Eezma, pretending to be the headmaster, tries to turn Kuszko into an animal to stop him. Each episode. <br /> <br /> The film's lines are copied (Eezma's incredibly complicated plans, Kuszko constantly breaks the 4th wall, the squirrels.) They should try to hire some writers. <br /> <br /> 2/10
