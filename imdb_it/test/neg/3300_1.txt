There are shows and movies I saw and later I read reviews on IMDb.com that I disagree with, and I was happy to accept that there was only a difference of opinion. <br /> <br /> Positive reading of reviews of this filth only reminds me of a sinister conspiracy involving the employees of the television network that is ordered to surf the Internet, posting unconvincing reviews for the programs for which they are responsible. <br /> <br /> How else would you explain a review by saying that this show is "sure to become a phenomenon" a year after it became clear that it will be nothing of the kind? <br /> <br /> I will not waste words describing this mess, but it is enough to tell me if you like wives who highlight their husbands, husbands who evoke their children, children who do not respect their parents and absolutely no other way to behave or subtext to legitimize characters that are simply vomiting automata that drive away automata, so watch this sh ow. <br /> <br /> I, on the other hand, have DVDs of Seinfeld to pass. <br /> <br /> Futurama - Canceled. TItus - Canceled. Development stopped - Canceled. The War At Home - Renewed. <br /> <br /> No justice.
