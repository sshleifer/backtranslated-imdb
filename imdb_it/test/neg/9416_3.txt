Mario Van Peebles tries to follow the route Jean-Claude Van Damme and plays a renegade robotic soldier who is absent from AWOL, however the government will not make him lie down, so among the simplistic plot Van Peebles protects the villagers from the rebels and defeats an improved version of himself in this disappointing film. This obvious Universal Soldier rip-off (which is a lot more fun than that) simply isn't going anywhere. The main problem is that the film is so incredibly inert. Van Peebles only waits and there is not enough calcium to justify a vision. On the other hand, the film resembles a competent version of R.O.T.O.R. although where that terrible bad movie was hilarious, this only produces occasional laughter in its ridiculously unconvincing action sequences. Even as R.O.T.O.R it makes no sense in his narrative and basically the film is incredibly boring. Furthermore the villains are disappointingly weak and basically the film needs a scenario of real action to work, because the material is too boring. In all aspects, Solo is a very weak film. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on 4 (Poor)
