I'm not going to worry about mentioning any plot - this is strictly a B movie on the road to darkness. The shock to me, though, is to see what has become of some of the actors in this film. Erika Eleniak, never like any other person who would call a thespian, seems to have turned into Anna Nicole Smith (in her great period). Daniel Bernhardt - I almost shed a tear. He has always been one of my favorites for his martial arts skills, as seen in the Bloodsport series (even in the B series films, but, if you like martial arts, eminently watchable). Here, it's a shell of his previous self-confidence, he's older, but he does the mercenary thing and doesn't even seem interested ... I just don't understand. Don't these people invest? William Forsythe is another "heavy" that I've always liked, but his last different roles are the ones you'd call "sending him". I won't even talk about Mr. Reynolds - his concert here is a gimmick, nothing else. The only winner is Andrew Divoff, as usual a creepy villain, bad, pockmarked with a sandpaper voice that can curdle milk - the best kind! This is a film that you look to laugh. There is nothing else.
