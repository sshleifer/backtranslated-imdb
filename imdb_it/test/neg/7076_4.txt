I'm working in a video store so I got to see it for free - thank god, if I paid for it the review would have been less forgiving. <br /> <br /> well, the main idea of ​​the film (geeky the girl takes a bloody revenge) is not all that is original, there are several parallels with "carrie" (playing a joke about a loser, except for a good girl who is actually sorry for her, tamaras and brings bad family background). I still think it's a fun idea for the trashy teen horror movie, unfortunately they didn't take much advantage of the potential here and rather put the accent on all the wrong things. <br /> <br /> what worked: I liked the actress who played the tamara. she was beautiful (when it was hot) and her cheeky lines were fun ("Sean can't come on the phone, it's f ** king patrick!"). <br /> <br /> what didn't work: the whole wicca thing was silly. Generally I prefer rational explanations (he could have plotted the whole thing with his teacher or one of the boys to get his revenge). there were a lot of logical sets and the blood looked really ugly (when the boy cut his ear and tongue - please !!!) <br /> <br /> the idea was not related to the buzz of darkness, but I think they wasted the comic and the potential for suspense they had. it was bearable but far from good!
