This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Boring, illogical, terrible Don't waste even a minute in your life to see this shit! I hope the filmmakers don't make any other films because this film sent them bankrupt. The film seems to be created in one or two days with some friends of the directors (if we can use this word for these 2 boys). They only use the camera in their hands. Many scenes are in darkness and nothing can be seen. A lot of scenes (80% of the film) are only with conversation. ! There are films like Vampire Vs. Zombies on which you can laugh, but this is simply bad, it makes no sense to make films like that. Please stop Jason Horton and Shannon Hubbel. Don't make more movies!
