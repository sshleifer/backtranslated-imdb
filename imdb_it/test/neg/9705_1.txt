Sorry to say but I was disappointed in the film. It was very hasty, as I suppose you could understand that a film-length version of Pride & Prejudice would be and I felt that many of the main scenes were ignored just to go through the story. Since the film is so hasty, unfortunately you are not able to know and really feel very well for each of the characters. <br /> <br /> Not only that, this film is boring. I say this with a capital B. 1/3 I started yawning and couldn't wait for the film to end. Since I read the book and watched the BBC version, I knew how many scenes had to go before I could finally leave the cinema. Mr Darcy, whoever is in this film, surely can't act. He seems too young to play the role of Mr Darcy. Every word that comes out of his mouth is hurried as if he needed to get past the script or something. Where is the accumulation? At first, he seems confused with everything. He is simply bizarre! It all seems set. <br /> <br /> I was trying not to compare to the Colin Firth version, but if you love that version, you will most likely be disappointed anyway. <br /> <br /> The costumes are absolutely shocking. Where are the corsets? I know Elizabeth is poor, but I think she still knows how to dress like a woman, and she wasn't raised in a squaller. His clothes indicate that he could be the poorest peasant in England. <br /> <br /> I disagree with a couple of scenes from the film in that I don't think it would be considered appropriate in that society for men to do things like that, honestly Mr. Bingley who has wealth should know better. There are some things that are said to be too modern for the time this film is set, and not at all like Jane Austen. The character of Bingley is shocked, for me he acts like a simpleton, not a character to love and respect. How about that laugh of his !!! The Wickham has just one presence and Mr & Mrs Hurst and a couple of other characters have no presence. Keira did well, but it's not the same.
