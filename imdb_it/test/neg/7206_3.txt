OK I gave this three to three! It only deserves a star without asking questions. <br /> <br /> If you look seriously at the film and consider it a legitimate B-Horror film of yes, it will get a star. But I think it's obvious in the first few minutes of the movie what we're dealing with is a piece of shit. <br /> <br /> With this film I and the friend with whom I watched it could turn it off and put on something more "Hollywood", but instead we decided to tear all this film from beginning to end. We laughed so many times that I was almost watching a play. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible ..... The effects and the death sequences are so bad .... The complete story sucks .. ... <br /> <br /> But the fact that they are trying to make a serious horror film ... Too bad! <br /> <br /> The most memorable part for me is when two of the characters are walking into an alleged "dark basement" which is clearly lit up, and pretending not to be able to see the bones hanging from the bahahahaha ceiling crash just terrible ..... <br /> <br /> So if you want to laugh how bad this movie is, along with the fact that it was made in 2004 that you see this movie .... <br /> <br /> Wait why am I writing so much? nobody knows about this movie ... I doubt anyone will even read this hahahaha.
