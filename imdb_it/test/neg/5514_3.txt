As many posters have "hinted", this is a repugnant "Star Wars". Now if you're going to rip "Star Wars" at least do it right; "Battlestar Galactica" did, and there were some other space works that didn't do a bad job, but this is definitely not one of them. David Mendenhall, the young condottiere, is actually not bad, although he occasionally leaves the "cute" factor. Vince Edwards hasn't improved much as an actor since "Ben Casey"; if anything, it is even more than wood of ten. The other performances are also nothing to write about. Even worse are the special effects; the best you can say about them is that they are bad. It is evident that the "aliens" are simply actors wearing rubber masks with some foam or latex on them, and the "battle" scenes between Edwards' raiders and the aliens are poorly staged and badly affected . A very weak effort by Roger Corman. Salta.
