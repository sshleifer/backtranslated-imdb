I own this movie. And it's terribly hard to find. This is an exceptional low-budget film about a doctor looking for the perfect companion. He has really humorous low budget sentiment, and the blood is surprisingly good for what appears to be a $ 500 budget. The director is considered the master of blood. I wouldn't go so far, but maybe it was in his day. A total of 6/10 on the gore chart.
