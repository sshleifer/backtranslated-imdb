I wish I had something more positive to say about Devil Fish, but honestly I can't think much. I can't even invent many of those "so bad, it's good" moments. Devil Fish is simply bad old. The plot is completely derivative (Jaws, anyone?), The acting is wooden, the characters are not interesting, the special effects are beyond the bad ones and the score is annoying. Add to this the seemingly inept direction of Lamberto Bava and you have a bit of a movie stench. I think, however, that the biggest sin of the film is the lack of a budget. It doesn't seem that Bava has had much to work with. In 1984, the Italian film industry was in decline ?? especially with regard to genre films. The funding available for Bava was probably very low. Movies like Devil Fish based on special effects have never had the chance to be good. It is not the only Italian film to suffer this fate. There are a number of Italian films made in the mid-80s, whose ideas and concepts have far exceeded what anyone could realistically expect, given their budget limitations. <br /> <br /> However, having said all this and noting the film's many weaknesses, I cannot afford to rate Devil Fish below a 3/10. I also considered judging it higher, but I can't because I realize how bad a movie is. Why don't you vote lower? Well, it's hard to explain. Despite the many problems encountered in the film, there is something in Devil Fish that I inexplicably like. It could be as simple as my love for low-cost, shoddy, Italian Italian films. Maybe my taste in movies is horribly distorted, but I like what I like. <br /> <br /> Devil Fish's Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment is actually very pleasant. I consider Devil Fish a 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale. The guys do a great job teasing the many flaws in the movie. A very astute observation comes very early in the comment when Tom Servo observes, "Just because you can modify, does not mean you should" ?? highlighting yet another of the many weaknesses that can be found in Devil Fish.
