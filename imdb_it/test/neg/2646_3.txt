Although this was a well-told story, I found it too unpleasant. The main theme is child abuse, which is never fun to see - a sordid topic. Add to this a lot of vulgarity from the drunk-abuser husband and a child's GD, no less - and this movie prompted me to see it again. <br /> <br /> Even portraits here were punks who chose the two kids, another unpleasant visual experience. The realism of the plot takes a swan dive when one of the boys flies off on a homemade airplane! Give me a break! <br /> <br /> The only positive and pleasant part of this film is to see the beautiful, loving and moving relationship between the two young brothers, played by Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazello. The latter has become a familiar face over the next two years with great roles in Jurassic Park, Shadlowlands and The River Wild. The wood, of course, didn't hit him until a decade later, but he made the Lord of the Rings trilogy very big. Those two children, and the narration of an unripe Tom Hanks, are the only facets of this film that I liked.
