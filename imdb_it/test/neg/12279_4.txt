This film is very violent, but exciting with original dialogues and fantastic characters. He has one of the most moving stories and is very faithful to life. The film begins with the action star Leo Fong as an unscrupulous cop approaching the end of his career, when he comes across a big case involving corruption, black mail and murder. This is where the killings begin. From the beginning, Fong delivers in this must action caper. This film is also a co-star of Richard Roundtree. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this film as a child but when I got older I realized that this movie is pretty bad and not very good. I would not recommend this movie and the action is very, very bad.
