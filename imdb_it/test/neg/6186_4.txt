Coltrane and Idle are members of a bank of bank robberies that double their leader during a robbery. They hide in a school of nuns and disguise themselves properly to avoid being discovered by the crowd and the police. A lot of Catholic humor and slapstick but the script is pretty thin as are the laughs .. There is a GOOD shower scene though ... on a scale of one to ten.4
