I am insulted and angry at the idea that a sequel to "Gone with the Wind" should never have been undertaken. Having expressed this, I have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film. The interpreters are talented people whose talents have been wasted on this piece of junk. The clamor surrounding this book and this film seems to be an exercise in futility. I think it will go down as one of Hollywood's misguided movies. I don't think the beloved characters created by Margaret Mitchell must have been soiled by the ideas and interpretations of another writer. The film and the book should be on the list of the worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and cinema. The sad thing is that people actually made money with this tripe.
