This is the most painful excuse for a comedy I've ever seen. I'm confused by the fact that this guy was given his show. It stinks of complete and utter desperation on the part of the central comedy, trying to fill the void left by the talented and incomparable Dave Chapelle. It's a suggestion from Ned's golden comedy bag: isn't the joke funny? Do you need to give it that extra touch in hilarity? F *** ING YELL IT AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS. Simple, isn't it? And as an added bonus ... finish half your jokes with ... THEN YOU'RE RE-TAH-DED !! or DUH-DU-DUUUUHHHH! Oh God. So funny. Beaner ... hilarious. Wetback .... do laughter ever stop? <br /> <br /> To illustrate my point in a more cerebral way, I will cite an example. Mencia jokes about how "retarded" is to rebuild new orleans, because he is so close to water. Genius. The line of distinction between a great comedian and a hack has never been designed so clearly. While a good comedian would find hidden humor in the tragedy, finding subtle ways of weaving a joke into something that we can all laugh at and take comfort, Ned goes for the obvious. Move the city. Great. Wait, is it fun? Ned does not have the intellectual capacity to find the deepest meaning of things. The hurricane did not invade the city, ned. The levee project was underfunded and in serious need of federal dollars ... and here it is! They broke. I think it's the way God tells us that we shouldn't be there. After all, he has a place at the congress. What a fool. <br /> <br /> Chapelle was a master at turning a weary racial comic into the head. He was effortless and at all points we were laughing with him. While Mencia speaks of blacks who are unable to swim * yawn, * Chapelle takes her 300 meters away with the blind black white supremesist. You don't have to be hard to be edgy. You must be original. <br /> <br /> Mencia and his legions of fans are like that closed gay little man who emphatically laughs at gay jokes, thinking he somehow masks his own insecurities. Except of course, with Ned, he is laughing too emphatically about the "retarded". Du-du-duuuuh.
