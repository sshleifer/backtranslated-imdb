For football fans everywhere - stay away from this movie. It was so baaaaddd! Lame acting, lame script, lame kick and no directing! I rented this movie during my time in Asia and was shocked that this was considered one of the best films in Singapore. It was simply meaningless and completely boring. There are thousands of rich and exciting stories in Asia. Why write a bad story about Singapore's tops and stereotypes?
