Wow, well, do you know those shocking things they use in hospitals to make your heart think again? I needed one for my brain after watching this movie. It took me almost 4 hours in total to watch because I had to pause and restart my brain with semi-normal functionality every now and then. I mean that this film becomes really ridiculous, to say that the script contained about 10 pages of generous dialogues. They just don't talk !! And while it is not everything, and I admit that there were some scenes where only music was needed, and the music is excellent, probably the best part, but then he listened to a symphony or something and forget the movie. So many people give these fantastic reviews, and for the moment, I would say that special effects and filmography are quite good, but as far as acting, or lack thereof, was concerned, a little more was needed, no shootings, sex, etc. ., vulgarity is not even required, but a little more emotion, these boys were like stones, sitting there with long faces. All in all, if you need something to calm you down, just play the movie, don't even start if you've already seen it, start over, lie down and relax, it'll put you to sleep.
