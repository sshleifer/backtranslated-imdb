Victor Jory has never become an important star. He is better known for the subsequent roles of the characters than for his first contacts. But he was very handsome and an excellent actor. <br /> <br /> His love scenes with Loretta Young in this romantic adventure thriller are passionate. Their kisses seem very real. And very modern. <br /> <br /> Vivienne Osborne is also prominent. She plays a woman with a reputation. But the character has a good heart. <br /> <br /> The print I saw was not clear. But what a joy those rare films like this have! And they are, in a sort of manageable condition, still intact. This is nothing really special. But if one is willing to sift through the films of his era with equally intriguing titles, suprtb films are likely to be found.
