The worst Korean movie ever! The plot is ridiculously complex, incredible, and the film doesn't create a single shock. It builds suspense quite well, so it leaves you upset without providing any shock or moment of excitement. Whenever there is a chilling moment you are not bothered while you are still trying to figure out who is who and what is happening! Something like this happens: a model company recruits 4 people for a modeling career. but the owners are not what they seem, they have model dolls of all and a strange girl is seen walking around the place and the owners have no recognition of a girl. It turns out that everyone is there for a reason and this is how I could understand. The ending is a mess of killings and you don't know who a doll is that is real and who is dead! I don't recommend it to fans of Korean / Asian horror movies.
