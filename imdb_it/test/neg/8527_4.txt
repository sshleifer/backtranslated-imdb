The Messengers directors Danny Pang and Oxide Pang are responsible for "The Eye" and its sequel and their first American image sounds like "The Grudge" -lite set on a farm. A family of four moves from Chicago to a down on the sunflower farm in rural North Dakota. Almost immediately their teenage daughter Jess starts to see ghosts. Of course his parents and the police are skeptical. Of course, the film is well done and there are two or three effective scares, but it depends too much on the "boo effect. Yet the plot is a carbon copy of many ghost stories and the ending is anti-climatic and incredibly terrible. In addition, "The Messengers" is a rather weak horror film that simply does not deliver.4 out of 10.
