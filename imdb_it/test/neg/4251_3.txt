A dirty family moves west. <br /> <br /> The head of the most recent heterogeneous brood of Walnut Grove is called "Charles". He works at the mill making a lot of lumber, although who the hell thinks he cuts all that wood is a mystery, because none of the people in the whole city have enough money to buy a splinter, much less a two for two four. <br /> <br /> Managing the city is the "Olsons", a rich but stupid clan that has moved here to rake up all the dough they make selling eggs for eleven cents. They have two children, a boy, 'Willie' and a girl, 'Nellie', who among them, have only one advantage in terms of savings ... Nellie is sexy and it's fun to spy on her when she takes a bath in the ass. <br /> <br /> The preacher of the city is also the idiot of the village because he thinks he is really something special in this leafy garden of country dillum, when in reality, he can't stand his boring sermons and the only one which they pray because Sunday is for him to drop the nearest cliff as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> The city doctor is a dinosaur who has seen his best days around 20 years ago, but still wanders around so he can give free breast exams to the old witches who live in the city. Unfortunately, the only time these hot old moms kneel to pull out a loaf of bread from the oven to give the Doc its services. But that's okay with Doc because he knows these old girls give good bread. <br /> <br /> Accompanying the back of this colorful collection of country cow fries is Wicky Carolyn's wife of Charles and their three girls, "Mary", "Carrie" and "Half-Pint". Mary is another hot chick that all the guys peek at every time she takes a shower or a shit. Carrie is an annoying little girl, but she sticks a cookie in your mouth and you won't even know that she is there, in fact, where is she? ... oh, here it is ... he's in the yard playing with a bunch of cigarettes ... how nice! Half-Pint is the youngest spin in the city. He may not have a brain or any type of body to talk about, but he can spit farther than any other guy in the whole scary school. <br /> <br /> It is a large city, Walnut Grove, where someone is always falling off a roof or being run over by a wagon wheel, and it's also beautiful, made up of a building ... the church / school - house / town hall / billiard room. Ah, he gets a little hairy on the prairie, but that's okay, especially when Mary takes a bath in the crick ... that's how you can see how hairy he is.
