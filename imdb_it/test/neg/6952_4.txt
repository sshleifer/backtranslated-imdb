Not all lesbian chick and vampire movies that touch our favorite kind of trash can are beautiful. Unfortunately this film of lucidity of originality and performance does not come with junk standards. It seems that the creator's intention to make it cult has failed. Trash movies are junk movies because it happens. It is not possible to create this type of film on purpose. I don't know if Mr. Creepo is a legend (the first time I heard his name), BUT if he asks me why ... <br /> <br /> Very bad. Even lesbian scenes are pathetic, so fans of erotic x-ploitation movies won't be satisfied, since there are thousands of better movies than barely legal lesbian vampires.
