I still wonder why I sat across this whole thing. Only had about 3 minutes of real entertainment, the rest was just a total bore. The acting is not great and the action scenes are really funny that it's not even funny. I wish I could say something good about this movie, but I can't think of anything right now. There was probably something in which some may have fun, but the end of it must be the most stupid idea ever. What kind of person would receive a remote-controlled toy helicopter with a burnt machine gun to assassinate the president? This idea could never have been made before, let alone someone stupid enough to try it, I imagine the writer must have been obsessed with the scene of the car in The Dead Pool, but he actually tried to make this look serious.
