To put it simply, Mind of Mencia is Comedy Central's worst and most entertaining show, and perhaps all television ... ever. I love Comedy Central and watch many shows and movies there all the time, but whenever the intro of this show starts even after some good comedy, I can't find the remote fast enough. <br /> <br /> Mencia recounts used, consummated racial jokes in a bad attempt to be controversial, then he will indicate the ethnicity he has just spoken to the public as if to say "he liked it, so your whole race likes , and by extension also to me ". Give me a break Mencia, I don't know if those people are plants or not, but just because you go to a black guy and give him a high-five after one of your ridiculous jokes, doesn't mean you think you're funny, it just means you put it on and what else are you going to do, beat you on TV? It gives the impression that his lines are deep, meaningful and stimulating, which is evident in his advertisements, but when you watch the show almost 100% of what he says is common sense. He also says that only smart people can make some of his jokes, but you don't have to be smarter than a monkey to understand what he just said when he says this, maybe you need to finish 3rd grade Carlos. The boy goes on to say that he says what the others are just thinking, but I think you'll find that if someone was thinking what he says, they figured out for themselves that it was ridiculous, and that's why they never said it in the first place . <br /> <br /> All in all, watch 1 episode and finish with it if you have to, because after seeing 1 episode, you've seen them all. Because Comedy Central continues to renew this horrible show goes far beyond. If you are looking for a good play, look elsewhere, because you will find very little here.
