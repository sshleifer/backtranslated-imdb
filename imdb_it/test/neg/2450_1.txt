I ticked the "contains spoiler" box, in case you say something that is a spoiler and I don't realize that I said it until I read it again after posting it. So, just in case. <br /> <br /> Anyway, back to the review of this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this film on skymovies earlier this afternoon, and according to the description that Sky offers (these people must be on acid) it sounded pretty good, but then when I had about 30 minutes, I was horrified. This film, in my opinion, has the worst screenplay and actors / actresses - ever. The girl who falls in love with the boy of L.A after about 3 hours, is a really stupid, lame character, who has an annoying whining voice and boff hair. -.-. Then there is his lover, who is an idiot, and he is also very whiny. In fact, maybe they fit each other. Then there is the boy's mother, who is with him on vacation, and surprise, surprise - she is a doctor, and - oh my god, wait, there are also other unexpected surprises! Suddenly a virus breaks onto the island and you know everything about viruses! = O. SHOCK HORROR! Yeah, for sure. Lol. Then there is this crazy religious boy, who continues to talk about "erbs" or something like that, and how the Lord knows everything. Everyone on the island seems to love him, but in reality he is a stubborn, arrogant, pumped up steroid (you really need to watch this movie only for the scene where he comes out of the sea after a swim, his head is small, and his body it's MASSIVE, it's hilarious, a fool who has had too much to drink. <br /> <br /> However, after all these weird characters, including a brazen-looking taxi driver, the religious boy finally surrenders to the doctor and takes a blood sample, and they immediately get to work to find the cure from that , because for some reason it was dramatically saved, all up to "'erbs and God". AND OH MY GOD. YES, THERE IS ANOTHER surprise !! YOU WILL NEVER INDEX WHAT !! Just in time, 11 minutes from the end, all the inhabitants of the island fall dead, including his son and his girlfriend, find the cure, and inject everyone, and it's all solved !!! What a pathetic movie. I mean, I knew it seemed like an obvious ending since I started watching it, but in reality it would still be nice and have twists somewhere, but no-no, it was just boring and dry. /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. You'll end up like me - stunned for 3 hours and then asking the hour and a half that you spent your life looking back.
