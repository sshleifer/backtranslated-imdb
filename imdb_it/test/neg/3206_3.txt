Critters 4 part, and I quote "Somewhere in Kansas 1992" and a replay of the last minutes of Critters 3 (1991) while the recurring character of Charlie McFadden (Don Keith Opper) is about to shoot the universe which, we are told, it would mean the extinction of the entire Critter race that is against some intergalactic zoological law or something. The bounty hunter friend of Charlie Ug (Terrence Mann) is now known as Tetra advisor and is a high-ranking official in the intergalactic council and orders Charlie not to shoot the eggs but instead of putting them in a pod that will land very close, the pod does indeed, I landed very quickly and Charlie actually put the eggs in it, but he was also caught in the pod which I assume the cryogenic ally freezes him because it is never really explained. Critters 4 informs us that we are "Somewhere in Saturn Quadrant 2045" where a recovery ship runs into space (the credits are just finished and Critters 4 is already stealing whole ideas and scenes from Aliens (1986)). Rick (Anders Hove) decides to claim the unidentified, to them anyway, pod and try and make some money out of it. With the help of his crew, Ethan (Paul Whitthorne), Fran (Angela Bassett), Al Bert (Brad Dourif) and Bernie (Eric DeRe) the pod is successfully recovered. They get in touch with the intergalactic council and councilor Tetra who say they go to an abandoned space station where an exchange will be made for the pod and its contents, Tetra also tells Rick not to open the pod. Thus, in the true horror film tradition, Rick opens the pod, dissolves Charlie and Critter's eggs that hatch, kill Rick and escape into the space station ... <br /> <br /> Co-produced and directed by Rupert Harvey I thought Critters 4 was a rather useless film and rounded off the Critter movie series with a groan rather than a bang. The screenplay by Joseph Lyle and David J. Schow is both predictable and clich√©, the space station with an unstable reactor that will explode in a few hours, the protagonists are only means of escape that are soon neutralized and therefore blocked, the race Against time for save yourself, the continuous quarreling and arguing between the crew, the people who are divided and the loser who turns into a hero and saves the day, yawns. A lot of plot devices seem to come directly from the aliens and rips off Star Wars (1979) with a scene of sticky waste compactors. The characters aren't better and you probably don't care about any of them. While Critter's other films could be described as the horrors of comedy, Part 4 can't, it seems to be deadly serious everywhere. Critters 4 is also incredibly slow, uneventful and boring. It's been over 30 minutes before Critter's eggs hatch and after this short sequence it's almost time before they're seen again, why make a Critter movie and barely put them on display? It can't be because of the expensive special effects as they still look like glove puppets, oh and how can a simple Critter of a few hours operate an entire space station and set up a course for the Earth? How do they know what the Earth is? Why did Capatin Rick want to open the pod anyway? What is it about with the scientist and an alien rubber thing that is mentioned only once? Why does the intergalactic council want the Critters so badly? Why send only four men? Why is this perfect-looking space station completely deserted? Critters 4 seems cheap with insignificant and dark ensembles and even steals footage from Android (1983) for its ships and space scenes, Critters 4 was apparently so low-budget that the directors could not afford any optical effects and those they needed from Android look seriously dated. For the most part only two Critters are used, although some begin to hatch, but it is rather late on the day that this happens, for most of the film they are just seen and the effects for them are the worst in the whole series. Forget any blood or blood because the Critters kill only two people during the more than 90 minutes of execution, which was not enough to keep my interest. The acting is rather poor, with Angela Bassett's exaggerated melodramatic reaction to seeing some particularly worthy Critter's eggs. Watching Critters 4 is an economic and not very spectacular production as one might hope to (not) see. The final of Critters 4 has finally saved the universe from the Critter threat, let us hope that it will save us and also our local video stores from the threat of a part 5 ...
