I'm the only person who has seen and remembers Amadeus. Each scene in "Copia" has its counterpart in Milos Forman, Amadeus - from the galloping carriages accompanied by frantic strings, to Anna's entrance through the dark corridor preceded by the man with the key, to the dialogue itself of the conclusion with Anna to the Beethoven's feet to Salieri before the dying Mozart. No one else remembers the dialog in that script: <br /> <br /> Salieri "Time?" , Mozart "Common time". ..... "Let's start with the bows ..." and so "copy". <br /> <br /> Remember Cynthia Nixon leaning against a door frame, the tears falling on her freckled face - same scene, only replace it with Beethoven's nephew. Even the scatological humor (fart beats) are the same. We also have a cardinal followed by a plate of sweet biscuits reminiscent of Salieri in the banquet hall. No one else remembers? !!!! <br /> <br /> And the scene where Anna shouts to God "Why did you give me this gift?" ... Salieri said the same thing! <br /> <br /> And above all we have a youth script with an opening exhibition that reads like the identifications of the characters found in a child's story. "I am Mr. Beethoven, I am the composer ..." <br /> <br /> And what, after all, is the purpose of the bridge builder? Other than bringing the technician to the artistic ... a comparison that is not at all developed - probably because it has no meaning, especially when it comes to Beethove who was a master of the technician. <br /> <br /> There is only one big scene - the game of the ninth. First, the music, which in itself brings you to tears. But then there is Anna's highly erotic interaction, the copyist who keeps Beethoven's time and direction that goes beyond the most explicit sexual intimacy. So intense, it's almost embarrassing. <br /> <br /> But please - the rest of the film - Where is the collective memory of the world? You have seen all this before ... and better!
