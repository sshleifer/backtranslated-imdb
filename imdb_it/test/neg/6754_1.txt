Let's see how many ways you can insult my genre: 1. Obviously, girl number 1 is a horrible skank who cheats on her boyfriend and plays / looks like a heroin addict. <br /> <br /> 2. Obviously the girl number 1 sleeps with the boy on the first date after getting lost. <br /> <br /> 3. Obviously the lesbians are "German" who are in S & M. <br /> <br /> 4. This was actually a surprise. The end of the film on a note of torture celebrated by the majority of the characters was nauseating. Seeing a beaten woman is not my idea of ​​comedy. <br /> <br /> 5. The director's comment - talking about the connection with the actresses in the film, only for what you know, is gross and incredibly unprofessional.
