Susan inadvertently runs into a drug smuggling ring while her real estate agent takes a flat tire while driving to see a house. The head of the said drug ring, Mongo (who has only a week until retirement) thinking he knows a lot more about this blonde sparkling wine actually tries to say nothing to anyone and thus begins one of the most obsessive films that I sat on. <br /> <br /> All the actors in this film can't really behave at all. Susan is a rather ineffective hero for most of the film (she would never have been able to escape several times if it weren't for the fact that everyone in the film wants to have sex with her) and doesn't take the offensive until the last 20 years. minutes of the film. When he does, he throws a generic line of "I've had enough", preaches about my sister, that thought crossed my mind several times while I was watching this <br /> <br /> My Grade: D-
