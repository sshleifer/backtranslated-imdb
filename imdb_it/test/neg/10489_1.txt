I'm a fan of the bad horror movies of the 50s and 60s - movies so ridiculous and stupid to make people laugh. So, that's why it's natural for me to choose this film - especially because with John Agar in it, it's pretty much guaranteed to be bad. Unfortunately, while it was a bad movie, it was the worst kind of bad film, boring beyond belief and not funny. At least with stupid and exaggerated bad films, you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting. Here, you never really see much of the monster (mainly due to the darkness of the press) and acting, while bad, is lower than bad energy ... listless and boring. <br /> <br /> The film begins with some young adults who go to the neck of Satan. Well, considering the name of the place, it's not surprising when chewed will be found later! Duh ... don't go to Satan's Hollow !! Well, there are reports of a kind of object crashing from the sky, so what do teenagers do? Yes, organize a dance party - a very, very slow dance party where kids almost dance in slow motion. So it is up to the Sheriff (Agar) and his men to make sure the boys can dance in peace without fear of chewing. <br /> <br /> As for the monster, he's a guy with a gorilla suit with a silly mask - kind of like the monster of ROBOT MONSTER. Not exactly original and not exactly high tech. To make matters worse, it makes noises and snorts very, very slowly - so slow that even the most burly teenager could easily run faster! How he manages to kill repeatedly is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Overall, too boring to love - even if you're a fan of filthy cinema.
