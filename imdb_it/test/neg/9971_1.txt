One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Three immature young people have sex and speak very little, except their "love" for each other. They don't seem to be interested in much but each other, and just passively so. I felt excluded. Most outdoor scenes take place at night, so you can't even enjoy well-lit views of Paris! I gave up after an hour and ten minutes.
