If this film won the Lumiere award for best film in French, then what kind of garbage is coming out of France these days ?? <br /> <br /> The topic is important - as are the African economies held as economic hostages by the international organizations that should help them, namely the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. About 40% of government budgets of different African nations are earmarked for the payment of western debt, while their population suffers from diseases, dehydration and illiteracy. <br /> <br /> ... but the subject has been treated in the driest way so that it could be conceived by man - dryer compared to the Sahara that surrounds the country of Mali in which this film takes place. More monotonous and lacking in action than any documentary I've ever seen (and I'm a fan of the genre), one "witness" after another comes forward in this "process" that is "captured" on a film that condemns the World Bank and IMF. Some critics may place the colored visual parts inside the film, but they were out of place and didn't have a complementary soundtrack when they were on the screen. They belonged better to a coffee table book than in this film. <br /> <br /> Even the characters in the movie say something like "This process is boring" and "When will it end?" Everyone in the theater laughed. Were those people on the screen reading our minds ?? <br /> <br /> Danny Glover had a brief appearance in this film. It is a television movie within "Bamako" and is set in Morocco or Mali. It was even more ridiculous than any spaghetti-western I've ever tried to avoid. The only redeeming part of these five wasted minutes was one in which a bad Caucasian guy accidentally shoots an African woman carrying a child and shows no remorse. Perhaps it was to symbolize the insensitivity of the World Bank and how it is involuntarily killing Africans. <br /> <br /> And one last technical hit, the subtitles were hard to read with so many light colors on the screen and not enough black outline on the subtitles themselves. <br /> <br /> I've already summarized the movie for you. Don't be fooled by the hype. No need to see this movie. You will never have these two hours in your life again.
