"Embarrassing" is the only word to describe this ridiculous production. From the obvious disregard of the source material (sure to infuriate anyone familiar with mythology) to the predictably inadequate production value, this mini-series is a train disaster. <br /> <br /> The cast (which includes some good actors, which I mourn) offers illogical dialogue in the same generic "European" accent so common to bad epics. The worst thing is the lack of originality in almost all other aspects, from costume and set design (blurring the styles of all time and space) to the score (which seems to badly mimic many recognizable classical melodies and "The Lord of the Rings") . The most offensive thing of all is the visual effects, which prove by themselves that if you can't afford to do them well, WRITE IT. <br /> <br /> It pains me to see another legendary tale beaten by an economic "adaptation". Maybe one day someone will do it right.
