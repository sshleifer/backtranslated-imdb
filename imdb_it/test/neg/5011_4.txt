Necessary Roughness (1991) was a bad comedy / drama that tried to engage at all levels to be a serious college football film. A lot of current and previous superstar athletes have appeared in this production during one of the highlights of the film. Apart from this it is a very mediocre film. They should have limited themselves to making a simple comedy full of realism. Instead the directors try to play both fields and end up on the short side of the stick. When will someone make a decent film about college football that is fun and realistic? <br /> <br /> Not recommended, unless it is free on t.v.
