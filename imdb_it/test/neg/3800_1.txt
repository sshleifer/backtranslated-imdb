Wretched. Talk about mess. BEYOND THE ADVENTURE POSEIDON is bad in every respect. The saviors Michael Caine and Karl Malden decide to tow the wreck of the eponymous transatlantic with a really creaky tugboat. They are challenged by the ruthless Telly Savalas and his band of machine guns armed with machine guns. This part of the sequel, part remake has Caine, Malden and another group of Poseidon survivors who make an equally dangerous journey out of the sinking ship. Among this group are Shirley Jones, Slim Pickens, Peter Boyle, Shirley Knight and Slim Pickens. Jack Warden plays a blind man. Surely, you will wish yourself to be blind after seeing this mess. Sally Field is particularly annoying as an illegal immigrant aboard Caine's tugboat. <br /> <br /> The Disaster master Irwin Allen not only produced this, but also decided to direct it.
