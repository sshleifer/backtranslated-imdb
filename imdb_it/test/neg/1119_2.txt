The only reason to see this film is Sung Hi Lee, the beautiful Korean model / actress who plays "Muka Laka Miki" (give me a break) in this otherwise lousy movie. <br /> <br /> You are given a fairly important role in this film and seem to be handling it well, even if neither side is really interesting or well written. Even for a National Lampoon movie, it's really stupid. Stupid humor is one thing, but only one fool is another. I might have laughed once, and it was probably just me that was kind. <br /> <br /> Attention: watching this film can be harmful to your health on two fronts: 1) It totally resembles crap. 2) Sung Hi Lee is so wonderful that it could blow your brains out of the back of your head at first sight. <br /> <br /> So don't say I didn't warn you ...
