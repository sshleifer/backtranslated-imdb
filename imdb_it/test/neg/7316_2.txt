A boring mixture of childish efforts on humor with the melodrama of romantic relationships fails to provide this weakly produced film with no taste of reality. As the action opens, Reno (AJ Buckley) enters his apartment, discovering his girlfriend red-handed with his roommate, who says darkly in Reno "Well, at least he's with someone you know", resulting in a decision of Reno to never have another roommate, this decision told viewers through a voice abandoned soon abandoned. The script then proceeds ten months where we find out that Reno is really faithful to his word about avoiding roommates, even if this seems to beg for the question because of his gain of a lover, Holly (Holly Fields), with whom he has generated double floors. The plot shifts briefly to a sleazy Hollywood strip club, in which Reno's uncle Charley, in love with a "dancer" whom he finds eminently desirable, lies dead over the club bar after seeing the amulets without ornaments shown by the object of his affections. It is clear that Charley was aware of the imperfect condition of his heart, because he created a videotape during which his comment bequeathed his large (and mortgaged) residence in Hollywood in Reno, and we see the latter deciding, contrary to his vote, interview the candidates for two roommates as tenants, with him and Holly sharing the selection process in an organized way. Following an unheard-of sequence involving bizarre rented candidates, all of whom Reno and Holly are not surprisingly able to live together with them in their home, both of whom are unknown, each choose a tenant of the opposite sex, with lovers clearly cool towards the choice of their partner. The newcomers (Chad and Nicole) would seem to have a small point of discernment about their existence, apart from highly aural fornication with a wide range of partners, and it will not be long before jealousy drives the harmonic relationship of Reno and of Holly. Reno is determined to patent and market a type of sports travel bag and, given that he gave Holly an engagement ring, the potential success of this entrepreneurial adventure is of great financial importance if he intends to continue his marital plan. Unfortunately, the predatory team of Chad and Nicole, whose actions are apparently tied to concupiscence, risks interrupting any future Reno marriage intention. The management is loose, clearly far from meeting the basic needs of the players, even if a script irregularly composed provides scarce material with which the actors can work, and freedom of speech is reduced in an embarrassing way. As a result, the performance is indistinguishable, not supported by spotted editing, while the way of working with the camera suddenly and often changes like the tail of the firefly. Shot on a low budget and in place, only a minimum of skill is required for design processes, but a larger measure of value may have been placed on D.J. insipidus. background soundtrack, generally at full volume and almost always invasive. A good deal of discussion has been stimulated by the final sequences of the film that apparently are not expected by a spectator based on what came before, but in reality they probably include the only pondered portions of a badly cobbled script, and the offers are right to make work almost watchable, despite the bleak quality of the production as a whole.
