It's weird, while the movie has sex scenes with X and violent murders, it's never as shocking as it should be. <br /> <br /> A group of scientists travel to a Caribbean island to investigate an incident radioactivity. Upon their arrival, a mutated insulator is dedicated to the happy task of killing men and making their way with women. It doesn't always seem to work that way. <br /> <br /> Among the outdated acts we find some lesbian encounters, three-way with male prostitutes, assorted heterosexual couplings and the rape of a dead body. Although it is completely explicit, it never fails to shock or shake as it should. As soon as sex becomes completely pornographic, it simply loses its edge; the suspension of disbelief breaks down and we realize that we are only looking at the people who have sex. <br /> <br /> There is some blood and blood with the murders, but since this is a film D'amato it is really domesticated. For a much more rounded experience, look at the similar 'Erotic Nights of the Living Dead'. <br /> <br /> 2/10
