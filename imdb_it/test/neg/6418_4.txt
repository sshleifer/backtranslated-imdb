This bizarre and watchable movie is the story of a deceived dentist who begins his mission or crusade to fight tooth decay in the back and beyond of Patagonia. Originally from Northern Ireland, via New Jersey, the main character, Fergus, sees his crusade as a mission of fundamental importance and approaches it with all the enthusiasm, vitality, discipline and attention to detail that expect from an experienced dentist. Which adds to the hilarity as its grand plans are destroyed and gradually fall to pieces as it passes from disaster to the debacle in the Patagonia outback on the back of a custom-made motorcycle or its mobile dental unit. We never meet his wife, nor the rich philanthropist who is sponsoring the unfortunate mission, but we get a solid demonstration from Lewis. Fans of his work will not be disappointed by his very credible performance as the deceived dentist who is admirably valued by the innocent but sexy 18-year-old female protagonist who comes forward for the run * ahem *. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone and I can understand why it was not driven by seeds. It is a low budget film, sometimes fascinating, always disarming, moderately funny and immediately forgettable, which starts with low expectations and almost succeeds.
