TANDEM is a strange slice of the Japanese pink genre - as it has the necessary sex scenes and the misogynistic tone that's all but required for these types of movies - but it also throws in a messy / dark-comedy storyline that looks like it's "I was better suited for a different type of film. <br /> <br /> The film begins with two lonely boys in a restaurant, each of whom dreams of a previous sexual encounter. One is an attempt to sort the subway, the A rather typical semi-violent scenario (for this type of film). The two perverts meet and start talking after one lends itself to smoking a cigarette.They stop for an evening and talk a little about their respective sexual lives "The film is inter-cut with flashback scenes of both the interactions of men with women that are central to their lives. The two men are falling and the film ends with a bizarre but predictable note ... <br /> < br /> I don't really know what make of TANDEM. These are usually soft-core, "strange pair" type of anti-companion films, but in reality it does not explore the topic satisfactorily. Also, there isn't much of the typical extreme sloppiness often so prevalent in these types of movies, so I really can't figure out what the point was. I can't even tell if the movie had to be funny, depressing or both. I think TANDEM could have had some potential as a more serious drama with a dark-comic side, but like a soft-core sex movie that tries to be too 'smart' for its own good - it just doesn't work. I can't say I hated this, but I can't say there is anything remarkable about it. 4/10
