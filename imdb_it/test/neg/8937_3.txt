A non-redeeming hunka crap that is mercifully free from the ravages of competence. Some idiots of the North arrive in the deep south in search of some Confederate rifles hidden on the legendary Mount Whiskey. They are threatened by frightening hillbillies, in a broad nod to "Deliverance"; but it turns out that the hicks are preparing for a shit about northern marijuana trafficking. This is brought to light so early that it does not even qualify as a turning point. The women are locked up and raped in catatonia; rather than save them, the boys go down to the city to get the sheriff, who is lazy and doesn't believe him. I think that if my girlfriend were raped, I would still take the shortest way to reach the hiding place. Okay, however, because as soon as they appear to soften the bad, the girls become cheerful and jump, if only the trauma were like that in real life. It also features a backwoods type with a very grumpy beard. Not exactly bursting with ideas.
