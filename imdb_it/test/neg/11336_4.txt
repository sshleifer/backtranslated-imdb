This series, made for Televisión Española (TVE), is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in 1968, mainly seen through the eyes of the younger son. <br /> <br /> Based on a background of historical events, such as the student revolt of May 1968 in France, the decadent Franco regime, the war in Vietnam, the rise of imperialism and others specifically related to Spanish life in that particular moment, one could consider this series as a simple compilation of characteristic elements that become so evident in this type of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Generally treated in a light vein even if there is no lack of it in certain moments that could be called dramatic, the series would seem to be aimed at people of about fifty who can remember those times, how, it should be stated anyone younger chooses to ignore such events or is occupied in other things. <br /> <br /> The best thing that can be said about this series is the role of Ana Duato as mother of three children: she plays the part of the housewife of the times very well, showing that particular Spanish inclination, particularly evident among women, to let all his thoughts and actions be carried out by the impetus of his heart, without any recourse to the use of the brain. As we say in Spain, common sense is one of the least common. Imanol Arias offers very little, apart from not being his usual tough and stereotypical cop like in other television series. In fact, as an actor, nothing should be trusted that is not a TV series. Its resources are too limited; however, his part as a father of the working class family is not at all negative. <br /> <br /> It is not really recommendable for other types of public, even Spanish speakers in Latin America: the themes are too tied to a specific point in Spanish contemporary history, such that if the spectator did not live here in that moment, it will lose most of the references. It is also likely that certain situations that cause some Spanish smiles do not mean anything to other viewers.
