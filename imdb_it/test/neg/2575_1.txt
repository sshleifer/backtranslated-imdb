Forget the fact that many people expect an action movie from Seagal. This film simply had no substance. Very long, pulled out and boring. The scenes were much longer than they should have been: the camera often focused on something for long periods of time when absolutely nothing was happening. Care for insomnia. The Worst Seagal movie by far (I like some of his other films). 1/10
