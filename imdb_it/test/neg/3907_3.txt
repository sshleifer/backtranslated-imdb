How do bad stories get done? This is not a question. It's a statement. <br /> <br /> Here are my problems with the movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Much of the development of the story was predictable and boring. My emotions flowed practically on a flat line all the time. There wasn't much to draw in the film. <br /> <br /> 2) The characters were decidedly fickle. One was a loon, another was confused, and the third was damn boring. There was absolutely no reason to be attracted to these people. Even though I knew it wouldn't happen, I kept hoping they ran into someone else, someone more interesting. <br /> <br /> 3) The physical environment was uncomfortable for me. A trailer ??? In the desert??? The desert is a place that many people would rather not visit. How come these three people end up in the desert ??? <br /> <br /> 4) And in the same desert. Did the writer really expect you to believe that the last three people on Earth could find each other in a few weeks in that desert? <br /> <br /> 5) Was it really necessary for the lady? Ryan in two scenes that required a swimsuit? Hey, it's beautiful, but it was pretty free. Okay, so if I thought it was so bad, why did I give a 3? I'm trying to be as objective as possible. Although I found Alan annoying, I have to say that David Arnott did a very credible job in portraying a neurotic nerd (the character reminded me of some of Albert Brooks' most annoying roles). Jeri Ryan tried to do something with Sarah, but it wasn't written very well. Ok, so she had to be a confused and dysfunctional woman. But why? What contributed to the story? His mood swings made me feel like I was jolted (loud!) One way and then another and then another. <br /> <br /> I don't often go to movies, but this made me think about it times. Rigid, predictable, boring. Proceed at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My 2 cents.
