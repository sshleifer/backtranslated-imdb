This must be one of the movies if not the worst I've ever seen. After seeing this piece of sh * t I felt like I had to write to Madonna and ask for compensation for my time, but now I feel I should write Madonna and ask for a 1980s album (considering she can't record a good album to save his life more) in exchange for this disaster. <br /> <br /> On the film itself, which can be summarized as follows: <br /> <br /> Consists of the fact that Madonna is jumping around acting as a spoiled teenager who has lost her way. He is trying to impress this absolute shower of an actor who plays the "lawyer" in the film, but the best was the ending: I was staring with my jaw on the floor in the television while the credits rolled thinking of myself, "This is that all? This is the ending? What piece of sh * t! ". If Madonna was not a pop icon at the time of this movie, this movie would have destroyed her career by herself and the funniest thing about the whole situation was that I just saw that damn movie to see where they put the song "Who's That Girl ". Well, guess where they placed it? ............................ .......at the end!
