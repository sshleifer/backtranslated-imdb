The absurd premise of this film has to do with Argentina claiming the Falkland Islands, having failed by force in 1982, imbuing European women with Argentine sperm, diluting ethnic purity to favor Argentina. Yeah, for sure. The reconnaissance is done by our hero / villan and cad, Fabian, who drags his fish-eye camcorder from column to post to covertly film his encounters with the Falklanders including his courtship and a woman's final conquest Camilla. An unfortunate indie and fraudulent documentary, this film favors us with a lot of boring tourism shot from the hip .... yada, yada, yada. The film has no plot potential and starts to become interesting only when Fabian and Camilla make their way through the usual moments of embarrassment and uncertainty as they move from handshake to bed. "F * ckland" is only for those movie purists who can appreciate the squalid, no-frills austerity, jigglecam of the indie Dogme.
