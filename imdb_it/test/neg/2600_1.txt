Words cannot describe how asinine, youthful and repetitive this steaming stack of a series is. It is based on 3 things: 1. Constant references to pop culture of the 1980s 2. the tired "lengthens a joke to the point of embarrassment" bit, and 3. at least 3 or 4 useless flashbacks per episode. The only reason I can see this disgusting fest is as popular as it is constant for the pop culture references that I suppose arouse an "OMG LOL THAT IS FROM THE SUPERFRIEND !! !! TO GET IT !! " response of the spectator. The script is beyond laziness, and supports its viewers, mostly between the ages of 20 and 30. There is also the character design, which seems to be composed of the same three characters with the same bored expressions drawn over and over again, but with different skin colors and, at times, a different thin line. Insulting shit.
