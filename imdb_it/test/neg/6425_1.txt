Bad plot, bad acting, bad direction. <br /> <br /> There were possibilities but I got nothing. <br /> <br /> This film looks like someone started with an idea, a bit of info on google and then I tried to deal with an hour and a half with a lot of night shots and bad music of suspense. <br /> <br /> The others had to stop watching because they were scared for 2/3 - I had to take a break purely because I didn't care anymore. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of an episode of Days of our Lives with marginally more suspense. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
