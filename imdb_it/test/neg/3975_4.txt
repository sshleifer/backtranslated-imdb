This film is a mediocre and low budget film. I've seen a lot worse on MST3K, I assure you, but this is still a pretty nasty movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about Clonus, a top secret government structure in which clones are used to give organs to politicians. It is an almost Orwellian society, actually: almost (but not entirely) effective. <br /> <br /> The film begins to roll downhill when the clone of the head (Tim Connely of 'Emergency' fame) falls in love with a female clone (Paulette Breen, who appeared in this and at most in others four films {and this was not his first film}). They begin to suspect something. After finding a can of beer in the nearby river, the plot begins to unravel. The clone receives no response either from the chief scientist (Dick Sargent of "Bewitched") or from the "Confessional", a computer that supposedly knows everything, then breaks into the main Clonus building and (in a scene amused by Mike and Bots) discovers the truth (including a video clone that, strangely, shows exactly the same method used to clone Dolly five years ago ... and this film was made over twenty years ago ...) on Clonus. He frees himself, pursued by two guards. It has a hell of a time to break through the two-foot-high fences, even if it has a considerably more difficult time climbing some boulders. From there it continues to slip. Peter Graves ("Beginning of the End", "It Conquered The World") also appears as a presidential candidate and Keenan Wynn ("Dr. Strangelove", "Piranha", "Once Upon a Time in the West") and Lurleen Tuttle ( "But Barker's Killer Brood", "Psycho") as the elderly couple helping Clony after the escape. <br /> <br /> The MST3K version is priceless; one of the best episodes ever. <br /> <br /> Four stars for the film, 10 for the MST3K version.
