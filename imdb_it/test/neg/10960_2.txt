I'm not a director or a writer or something related to a movie. But watching more than 1 movie every day gave me the idea of ​​what a good movie is or not. So here it is: The rapid and the undead are a rip off of the Rapid and the Dead. I was thinking it might be a bit of a parody of a fantastic movie with a lot of starts in it. But oh no, I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, the film sucks. I'm a big fan of gore movies but this just gives you some blood here and there but they're not so consistent. <br /> <br /> But I have to give them credit for creating gruesome characters that gave me a little excitement. <br /> <br /> If you're a big zombie fan, watch this. If you're not ... better look for more rob zombie movies.
