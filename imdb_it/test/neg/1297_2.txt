This film was total junk. I was sitting watching this absolutely furious that this was funded. They have certainly spent all their budget on the special FX rather than on the writer and director AND some of the actors. <br /> <br /> First the acting was insipid and disgusting. The story was not recognizable enough for the public. Rather than being from the perspective of the storm, the narrative was told more by government figures and the army, which in reality is not a way to connect to them, since most of us still hate politicians. The writer attempted to add a human element to unrealistic characters by adding the small subplot on father and son, which they failed completely. <br /> <br /> As for the director ... oh god, his techniques to try and create tension and discomfort are repetitive and exaggerated. The accelerated movements of the camera and the sudden flash of flashes stop on the face of a character when something horrible happened it was pathetic. <br /> <br /> The only reason I saw it until the end was to see the special effects. Which is a negative as special effects should not make the film, but only amplify the story and the experience. There was no story. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't worry about watching it, total garbage and embarrassment for the British film industry.
