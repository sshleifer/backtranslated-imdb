*** SPOILER MILD *** Dear Inman, kind words are hard to find for me to describe the movie I was just submitted to you. The problems are far and wide and painful to tell. . . yet I feel that I must, if only to prevent others from suffering the same anguish I felt. This is NOT a movie for those under 50, it's sloooowwwww, soooo slow, and when the big meeting of Ada and Inman takes place. . .the biggest and most important scene of the film, NOTHING happens, is an epic disappointment. Now, as the director should have done, I'll keep my words short and I'll finish with this warning, your film is disjointed, boring, has no flow and Jude Law is tragically misled, he showed more emotions like a robot in AI - attention, the film should be rhythmic. . . Bored mountain. Love, Ada
