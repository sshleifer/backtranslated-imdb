Stay away from this movie at all costs. I was led to watch this movie in a bet to see which of us knew the "worst movie of all time". Needless to say, this won hands. It is long and pulled out, and has no purpose or plot from what I can gather. A film about a killer boy raised by a fetus raised outside the womb has no place in your VCR. If you are extremely bored and have no life, watch this movie. But if you prefer to keep your sanity, you're FAR.
