With "Thank God you are here" from NBC, the network could try to replicate the successes of ABC's improvised sitcom, "Who's Line Is It Anyway?" in which the conductor Drew Carey would have judged the performances of a handful of fixed cast actors called to improvise scenes of some kind. On the NBC show, Dave Foley and co-host Dave Alan Grier supervise a handful of well-known comedians who have to improvise through various scenes that all start with "Thank God You're Here". He takes himself too seriously (because viewers have to be repeatedly reminded that the actors have never seen the sets before), both condos seem less enthusiastic. After seeing the continuous sub-par, the actors' unpleasant attempts to elicit laughter, I wonder if the live audience is really laughing at what's happening, or if they're improvising too. Expect that this time slot filler is very short.
