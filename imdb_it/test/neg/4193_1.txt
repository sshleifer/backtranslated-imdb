Anyone can make a movie these days. Budget, production value or expert staff should not stop the "director" who has defined himself as "realizing their dream" in these days. <br /> <br /> Respect for the art of making films, or even just respect for each film, aesthetics is no longer a prerequisite for the performance of a film. <br /> <br /> Director Bill Cowell must have thought he had achieved gold when Lion's Gate decided to market his original film as a sequel to a film he had nothing to do with. <br /> <br /> Personally I find Lion's Gate much, much more in error than Cowell regarding Dark Harvest 2 made available to the public. The deceptive marketing of this film by Lion's Gate should be examined by the Attorney General's office and Lion's Gate officers should be pickled in sulfuric acid and kerosene for their utter disregard for cinema, film production and the goodsense. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, it's not even worth commenting on it.
