This is a family movie that was broadcast on my local ITV station at 1 am a couple of nights ago. This could be a strange decision by the schedulers, but THE REAL HOWARD SPITZ is a rather strange film, strange in the way it doesn't want to upset its audience. Come on, there's nothing that children love more than sadism and that's why Roald Dahl was such a popular author for children. It also explains why DOCTOR WHO was a successful show all over the world. In this script you are dying to hurt children but this does not happen. I am not advocating child abuse, but seeing Howard Spitz lose his rag to the little ones would have made the movie better. Can you imagine how much worse COP KINDERGARTEN would have been if the producers had gone on all PCs? I mean if you are making a film that focuses on a child author who hates children, shouldn't he show the story and not say it? <br /> <br /> Much of the problem is with director Vadim Jean and you have the feeling that he doesn't know how to handle the material which is bad news for the film. As someone previously noted the soundtrack is random and Kelsey Grammar is very wooden. I imagine he is trying to play it as if it were a famous show for which he is famous but does not work here and there are many scenes with ridiculous and silent shooting angles that seem unintentional but are very annoying. But at the end of the day the main problem remains that the potential is ruined because nobody wanted to offend the sensitivity of the public
