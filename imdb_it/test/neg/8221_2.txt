"Garden State" is another of these "indie" type images that presumably skimp production values ​​in order to offer the public a real realistic human drama. Strangely, the production is very good, as are the performances (even by fairly famous actors). Where the image is missing is in the script by Zach Braff, which seems largely derived from situations taken from other films. <br /> <br /> When you're as young as Braff, you haven't lived long enough to use the experience as a movie feed. Braff's experience seems to come from watching movies, then repeating the same banal clichés in his film. In Garden State, he plays Andrew Largeman, a semi-successful Hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in New Jersey to bury his mother, who took her own life after suffering for years in a wheelchair. He seems to have no feeling about it; he has no relationship with his father, who blames him for causing his mother's paralysis in a bizarre accident since he was six, and he has no particular despair at having lost his mother (in fact, he attends a party immediately after the burial that was invited by a friend of his who works as a cemetery digger). It's all quite a bit of "Beautiful Girls", even about a guy who returns to his hometown to "find himself" and be with his old friends, with a small "Ordinary People" thrown on his side. <br /> <br /> It is truly a miracle that Braff can accomplish anything in his life, given his father and his useless friends (I'm surprised he didn't commit suicide), that they're still living their "lives" as if they were still in high school, celebrating with stupid bimbos, drinking and drugging, etc. None of them even recognize him from his television role as the "retarded quarterback" (character of Natalie Portman, the most knowledgeable person in the film, does), and say things like "Hey, I remember you from Junior year". These guys are losers, for them watching television would be a cultural leap forward. Even a friend, who has made millions by inventing a silent velcro, has no real reason to live, because his entire frame of reference is high school and parties. And you don't need a lot of money to celebrate like a second year high school student. <br /> <br /> Braff, it is revealed, is heavily medicated, which prevents us from "feeling" and dealing with anything, really, like a wanted adult. Then he meets Sam (Natalie Portman) a sort of lost girl, who gives funerals to pets and lives with her mother like a 10-year-old girl in a bedroom that looks like a life-size inflated pink doll house. However, they fall in love and Braff learns to "feel" again. The clichés arrive fast and furious. Braff has a long heart-to-heart conversation with his cold and detached father and tells him What It Is and The Name Of The Game. In one scene, Braff and Portman are in the house of the millionaire kids, playing at the touch-fake is in front of a giant fireplace, and the piece is so routine, so from standard films, I swear, I almost expected someone to come up throw a sled in the fire. In another, Braff visits a doctor (Ron Liebman) to fill his stuff, and Liebman tells him (in the worst line of the film) "The body can play tricks, once I found my ex best friend's twins in my wife's purse, and I haven't had an erection for a year and a half ". Of course, no licensed doctor would ever say it, but it is the dirtbag poem, a nod from Braff to, I think, his losing friends to let them know he is still thinking of them, just like the "37" line in "Clerks" was Kevin Smith nods to his dirty friends. <br /> <br /> However, Braff finds true happiness and takes the drug away; the story takes place predictably. But if you're going to have a movie that's a wall-to-wall cliché, at least give it some fascinating show to breathe some life into it. And Braff does it. He has the right kind of vacancy, a casual acceptance to make his role of Andrew out of the ordinary, real and moving, and Natalie Portman (also of Beautiful Girls) gives the film a great success. With her tiny features and trembling expressions of humor, she almost steals the image as her traveling companion. Jean Smart is surprisingly good as Portman's mother, and Peter Saarsgard (although much better in "Shattered Glass") is as remarkable as his gravedigger. I would recommend "Garden State" if you can't get enough movie story novels, but when people start calling it a masterpiece, they are simply incapable. Braff thinks you can take the same old tired plot, write in a few "f ** ks" and "awesomes" and slap on an acoustic rock soundtrack that represents the material. It is not so.
