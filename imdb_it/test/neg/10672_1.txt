Ego. It seems to be the only reason this film was made. This film is so wrong in so many ways that it is far from being dignified to write a lot about it. Each character was only good at praising and leading the actors (I use this term freely as the director did) to emulate in the likeness of the stone. the little story, if this, fails on the basic aspects like logic, feeling and drama. The management leaves a lot to be desired. obvious defects are everywhere (the characters' motives are undefined, future husbands are found from one day to the next, broken windows take shelter among other things) <br /> <br /> Let's face it, Himesh cannot act. nor, it seems, can Hansika Motwani. In her defense, she is still a fat girl who looks older than her thanks to tons of makeup. Raj Babbar Overacts and makes his small presence as fake as possible. Darshan Jariwala laughs a little too much. The actor who plays Himesh's friend is the only natural one. <br /> <br /> I can think of some questions: how can a movie like this cost Rs.500.000.000 ?? where did the money go ??? assuming that a sequence of chases was taken moderately and Mallika Sherawat received an obscure Rs.15 million for her 15 minutes of appearance and 2 songs. but the pure stupidity of the film makes the mind go crazy. (including 3 rickshaws from Mumbai who show up and jump on a police car) <br /> <br /> the good: Himesh shows courage by allowing the film to make fun of his nasal voice and his trademark " mice. " Let's give the devil to his duties: Himesh, as usual gives good music. <br /> <br /> The bad: Direction, Story, Himesh's singing is still hard to ignore <br /> <br /> The Ugly: Dialogs and everything else !!! <br /> <br /> Final: painful in every sense! watch this movie only if you love "Yaadein" by Subhash Ghai
