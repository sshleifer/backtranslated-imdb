Wave after wave of nausea without direction - this film wants and at first promises to be bizarre and original, but in reality it is obvious, solipsistic and mired in a dialogue driven by clich√© that eventually builds a fool of horrible and cheeses. Throughout the film we come across characters that are apparently off the wall, which are actually very boring, and they simply don't work and those who clunk through the horrible script like men in armor, driving jeeps through manor houses and triggering the obvious existential preppy accompanied by the whining of Coldplay. The film has occasionally amusing episodes, often no more amusing than a dog that plays with his genitals, which has happened twice (an index of farce, the rudimentary humor of the film in general) but in the end, the film falls into a 'infinite abyss' of complete debris and the egocentric ramblings of the director that made me want to gouge out my eyes. Watch this movie at your own risk.
