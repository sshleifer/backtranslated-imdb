I love basketball and this seemed like an intriguing film. However, in the first ten minutes of the movie I knew it would be bad. It was poorly managed and too slow. Moreover, he was very, very racist, sexist, anti-Semitic and homophobic. Sometimes it makes sense to include in racial, ethnic and other insults, illustrating the bigotry that exists. In this film there was no reason for the horrible bigotry and no one learned from what was being said. Part of the problem is that it was an adaptation of a play and a remake of a 1982 movie that dealt with a basketball team from the 1950s. Having this movie took place earlier would make more sense. It was not well translated in modern times and the writing was horrible. I don't know how the script was originally written, but I can't believe that such a bad and hateful movie was broadcast on television and video in 1999. It was disgusting. Don't waste your precious time on this.
