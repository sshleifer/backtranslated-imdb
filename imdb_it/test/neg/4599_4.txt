A boring film about a miserable loser ... in a nutshell is Factotum. Matt Dillon plays Henry Chinaski, alter ego of author Charles Bukowski whose novel is based on the film. When we meet Chinaski, he could be a writer, but it's certainly not a success. He goes through life, gets fired from one humble job after another and doesn't care a little. The fact that he is always drunk can have something to do with his not caring. He meets a woman, Jan, played by Lili Taylor and follows a relationship. Chinaski moves into Jan's apartment and now instead of getting drunk alone, he can get drunk with someone else. Good times. In the end he had enough of this relationship, so Chinaski does it alone. Unfortunately he still can't keep a job so early that he's broke. At this point Marisa Tomei shows up and for some reason her character, Laura, decides to save this miserable drunk loser who doesn't even know. We will soon meet some of Laura's knowledge and the film turns into a sort of bizarre world with this rather eclectic group. Soon Tomei and his friends are offstage and once again we stayed with Chinaski and his drink and his miserable little life. There is still some time spent with Jan, but above all there is only time spent being a drunk and unemployed loser. And then the film is finished and not a moment too soon. 94 minutes of absolute monotony and seems infinitely longer as the film drags on. Nothing happens. Nothing ever happens If you want to spend an hour and a half of your life watching Matt Dillon's drink, this is the movie for you. If you are looking for a compelling story, well-developed characters or any type of entertainment, then you are in the wrong place. Dillon's performance is actually not bad at all. Too bad that the film that surrounds it is actually quite ugly.
