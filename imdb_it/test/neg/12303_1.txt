Shame Shame Shame on UA ​​/ DW for what you do! <br /> <br /> I was shocked. <br /> <br /> DO NOT take the children to watch this movie. Humor is totally inappropriate for children, and they will be bored and disappointed. Of course * everyone * we read Theo's wonderful books and we certainly have expectations ... but this is pure junk. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and certainly would never have given his "thumb raised" to such an ignoble attempt to capitalize on a classic. <br /> <br /> Too bad. <br /> <br /> Spend your money on the book. If you have a copy, buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program. This film is NOT worth seeing a "free" ticket. <br /> <br /> Follow the book. The cartoon tv version works well if you want a visual representation - save your money ... seriously. SAVE YOUR MONEY - it will be in cable from Saint Patty's Day. <br /> <br /> Shame shame shame on what they do !!
