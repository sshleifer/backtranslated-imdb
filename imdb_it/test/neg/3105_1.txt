I'm actually too tired to write this review - bad movies always do this to me - but I feel obliged, as if it were my civic duty, to warn anyone thinking of buying or seeing this terrible mess of a photo. Please, please just take my word: this is one you would like to stay away from. It's so boring and boring, so bland and banal, such an impolite excuse to put together some family talent. Burt Reynolds? Wasted (despite his best efforts). Ice-T is barely in the film, and when he appears on the screen his performance is so subdued and muted that it becomes clear that the director, perhaps intimidated by Ice's intense gaze, didn't know what to do with it. Rob Lowe, as a title character, has never shown so little charisma on the screen. Mario Van Peebles should be ashamed of himself; its interpretation is, in the saddest sense possible, a joke. Surely, Satan himself signed Mario's check for this film. The plot is weak, half-cooked and annoying like all the music involved (the absolutely boring club song seems to continue, literally, for the first third of the film). The appearance of the film will lead one to seriously wonder if even the cinematographer was forced, as one of the forgettable female characters in the film, to smoke crack from a tube connected to his mouth. And if you're looking for, at least, for stylized, shoot-em-up violence, you won't find any. I assure you, I assure you, this film has absolutely no quality of redemption! Please, I beg you, avoid this blow! Don't put it inside and get sucked into believing that its pace will increase, improve and evolve in a decent ending. He will not. It is not so. He can not! It sucks! Now, you've been warned, and now I can go to bed (it's 3 am - please forgive any errors that this warning might contain) - to know that my conscience is clear, because I did my civic duty to my neighbor!
