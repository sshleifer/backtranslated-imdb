A film that is well known for its eloquent formulation and complicated concepts never made into a film good enough to represent the profound meaning of the book? So far, this goal has not been achieved. The Heart of Darkness was attempted to be turned into a movie in 1993, but it was a failure compared to the book. <br /> <br /> It is quite difficult to make any book in a movie. There is always the concern that it is not so descriptive or that it has the same meaning. So, because the novel, The Heart of Darkness, is turned into a movie, I am clueless. There is so much description and meaning hidden throughout the book. When I read the words clearly, I think a person would think it is rather boring and would not get the symbolism. I think that's what happened in the film; the film has just touched the surface story. <br /> <br /> The film didn't even follow the entire plot of the book, major changes were made that I thought would make the film worse. For example, the manager did not go on the boat with Marlow and the rest of the crew, instead the spy did. I think he pulled out some important plots and took the manager's trick in relation to Kurtz. Also, Kurtz wasn't even on the steamer when he died, which made the whole trip even more useless, which became annoying after a while. And when Marlow was telling Kurtz's girlfriend about his last moments and words, it wasn't even remotely descriptive or important, his girlfriend wasn't even angry. <br /> <br /> As for acting, none of the actors did a great job except for the actor who played Mfumu. In my opinion, Kurtz wasn't very evil, and that was kind of important in the book. Furthermore, other characters like Marlow, the manager and the boyfriend did not do justice to the characters they deserved from the book. Their acting was not at all exciting or memorable. Above all, I don't think this book should even have been tempted to be turned into a movie. I think it's right to use some of the themes in a different storyline like in Apocalypse Now. But as far as following the exact same plot as the book is concerned, it is a shame.
