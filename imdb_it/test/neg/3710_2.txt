A film B horrible at best with a video quality similar to Dead Alive. I challenge anyone who is a fan of "Aliens (James Cameron 1986)" to count how many times almost complete lines or sequences have been torn from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of junk. <br /> <br /> The cast members like R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with some talent and the main character "Jack Scalia" was absolutely absolutely horrible. I think they chose it for its huge cleft chin. It also bothered me about the stereotyping of the only black guy on the set, John Toles-Bey, who has to watch this movie and just wonder. Watch him a little while he made a lot of interesting films. <br /> <br /> But in this movie: The script as I said before was a Aliens rip-off developed and transformed into a submarine "thriller". It included phrases like "I had a bad feeling about this" and "Kill me" when a crew member was infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts to "jump alien" just before it releases from the stomach. There is also a classic rip-off "take some!" via Bill Paxton. We also have a pack of grunts from the navy that run through caves with creeping insects sprouting from the walls. Even the explosions of mutant creatures are very similar to the popping of aliens as they load marines into the movie "Aliens". And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (instead of having acid for blood). There are many other important examples. So if you want to see this script done right, look at the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver). You will have a more pleasant time. <br /> <br /> The plot could have been interesting and better done if it weren't for confusing sequences at the beginning of the film and generally poor editing. Camera shooting was pretty boring and honestly it wasn't very difficult to stop looking at it and going around the room to have a snack or check e-mail. Many of the interactions between characters have had little or no meaning and have not gone anywhere more often. The entire command structure between the crew and the captain was badly done. I'm not even sure if there are military captains who have full control over nuclear submarines. In general this shows that there has been little research done for basic information to make the film look at least a bit respectable and there are many other similar examples (such as depth of immersion etc.). <br /> <br /> Whether as horrible movies or you're a big Alien and Aliens fan and want something to laugh with and shake your head then this movie could be for you. As far as I'm concerned, this is coming back to the shelf ... permanently.
