Excerpt from TV GUIDE: <br /> <br /> This week on THE LOVE BOAT, Captain Stubing has his hands full when a cryptozoologist gets on board with an unexpected load! Join the Captain, Isaac, Gopher and Julie in a fun Halloween Special. Guest starring a guy in a really ugly lizard suit like the Chupacabra. <br /> <br /> This is a typical discounted rate for the Sci-Fi Channel slot. The captain of a cruise ship, played by the already respectable John Rhys-Davies, is responsible for a Carnival cruise along the Mexican coast. His daughter is traveling, and is gaining her strength as the ship's kickboxing instructor. Be careful, everyone, that kickboxing will come in handy later! It should be noted that the Captain's daughter is rather uncoordinated and painful to look at. It would have been nice if he had taken a couple of kickboxing lessons before trying to play an instructor in a movie. <br /> <br /> Captain Stupid and his daughter join Ms. Thurston Howell of Gilligan's Island, a kooky cryptozoologist and a dark and mysterious stranger on this 90-minute boredom journey. <br /> <br /> Exactly, I said cryptozoologist. He continues to mention that he brought on board the precious cargo he needs to control. Needless to say, the box contains a Chupacabra that someone decides to release. From this point on, a man in the Chupacabra rubber suit runs around the ship, killing people. Captain Stupid is powerless to stop him. He decides to call the Marines but tells them that there are a lot of terrorists on his ship. <br /> <br /> The Marines respond. They say all that sailor stuff like "Hooya" and "Get Some". But those stupid Marines can't compete with a Chupacabra. They don't really tell anyone where they're going, so there's no help in sight. I suppose no one will really miss any strenuous battalion of the lost Marines. But don't forget ... Captain Stupid's daughter is, fortunately, a Kickboxing instructor. Yay for Little Stupid! Enter immediately at the height of time, beat the kid bloodsucker and save the day. Chupacabra means Goat Sucker. Therefore, the Chupacabras suck. But there is no way that Chupacabras sucks anywhere as much as this movie.
