As you may not know, EÃ§a de Queiroz is one of the most aptly celebrated writers in Portugal. He was witty, he spared no one in his critics and now he must roll into his grave. And this is not due to the fact that this film is bad, but it is the result of the treatment dispensed in one of his masterpieces "O Crime do Padre Amaro". It is treated as a cheap junk. When it was advertised that this would be a "modern and urban" take on the book I feared for the worst, in these normally modern contexts it means taking liberty to take the p **** when doing an adaptation, in the mid-ass poorest possible. And so the moral and social dilemma of a priest who has a secret and forbidden business is replaced by very long passages of people who take drugs and sing hip-hop for no particular reason or pertaining to the plot. It is right there as it may not have been. <br /> <br /> Oh and there's a lot of sex so you can at least count on this when you put it on. Do you remember how every film of the 80s, regardless of genre or tone, has always found a way to sneak into some nudity? If it was a thriller and they didn't need it, they simply found a way that when they were catching a criminal they "happened" to be in bed with a woman who was screaming (obviously naked) when the cops raided Ahem, Free is the word I think. Not that there's anything wrong with nude scenes, but here they make the creators of this film look desperate simply because there's nothing else in the film, it's totally devoid of what you call dramatic content.
