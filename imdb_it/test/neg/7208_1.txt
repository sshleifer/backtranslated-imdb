Dark Harvest 3: Scarecrow: 1 out of 10: In Einstein's theory of relativity time is from the perspective of time-seeing. (Or so I heard) In other words, this film seems much longer than an hour and a change. Even in fast forward (and will be reached for that fast forward button) it wanders somewhere around eternity. <br /> <br /> If you are familiar with the version of Project Greenlight by Lionsgate (This is where they buy a home movie but a fancy cover and introduce it in the horror section of your local Wal-Mart) you won't be surprised by the complete and total lack of entertainment value contained within. <br /> <br /> Reading the line (I refuse to call it acting) is uniformly terrible. This is a collection of dads and strippers who pretend to be in a movie among Schlitz cans. The camera work is a drunken father who photographs the quality of movies on vacation and while the special effects are in place the most terrifying effect is the scars of breast augmentation in the nude scene. <br /> <br /> The story is terrible, the sets come from a haunted Halloween set by ADHD middle school students and once again reading the line (remember that this no longer acts to sink into the bottom of a pool is swimming) is distracted beyond simple words. To avoid.
