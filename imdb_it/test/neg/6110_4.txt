The summary of a line is actually the joke of an old joke that starts "what is a Jewish porn movie?" <br /> <br /> While this film had its interesting moments, it was too slow and not enough to explain to those of us in the public who do not know Orthodox Jewish custom, exactly what was happening and why? How many people came across this film knew that the tub in which the female characters were washing is actually called "Mikveh" which is a ritual bath used to clean up spiritual dirt? The same question could be asked about why the bride was turned around the groom a dizzying number of times while her face was covered just before the marriage vows were performed. These two examples are just two of a large number of such moments that have remained completely inexplicable for the uninitiated public. <br /> <br /> This film has its moving moments along with expressions of great love and emotions. The characters are presented in a very authentic way up to the number of garments that an ultra-orthodox Jewish man must wear as well as the religious rituals that he must commit to waking up in the morning to start his day. The attitude of orthodox Judaism towards women in general and wives in particular is both intriguing and sometimes exasperating. This is another reason why more explanation is needed if this story is to be understood in context. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to people who are familiar with the Orthodox Jewish tradition and ritual and those who might be interested in taking a peek at what life is like for people who practice this lifestyle. <br /> <br /> The very story of two sisters who rebel against the "system" in their own way is of moderate interest to better.
