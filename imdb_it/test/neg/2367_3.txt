no way out 2007 was really bad and if it's the road to wrestlemania, they choose the wrong path. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit and the hardy def. MVP & Minn: in my opinion this was the best game of the night, some good fights here but not much. Open Championship 7/10 <br /> <br /> cruisweight (won by chavo Guerrero): horrible, no high flight, really fast and boring. 3/10 <br /> <br /> little bastard and finlay def little bogeyman and the scarecrow: it was more a comedy than a fight, some laughter. 5/10 <br /> <br /> Kane def re booker: a decent effort by these two but they could do better. 6/10 <br /> <br /> wwe tag team championship Paul London and Brian Kendrick def deuce & domino: another boring game, without flying high by the champions. 4/10 <br /> <br /> world title ecw Mr. Kennedy def bobby lashley (imbalance): in my mind the worst game of the evening. really terrible. I thought ecw was not a rule, I was wrong 2/10 <br /> <br /> john dinner and Shawn Michaels def Batista and the gravedigger: a good game, but it could have been much better. 6/10 <br /> <br /> overall this was tori * it id give a 3/10
