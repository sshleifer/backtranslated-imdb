It starts in a really interesting way - the story develops around the protagonist, who runs a "cleaning company", specialized in cleaning up crime scenes. As a former policeman, he comes across a strange situation when a job suddenly "officially fades". In addition, he finds some relationship with a police corruption investigation. His "Columbo Feeling" is justified, the more he delves into the background of the story. The good actors (Jackson, Ed Harris, Eva Mendes) play in a suspenseful story with some twists, but only until the last 25 minutes. (up to here 7 of 10 stars). SPOILER :::: Suddenly the film loses its touch and in the end there is a completely useless shooter, which involves the 14-year-old daughter, a betrayal of friendship and a justice not justified by the character's development ... not having Cutler give up his investigations for the sake of friendship? or have your daughter discover some facts? or ... many possible very best stories are imaginable ... a really wasted ending!
