This film did not give Mr Bachchan justice. He's a great actor and I was very disappointed in the film and there wasn't a lot of plot in it. As a matter of fact this is the first movie I've ever been disappointed with. He starts with her coming to his house with his daughter and he is a photographer. She takes pictures of her in the garden and is washing herself. He's a sixty-year-old who has nothing to do but photograph this girl. The film makes no sense. The whole movie talks about her chasing him and she tells him how much he cares about him. Then his daughter falls and he has to take this girl around the places so that she isn't bored and the daughter finds out. I didn't think this movie was up to Bachchan's standards. He is better than this movie. I always imagined him as an honest person and then I saw him in this film and I couldn't imagine him in this film. The film did not interest me at all. I couldn't wait until the movie was finished. And neither do you.
