Overturned and without humor (especially in light of his rather questionable psychology), but with an urgent and comfortably quiet rhythm, this movie-counting movie highlights Angharad Rees' unusually hypnotic presence as a young woman periodically owned by Jack the Ripper, allowing such bad effects of blood amid Edwardian property. It's all pretty standard stuff for Hammer, but it is handled with a good deal of visual elan, although the central relationship, between psychoanalyst Porter and Rees, guides the narrative without ever being satisfactorily explained.
