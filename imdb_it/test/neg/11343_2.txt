Ladies and gentlemen ... be sad (or be happy!) .. We are in the disgusting forensic T.V Series-ERA !! Now count with me and amalgamate our fortune: <br /> <br /> "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation", "CSI: Miami", "CSI: NY", "NCIS", "Crossing Jordan", "Da Vinci's Inquest "", ALSO "The Cosby Mysteries"! .. WE HAVE NOT YET ENOUGHLY ENOUGH ?! <br /> <br /> From the late 1990s until the end of the 2000s we have almost the same series of sick on the criminologist genius with a partner (or a team) going to solve the crimes by examining the autopsy ... and what a nauseating mission to do, so you will surely have many repellent scenes in which we see clearly, accurately and terribly the most horrible shots in the TV OH GOD story. Once we had the good days, the good ERA cop (or detective) like Columbo, Kojak, Magnum and Simon & Simon, or the good old science fiction ERA, like The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman, Knight Rider. , oh my dear, we also have hot & sexy: cover up, The Love Boat, Baywatch, even a flop like Thunder in Paradise. <br / > <br /> Everyone was unforgettable, original, good. .real good thoughts, action, women ... until the X FILES arrived .. And then it was the beginning of bad luck or to be exact: The Catastrophe! <br /> <br /> X Files Undoubtedly he was one of the greatest, but there were some slight disadvantages, we had agent Dana Scully (doctor and FBI agent) in every episode that did the autopsy .., and obviously his tour (as the series was successful) became part of our living room, so the money-hungry producers adored him with all the physical terror + the exciting hunt for the truth .. So they tried to repeat it in a another classification not too far away: The Forensic! <br /> <br /> But it has become so ugly, distorted and very cruel just like BONES. Plus the intoxicating present of Emily Deschanel, and the bloodthirsty as David Boreanaz (he was much better in angel), and all these corpses .. To the extent that every time I saw him I found my self screaming AAAAHHHHHHH !! What a terrible crap !! .. <br /> <br /> Cancel it please .. You canceled before the actual shows like (The Lone Gunmen) or (A Man Called Hawk). Here is a bad thing .. So please .. Little Mercy and enough with the Bones-WAS !!! .. or we'll fall dead of Nausea and Monotonia !!
