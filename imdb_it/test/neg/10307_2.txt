I love this show. I saw every episode last year. I bought the DVDs. And I tune in to see tonight and see for some reason that you have reorganized this great show. And you took what worked and ruined it. You took one of the best aspects of the show which was the 4 friends. Sam, Sully, Lizzy and Piper. I also love the other characters, but they are good at dozens like Derek, Darcy and even Sully. It's like the show has lost part of its family and everyone else was trying to fill it. It's an overdose. While things are fun in little naps when you are exposed to it all the time it goes from funny to annoying. I couldn't wait for this show to come back. So please bring back the charm. Even if I can't get Piper into the show, she reports at least Lizzy. But I loved those girls. They brought fun. The show was about Sam trying to live his work life and managing his personal life and friends too. This was the charm. And that big dog too. I hope the network (FOX) forced writers to do this and the writers didn't like it at the show. I'll give the show a couple of episodes before giving up, but tonight's episodes were bad. I made a big deal for the show that came back tonight and I got people and I felt crazy, because nobody laughed except 2-3 times. I apologized to them and said I don't know what happened. And about 10 minutes after the episode I realized that they would not show Piper or Lizzy and this was no longer a television comedy not to be missed.
