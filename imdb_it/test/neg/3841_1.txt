I would like to start by saying that I would not go to see this film again if they distributed popcorn made of solid gold and the ticket gave me eternal life. This film was terrible. I can't give him a really honest assessment because there are no negative stars. The acting is absolutely terrible. This film is a disguise, based on the classic "The Most Dangerous Game". If you really want to torture yourself for 90 minutes rent something like Gigli. At least J-Lo offers a better scenario, Ben should pacify the women who watch him. I'm not angry for the $ 7 I paid to see the move, I just want the 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> "Can you give me my time back!?!" Samuel L. Jackson, Changing Lanes
