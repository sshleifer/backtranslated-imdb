This was an interesting adaptation of William Shakespeare's last solo work, but in my humble opinion, terrible. Jarman tries to change the personality of the characters to begin with. Makes Miranda senseless after being stuck on the island for so long, Prospero is no different - a mixture of madness and self-pity on her part. I could not imagine that Shakespeare thought his characters were something like the way Jarman portrays them. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Caliban is perhaps the only thing that is right, but then again, I had the impression that Caliban was a tormented and deformed monster, but he turns out to be a crazy upset, a northern that continually laughs, not as I would have imagined him. Ferdinand makes a brief appearance, naked more than ever. <br /> <br /> Indeed, to the point where I stopped looking at this horrible adaptation, their lines had been cut so many times from the game. If nothing else, I think Jarman was trying to rewrite Shakespeare and include his scenes most of the time. So much text is cut in the first part that does not make a Shakespeare play, but a load of melodramatic, absurd 70s trash. <br /> <br /> An attempt to interpret this game more realistically at the end, but this game has never been realistic and nothing like the text displayed has been made.
