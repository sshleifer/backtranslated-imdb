How bad you can make a movie. A good question that House of the Dead 2 can answer. I could not believe that it was possible to achieve something worse than the first House of the Dead but incredibly the director succeeded. The only feeling you get from the movie is that it's bad, just bad. What with overacting, bad FX and a stupid story. It's a kind of movie that gives a bad name to Z-Movies in general. Why couldn't they learn the lesson from the first House of the Dead movie? Anyway, I guess you'll understand that you shouldn't see this movie. It's just a waste of time. Watch "Bad Taste" or "Dawn of the Dead" if you want to see good zombies.
