When the budget doesn't take into account a Cadillac or Packard or Lincoln or imperial hearse, we're talking about greetings. This is the language of cheap birds. <br /> <br /> What's in the hair of the forty year old boy? The guy who looks like a concrete head who tries a couple of times to run into John Agar and gives the only fright in the film from how close he comes. His hair looks like a shoe. A shoe of paint. He is a shoe head. <br /> <br /> The nurse needs an immediate hair wash. He has a hairspray in his blond hair that would light up if the production company was able to afford the lights. <br /> <br /> The monster? The music was scarier. I would try to run from the music. Probably the monster had better hair than the rest of the cast. Put some lipstick on that monster and you have Divine's older sister. <br /> <br /> The work, the editing and the plot of the camera provided a buffer to prepare the public for bad music. <br /> <br /> Hi Mr. Agar? Are we planning to do a sequel to Night Fright and ... Mr. Agar? Hagar? Tom Willett
