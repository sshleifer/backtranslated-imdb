The Italian rip-off of Mandingo and The Drum is an Italian life nicknamed on plantation yarn. Many people who do not seem to belong to the South of the United States wear poorly made costumes and wander around places that do not resemble the South American. The plot has something about the romanticism between a rich man and a certain young woman, the jealousy that ensues and the tragedy that follows from it. The film promises hot and hot sex and a lot of twisted violence, but nothing really comes anywhere, it's all taken for a ride. It's all probably insensitive to race, I couldn't notice it from his artistic failure. The final turn is at the most laughable. A big turkey
