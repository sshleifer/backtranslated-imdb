Everyone, except the younger Americans, is probably familiar with the iconic call of "Laaaaa-sie!" from little Timmy, or whatever the baby's name was, he complained to his little tow head for his friend the border collie. These same Americans may or may not be familiar with the fact that Lassie made the leap from television to cinema (or was it the other way? I'm clearly too lazy to do some research here), and The Painted Hills is one of those. It is irresistible to make a "this movie went to the dogs!" wordplay, so I won't (although technically I just did). But in a sense, he has. Lassie (who plays Shep, the man's best friend) gets the maximum billing. THE DOG GETS THE HIGHER INVOICE. Now, I'm not familiar with the way actors or their agents negotiate contracts, but here's how to play it in my mind: <br /> <br /> MOVIE MOGUL: Okay, Lassie, in the credits, will be, " and with Lassie as Shep! "LASSIE: Rrrrowf! Grrrrrrr. MOVIE MOGUL: Ah, ah, kid, calm down, calm down! LASSIE: Rrroo rrrrooo roooo. MOVIE MOGUL: Ok, I think I see. Co-lead billing? LASSIE: Rawrf! Rawrrrrff rawrf! MOVIE MOGUL: Oh God! Let my arm go! Maximum billing! The best billing for you, now let me go to my arm !!! <br /> <br /> So, the dog gets top billing, and with the rest of this shocked cast, I suppose it's understandable. We love old grumpy old Jonathan the seeker, his young, whiny and apparently orphaned Tommy, the shady loser Lin Taylor, and the adorable old religious grumpus Pilot Pete. The meat of the plot here can be summed up in a few sentences, so I'll save you the real pain of watching the movie. Jonathan is a prospector with a dog named Shep, and his companion dies while he is in his complaint. He gets a new partner named Lin who becomes obsessed with gold, and Jonathan, for some reason, gives Shep a little whiny whiner. Lin kills Jonathan, Shep sees it, and Lin tries to kill Shep. Then Lin tries to kill Tommy. Then Tommy complains, it's cold, and Shep makes an elaborate plan to take revenge on Lin, which he (or she?) Does. The end. <br /> <br /> Unless you have a deep and disturbing need to see a Lassie movie (even then, there must be a better Lassie film than this), simply avoid The Painted Hills. When not dragging along, marveling at Lassie's limited ability to 'act' (similar in style, perhaps, to Keanu Reeves - always the same facial expression, only the body moves), setting the obvious using several minutes of film, or insulting Native Americans everywhere with his white actor in the face "Ugh! How! Me Running Bear!" stereotypes, The Painted Hills is only suitable for Lassie fetishists or people who have some kind of connection with the prospecting of their days as an old grizzled prospector who watches that vein of shining gold!
