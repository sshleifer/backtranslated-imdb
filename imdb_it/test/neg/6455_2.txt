Yes, this review may contain spoilers, but you'll thank me for it. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I came to this board waiting to see the same answer I had, but inexplicably, there are many people who love this film and Spacey's performances in particular. <br /> <br /> Some will punish me for saying it, but I find Kevin Spacey's acting quite limited despite the admiration of the world for him. I seemed to see a more petty version of Kevin's role as "American Beauty". His character in this film is ridiculously exaggerated, up to his laughable insults he throws at his assistant. <br /> <br /> There are trivial and boring scenes from around the world like when Spacey is tearing apart Whaley to bring him Equal instead of Sweat and Bass. Somehow, I suspected that this particular scene was fun, but at that point I was ready to press the stop button (it's about 20 minutes in the film). <br /> <br /> And the faux-homage to "Resevoir Dogs"? Whaley proclaims: "I think I saw him in a movie once," as if he were about to cut off Spacey's ear. But what do you use to cut it? A bag! True, he will give him paper cuts! This must be one of the worst Hollywood scenes of all time, and the fact that the actors and the director have tried to take it forward with a straight face makes it even more terrifying. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I didn't do it. I see the end of this film (my DVD was mercifully blocked about half an hour before the end), but anyone who wants to say it could spare me the joke I have missed a great twist and everything would make sense. Well, I don't care what happened in the end, because he has never been able to make up for all that bad acting and inexorably exaggerated dialogue. I also had the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this film as much as I did.
