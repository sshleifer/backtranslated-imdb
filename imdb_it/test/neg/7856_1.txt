C'était complètement minable: à fuir absolument! <br /> <br /> This was an idiotic attempt to destroy the classic source material, and we have completely succeeded! <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie under any circumstances unless you want to snatch your ten euros and push your nostrils from a group of vapid and atrociously unpleasant characters. <br /> <br /> This type of film clearly illustrates the gap that unfortunately divides the directors and the public. If the individual (the sky forbids a collective to have conceived this slag) behind it was thoughtful enough to look at the version currently in progress in French cinemas, he or she would have endured what I was forced to endure, and for luck has rewritten it or simply scrapped all in all. The vein of adult humor that is extracted here goes back, in my opinion, to Fritz the Cat, but lacks the state of the avant-garde of that film or even its basic attempt at social commentary. <br /> <br /> With the proliferation of remakes and increasing dependence on preexisting source material to finance storytelling these days, one might hope to choose Snow White, and thus not have to worry about designing characters or a radically new story would he have allowed more time for, oh I don't know, interesting animation, smarter jokes, maybe a coherent film that has something to say and doesn't telegraph its emptiness from the opening frame? <br /> <br /> A manifestly frightening production.
