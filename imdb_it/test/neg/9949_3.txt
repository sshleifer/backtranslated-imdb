As I sit and think of Poison for the Fairies, I realize that I might not be honest with the film. My 3/10 rating could have more to do with my disappointment with the film than its actual quality or entertainment value. Based on the plot description, IMDb reviews, and the IMDb rating, I would be sure I came across a little-known gem. Unfortunately, it didn't do much for me. For whatever reason, Poison for the Fairies almost put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> Poison for the Fairies is the story of two girls in 1965 in Mexico City. One of the girls, Veronica, is a compulsive liar and tells her friend that she, Veronica, is a witch. The other girl, Flavia, is so naive that she believes and is afraid of everything her friend tells her. This is really about it. In reality, not much happens and the film goes on and on while Veronica tries to terrorize and dominate Flavia. A commentator on IMDb described it as "the scariest movie in Mexican cinema of the 1980s". My comment ?? if so, there must not have been many horror films made in Mexico in the 1980s. Another commentator wrote: "Look at him if you want to be frightened". My comment ?? are you sure we're talking about the same movie? My opinion is diametrically opposed to these examples I gave. For me, it was boring, uninspired and malfunctioned. The shot of the scene is particularly annoying as the director Carlos Enrique Taboada never shows the faces of any of the other characters. Veronica and Flavia carry on long and exhausting conversations with their family members and their teacher, but we never really see the faces of these people. It's an annoying trick.
