When I read the reviews of Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye, I thought, "Huh?". He was so confused. To be sure, I went to see the movie and what do you know? It's a remake of "The Wedding Singer". Several scenes have been modified to fit all the essence of Indianness, but the rest is a direct transition from the 1998 Hollywood hit. Bollywood is no stranger to remakes, but this is so poor that it only hurts me to watch it. I complained so much looking at this and realized that I wasn't the only one doing it! A guy actually left the theater and never came back! Salman Khan should seriously stop playing comic roles. He screams and moans too much. Why can't he just take it easy? It does not do justice to the role originally played by Adam Sandler. He has no sense of Sandler's comic time. Rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites, but it's not even Drew Barrymore. The scene in which he finds himself in front of a mirror that he practices to pronounce his new surname ("Hi, I'm Mrs Pugalia") does not correspond to Barrymore's version ("Hi, I'm Mrs Julia Gulia"). I felt embarrassed to look at that scene, even though I loved the original. Music is not bad. It's probably the only thing that saves this otherwise horrible movie! Avoid this at all costs!
