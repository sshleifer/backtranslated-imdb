I did about 8 minutes in "Steel Frontier" before turning it off. Then, greedy for punishment that I am, I looked at it again the next day. Today I had to iron a pile of clothes, so I decided to finish the film, and that was his punishment. Here's what I don't understand: Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carruth spent $ 7,000 on their first feature and created two extraordinary films. Yet here we have two directors with way far more money, and churn out a huge pile of steaming shit. Let's see if I can understand the logic: "It's" Road Warrior ", but it's like a Western future: we'll get the cheapest" actors "we can find, we'll have the mentally challenged cousin to write the script, and spend the budget for a lot of explosions. We can't lose! "<br /> <br /> Seriously. I don't even think the MST3K guys can improve this. But if you insist on watching it, I recommend you be very drunk.
