All right,. so I went to this lovely RuPaul. I still love him, but I think a little less. This is a gross film that shows many male genitals. This is a parody of the black exploitation films of the 70s and is deliberately hurt. The only fun part for me is that all the voices have been linked with those of drag queens, even the voices of real women. This is the maximum, without pause, you laugh your back is a film so stupid and poorly made. I would never look at it again, but I appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to do. There are no ratings on this but it would be R or even NC-17. RuPaul has done a much better job.
