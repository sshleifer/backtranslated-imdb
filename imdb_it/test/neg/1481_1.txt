A classic trash! Basically what we have here is a story about a couple of American teenagers (a male, a female, both beautiful people of course) who seem to be psychically bonded, because every time they both fall asleep, dreams can live together. express each other's most intimate desires ... think that Mills & Boon meets X-files and you will be close to the brand. Actually, it's more like an unhappy hybrid between one of Ed Wood's famous B-movies and a particularly silly episode of Melrose Place, so the special effects are so shabby that acting is so amateurish. The actors who live (I wouldn't say acting) in this film say their lines as if they were reading from cue and pout when they should show emotion, and it's not a shock (or loss to the industry) they have from then faded into darkness. The whole thing is just a mixture of extravagant and misdirected styles that do not go together at all, and the end result is an intriguing curiosity that will undoubtedly be licked by such bad film suppliers who have been good for years to come. I'll probably be the only person who ever commented on this movie, but if you're reading and you saw it please come back here, get pretty lonely around here ...
