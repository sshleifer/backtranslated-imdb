This film was disturbing, not for the subject but for the way it was managed. The extremely overweight mother (Angela) didn't even make it on the video cover when most of the cast did it. This is not right but it is a statement in itself. I also noticed that his picture is missing from IMDb (maybe his choice) and it seems that this is his only film ever? The language in this film was rough beyond necessity. I watched with my 10-year-old son because he was rated PG in Canada and the tongue that came out of their mouth was shameful and disgusting. I never appreciate Shirley Maclain like many others seem. <br /> <br /> LOVE Kathy Bates and always will. The Sinese part was annoying. <br /> <br /> The little boy Alex is a great little actor. I'll have to see what else he's been doing lately ...
