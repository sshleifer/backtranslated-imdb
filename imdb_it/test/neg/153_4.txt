I guess I can understand why critics attribute two out of five stars to this film, it's not fantastic, but I think it's worth a look, from director Shawn Levy (Cheaper than Dozen, Night at the museum). Fourteen-year-old Jason Shepherd (Frankie Muniz's Malcolm in the Middle) often lends to his parents and teachers, and his teacher warns him that if he does not do his creative writing, he will fail his entire semester and will have to repeat the vote during the summer . So he completed his work, but taking a ride from the Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti), who hit him while he was going to school, manages to leave his paper with the "Big Fat Liar" story in the car. He discovers from a movie trailer that Marty has stolen his paper and is turning it into an important movie, so he and his best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes of She's the Man) are on a mission to prove to Jason that he is once telling the truth. Marty, of course, is too bad and smug to give Jason's father Harry (Michael Bryan French) a phone call, and he still burns the "Big Fat Liar" card. So now Jason and Kaylee are determined to make Marty's life as diabolical as possible, until he agrees to call Jason's dad. They put the blue dye in his pool and dyed his orange hair in his shampoo, and many other bad jokes create chaos for Marty's career. There is the obvious point in which Jason seems to want to give up, but don't worry, all the characters that despise Marty help in the final operation, and with Jason's parents coming, he finally wants to prove his veracity, and the boy does delivery, great style. Also starring Amanda Detmer as Monty Kirkham, Lee Majors as Vince, Donald Adeosun Faison as Frank Jackson, Sandra Oh as Mrs. Phyllis Caldwell, Russell Hornsby as Marcus Duncan, Christine Tucci as Carol Shepherd and American Pie's John Cho as Dustin 'Dusty' Wong. Muniz is sympathetic, Byrnes demonstrates surprisingly talented support, and even if he is wasting his time and talent a little, Giamatti is very good at being bad. It's a film for children, so if it seems trivial, vulgar or predictable, keep it in mind and try to enjoy the performances and the slapstick. All right!
