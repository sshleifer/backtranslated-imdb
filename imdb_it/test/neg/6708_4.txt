This film starts with this disturbing song that gave me a thrill like the song used in "Nightmare on Elmstreet"! Set the mood immediately! The following sequence also shows what to expect! We are aware that a ghost is present! The mystery of this ghost is what keeps this film together! But the structure of the plot is so complex that it's hard to understand! The ideas behind the plot are pretty interesting! Only the way we are told is too abstract! I understand that the director believed he needed to keep the mystery as long as possible! The problem is that when certain things are revealed you never get a satisfactory explanation! The motivations of the important characters are omitted and some questions raised in the film receive no response! Since we don't learn enough about the characters it becomes difficult to take care of them! And consequently you will lose interest! Only a little fear and a twist will save this film from becoming a total failure! The twist is interesting but not very shocking! The experienced spectator will see it coming! Some reviewers complain that this film is too similar to "Ringu" and is not at all original! Well, it's true that some of the effects and fears were borrowed from that movie! But there is one main difference! The suspense in "Ringu" was based mainly on this twist in which the spectator discovers how the characters are killed !! In "Ryeong" (the "Ringu" type) the twist is used as a disturbing effect to accompany another crazy twist! "Ryeong" largely depends on a structured plot and a breakthrough that doesn't contain enough scares to keep your interest! In a nutshell: this is not a scary movie!
