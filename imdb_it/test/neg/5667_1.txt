Once again, as in many other television programs, a certain actor / actress has gone to the fore, in this case Miranda Cosgrove, having built his reputation in previous films / series (especially from Nickelodeon and Dan Schneider. Show, he arrives at sing the soundtrack (which has NOT WRITTEN and therefore gets even more fame from this). Wonderful? It creates the imbalance in terms of popularity compared to its other co-stars, especially Nathan Kress, who is continually pushed into the minor roles in each episode , except iDont Want to Fight. Cosgrove's music would never have met the charts without this show and she sang the main song (which was not written by her) and other covers like About You Now and Stay my Baby. she syncs / sings her song too. That's how you create vocalists nowadays? <br /> <br /> Back to the show, Cosgrove reveals more physically by reciting scenes in bikinis, reg Hawaiian hula-like giseno and bra mentioned many times through visa in many cases (though not by other actresses). The wedges are mentioned, the panties were mentioned once. Let's not forget "Oh My God" as a sentence (some of the Christian scriptwriters / actors?), Assuming that the show is not meant only for children, I am surprised by the multitude of mentions of women's underwear, especially in the first episode, where the phrase "pointy boobs" was mentioned. I am not sure that children will therefore refrain from saying it at home / at school afterwards. <br /> <br /> I am not against the mention or presentation of women's underwear (which the girls will wear), but for a Nickelodeon show, the managers should have realized that the children would have the gender. I doubt that other Nickelodeon shows have this kind of content. <br /> <br /> As mentioned in other reviews, the laughter track is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many parts - for example, when the character Sam cries, how on earth is a time to laugh? It distracts people from the joke and is used almost in every sentence. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, Cosgrove has become the protagonist of the show and thus gets the maximum fame and support from hard fans, who have even scolded a hotel staff when they are told to keep their level of low noise (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk0gtfUk98U). Jennette McCurdy is the second star of the show, but faces the Cosgrove competition in the music industry (compare the popularity of her new single with the covers of Cosgrove). As noted, the third co-star Nathan Kress is the least noticed of the match. He is portrayed as an atypical boy who suffers the burden of bullying a girl and other boys, but somehow a technology wizard. His height in the early episodes makes him a cute but unusual actor given his character's crush on Carly / Cosgrove. Beyond that, Kress is not entering the music industry and with the fame of Cosgrove growing with each episode, Kress falls behind. I would bet that he is the least paid of all three actors. <br /> <br /> The content of the show is obviously fiction, but one also wonders how it fits into a comedy series at certain times (so the laughter track is used). It also contains several errors of continuity (how can your father and the air force colonel on a submarine? US special forces have their own branches, and aviation does not use US submarines - ie for SEALs). A unique feature is to allow viewers to submit their videos to show during or after the episodes, but again the videos somehow do not satisfy the theme of the play. <br /> <br /> Once again, it is a show that is full of mentions about women's underwear, skin exposure and traces of laughter used. It's a series that drives a teenage actress so far away in the crowd so that her songs / actions are over-supported by her fans, leaving her behind Stars.
