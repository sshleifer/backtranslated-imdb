go get your video camera, your little brother and the disturbing neighbor who throws boiling water on raccoons; and you got yourself a movie! well, that's what these guys thought anyway. it was so bad that I can't even remember most of it except for the flashbacks comparable to those that did a tour in 'Nam. despite the really dull title, the horrible quality, the terrible actors and the writing of clich√©s, I think this film is not the worst I've ever seen. I'm saving that slit for everything with steven seagal, chuck norris and jean-claude van dam. anyway, if you are out of options when it comes to finding new "horror" movies that you haven't seen 1,000 times already (as I was) and are discussing it, I'll skip it anyway. he had absolutely no salvific qualities. this fake serial killer was a weak, petty attempt at a B series movie. if they are really lucky they could make the wal-mart $ 4.50 bin. but I doubt it strongly.
