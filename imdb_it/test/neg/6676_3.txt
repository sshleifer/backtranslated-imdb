Unlike what a reviewer said this is NOT a Magnum Force scam. In that single Lieutenant Hal Holbrook he assembled his small team from the Academy rookies to send repeated offenders. In Extreme Justice this operation has the sanction of the superiors of the LAPD. To what extent do they sanction the exact methods used is open to the application. <br /> <br /> This special investigation team seems to be a real paradise for the misfits of the LAPD, those who have forgotten their first duty are protection and service. That's why Scott Glenn believes that Lou Diamond Phillips, a detective with more than his share of beef with Internal Affairs for excessive use of force, is perfect for the team. <br /> <br /> What should have sent him to run by Phillips is the fact that he has a good live relationship with a reporter, Chelsea Field. What surely threw me into this film, you would think that Lou would be the last guy he would try to recruit for his team. <br /> <br /> And his team is a death squad. They target the perpetrators following them and waiting to catch them red-handed. Then the season is open. <br /> <br /> Extreme justice has been greatly exaggerated in trying to make a point. It certainly wouldn't have been bad to wait for a gang of bank robbers to finish the robbery and take them out. No civilians were hurt when the citizens of Coffeyville did it to the Daltons. Or wait for three rapists to finish the job before moving. This is what was asked to believe here. <br /> <br /> And frankly I couldn't buy it. A lot of good players really waste this.
