This "film", and I use this term freely, reminds me of my daughter's first line, at eighteen months: "P.U., stinky poopies!" <br /> <br /> As in this joke, this film may interest only the youngest, the most immature or the most stupid. <br /> <br /> Having said that, there are some bright spots. <br /> <br /> The effects, where most of the famous $ 100 million went, are kinetic and convincing - I mean, as convincing as those kinetic kinetic effects can be. The baby effects in CGI are not great, but I imagine they are very difficult to do ... even if for a hundred million dollars, they could have been better! <br /> <br /> Alci, "Frasier's" dog, "phoned in his usual exemplary performance. Steven Wright did well with a small part. Alan Cummings was, well, Alan Cummings-like-bad, who we have seen before, and Bob Hoskins in the role of Odin was unrecognizable, but pleasant. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays Mrs. Avery was as nice as a button, as you would expect, and Jamie Kennedy smelly, as you'd expect. His best role so far has been in the Scream trilogy (not to be confused with the Lord of the Rings trilogy), and in Three Kings. He should stick to, perhaps, more subtle forms of comedy. Ã¨. <br /> <br /> Writing and directing were, if possible, worse than Kennedy's performance, partly remembering a clever line (even if seven years) that I would like someone to quote accurately for the "Citations memorable ". Something about the costume proposed by Avery is Craptown's" most disgusting shit ", it was a second choice joke, but a little funny in context. <br /> <br /> Above all, since there is nothing lower than a "one", I give this film a "one".
