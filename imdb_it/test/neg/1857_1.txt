When I say worse, I mean less fun. It seems that Todd Sheets has learned some stupid car tricks since the last Zombie Bloodbath, which makes the film even less tolerable. In the last film there were no special effects of the camera, in which in this case we are treated with a shaky cam and the constant transition to black and white. Also, this is called Zombie Bloodbath, despite the fact that the zombies are barely in this. The film begins in 1945, where some Satanists kill a violent thief and put him on a scarecrow. In the modern period, some children have a problem with the car and go to a house, the same house where Satanist murder happened. Some bad people try to rape children (or something), and bring the scarecrow thief back to life, who returns with some zombies and now speaks like Darth Vader. Mr. Sheets has amplified the language and reduced violence. If you want to see what a bad movie is, look at this! <br /> <br /> My assessment: BOMB / ****. 96 minutes. Not evaluated, it contains violence and language.
