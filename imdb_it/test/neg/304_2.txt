I've wasted enough time to LOOK at this movie thing, I don't want to waste more writing a great review. I didn't even smile once. ALL the jokes were boring, forced and lacking any kind of wit. I kept saying, "where's the joke?" Almost every single character was a hateful stereotype and all situations were clich√© and half the time there was not even any kind of solution. Things just happened to get to the next scene. For the life of me I can't understand how this has had as many good reviews as it did. If you like clunky scenes and poorly composed movies, Fat Girls is the movie for you.
