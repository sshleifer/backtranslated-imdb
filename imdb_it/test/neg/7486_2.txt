I had taken it several times in the rental shop, wondering if I should give it a chance. Today I broke down and I did a quick ride, and probably I shouldn't have. <br /> <br /> While the writer / director gave the film a respectable effort, it was much less appealing. The characters, while you wanted to try something for them, didn't have enough development or depth to really get involved with them. Sara's sexual explosions are tired ... quickly. I don't care about sex in movies, and I don't mind assholes, but being a "bad" girl doesn't mean that you are inclined to ask excited people at random, if they like sexual favors. Over time, what happened to the characters has been revealed, I was bored and ready to quickly advance to the climax, in the end, to something exciting ... and nothing was delivered. The things that the people of history tell you at the end seem forced and unrealistic, and they haven't been played well enough. If they had thrown a little more anguish, I might have been interested. This should have been a suspense / drama movie, and should have been affixed to the title "Jon Good's Wife" rather than the entire "red right hand" and on the cover of horror movies. Hell ... this should have had suspense, period. <br /> <br /> Anyway ... watch it on a rainy day or a night when there's nothing on television. Although this is not as exceptional as I hoped, I would do it on some infomercials.
