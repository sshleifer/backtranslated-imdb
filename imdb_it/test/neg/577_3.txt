I have to be honest, I like romantic comedies, but it wasn't what I was hoping for. I thought Ellen Degeneres had the biggest part, which should have been, because I didn't like the two struggling bedfellows. It was terrible. Poor Tom Selleck !! He had to act with someone who was so much in the picture while he and Ellen should have been in most of the movie. They were the only credible ones. And the only really funny parts are the protagonists, not Kate Capshaw and that guy from Everett .. Fantastic that the mother is leaving the closet, I thought it was a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw it on the cable and I didn't pay anything to rent it ..
