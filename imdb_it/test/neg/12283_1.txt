One of the worst movies I've seen this year. Everything about the film screams "AMATEUR". For a movie set in 1800, everyone talks like it's the 90s. The acting, especially the people who play the white slave masters, is horrible. After about an hour in this film, I went out. What a waste of time and effort. For a much better film on this topic, see "Amistad" far superior than Steven Spielberg.
