I saw this film when it first came out in theaters in 1988 and although I knew it wasn't an award-winning caliber ... I liked it. It tells the story of 5 former puppy explorers who come together to take on the only task that they never ended up as children - which is to climb Mount. Whitehead. Obviously now the puppy explorers have all grown up and developed their personalities in various ways, but not too differently from how they were children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is still a sort of Dear Abby of the group, and Tim Thomerson is still the guy from the group's surfers. Obviously the most famous star is Louie Anderson, a "true believer" in everything related to Scouts. He still lives in the same house with his mother, the Cub Scout manual continues every day, he is brave, reverent and clean, and he is the one who brings others together for another great scouting adventure. However, their task is aggravated by the Grunski brothers, two bullies hunted by the Cub Scouts from the above. By coincidence they run into their old lair and decide to harass them a little, though harmlessly. Not so harmless are three escaped prisoners, who think that Pack 7 is from the FBI and are willing to wipe them out. All in all, the film still has some charm. Watch Richard Lewis try to get comfortable on a folding cot, for example, and you have a really fun reason for yourself. After a further review, the entire film needed more than that kind of observational humor. It doesn't hold up well after all these years, but it remains a guilty pleasure.
