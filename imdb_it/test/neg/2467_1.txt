This is by far the stupidest thing I've ever seen on celluloid. I mean, we started watching it assuming it was an "action movie T & A skinemax", but apart from a couple of tits, it was like that. I mean, I have the merit of making silly movies to show sex scenes, because they're the only reason why a movie of that kind needs to be done. This film, however, has no sex scenes and makes absolutely no sense. There is no linear time, the scenes travel like a fart in the wind, people show up for no reason, then they leave, and are never explained, the plot is never advanced and nothing happens. I've never been so stunned by how bad a movie was until I saw it. Has the director even been to a film school? Have you ever seen a movie? I don't know, but from his looks, he seems to have done some proud idiot with this piece of shit, since he's still working. I literally turned away from this dumb movie, but I still recommend watching it, as it should be shown in every film school in the country as an example of what not to do when making a film. Move to PLan 9 from Outer Space, you have a new competitor for the worst movie ever made.
