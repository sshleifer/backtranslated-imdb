If you want to waste a small part of your life, sit in front of this predictable zombie movie. In the first post he can't be scary or funny. It's a dull gray film that I imagine went directly to the video. The hammy and tongue in the cheek leave a sour taste in the mouth. If you want to see a recent but still watchable zombie movie, Diary of the Dead. Poor special effects, school-level scripts. Zombie movies work if they have a moral or even a political point. This film has nothing, there is no worthy point that zombification emphasizes. This is as exciting and convincing as a Republican Convention, so don't mind seeing the Republican Convention as a better example of a Zombie movie.
