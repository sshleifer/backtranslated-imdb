This movie is stupid, made by stupid people. I suppose the plot works pretty well for a horror movie, but the actions that these characters take are insanely STUPID! How, incredibly non-sensual stupid to the nth degree! Basically the whole movie consists of these 4 idiots captured, repeatedly, despite having many, many simple ways and opportunities to win their captor. It doesn't make a lick of common sense and it's not funny at all. Grasping yourself in the eye is more rational and probably more fun than watching this. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS **** **** The ending is fun !! The only good part of the movie! I almost died laughing at the end! That stupid movie, and ends up with the stupid girl who is sent in a cage to white slavery in Asia !! Funny! I thought it was a really great ending for a really cool movie!
