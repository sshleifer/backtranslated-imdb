My ratings: Acting - 3/10 Suspense - 2/10 Character Attachment - 1/10 Plot - 2/10 Character Development - 2/10 Overall - 2/10 <br /> <br /> This show sucks very officially . For me, CSI Miami is the best, CSI NY 2nd and CSI 100th. I don't know, in other CSIs you enter the episode you are watching. But in this, you can't get into the episode, no matter how much you try, so in my opinion, this show isn't worth watching. I know that people have different opinions, and I respect them, but for me, this CSI is not good enough. So if you like suspense, acting / performance, good plot, direction, character / attachment development and a general show, I suggest you watch CSI Miami.
