Maybe I'm too generous when I give this movie two and a half stars out of five, but there was an occasional moment. However, as a film "An American Werewolf", this is a missed opportunity! There are no real storyline connections with the top original to talk about, but the story is somewhat similar to "London". <br /> <br /> * Possible warning of spoilers * American children go to a foreign country, one falls in love with a beautiful girl. Another of the boys is slaughtered by a werewolf on the same night that one is bitten and, despite the warnings of his undead friend, he shoots fur, fangs and claws in the light of the full moon! <br /> <br /> But there are some differences in the story, for example; the girl is one of the werewolves. Second; there are three American children. And third; there is something strange - @ $$ werewolf intent on conquering the world! Crazy as it may seem, that last one, it was NOT a joke! * Spoiler Ends * <br /> <br /> Films suffer from many things, before the weak acting drags them immensely! Tom Everret Scott's performance is at its best, and he and Julie Delpy, who plays his love interest, don't seem to have any chemistry together. Second; A weak script that seems to be everywhere. Many elements of suspense and dark comedy, which have made the original great, are missing in this. And who said that eating the heart of the werewolf who bit you will change you human? The last time I heard this was not part of the werewolf for nothing! Third; terrible special effects; The werewolf effects are made with computer animation, which works for things like dinosaurs, ghosts and space ships. But it looks choppy, fake and artificial, if used for hairy creatures like werewolves. <br /> <br /> However, there are some things that have saved this from total "turkeydom", there is a hilarious scene in a cafe in Paris when Andy (Scott) is having a coffee with Serafine (Delpy), does drop a bunch of condoms on the table and try to pass them like chewing gum, chewing and blowing a bubble! Also; the soundtrack, a very interesting mix of alternative rock bands like Bush and Smashmouth. Although none of the songs has the word "moon" in the title, as in the original film, the soundtrack is still excellent. And another funny scene when a rotting corpse, played by Julie Bowen, tries to whistle and her eyeball opens up, makes me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> But overall this film seems to lack the spirit and suspense of the original. And the too elaborate ending doesn't help much. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 Two and a half on five stars (average)
