I went to see Random Hearts with 3 friends, and at first I thought maybe it was just me not enjoying the movie. After all, I didn't like As Good As Gets and that movie won all kinds of awards. Well, it wasn't just me ... even my friends didn't like it. It was incredibly slow, just like having your teeth pulled. The only action that is in the film is what is in the previews. We didn't leave the theater because we all thought that something more would happen. We were not as intelligent as the 7 or 8 people who came out. I have never walked on a movie in my life, but surely I should have. It's all difficult for me to write, considering that I'm relatively easy to please when it comes to movies. It takes me a lot to think that a film is fantastic, but not a lot for me. This film has not even come close to the similar category. Not only did the film last about 2 hours, but it was like two separate stories cut into one, but they weren't evenly stitched together. Also, the "soundtrack" if you could even call it was so annoying. As Seinfeld has the same riff that is repeated several times (the difference is that I like Seinfeld) .. this film had this jazz riff that kept playing, which sometimes sounded very inappropriate, especially when people were dealing with the death of the plane crash. Difficult to explain what I mean, but believe me it was terrible. I can't say enough to make people waste their money. After I left the theater, I genuinely wanted to write to the movie company and ask for my $ 7 return, I could go bowling or something for that money.
