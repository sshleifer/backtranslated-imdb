This film was terrible. You couldn't go fast enough to get to the end of this movie. It was the last 20 minutes of the movie and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Worse than all the Dean Cain films put together. To begin with, the acting was terrible. I realize that the main actors came from the cast of survivors, but one might think that any television experience would give them a little more talent. The main problem with the film was the visual effects of the film and the poor quality of the film. In the defense of the film, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was fine.
