Bones' first season is playing in Finland and I can't believe the amount of bullshit this show puts on - the characters are superficial, misguided and clumsy. <br /> <br /> It is a CSI of a poor man. Or actually, CSI without consistent plot. Although Bones has potential, he fails due to the lack of the director who was unable to extract the essence of the show from the actors. It's really sad to see a show throw it all away when it could have been a downhill show with a bit more reflection. From the beginning you have the feeling of how difficult acting is. <br /> <br /> Long story short - don't waste your time with Bones.
