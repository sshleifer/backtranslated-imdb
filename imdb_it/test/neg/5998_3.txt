Jackie Chan's films are typical examples of how supply is greater than demand. Well, to be honest, what question? In this Jackie Chan is his name in this, I doubt he knows, and he's kind of a car driver. Well, drive 10 miles an hour and then the footage is accelerated, so I can also do all the stunts. During the grand finale, in which Jackie Chan wants to arrest the villain by beating him in a race, we can finally see how poor this production really is. The fight, especially in the casino scene, is decent, but when we talk about special effects, dear Lord. And everyone has to crash in this race? stupid. And it's not really safe for pilots here, nor is there a concrete wall in the neighborhood. And don't let me get started on what kind of horrible story this has, I mean it's Hongkong, it's probably been written to the point gun for eight years, but still, what a mess. I like Chan as much as my neighbor, maybe more since I saw "Rush Hour", but his agent's retarded cousin really needs to choose his projects better.
