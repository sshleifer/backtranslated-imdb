Patsy Kensit and some casual Australians as a duo of aspiring police officers in the middle of investigating a series of murders related to the art gallery, but in the meantime still manage to find time to shoot the young shoplifters and suspect the new wife of the male policeman to be adulterous. The serial killer is suddenly no longer important when the wife's alleged mistress (who is practically only his colleague) is found murdered and the male policeman becomes the first suspect. "Tunnel Vision" is a really boring, implausible and tension-free Australian thriller, which obviously mimics popular sex thrillers like "Fatal Attraction", "Disclosure" and "Basic Instinct". The characters are extremely one-dimensional and practically all the clich√©s of a good cop / policeman are widely described in the script. The fight position of police women in a body full of men, the mentality of firing-before-asking-questions-after, problems of alcohol through stress, etc. etc. ?? Even the bad eating habits of the cops are a racing gag. Yawn! Kensit does its best to make this film more bearable, but it lacks the credibility and talent of a true movie heroine. The final touch is more or less interesting (not entirely original, mind you) but, at that point, you stopped worrying about the characters for a long time. The scenes shot inside the sex clubs seem ridiculously fake and the direction of Clive Fleury is completely uninspired. What a waste of total time ??
