"Ashes of Time" was a bold project but it ended up being a pretentious film. This film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex way. The plot of "Ashes of Time" is quite simple and is reduced to two words: "love triangle". Because of those "love triangles" that cross stories, jealousy, hatred and love are the main dynamics shown by the characters. The narrative part is seen through the eyes of Ou-yang Feng (Leslie Cheung). Ou-yang Feng lives in the desert, where he acts as an intermediary to various swordsmen and becomes the instrument of Destiny through which revenge is achieved. Unfortunately "Ashes of Time" fails to tell these simple stories of love and hate. Wong Kar-wai has lost himself driven by the desire to make every picture of the film a painting and an aesthetic experience. In fact, next to the casting of beautiful actors (men and women) everything else is a failure in this film. Dialogs are minimalist and not original. The quality of the images is very unequal, the editing is one of the worst ever seen (at least by me) in the "sword" genre and finally the shooting of the rare sword fight is very confusing and unattractive. Even the attempt to build artistic scenes is not always achieved: the erotic scene of "women on a horse" is ridiculous, not erotic and useless. Wong Kar-wai wanted to deliver 100 minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that a film is the first of how a story is told. Forgetting that he offers a clumsy film that does not even satisfy his artistic goal.
