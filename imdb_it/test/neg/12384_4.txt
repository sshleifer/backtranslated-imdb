Pilot Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees a UFO trying to fly on an airplane - but nothing is displayed on the radar. So the planes and ships begin to disappear and reports of an increase in UFOs. It turns out that it is a giant monstrous bird that is attacking and killing. But what is it and why is it here? <br /> <br /> This has all the right elements for a classic. He's got a really fun script - I've never been really bored. The acting is good (for a monster movie from the 1950s). Morrow does not upset the hero act of the macho and Mara Corday is quite as good as the female love interest required. She is also strong and takes care of herself - even if she is out for food and coffee for everyone during the film. The problem here is the monster. Dear God, it is TERRIBLE! He looks like a deranged turkey! It has a long neck, an exhilarating and stupid BEAK, some teeth, a few strands of hair on the head and claws. And - oh yes - shouts! Don't roar - shout! The actors had no idea how it looked - it was added after production. Actors Morrow and Corday were horrified when they finally saw him in a theater. Morrow said his audience laughed and left the theater quickly before the movie ended! Producer Sam Katzman was responsible for this. He wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever. And you can SEE the threads that move it too! This gets 4 stars just because Morrow and Corday are so good and the script is well done. He doesn't get stars for the pathetic monster - wait until you see him attack what is obviously a train! It's worth a look if you're a horror fan to see what the stupidest monster ever has to be.
