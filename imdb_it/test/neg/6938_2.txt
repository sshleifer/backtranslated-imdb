If you're a six-year-old dinosaur kid, you'll love this movie. If you are someone else, your eyes will spin around every 15 seconds. If you want to start choosing things like acting, special effects, dialogue, or the absence of a coherent plot that also has the slightest meaning, you'll have plenty of material. If all you want is a safe dinosaur fantasy movie for your child, it will be fine. That being said, there is a lot of children's entertainment out there that is a lot smarter, and some of them are even bearable or fun for adults. Unless your child has an uncompromising dinosaur mood, you're probably better off looking for something else.
