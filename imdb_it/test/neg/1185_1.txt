please, look again at all 3 series and don't go see this movie, the trailer is completely misleading and the 3 weakest characters in the series stretch a television episode of 25 minutes badly conceived in the 2 most painful hours of my life, really a terrible movie. tubbs and edward are in it for a few minutes, micky has 1 line, and his tipp does nothing but repeat the same old word games, even mr briss's accent changes about 5 times in the film, tons of extras misinterpreted, and really few Ride that seem to recycle for 2 hours honestly I feel that this series has been completely ruined by this piece of god disgust .......... batman and robin everything is forgiven
