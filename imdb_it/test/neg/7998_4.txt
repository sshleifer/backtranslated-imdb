This is a very famous Ninja movie but it's not a good movie. If you want to see some ninjas and some figures, you want to know some things about Ninjas, see this movie. This film is only for ninja fans and those who want to be nostalgic. <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of the film are the best. You can only see ninja figures and fight in these scenes. Among these are below average, almost as bad as a movie. Acting is bad. Sho (black ninja) is the best actor in this film. Frank Nero is a good actor and charismatic but he can't fight well. Even the scenery is not good. It's that simple. Franko Nero approaches his best, old friend of the army and the war. He also protects him from the Mafia, but he is having sex (go to bed) with his wife and his friend knows it but he doesn't say anything to Negative Black. Is it possible in life? What a friendship! <br /> <br /> Finally this film has started a genre; Ninja movies Also there is the ninja master Sho Kasugi, but some fighting scenes are not realistic and not fast even with shoo. This film is below average even though it is a classic.
