I saw this movie based on good reviews here, and I won't make that mistake again. <br /> <br /> The first couple of minutes shows that a group of people has been brought together by some tragedy, but we see what it is 12-hour Flashback and we see the boring lives of each of these people, in the end they are totally meaningless for what is about to happen. When the ending finally reveals itself, you realize that you have just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a great reward that does not happen and means nothing to what you are looking at. The only connection these people have is that they all had a "bad day" - but even that continuity is lost in boredom. <br /> <br /> If this was to be a "Crash" clone, it's a complete failure.
