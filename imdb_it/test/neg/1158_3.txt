Michael Feifer writes and directs this fictitious story based on Edward Gein's arrest in Plainfield, Wisconsin. Gein was responsible for a series of gruesome murders that sent a wave of terror into his rural hometown in the late 1950s. His evil mind and twisted world are suspected of being caused by his Lutheran mother and Lutheran mother. A was given the nickname "The Butcher of Plainfield". He robbed the corpses from new graves of women who looked like his mother and had sex with them before "dressing them like a deer" in his garage. The severed heads with bodies hanging upside down are his personal mark. After his arrest there would be many articles made with the human skin found in his home. In this film, a young deputy Bobby Mason (Shawn Hoffman) personalizes Gein's research (Kane Hodder), when the mother of his warehouse worker (Priscilla Barnes) disappears. The acting is much better than the ridiculously liberal account of the documented events concerning Gein. Also in the cast: Adrienne Frantz, Timothy Oman, John Burke, Michael Berryman and Amy Lyndon.
