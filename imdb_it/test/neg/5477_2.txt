This should have been a moody, gritty film, which has lingered in memory as a relational exposition in which the dominant personality survives only because the dominated personality sees no hope of change. <br /> <br /> The acting was intense and skillful, the dialogue worked but the film was irritatingly ineffective: too many remote shots that suggested lack of attention rather than a broader picture. Poor flow. The first 5 minutes could have been completely missed. <br /> <br /> I suspect that, with a different modification, this film could have been compelling. <br /> <br /> In its present form it is flat, formless and tremendously disappointing.
