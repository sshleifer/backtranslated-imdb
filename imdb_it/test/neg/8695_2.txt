From the English accents to such useless violence after violence. Showing Moses as a murderer. The people who actually believe in the Old Testament will sit there and shake their heads. I'm not a religious person at all. But I also felt as if the writers of this film were trying to turn us all against God and the Jews. When Moses picked up that stone and threw the first stone at the woman to kill her for committing adultery. I wanted to stone the writers. I can't believe in this day and age that Hallmark and ABC (Disney) would attempt to show such garbage as this. Don't we already have enough problems in this world?
