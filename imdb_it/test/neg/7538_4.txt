After seeing PURELY BELTER I came to this site to review it, but not only that, I also had to check the resume of the writer / director Mark Herman. As soon as his name appeared on the credits, I realized I had already seen his name somewhere and after checking I found out that he wrote and directed the film version of LITTLE VOICE one of the most underrated British sentimental films of the 90s> < br /> PURELY BELTER is a completely different fish kettle. It's a sad stereotypical vision of Geordie's life and very little fun. Everyone is either a wife hitter, a single mother, a shoplifter, a drunk or an addict. Since many scenes are set in a school, the physical education teacher is a sadistic bully and this is the film that comes closest to reality. Oh, and everyone is very talkative that adds to the sad unlikely atmosphere <br /> <br /> I didn't like PURELY BELTER much while watching and now that I know who Mark Herman is I like even less. With LITTLE VOICE Herman showed that you can make a fun and uplifting comedy with northern souls, but I had to ask where his undisputed talent went in this movie?
