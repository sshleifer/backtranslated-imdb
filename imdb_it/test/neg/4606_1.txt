The idea behind this film was great. The story of a child who faces abuse (both emotional and physical) and tries to face it and survive. What makes the film collapse is the terrible use of voice-overs and banal dialogue. Actors must stress the most obvious things over and over again. Furthermore, there is a very tedious, almost amusing use of metaphors in the voiceovers. The highest point is the acting of the child. Nice try, but this is a stinker.
