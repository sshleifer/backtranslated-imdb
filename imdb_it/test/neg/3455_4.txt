(Warning: several spoilers) <br /> <br /> One day, somewhere, there will be a post-apocalyptic movie that does not smell. Unfortunately, THE POSTMAN is not that movie, although I must recognize it for having tried it. <br /> <br /> Kevin Costner plays someone who is credited only as "the postman". It is not really a postman, only a vagabond with a mule in the desolate land of western America devastated by an unspecified catastrophe. Trade with isolated villages running Shakespeare. Suddenly a pack of bandits called the Holnists, the self-declared warlords of the West, descend on a village that Costner's visit, and their evil leader, General Bethlehem (Will Patton), designs Costner. After much suffering and numerous efforts to break Costner's spirit, he escapes, ending a long section of the film that could have been better told in a three-minute flashback. <br /> <br /> Now we finally reach the major premise: the escaped Costner finds an abandoned mail truck and delivers the letters to the nearest town, hoping to get some food with the pretense of being a postman. A number of village people led by the young Ford (Larenz Tate) want to enter this postman act, which does not fit well with Bethlehem and its bandits, and Costner finds himself the unconscious and reluctant leader of a band of postmen in war with the Holnists. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​The Postmen against The Bad Guys is not as ridiculous as it seems. The holists depend on their livelihood for the fact that the villages they prey on are isolated from each other; Holnists can destroy any village, but they could not resist all their united victims. To join, the villages must communicate with each other, and a functioning mail system would therefore be a great step forward for the Holnists to fail. So it really makes a lot of sense that Bethlehem would become medieval on our heroic mail carriers. Unfortunately, the eventual defeat of Bethlehem is not the result of the villages that unite against him, but instead of your old standby cliché, the fight between him and Costner. Nor is there any real attempt by the communities to use mail to work together to solve their problems; all the mail seems to be the standard "Hi, Aunt Debbie" for maximum sentimental value. <br /> <br /> THE POSTMAN is one of the most predictable, shot-shot films I've ever seen. Now, on purpose I don't try to ruin my films by trying to figure out what will happen next. But here we are talking about the kind of predictability that requires no effort; I only knew what would happen next, if I wanted or didn't want to know. After a lion has been showing off eating people, a holnista bandit looking for Costner's escape ventures into the bushes after a noise, and we are therefore "shocked" when the lion eats him. A group of unaffected peasants is gathered and killed by a firing squad, and one of the villagers sings some famous last words just before being hit, to my immense lack of surprise. A covered statue was unveiled to show exactly what everyone knew would be there: Costner bent over to take a letter from a Czech kid we saw earlier in the film. A man says in Bethlehem that no sir, you can't take my wife; Bethlehem manages the unexpected tares, even though she is the only person in the theater to be unaware. <br /> <br /> But it is a sickly feeling that really erases THE POSTMAN. Olivia Williams, who plays Costner Abby's lover, is the worst thing. He pours his heart into the material and does his best to make it seem natural and sincere. It tries so hard, it's heartbreaking. But nobody could ever make the jokes "I have a gift for you, postman ... you give hope, as if they were sweets in your pocket", it seems far from being my father's syrup. Another example is the scene in which a mounted Costner throws himself in front of a little boy, ignoring his letter, just to turn around, stare at him for five minutes and then go back to get the letter. Why didn't Costner only pick it up the first time? No real reason; it is only an artifice that tries and fails to give us a feeling of euphoria by leafing through the hopes of children and then restoring them. <br /> <br /> Schmaltz and predictability come together at the end as the postman statue is revealed. I sat thinking, "Please don't tell me they are going to show the statue and then cut the scene with the Czech kid. Surely it's too mawkish, too obvious for this movie too." Then, alas, the music swelled and we really cut the dreaded boy smiling while his letter to the unmarried aunt was taken away, and I kept my head in my hands and thought, "Somebody shoot me" It seemed to have thirty pounds of apple pie planted in my throat. <br /> <br /> Gen. Bethlehem is a villain more humanized than normal. Your standard post-apocalyptic villain is the S.O.B. in the Bethlehem valley it shows that it is not a small man within himself, who tries to make himself feel important by hitting others. Even if some threats are thus sacrificed, Bethlehem is credible in a way that most villains are not. Unfortunately, Will Patton raves. And even if we are told at the beginning that Bethlehem completely destroyed his last challenger in five seconds of melee combat, the real fighting skills shown at the end of the Bethlehem movie are absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The acting is otherwise quite good. Costner did better, but his Razzie was an overreaction. As mentioned, Olivia Williams is really impressive. Larenz Tate like Ford does a sincere and credible job. The soundtrack of James Newton Howard is competent, though not up to the epic standards for which the film was going. But it's not enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: * 1/2 on ****.
