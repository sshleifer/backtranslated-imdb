In my opinion, the film was ridiculous: a bad dialogue. Anyone who has written the script, please keep your day job. Surely it is NOT Godfather or Goodfellas. It's nice to be on the other side of the table - poor choice of words. Some of the characters were clowns. But what do you expect from a low-budget film with no name actors.
