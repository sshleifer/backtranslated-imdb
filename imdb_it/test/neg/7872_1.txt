I rented this movie when my girlfriend was absent, hoping to see some serious military / specialist action. <br /> <br /> After 10 minutes of watching this "movie" I was so terrified and horrified and sick of the quality of everything in this film I was ready to destroy the disc rented with a flamethrower. Fortunately I couldn't find one. I've seen a lot of bad movies. But this isn't bad either, it's total rubbish and doesn't even deserve to be counted as a movie here on IMDB. <br /> <br /> I am sorry for the people who have been involved in the realization of this total disgrace. I hope he wins some Oscars though: D.
