I think I should now comment on a 4th film in the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN franchise; the sequels still surprise me or amaze me with their fussiness and their deliberate absurdism. Do they form or forge a fourth way ?? non-classical, non-revisionist, non-European ?? but a squalid American, akin to the violent films of the 70s, absurd garbage. Even this episode is an unpleasant nonsense, inexplicably embarrassing and even a little strange. <br /> <br /> Now I find it disturbing that these sequels don't just have their opportunist fans; but fans simply don't perceive any difference between the style of the original and the sequels. <br /> <br /> These sequels are not boring or insipid, but bizarre. They are obviously very badly written, messy scripts, garbage lines. It's crazy; in this episode every gunslinger gets several women ?? Van Cleef's young wife begs him to release a young prisoner; finally does it. The young man resumes his life, shoots Van Cleef, kidnaps his wife, rapes him and kills her, then joins a violator. Van Cleef, who had previously refused to help defend a village, now assembles a small group and accuses the evildoer hacienda; then the evildoers load the village where Van Cleef has set. <br /> <br /> I liked the cast. <br /> <br /> Van Cleef is Chris; Stefanie Powers, quite active in the westerns of the 70s, is Van Cleef's darling. Callan, very unpleasant, is Noah, a writer and aide to Chris. The rest of the aggressive group is Askew (one of only three survivors), Armendariz, Lucking, Lauter; Rita Rogers is really beautiful, fleshy beauty.
