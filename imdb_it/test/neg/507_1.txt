Let's see. What bothered me the most? The extra long dance scene at the beginning looked at the people that were spinning so much that my vertigo was spinning ... Without even showing where the music came from ... All part of a degree that had nothing to do with the rest of the film. Or maybe it was the fact that every scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than it should have. What a drag this film is. And the most annoying aspect is that the villains are so bad, so obviously horrible that it seems that the director is making this film for the second grade. "These people are bad ... These people are good." Every time a movie has its program, the heart on its sleeve, I'm out of me. There is a scene in a skating rink that seems totally out of place. Long love scenes with the main character and a Russian prostitute who looks more like a rock star and her sexy groupie. The character of John Hurt, who is part of the too long opening scene, drinks and disagrees with the exaggerated criminals. His death scene could very well be the most stupid in history. And I hear everyone, even the haters of this film, talking about how beautiful cinematography is. I think it's faded. Watch "Days of Heaven" if you want to see beautiful courtyards. This film is even worse than an anti-hype. It's useless. The epilogue, which showed the main character of a yacht, was almost as stupid as the prologue. The battle scenes are boring and dizzying. This movie is really bad. Avoid it unless you love bad movies, because this is the king of them.
