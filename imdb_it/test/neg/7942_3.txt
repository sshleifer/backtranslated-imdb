The opening scene prevents me from assessing absolute zero. I wish the whole movie was as gritty and real as the intro. <br /> <br /> To be able to enjoy some movies, many can be forgiven, (handguns with 60 shots, heroes with super human powers, all women are beautiful and half-naked) but Puuuuleeese this "Assault On My Intelligence "It's so far-fetched that I'm surprised the cast showed up for a second day of filming. <br /> <br /> First of all, how did these guys become cops? Based on stupidity, I believe. How do the main female characters justify being half-naked in the middle of winter in Detroit or wherever they are. In reality, no character reacts to the elements of this film. No windows, no electricity (which miraculously returns inexplicable) during the storm of the century and are all as comfortable as insects in a carpet. What technology exists that disables all cell phones, radios and brain functions. This must be the same power that causes Maria Bella to walk from her car for the disabled with her knees in the snow with no coat and almost no dress.
