Depressing the black comedy BLACK on a woman (Mia Farrow) who flees her home on Christmas Eve when she discovers her husband (Tony Goldwyn) hired a hit man to kill her. He ends up with a husband and a wife (Scott Glenn and Mary-Louise Parker) and then things go wrong. Farrow basically continues to run and continually meets VERY weird people and comes across unhealthy little fun situations. <br /> <br /> This was advertised as a beautiful film when I saw it over the Christmas period in its short period in an art cinema. I found him sick, not funny and just depressing. I like black humor, but this was too bad for me. What happens to the character of Parker in particular has been terrifying. To make matters worse Eileen Brennan is thrown like a nun (!!!) later and continues to chew the scenery with taste. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved was Farrow's acting - it's much better than that the image deserves. It was also a relief to see the talented Stephen Dorff appear at the end. The ending itself was pretty nice, but it wasn't able to erase what had happened before. <br /> <br /> Ill comedy, morbid, black pitch. A 1
