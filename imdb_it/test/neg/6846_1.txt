The worst villain movie fan will be surprised by the general ineffectiveness of this level-z "movie". Mary Woronov, a skilled actress famous for her roles as Mary Bland in Eating Raoul and Miss Togar in Rock 'N' Roll High School, is by far the best thing about this tripe. This film is almost a pity also for MST3K: honestly!
