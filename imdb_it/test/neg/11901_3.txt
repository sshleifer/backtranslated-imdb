What could have been in Irene Dunne's mind when she accepted the role in this unpleasant report of a negotiable woman of morality? Certainly, the Irene Dunne of the 1940s, whose reputation as a faithful Roman Catholic who publicly abhorred darkness, and avoided any screenplay or Hollywood company, which could even be remotely interpreted as a corruption of public morality - would never have been associated to such a questionable project like this. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, the cardinal of New York, Cardinal Spellman, in his private audience with her, gave her a good dressing on this role? Which we probably will never know, since he never mentioned it in later years, even though he denounced his morally suspect film, (though quite successful) of 1932, "Back Street" as "garbage". <br /> <br /> Certainly when he received the distinguished St. Robert Bellarmine Award in 1965 for an exemplary public Catholicism, "Ann Vickers" was no longer recalled by the general public. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that "Ann Vickers" does not work or as entertainment or social commentary. <br /> <br /> Miss Dunne's role as an adulterous social worker, sleeping around (between reforming prisons and writing a best seller on corrective rehabilitation) does not match her temperament or the behavior of the screen, and one he continues to suspect that the whole thing is a kind of tongue in an ironic gag, (what else can we think of when we see a montage of the cute blissful look of Miss Dunne superimposed on a shot of a captive woman being scourged? film, renounced careerism in favor of marriage, (for the chronically convicted Walter Huston no less - and what kind of madness would he have thought to combine these two romantics?) <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne's completists will want to no doubt see this curiosity, if only for the chance to hear his promise to rehabilitate a cocaine addict under his responsibility: "I'm about to get you out of the cold turkey snow" !!! <br /> <br /> Well, if there is nothing else so sordid, offer your light years to its usual environment of operatic trills, wool chiffon and strawberry phosphates - cocaine addiction is not the first subject associated with the irreproachable Miss Dunne.
