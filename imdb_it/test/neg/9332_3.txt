Mumbo-biblical jumbo mostly non-addictive that lasts for well over two hours. The only thing that saves this film from the crown of God (and there is only one God, remember) is the unwittingly entertaining dialogue, and a good battle scene that comes too late in the film. For most of the two hours until the action scenes there is too much talk; the dialogue is so inept that the film is limited to being falsified by MST3K. <br /> <br /> George Sanders is absolutely horrible; one of the most animated and theatrical performances I've ever seen. Brynner is not much better; its stiff, wooden acting, combined with the horrible wisdoms of fortune cookie wisdom make a Salomon rather boring and foolish. It seems that every time Brynner opens her mouth, something so wise and ridiculously tall and powerful comes out. In a sense it is not the fault of Sanders and Brynner, due to the terrible comic dialogue and the typically biblical one-dimensional characterization, but they have made little effort. Brynner's accent also resembles that of Schwarzenegger; this is not an advantage. Only Lollobrigida manages to avoid embarrassment, interpreting the role with more conviction and in an appropriate way that is suited to a role in such a foolish film. Describing these biblical characters as one-dimensional would mean giving them undeserved credit; the characterization is semi-dimensional.
