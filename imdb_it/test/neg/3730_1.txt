During a lifetime of seeing and enjoying thousands of movies, Feeling Minnesota is absolutely the worst (** major movie with A-list stars) I've ever seen. Nobody. This film totally fails at all levels. It is poorly photographed and modified. There is an uninspired acting, of the kind in which the actors seem bored by their mind. I'm just collecting salaries, maybe? And worse, it seems that the muddy writing was written under the influence of some unpleasant substance found only in the sewers. I can't even understand how the writer / director could ever have found someone to fund this project, let alone attract the stars he did. I really wish I could go back in time that I missed looking at this piece of junk. If possible, I would have given this film a score of zero. Better yet, a negative number.
