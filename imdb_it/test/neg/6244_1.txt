After reading many positive things, I finally saw "the clearing". With a cast of great actors like Redford and Dafoe, one would, at least, have waited for a decent movie. After the credits had been drawn, I was still shocked by how bad and inconsistent this movie really was. <br /> <br /> Is it supposed to be an "art" film? I don't think it's too melodramatic for that. The bad thing is that the drama seems too forced and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The truth is that the script makes absolutely no sense. First of all, it never really explains the reason behind the actions of any of the characters, but simply overwhelms their so-called "personal problems". What's so bad about Redford's character that he has to "delete" it? The fact that he cheats his wife from time to time? The boy is a millionaire who has had a good life, he has a great son and a great daughter, a wife who loves him (and a girl who also looks far above the kind of generic woman) or a newborn grandson. the only problem seems to be that ... he worked hard all his life to be a successful person. So what? It seems that his hard work has really paid off and in reality there are no real problems in his life. /> <br /> Then we come to the character of Dafoe: here is someone who was a manager for one of the Redford companies and was fired. Why is this guy unemployed for ... eight years ??? He seems to have some kind of good manners to have a job like the one he had in the first place and he seems to have been a man with solid ideas about his work (as shown by his flashback of a conversation he had with Redford when he worked for him ). Why doesn't a man like that have a decent job and a decent life? Why was he fired once? Totally unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The film really tries to portray these men as "tortured souls" or something like that and it turns out to be really bad. In fact I would say that if the creators of this film were trying to say something about the American dream When they failed miserably. <br /> <br /> As for the actual events that take place during the film, they too don't make any sense. In fact the last 20 minutes of the film came out as an insult to the viewer intelligence, because there is not a single thing that really makes sense. Redford appears to have around 1000 chances to escape, yet it does not. In a moment he is ready to flee and yet he misses his chance because he feels sorry for his captor and doesn't want to hurt him !!! Then Dafoe takes his gun from the water and the mud, which should be useless (if you fire a shot with a gun after the gun was in the water and mud could explode in the face) and the gun is in perfect condition !! ! The way an unemployed, useless (as interpreted in this film) and mentally unstable character, manages to outsmart the entire FBI with such ease brings the narrative of this film to levels of "twilight zone". The poor ending (with the illusion of Redford's wife) comes to finish the viewer. <br /> <br /> This movie pretends to be something, it is not (ie a quality psychological thriller, sophisticated). Unfortunately it does not succeed so difficult, which becomes a disaster and this is the word that describes this film is the best: A DISASTER.
