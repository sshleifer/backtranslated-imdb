The murderer starts in the South American rainforest where Captain Hawk (Casper Van Dien) and his men are attacked by a group of vampires, they can barely escape with their lives. He jumps forward six months later and Hawk is called to see Colonel Weaver (Lynda Carter) informing him that there have been other vampire sightings and that his ex-wife and Goddaughter Dr. Laurie Williams (Jennifer O'Dell) they went out there on an expedition to study cockroaches, worried, asked Hawk to bring a team of soldiers to South America and to officially provide support to Captain Grieves (Kevin Grevioux) and his men while at the same time looking for Laurie unofficially killed by the Vampires who decided to venture out of the caves and into the civilized world ... <br /> <br /> Edited, written and directed by Kevin VanHook this is another original Sci-Fi Channel done wrong, which is not I'm very good in every respect. The script without humor has nothing to do with what I could see, it is one of those modern Vampire films that decides to choose and choose the traditional rules of the Vampire movie that he wants to use like these. Vampires can be killed with stakes through the heart and have fangs but at the same time they can walk freely in the sun and not sleep in coffins. The film moves at a reasonable pace but it's all very boring, tasteless and lifeless. The story is poor and only rather stupid, the characters are terrible, dialogue is forgettable and there is very little to recommend. The killer also tries to have a sort of ecological message as the chief Vampire states that they are only beginning to kill humans due to their systematic destruction of the rainforest where they have lived in secret for centuries, unfortunately there is no conviction and it is more like a disposable line to fill the time for a serious statement. There is not enough exploitative content and it is a rather unsatisfactory way to spend 90 minutes of your time. The producers don't even do anything with the jungle environment, I didn't expect Predator (1987), but I was hoping for a little more. <br /> <br /> Director VanHook has made several horror films that I've all seen have been equally poor, I'm sorry but he does nothing here and turns into a film with an absolutely forgettable and sentimental appearance. There is no atmosphere or tension and as for genuine fears, forget it. The blood is sober, there are bites and some blood, but it's nothing we haven't seen before or has a noticeable impact. There is also a huge Vampire monster creature at the end, but it doesn't look so awesome and it gets itself killed too easily. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of around $ 2,000,000, it actually had a decent amount of money spent on it, but it's still a junk movie, it's reasonably well done but nothing special or memorable. Acting sucks, I'm sorry but that's how I saw it. <br /> <br /> The killer is yet another poor, stupid and boring performance for the Sci-Fi Channel TV that I can't recommend. Not to be confused with the gorroid movie The Slayer (1982), rather refined, than once, which is 100 times better than this, so follow it and watch it.
