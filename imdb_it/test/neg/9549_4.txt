The plot has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be useful. Jolie's acting is rather flat and poor, Washington is OK, the rest of the cast are cardboard cutouts. Somehow almost everything in this film exudes mediocrity. The plot is lame. The only thing I liked most about this film is the rather original methods the author uses to put an end to his victims. The technical details are worse than the "Knowledge" and the more extensive CSI gadgets and halfway through the film one wonders if the credibility of the details is also affected by the director. (Some Spoilers in the future!) I mean, an ECG machine with a pure sinus wave that reflects a man's heartbeat, a quadriplegic with muscle spasms and a work index, of course. A killer who clogs a man's guts while keeping him alive to allow rats to feast on him followed by a mouse aiming for the boy's FACE! What is it with all that stupidity? Then there are some continuity goofs, but you can find them elsewhere on IMDb. I found a little insult even for my limited intelligence. <br /> <br /> Wasting time. Still 4 out of 10 to prevent my girlfriend from kicking me.
