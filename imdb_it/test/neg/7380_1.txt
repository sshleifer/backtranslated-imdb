If I had asked me 1 month ago what this film would have been like, I probably would have left most of it, but I'm a fan and as every fan often visits film sites when the Super Troopers came out I visited that site after output on DVD and has been hooked yes, it is a difficult site to stay in, but the good ones are normally like good families that stay together. What a story this comic company / company has BEGGING people to come and watch movies on street corners, universities, wherever they can and all for free and after all that to develop a great fan base after a few years shut down the website that helped them and was created for the fans, but the worst thing about it .... THEY DIDN'T TELL ANY OF THEM. They just decided that they are better than us, they want new fans, not the fans who helped them get where they are ... you know the same fans who prayed years ago. Still the smart team is that they released the best movie with Super Troopers and caught everyone's attention and thank God for it because they sucked the rest afterwards. Good for you guys, the way to become mainstream, just remember when you realize that your material is not so good and you have no new fans left who are the ones who threw away the original ones. Fans give you what you're not the other way around. Never burn bridges
