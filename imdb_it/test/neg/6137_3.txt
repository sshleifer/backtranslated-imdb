Collecting this along with the rest of the Marx Brothers set, I found myself disappointed by most of everything besides A Night at the Opera. This stinker is the worst I've ever seen so far, with the clever lines left out and the characterization is painful. The playwright is so obscenely stupid in this play it is difficult not to face the television and try to strangle him. <br /> <br /> As it is, the Marxes seem to do better as strangers brought to devastate, and are much better when they have a good gag or two at least. The material here is obviously written for anyone, and really wastes Marx's talent. To avoid. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: 3/10
