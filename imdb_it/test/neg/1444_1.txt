Put this movie out of its misery and burn the negatives. What am I saying? The whole film was negative. Fortunately, only a very few would find this film the least attractive. This is what the vast American majority would call too much sex and violence. Probably sooner or later it will be shown on a non-premium cable channel only for the value of the shock, but after changing the nudity (most of the violence will remain) all that will remain will be 45 minutes of acting really badly spaced by 45 minutes of commercials. There are too many hungry actors in Hollywood.
