There is some reason to revive the characters 10 years after the fact when the only reason they worked the first time was due to the actors who played them. <br /> <br /> Who can replace Jim Carrey or Cameron Diaz - or better yet, who can replace them at discounted prices since most studies know that sequels do not carry the same amount of revenue as the originals, so they cut corners from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Where the good films are going to go if the powerful Hollywood studios manage to clog 3,000 theaters at the weekend opening with whatever asshole they feel as if the audience can be sucked. <br /> <br /> Enough people, this sequel-it must stop and the people of Hollywood need to start acting together or start distributing the very best foreign product that floats in limbo. <br /> <br /> Wake up Hollywood, because people have woken up and are not buying it just because it is new and bright. Give us the good things and send the rest to the DVD shelves, because we are taking back the theaters once and for all !!!
