My friends and I have seen so many times that I have lost count. This is worth seeing for those in the right frame of mind, which means that this is not so much a good horror film as a lampoon movie for its funny quotes and negative effects. This film is best watched with other like-minded individuals to have someone to laugh with. <br /> <br /> You will laugh as Greg jumps and crawls around the lab, stroking his domestic rabbit, while his hunchback moves from right to left on his back. "Greg, stop being a clown!", Dr. Brandon scolds. You will laugh as J.G. Patterson gives hand signals to direct Greg across the operating table, while his hand is in the shot. And you will probably giggle when you realize that the last woman has none of the features with which she built it.
