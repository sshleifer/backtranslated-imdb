In the end, every kid learns the lesson that just because a girl is good looking doesn't mean she's good. Well, let me tell you, at 19, I learned a lesson. It's hard to say what's worse: Kathy Ireland's acting skills or her high-pitched voice; the one that sounds like a squeaky mouse on a helium that scratches its small claws on a blackboard. With an incomprehensible plot set in space with dwarves wanting the bones of Kathy Ireland for some obscure reason, this film is simply wrong on so many levels. If ever there was a candidate for a revival of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, that would be it.
