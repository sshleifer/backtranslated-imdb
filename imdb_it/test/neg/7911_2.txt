If nothing else, it deserves to be remembered for this result. <br /> <br /> It's not a black thing, it's not a white thing, it's just a bad thing. Something really, really bad. Collecting it point by point would be a waste of time. The best thing that can be said about the film is that there was a purple airplane inside. Do yourself a favor ... go buy a picture of a purple plane, and you'll get the best of what this movie has to offer. <br /> <br /> This definitely goes under the category of "What! ^ @@ & *! were thinking ????"
