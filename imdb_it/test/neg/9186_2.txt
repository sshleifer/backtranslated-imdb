"Wagons East" was a big disappointment for me. But the saddest thing about this film is that it turned out to be John Candy's last film role (he died just before the shoot was completed). There are only a few laughs in this Western parody, and for a comedy that does not cut it. If you want to see a stunning parody of western movies, the answer is obvious. Watch Mel Brooks's classic "burning saddles". Or, if you want to see Candy in a much better material, see "Summer Rental", "Spaceballs" or "Uncle Buck" (to name a few). These three films (as well as others) show us what a great comic actor he was. Unfortunately, "Wagons East" no. What a pity! <br /> <br /> * (out of four)
