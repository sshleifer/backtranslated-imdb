Visually beautiful with some good music, this film still has a fairly trivial television quality. The love story between two characters, which embraces a cultural and educational gap, is simply NOT plausible. Of course, we immediately knew that our perceptive heroine would lighten, conquer the locals and find true love, but this does not make it any less painful that the film had to make such long-awaited turns. This film has many promises, which makes it more shameful that the promise has not been fulfilled. Maybe a nice under the cover on a cold free night on cable, but I certainly wouldn't recommend renting or paying for it. I'm sure the soundtrack is wonderful, though.
