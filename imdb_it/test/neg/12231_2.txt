For the record, I hate spoof movies. Except for Mel Brooks and AIR! because those are classic and make fun of clich√©s, not real movies. I think the smuggling movies are the bottom of the barrel for both comedy and cinema. In particular, I hate things created by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the "genes" behind DATE MOVIE, EPIC MOVIE and MEET THE SPARTANS. <br /> <br /> I decided to take a look at the RENI. Since Friedberg and Seltzer had nothing to do with production, I was as objective as possible. It was just like one of their movies. In practice, all sports films were in one with spinster jokes in kindergarten, and disturbing images of physical injuries that should make me laugh and fail. <br /> <br /> Only someone tall would laugh at these jokes. Water? Who wrote this? an eleven year old? I was surprised to see that this was the creation of the producers of BELIEVE MARRIAGE, which was actually quite decent. But the attempt of this kind was as much fun as a burning orphanage. The only reason I gave these two stars (when it clearly deserved one) was because Friedberg and Seltzer had nothing to do with it.
