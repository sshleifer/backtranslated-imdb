A half mystic thriller and half of the fractured fantasies of a fragile mind, "Guardian of the Frontier" is an engaging journey that soon derails. A strong imagination and a compelling premise are soon overwhelmed by an inconsistent plot, trite dialogues, amateur actions and the most extravagant and exaggerated phallic imaginary in recent memory (here, a fish is definitely not just a fish!). Evidently, this is the first Slovenian film directed by a woman: Mrs Weiss must have been determined to prove that it could be just as unregulated and free as any man.
