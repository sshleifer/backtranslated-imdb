I saw and I have the 1959 black and white original with Shelley Winters and Millie Perkins and no matter how many times I look at it, I can't help but cry. <br /> <br /> This version was (obviously) a set, as in 1959, but there were so many errors in the layout. Spiral staircase? The articles that did not exist at that time existed in the film. Doris Roberts, sad to say, CANNOT play interpret the drama, she is a comic actress and will not change. James Coco was a horrible Mr. Van Daan and Mr. Dussel resembled my university professor rather than the dentist he was supposed to interpret. In the original film, Anne paraded the "gauntlet" to go to Peter's room, which seemed to take her more than a minute. In this lousy remake, it took less than 10 seconds. The first reviewer was correct ... This remake is just that, a remake. What was the thought of the director who chose comic actors in a dramatic role like that. I'm sorry, but James Coco can't play dramas. Max .. Schell was better in Deep Impact then this movie. The irritable Mrs Frank was so irritable, I couldn't stand her. Referring to and comparing the 1959 version, I like her, she did a better job of being the overwhelming mother. Out of 10 stars, I give this remake 3. Don't waste time, take the 1959 version and a box of Kleenex.
