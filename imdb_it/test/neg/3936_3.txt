I happened to see this film on a flight from Paris to Boston and it reminded me of the food on the plane: generic, tasteless and dark. French cinema seems to have lost its point of view these days and this is a good example of how a heterogeneous script can waste brilliant actors. While some may find the "playfulness" of the script to be in line with the dictates of the post-modernist Euro, the whole project seems more like a post-mortem on the death of the golden years of Euro-cinema and of talents fabulous --- one is vaguely remembered here in Bunuel but without the charm or wit.
