If you are a normal guy like me and enjoy good acting, good plot, good scripts, new ideas or fun, you could skip this. I was genuinely bored with the credits up until the end, but I tried to give the film a chance, and I looked at it all the way - only to be disappointed at every turn. <br /> <br /> The acting was incredibly comparable, but I'm not sure if the actors themselves are to blame or if it was the ridiculously wooden and horrible dialogue coupled with an even worse screenplay. The plot is very vague and underdeveloped and I think the public should draw some sort of deeper meaning from it, or be able to look beyond it, somehow, but honestly it would be a waste of time. <Br /> <br /> The film has a kind of raw sexuality that has no other purpose than to show off tattoos and lingerie. No one seems to have any motivation but to make money from some kind of "investment" that is never really explained. The connections between the characters are not very clear and the character development is poor or non-existent. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of subculture movie designed for a very specific audience to enjoy or absolute rubbish, but you can decide for yourself. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 2 because it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but probably not the worst.
