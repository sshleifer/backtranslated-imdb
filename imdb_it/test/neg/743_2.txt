What a terrible adaptation. The worst part was the music. Muzak saxophone and synthesizers that play in a story set in the early 1800s ?????? The only character who didn't bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy. I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this, and I love Jane Austen's films usually. I didn't even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They should have paid me to get it. I don't quite understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when, throughout the film, they had no chemical reaction or indication that they cared for each other. Isabella and her brother were really exaggerated; it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the "bad guys" and part of the excitement of Jane Austen's movies is the discovery that who you think is good is not. This is probably on my list of the ten worst movies I've seen.
