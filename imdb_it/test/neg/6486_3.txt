An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always as good as a dangerous fool (side note: I'd like to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a movie together, talk about furious cheekbones!). The soundtrack wasn't terrible either. <br /> <br /> But the acting - even that of professionals like Drago and Debbie Rochon - was terrible, the worst director (perhaps contributing to the first), the dialogue similar to chimpanzees and the camera works, barely tolerable. However, it was the SET that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale. I don't know where this film was shot, but if I were to venture a hypothesis, it would be an outdoor museum or one of those re-enacting villages, where everything is a little too well kept to do more than suggest the "real old West ". Ok, so it was shot on a college boy's budget. That said, I could forgive one or two of the above faults. But taken all together, and being generous, I could not see giving him more than three stars.
