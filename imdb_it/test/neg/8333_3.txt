I went to see him because I had never seen Tel-Aviv, where the story is set. I was disappointed, since it does not offer many visions of the largest metropolis of Israel. Is it also pretentious ?? one of those films that lets you guess its meaning until you finally give up with a shrug. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist is Batya, a woman in her twenties who works as a waitress at catering weddings. Evidently her parents don't care much about her, and when a little girl comes out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her, Batya feels compelled to take care of her. The girl does not speak, and Batya cannot give her social services because it is the weekend and the agency is closed. Then he takes her back to his apartment with the leaky roof, and when it comes time to work in the evening, he must bring the child with him. The boss is very unhappy about this and other defects in Batya's job performance. <br /> <br /> Another main character is Keren, who is getting married. At her wedding party (where Batya is obviously working), she breaks her leg coming out of a cubicle of a woman's room whose door doesn't open, and so she and her new husband can't take the Caribbean vacation they have programmed. End up in a dingy waterfront hotel with no view. It smells bad, there is noise from the traffic and Keren complains all the time. Does your husband meet an oddly attractive old woman ?? a writer ?? who is also in the hotel, and Keren worries about having slept with this stranger. <br /> <br /> The third main character is a Filipino woman named Joy who takes care of the elderly. The old woman who was hired to take care of him is very sullen and does not speak English, only German and Hebrew. The joy speaks English but not Hebrew or German. Joy is mainly concerned with how his son is returning to the Philippines and wants to buy him a toy boat, as he asked. Find the perfect boat in a store and plan to buy it. The daughter of the old woman, who has hired Joy, is an actress who appears in a sort of postmodern adaptation of Hamlet's "physical theater", and does not get along with her mother. <br /> <br /> which presumably these three historically intersecting stories are supposed to resolve mean something profound. I didn't understand. There is an element of fantasy in Batya's relationship with the child, and perhaps Batya's inexistent relationship with her parents is somehow reversed in this relationship. When Joy sees the toy boat in the window, there is a strange effect used where the small sails float as if they were blown by the wind, and they do it as if they were on the scale of a real ship. Keren draws the outline of a bottle around a ship on a booklet cover in the hotel room, and a narration of the poetry of a strange woman mentions a ship in a bottle. But what does all this mean? I thought about it for a while and realized that I would not lose sleep during the process. If someone out there has a clear idea of ​​what it is, maybe they can fill me up.
