This is a really hateful show. It is indeed an example of how television has diminished since "reality" became fashionable. Tanya is cute but is also extremely rude and has a terrible taste. Does a house show the place for sex appeal? Apparently some males love the show because they find Tanya attractive. The other end is not cute but is completely rude and also has a terrible taste. It is a pity that so many houses should be shown while someone still lives in them. Most people who allegedly observe these houses before changes are made should move into new or completely empty houses, so as not to insult anyone. Many of them ... like the 'crew' ... need to be polite. I can imagine how horrible the British show is as British reality shows tend to be even worse when it comes to good manners and tastes. <br /> <br /> What happened to the Arts and Entertainment channel? When it started (and for some years later) it was full of sweets. Now it's a great garbage machine.
