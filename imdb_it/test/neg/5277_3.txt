This film is terribly bad. Kevin Spacey is really a great actor, he shines in LA Confidential, American Beauty, Usual Suspects, 7 etc. But this is really rubbish, it never came close to a decent Irish accent, maybe it should have been practiced with Kate Hudson while she was doing on Adam. For the Irish this film is ridiculous and even worse, it's rather annoying for several scenes. I think the producers made this film hoping that the target audience (non-European) would never see or hear about the "General" or Martin Cahill and be fascinated by an intriguing and fun story. Total crud !!
