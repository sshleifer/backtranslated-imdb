"Thunderbolt" is probably the worst film by Jackie Chan from "The Protector" in 1985. Yes, I know that nobody watches his films for their stories, but the plot of this is unusually lame, even for his standards, and while the fight choreography It is up to its standards, the fighting scenes (both of them) are ruined, as others have mentioned, by the frantic and distracted photographic work. Even the most serious Jackie Chan fans shouldn't worry about this offensive, acrobatic and full of plug-in garbage. Anita Yuen's beautiful and lively performance is one of the few saving virtues. For a good "serious Jackie" movie, I recommend "Crime Story". (* 1/2)
