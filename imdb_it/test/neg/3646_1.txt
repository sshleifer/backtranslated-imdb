Well, there are some things about this movie. Everyone should see it. You see the nation of Iraq as you've never seen it covered by the media, and taken from a perspective that is barely considered by most Americans, where the film has its main audience. However, all those glorious things in mind allow you to take a look at some other facts of the film. There were 150 cameras distributed to the Iraqi people, most of whom consider the war and the subjugation of the occupation forces as a growing pain for the improvement of their nation. And compared to Saddam it is simply a faint scratch on the skin. Furthermore, Netflix as its main distributor advertised it before the funny elections we had just sent by sending a mass e-mail to its entire list to watch the movie. Many of those who should be labeled as opinions played as facts listed by the Iraqis interviewed are wrong. If one has to examine the documents of the Red Cross on the torture of Abu Ghraib, it was not Saddam's henchmen who were tortured, it was a nice mix of innocent civilians of 80-90% and 10-20% of detainees rightly held . It has never been revealed that none of that 10-20% were followers of Saddam or curfew violators. In addition, the Arab world has never listed "Democracy" as one of its opponents, the more correctly the United States is the 6 billion dollars a year for Isreal, our military bases in Saudi Arabia and our interest in oil. I agree that the media is a complete distortion, but this film shows the same distortion. I'm afraid the Iraqi people that this film represents have been modified to speak with a Yankee voice. Yes, it is true that Saddam is a vomit, and that his removal many see for the better. It is true that some Iraqis are actually paid with a good salary. Just as it is true that no Iraqi people have control of their oil and the most appreciated US corporations. Nor does it mention that 20,000 civilians died due solely to US artillery. Still 15% of the country that once had running water and electricity now no. Nor does it mention that from 1993 to 2003 the UN sanctions decided and created by the US government killed over 200,000 Iraqi civilians. Nor does it mention democracy when people decide the government, not a massive war machine that sends the message "Be killed or obeyed". I fear the cutting room floor should have quite a few Iraqis who are not so happy with the Occupation. Just as the vast majority of the world was not for war. In fact America, the British, Spain and the rest of them are not carriers of democracy, they turned their backs on them when they saw how full their pockets could have been. Alive, Saddam is out of power, but I fear that no Iraqi is still in power. Corporations are in power, the media are in power. Read, do your research and don't let yourself be blindfolded.
