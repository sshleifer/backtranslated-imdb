This seems to be two films united in one. In the first, ZaSu Pitts is a renegade in a small town. He wants to help the romantic life of Marjorie Woodworth. OK: I had never heard it before. But she and Pitts are on both sides of this concoction. <br /> <br /> Before we know it, Pitts is no longer Miss {Polly. She is Emmie. I had to rewind to see if I had fallen asleep somewhere. I hadn't done it. It is no longer in a small town, but on the way to the title Destination of the honeymoon. <br /> <br /> The film has some nice moments. The first part is better, with roles for what appears to be a third-rate actress who works in Hollywood at the time. <br /> <br /> And what do you think of Mrs. Woolworth? Seems a bit like Betty Hutton. Seems a bit like Marie Wilson. It's pretty, certainly. But she is not a comedian. <br /> <br /> Pitts has often been used in very small roles. Here she has the biggest role. It's always fun, even though this movie made me wonder if a little bit of her didn't do much. (As a cartoonist, when she was a tragic actress from Von Stroheim - "The Wedding March" and Greed "are the two I saw - it was brilliant.)
