I'm not sure who is having the most fun, the people who wrote the reviews or the director of the movie. I could no longer read this comment or watch this movie, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I can see a low-cost western movie that is made with passion and interest in details, but using a garage with art deco letters, pastel colors, actors who seem to fall asleep because the script is so boring and the boom that makes its way with the camera every two scenes, which is definitely not my definition of "one of the best western movies" produced in the new millennium ". <br /> <br /> Please, if any of you had friends in the movie, say it!
