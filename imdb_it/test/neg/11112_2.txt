Chupacabra Terror: 2/10: It was the Navy Seal team that tipped the balance from the bad cheese film to the bad. Until then there was a lot of bad movie luggage but the seals ?? They wear black-painted bicycle helmets. Know those with air holes that make every adult wearing them as a complete tool. Obviously the low fishing boat that they took to say goodbye to the cruise ship may have been another clue (he couldn't get past Tampa Bay, let alone an ocean) ?? and their tactics would not pass to a third-choice XBOX game. <br /> <br /> Director John Shepphird has the photos of John Rhys-Davies in a compromising position with a Hobbit? Because I can't think of any other reason why it would have been in this movie. The other actors have a great excuse. They are unattractive hacks with no talent that could not be hired for a commercial. The plot is that two men try to smuggle the mythical Chupacabra (the love that says that name) aboard a cruise ship and loosens it. <br /> <br /> The sets consist of horrible falsifications of cruise ships (complete with carded trees the size of a small apartment), the killing of monsters are at the bottom of the barrel, there is no nudity, and many actors really bad guys refuse to finish their death scenes. Of particular annoyance is a gigolo character in a film by Doris Day from the 1960s. <br /> <br /> The cast bleeds ketchup while the Chupacabra bleeds day glowing in dark blood. (Because a goat that eats a Mexican mammal would bleed everything except red is beyond me.) <br /> <br /> Each B movie has a tipping point that makes it a fun moment (Hey is a lesbian shower scene, OMG that boy ate it is his own eyeballs) or not so funny (Did they just call those forty overweight guys wearing Navy Seals overalls and bicycle helmets?) Chupacabra falls into the side of the B movie not so funny with a thud.
