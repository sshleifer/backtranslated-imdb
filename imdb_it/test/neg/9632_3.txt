I've seen this movie a few times and never liked it very much. I'm not a so-called "nu horror" fan, so I can't be fired for this account. I found it a bit seedy, I think the thing that bothers me about Hammers is the sexploitation aspect, not the sex mind, but Sexploitation. I'm surprised how many people have rated this movie so well, so I'll take another look at it. But for me, it wasn't scary, it had no atmosphere, just a bit of "omnodia, look at those bad / stupid London prostitutes and that innocent little Anna who's about to be raped by another ugly man, ooherh!" I suppose in the end for me, the film had no depth, only a group of malicious and unscrupulous men and women only there for the value of the titillation. This was no doubt to some extent what Victorian England was, but the sets are also too clumsy and boring that convey a sense of Victorian threat. The horrors of Roger Corman, on the other hand, are now style, atmosphere and elegant horror. For me, this was just exploitative, flat-footed rubbish.
