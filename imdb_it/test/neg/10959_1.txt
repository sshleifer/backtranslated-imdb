I saw this movie a couple of months ago when it appeared on Blockbuster shelves. It is officially the only film I wanted to cancel. Let me start by saying that I like "B" movies. I consider "Ice Pirates" one of the best comedies EVER. I will also notice that I am a writer and that I met the director / writer of this cinematic wonder. <br /> <br /> Evaluate the acting: if I had chosen a bright spot I would have to stress that Dion Day had an admirable recitative debut with his role in this. For those who don't know, Dion is a boxer and not an actor, so we'll forgive his lame death sequence. Why don't you shoot the gun you are holding once? Budget? It would take pages to highlight bad acting, so I'll just cover the egocentric role, Ryn Baskin. Ryn (who looks like a name chosen from a comic book because he sounded cool) has time to watch in this film, probably because he was a producer. His appearance is perfect, but his delivery evokes memories of SNL snatching soap operas. I suppose he could do so much with what was written for him, but part of the blame is definitely his. <br /> <br /> Special effects: It is not my specialty, but for a low budget film I suppose the trick and the game of the gun was acceptable. It didn't bother me, but it didn't impress. <br /> <br /> Writing / Directing: Oscar for the best screenplay is not something I can foresee that Gerald Nott has ever won. Not only is the plot rudimentary, but the dialogue is flat and prodded. I understand the stylized hokee-ness, but this was just bad writing. The thing that bothered me most was theft. Nott stole Viggo's scenes, shots and facial hair from a string of other films. The scene where Russell Crow is walking through the wheat field in the Gladiator, Whole sequences from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, that kind of thing doesn't cut me right. I will choose not to comment on the shooting because I do not know what it takes to establish a good shot etc ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Do not rent this movie, do not even pirate it. It's too bad to waste time. Good reviews can be completely false after meeting Gerry. It seems more likely to publish them alone.
