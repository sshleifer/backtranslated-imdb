This must be the worst movie I've ever seen. The part where they lose their daughter? with the nuance of the poltergeist rip-off? I push him over the edge with stupidity. I saw it on showtime, so there were still the soft-core porn cheese scenes. I have to say that it made my ass laugh. The 3D effects of the 80s were very out of place. Including an invisible cat and a rotating vortex. Wow, I wonder if the people who did it really feel fulfilled in life. The actress who plays the wife looks familiar but sucks anyway. His screams could be used as a torture device in hell for more than retired Nazis. Anyway thanks for the show for the super-lousy horror movie. I will always enjoy the time when I saw the biggest waistline of time and money I've ever seen.
