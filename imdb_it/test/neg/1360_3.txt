Not much in this film. There are some key moments and everything else speaks of a crucial moment that takes place before the film begins. The main mechanism used in the story is the flashback. Flashbacks can be used very well, but I'm not here. There is a zero indication when they flash forward or backward, and there are only weeks that separate the events, so the context in which a scene takes place is the only way to know when something happens. Perhaps this was intended to add a sense of mystery to places, but it was largely annoying. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in watching a 100-minute on-screen discussion of the why of things and a bad interrogation of good versus evil, have fun. If you look at the close-ups of a mostly blank look on Ryan Gosling's face for most of the movie that fascinates you, you're in luck. Unfortunately, I can't find any reason to recommend this movie. Oh, and as another reviewer indicated, Spacey is really alone in a cameo here, and he plays with a disinterested detachment that you've probably already seen. <br /> <br /> *** The rest contains spoilers even if some of the larger points are held back open and never learn what exactly happened. The implication is that he was killed to stop the profound sadness that was communicated through the boy's eyes. There are not many other unanswered questions because the characters besides the boy and the protagonist are very one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Regarding what is with the main character ... Another review suggested that he is crazy. I agree that it is not "right", but I do not know that I would call it crazy. It seems that the film tried to communicate that it was either autistic or delayed in some way, because it seemed sure slow and unable to understand the obvious. Either that or they were going for a young man neglected with a detachment disorder and / or who was heavily medicated. As always, Ryan Gosling is good at conveying something to the public, but it seems exactly what was deliberately left unfinished in this case. This film doesn't provide answers, just questions, but it was a pretty bad film that I didn't really care for.
