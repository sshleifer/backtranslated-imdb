This film has a lot of action and little heart. Let's forget for a moment that everything about the Russian revolution is wrong, after all we have only a little less than an hour to tell our story. In fact, the abdicated tsar after the First World War proved a disaster for the country, and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the Leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war. Now, let's get back to our story. <br /> <br /> Here we have the "noisy" revolution in Russian newspapers in what appears to be still a functioning country until the violence suddenly explodes and upsets the life of the noble baron Nikita 'Nikki' Krasnoff (Douglas Fairbanks Jr .). He flees his home with his ex-girlfriend Tanyusha (Nancy Carroll) in tow, and they begin to make a new life in Constantinople. Before the revolution, the baron used to make a comedy for the girl, not out of passion, but out of boredom as a diversion. The revolution does not change this, and continues to try to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl. It certainly doesn't make the audience like this guy to see him play with her like that. Tanyusha follows the baron because he has literally no place to go after the revolutionaries took control of the baron's house, and he knew no other life than to have waited for Nikki with his hands and feet. Once in Constantinople, Nikki quickly tires of life as a penniless worker, and that is when she meets her former lover, the Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina, who has a plan to take them to Paris, where the tsarists got together later the revolution. Unfortunately for Tanyusha, Vera's plan does not include it. <br /> <br /> This film manages to completely waste the considerable acting talents of young talkie actress Nancy Carroll. She does a good job with what little has been given to her, but it is not much. Lilyan Tashman is the protagonist here, although she has only a small role as a Russian vampire Vera. Lilyan has often been assigned secondary roles just like her, but her earthy voice and glamorous appearance make her the center of attention in every scene she appears. Guy Kibbee also presents himself in a humorous way as an American tourist who is curious to know the Russian royals who were forcibly expelled from their homeland.
