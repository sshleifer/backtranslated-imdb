think of the most film-free topic you can and 10 times worse. A woman must complete as many crosswords as she can in a day. We can't even see the questions and think about the words alone, but let's look at his struggle. The woman seems so anxious and in a hurry to do crossword puzzles, but for some reason she spends her time walking absently around the city when she could be concentrated at home. The acting is horrible, the actress snorts and snorts as she tries to think of words, and we are left completely in the dark. The scenery of New York is beautiful but the film is based on it too much and it gets old fast. The film sounds like a student film from the NYU rejected. This film has no redeeming qualities and I never recommend it to anyone.
