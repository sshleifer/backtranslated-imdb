I was prepared for a bad movie, and a bad movie is, so I guess I shouldn't complain. Twentysomething Tom (the gay guy in the poster Robert Stadlober) has so many problems he doesn't know if he's coming or going. I would not have remained except for the beautiful girls: Serious Mavie (Anna Brüggemann); Meaningless Angie (Emma Daubas); Sarah Baumann is the protagonist of the film in the film. And then there's the soul mate of Tom, Margarete with wild eyes (Jana Pallaske). It reminds me of Béatrice Dalle and Gina Gershon. If you have to remember, these are good memories. He looks good even in the most ridiculous clothes, and I mean ridiculous, even by Berlin standards. I wonder if I would have liked this movie when I was the age of the characters. My hypothesis is that I wouldn't do it. Pay attention to the idols Oli Schulz and Max Schröder of "Der Hund Marie" who perform as street musicians, without feeling pain.
