"So, I wasn't aware of most of what Lawrence had gone through before this movie. It was interesting but unfortunately it was all in common, I was left with the biggest impression that this guy's silence was not very funny, saving the big messages of life for a book, just being fun on stage, if you want to see a funny Martin Lawrence , go and hire some of the old Def Jam for which you hosted. Don't rent Runteldat.
