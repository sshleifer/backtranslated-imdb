It seems that all the companies that enjoy with the taxes taken from Romania for the image, grant the image that disappears since 1994. They are just trying to get the oldest machine that had founded it, but they never take pictures of the Lamorghini, Ferrari, Aston Martin and all the new Mercedes that are more than you can find in some important countries. <br /> <br /> A second problem is that they filmed in some districts of Bucharest where they had the chance to clean up the streets and put people in clothes with I don't know maybe the clothes of the 90's and make them look so stupid by realize that the script was perhaps a second hand bought by ebay or that it was worth. <br /> <br /> The wists for the future will continue to make films in the United States and to earn good money there rather than give us a little and feel ashamed of our country. I have no reason to believe that someone will understand the message (besides my English ---: sorry)
