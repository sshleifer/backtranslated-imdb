Based on Elmore Leonard's novel of the same name, does Killshot suffer from lack of attention, direction and creativity ?? all the elements that the original story probably had, and the negative test projections forced severe changes (including the complete removal of a character) resulting in a film that doesn't look like a Leonard story. Too many characters populate a plot that is too simplistic and direct (not a typical trait of the author's work) and the attention moves continuously between two hitmen who are difficult to love and a couple in difficulty who do not command our understanding. While the story itself offers precious few turns, unfortunately at the end of the film its charm still remains a mystery. <br /> <br /> Armand washed war man "The Blackbird" Degas (Mickey Rourke) follows a strict code during his missions that he inadvertently faces his last assignment. Now on the run from his former employer, he joins at random with the inept misfit criminal Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to earn some money in exchange by extorting a wealthy real estate agent. When the fighting couple Carmen and Wayne Colson (Diane Lane and Thomas Jane) are aware of the confusing plot of the thieves, they are forced to hide while the mad assassins stop at nothing to silence the two witnesses. <br /> <br /> Killshot shows that being based on an Elmore Leonard novel is not a reason for immediate success or a promising adaptation. The characters, the situations and even the resolutions in the film are all tired and unoriginal and only very randomly suggest something more. Isn't it that there wasn't a potential, especially when Rourke's murderer, calm and collected in black, perfectly executes a shot during the opening scene ?? the purpose and the principal are simply continually abandoned while every minute passes by. The style and the way in which each character is presented is the most intriguing; visually the roles of Bird and also of Wayne are well interpreted, giving immediate interest and depth to the characters that typically end up in a creative impasse. <br /> <br /> The combination of the cold and calculating Black Bird with the irrational and explosive Richie is a tempting combination (comparisons with Fargo would be too extravagant), except that each character seems to slowly lose track of the traits that initially made them interesting. While Richie starts taking the habits of the most experienced killer, Bird loosens his grip on his own murder methods. Regardless of what he sees in his momentary carefree adventure with Donna (Rosario Dawson), it is hard to imagine that his latest confrontation with Carmen's panic would provoke a confession of his true nature and the consequent carelessness that drastically affects his result. Probably or not, this is the unfortunate fall of Killshot ?? and little fun can be collected by these characters who constantly lose their originality by continually contradicting habits that once made them intriguing. <br /> <br /> - The Massie Twins
