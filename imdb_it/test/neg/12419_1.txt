I just caught "Wild Rebels" in one of the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" compilations, and this movie was so bad even the MST3K crew couldn't make it fun. There are some MST3K "targets" that were films whose concepts were so dippy that they couldn't have been good movies (like "The Green Slime"), and others whose basic premises could be turned into really fun movies if their directors didn't had they made me run crazy. "Wild Rebels" is a film whose basic premise DID is a good film three years before, when Don Siegel directed his remake of "The Killers" at Universal. Both films are about a failed racing driver who was seduced by a femme fatale to drive the runaway car in a robbery led by the woman's boyfriend - only in "The Killers" the driver was John Cassavetes, the woman was Angie Dickinson and the criminal mind (he wrote wildly but successfully against the guy in what turned out to be his final film) was Ronald Reagan. Steve Alaimo, Bobbie Byers and Willie Pastrano are a big jump! But what REALMENTY makes "Wild Rebels" a terrible film is directed by William Gref√© (note the accent on the final "e", present in his credit on the screen), which has absolutely no sense of rhythm and seems to let each shoot at least half again for as long as necessary to make the dramatic point. It's just a shame that someone hasn't made a mocking comment on this movie now (in 2009); the comparison between Steve Alaimo's and Rod Blagojevich's hairstyle would have been irresistible!
