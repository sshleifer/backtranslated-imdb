Actually, I'm not telling the main plot of this comment but with only 2-3 sentences I can make it a spoiler. OK here it is - <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is just a 85% conversion of the Hollywood Cellular movie into Bollywood using Vikram Bhatt software. The title has no correspondence with the story, only that it goes in the direction of the thriller. Just that!! It doesn't even deserve a single star for its imitation, the imperfect casting, a poor standard and predictable story. Undoubtedly I can now say that Viram Bhatt is slowly fading from his status as a director as no mature audience will appreciate his recent work including this one. Beside him, Aftab Shivdasani also makes his perspective as a comic book type. Who knows how long it will last in the film industry? Sometimes the standard in performance and film seems less than a class C movie. But the more supportive role was played by Zayed Khan who was somehow identical to the role of Chris Evan as Ryan in Cellular. With an innocent face, Sanjay Suri has no contribution in the film because he has nothing to impress. That's why those who have already looked at Cellular suggest you not waste more time with this imitation bag.
