This film was not very well directed. they have almost totally ignored the book. I guess they were trying to save time. the only positive aspect of me was that the actor who played finny was nice. Some of the dialogues between the main characters seemed a bit gay, which was not the case with the book. The main parts of the book have once again been cut. You lost the effect on everyone, it wasn't as disturbing as the book and left me lacking. Even the strong language, although brief, was very useless. I was also surprised (not pleasantly) by a new character who was not in the book. One of my favorite characters (leper) was misinterpreted and misinterpreted. He seemed more sinister in the film than was the real leper in the book. Totally disappointing.
