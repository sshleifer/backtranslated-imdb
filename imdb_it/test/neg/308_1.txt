This should be considered one of the worst films of all time. The film was screened at the Italian Film Festival in Melbourne, Australia. After the screening, not only did I want to repay my money, I also wanted the wasted 1.5 hours of my life. I have a very high level of tolerance when it comes to the indulgences of some European films, but this is one of those films that is selected for festivals based on the reputation of the director alone. This film is proof that while these selections can satisfy the egos of the director and the jury, there is absolutely no joy for the public. There is no kind of character development, the plot is a confusing mess, the style is meaningless, the selection of shots is terrifying and the editing is worse. By the end of the first reel, you wonder if you entered the wrong cinema, and at the end of the third reel, you will be implored to stay out of your misery. This film is an abomination.
