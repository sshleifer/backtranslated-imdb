Why are there no good reviews? Because this film is hysterically bad. <br /> <br /> Set in a Japanese prison camp during World War II, we have Jim Brown as the hero who bears a hysterically incredible racist officer, and just as hysterical is the way the brown nose of Japanese officers , the character of Jim Brown. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie one of these actors ever made. Stereotypes do not just abound, but dominate this film. The music of the sixties and seventies could be the best thing about the film, perhaps because it has nothing to do with the film. <br /> <br /> It is even difficult to sit back and have fun like mindless fun. This film is even more racist than the message of racism it seeks to offer. And believe me, I was alive in the seventies and thought that shit like this was just as stupid as it was then. It has never been popular
