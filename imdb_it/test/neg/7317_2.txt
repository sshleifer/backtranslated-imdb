This is a typical college comedy and is very average. The story is OK but not very funny. This is an unfortunate guy named Reno who loses his job, gets his car torn and then his uncle dies in a strip. He has a girlfriend though (a nice btw. :-). However this uncle offers him his villa in Los Angeles and mercedes as a heritage and soon Reno and his girlfriend move to Los Angeles in this new home. The problem is that they would need some roommates to pay the high rent for this house and then the film takes place ... <br /> <br /> The movie starts OK and has some funny jokes here and there, but All Suddenly the film takes a straight turn towards hell ... The ending is BAD. Really bad. It destroys everything related to the film. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see the movie ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
