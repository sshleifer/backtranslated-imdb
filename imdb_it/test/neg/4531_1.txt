<br /> <br /> After the wit and vibrancy of Highway 61 and Roadkill, I expected this film to shine, but it was just as inflated and self-deceptive as the hard rock stars it has parodied. The rhythm was dragged, not helped by a sequence of too long hallucinations, the characters were flat and not memorable, and Art Bergmann is not Jello Biafra. I had to hit myself to stay awake.
