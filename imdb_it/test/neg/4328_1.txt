Extremely boring ... I don't care how many avant-garde bones you have in your body, this baby sucks ... and don't go see it because I said that, except for the Warhol Empire, it's far more fun !! I have seen other Duras films that have been much better, so I am stunned because this is considered a "masterpiece". As an art historian, I had to consider radical works by Marcel Duchamp, Chris Burden and Damien Hurst, and in these artists I can still see the artistic intent, even the quality, and a funny aspect in rendering their art. As for "India Song" - not even the soft-porn - Anias Nin was almost here - series of G-rated sex slides and a voiceover that does not refer to the slide show / movie ...... well shit and not even campy ... unfortunately only a bore and a waste of 2 hours. To add insult to injury, the print I saw was faded and scratched in hell !!! (Harvard Film Archive), If I want to see "having fun boring" I look at Bunuel !! Yes "India Song" - keep your head up until late modernism and be really bored !! Watch a 70's porn movie with all the good parts cut and lower the sound, you'll receive "India Song" but with better cinematography and no annoying music or the screams of the Vice Consul !!!.
