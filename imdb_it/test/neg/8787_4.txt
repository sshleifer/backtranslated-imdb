I too am an animator and a fan of the medium, so when I saw this movie in a $ 5 basket I thought it was worth adding something to my collection. Although I don't regret having a new addition to my animation library, this film was decidedly disappointing. <br /> <br /> The premise has enough potential. A penguin named Hubie finds the perfect pebble to give to the girl he loves like the penguin equivalent to an engagement ring but before he can give it to him, he is chased by an evil rival and lost at sea. So he makes friends with another penguin who helps him find his way home. This set up is not exceptional but it is enough to set what could be a fun adventure. Unfortunately the exploits of the duo have never been so numerous and everything becomes rather repetitive. Most of the situations in which they find themselves are really uninspired and lacking in creativity ... and the bond between them is picky and forced. <br /> <br /> The entertainment is good but not up to standard Don Bluth standards. This is the type that The Secret of Nimh, Land Before Time and An American Tale gave us, all with an attention to detail that often surpassed Disney, the grandfather of animation. This is not far beyond the high-end TV show. <br /> <br /> The music is good but rather forgettable and the voice actors are all waste of talent ... Martin Short is particularly wasted here as a protagonist that despite talking about a bumbler he is practically a straight man through the whole film . <br /> <br /> In short, the film is probably aimed at very young children, but a good family film should appeal to all ages and unfortunately does not have what it takes.
