Not even two years have passed since I saw this movie, yet I can barely remember a thing about this movie. Needless to say, I found VERY forgettable. Of what I remember, nothing stands out particularly well. A talented cast is wasted on what I suppose was a dark comedy, but if this is the case, it fails miserably. At best, this film is slightly interesting. In the worst case, the seemingly ubiquitous covered skies are more interesting than the plot. If you like watching movies where it always looks wet and beautiful, then I imagine you might find something you like in this picture. It simply tries to ignore what else is happening, because it is barely watchable.
