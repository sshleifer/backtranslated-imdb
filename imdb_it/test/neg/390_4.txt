The best scene of "The People Across The Lake" is the truly gruesome night-time opening scene, with a house, a murder and a lake. After that, from then on it's practically downhill with regards to horror. A family (mother, father, sister and younger brother) is fed up with the (moderately) dangerous suburban environment and decides to go and live near the titular lake. From that moment on, the film presents too many happy lameness, linked to the family, near the lake, with occasional corpses popping up here and there. The couple of scenes in which they discover the bodies are quite convincing (in terms of creepy), but they are in stark contrast to the rest of the events (which only concern the everyday life of the established family). The truth about things (the mystery about who is doing the murder) is learned too soon, leaving only the unaware family and the viewer yawning during the unavoidable ending (with a discovery in a basement and running around the house), as if this the thing made for the TV suddenly remembered that it had to be a horror movie. It's not really bad; the content and the story are not interesting enough. The only highlight in the cast is Barry Corbin, although his performance / character is a little too stupid to be taken seriously. Cutie blonde Tammy Lauren (daughter) could be a recognizable face even for horror fanatics, as she also starred in "Wishmaster" (1997), and made TV releases such as "I Saw What You Did" (1988) & "The Stepford Children" (1987). He doesn't have much to do in this film though. Ignore, but watchable, if anything.
