Wicked Little Things (known in Australia as "Zombies") is a rare find ?? a film that promises one thing but delivers another. It is one of the few genre films made by Millennium Pictures, a European film studio known for making various action movies and B-level thrillers, some with the action star Jean-Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> Karen Tunny and her two daughters Sarah and Emma arrive in the city of Addytown, Pennsylvania, to move into a large house that Karen's late husband owned after finding a miner's act in its effects. Once they arrive, they discover that the house is very old and needs repair. But the conditions of the house are the least of their problems, since they discover that the area is subject to disappearances and Karen is in front of the owner of the area and has ordered to move. Once night fell, the Tunnys discover the reason behind the disappearances: a group of zombie children, killed in a collapse of a mine in the area more than 85 years ago, go out to kill everything that goes into the woods. With the help of a grizzled neighbor, Karen tries to end the curse in front of her and her children become the next victims. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD expecting a movie with carnivorous zombies, but I was disappointed with one thing: the film is more like a ghost story than the usual zombie movie, with dead children being the 'incarnation of a curse that haunts the woods, taking revenge for everything that moves at night (even if the internal logic is somehow children can be satisfied only by the sacrifice of animals and are repulsed by blood guards at the doors how vampires are repelled by garlic and mirrors ... shouldn't these kids be zombies? The plot as such would not be a problem and would actually be fun, but the main problem is that the producers have adapted a script with the intention of creating a zombie movie, only to fall back on their face with this effort. <br /> <br /> As such, a film like this would be fine as a ghost story but, due to a poor script, it becomes nothing more than an entirely routine effort. The greatest strength of the film is acting, with the cast offering better performance than the film deserves. Of particular note is Scout Taylor-Compton, who plays his role quite well ?? it's a shame to ruin his kind of credit with a very poor performance in the HALLOWEEN remake (or maybe it's just Rob Zombie's script).
