Even by the standards of most B-movies, this film is by far the worst I've ever seen. The graphics are so scarce that a man in a monster looks more realistic. the effects of the ocean water are particularly ridiculous, including the scene in which they board the mini-sub, and the water seems frozen in place. The problems with this film are so numerous that I will stop here with the details. needless to say, I'm not kidding when I say that even Uwe Toilet Boll could do a better job. Avoid this movie at all costs, there are other quality B movies out there that, despite being horrible, are at least a good way to pass the time.
