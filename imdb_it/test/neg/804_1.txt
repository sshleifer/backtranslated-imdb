Where do I start? The story was so bad, it must have been written in a high school club! The acting was so wooden that I felt sorry for the actors! An actor even reminded me of how a deer should look when looking at the headlights of a car! Another actor has this constant aspect of being constipated! But it was the dialogue that takes the cake! <br /> <br /> Our hero tells his captors - all in possession of submachine guns - if you put a finger on a captive woman you will be dead. Moments later, the strongest guard, built like a truck, and the only women prisoners go there. When our fearless leader, who has this boring and irritating gangster voice, takes the wind from this transgression, he quietly approaches the guard, while the machine guns are training on him, and in a moment the neck of this giant snaps like if he was breaking a cure-all! Then back in line, while all the bad guys with their machine guns do absolutely nothing, but basically they scream at him! <br /> <br /> I could go on forever! This film is a field gem; and if you have a sense of humor, it is guaranteed to make you laugh so hard that your eyes will tear!
