In general, I am an admirer of the Jess Franco film but, for some of these films, I really find it hard to understand the motivation behind them or even their reason for existence. Like this sick puppy, for example. "Sadomania" has absolutely no cinematographic value, it is badly done without any kind of plot and presents some of the most insignificant crack sequences ever captured in the film. This is another dirty film of women in prison where rape, lesbian action and violent torture games are daily routine. Guards are crazier than prisoners and the institution is protected by a helpless governor who becomes sexually aroused only when he sees a girl having sex with a dog (!). The girls are all very beautiful and naked throughout the film, yet you can't enjoy this show with all the perversion that's happening. The questionable highlights include a barbarian hunting game (you can guess what its prey is), a duel to the death between a guard and a prisoner and the image of a poor girl with a needle injected throughout the nipple. Auch! Avoid this disaster and you will save yourself the trouble of taking two toilets to wash away the dirt.
