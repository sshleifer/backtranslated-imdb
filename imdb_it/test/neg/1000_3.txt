First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of all the actors that appear in this film and at the time I rented it, I wanted to like it. <br /> <br /> I think the main reason I was so disappointed was the fact that the external box promised me a suspense thriller. In my eyes, a suspenseful thriller for British films is like something out of a Ruth Rendell novel, something that has a lot of twists and turns and leaves the viewer with an ending that is unlikely to be forgotten soon. <br /> <br /> This film started with the promise of being such a film. We have our main character, who suspects a man he doesn't like, of being involved in a success and an escape that killed the husband of one of his servants. His notions prove to be correct, but the idea that his wife might be involved doesn't happen to him until he confesses to being part of the crime. <br /> <br /> The elements of a good suspense were in place at this point, but from there, I felt that the film took a different direction and became almost a sort of delicate soap opera on who wants to stay with whom and what is the love for a true relationship. The film would have been nice to me if the outer box had spoken of a twisted lover's triangle and hadn't been labeled as suspense thriller. It looked more like a soap opera story and the initial setting seemed to be a slight distraction for the real content of the film. I felt that this film could have done much better than it did. I felt as if it continued to lead the viewer to a great event that never materialized. So, I have to give a lower rating than I wanted and say that it didn't live up to my expectations.
