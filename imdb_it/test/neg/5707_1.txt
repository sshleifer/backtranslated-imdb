The main character is a plaintive and irresponsible study of how to throw yourself into a feast of mercy. He loses it at the drop of a hat, he acts pathetic, he is schizophrenic, and he let me ask myself why on Earth he doesn't understand why these "friends" of his have not called her for three years. (Take a clue, sister - you're a youthful disaster!) I couldn't stand her or her friends. I never felt connected to any of the characters. To make the whole film even more unbearable, someone has done everything to put on the film the most horrible collection of knitted and knitted hats in the world for all eternity (this alone should guarantee someone to be put on on probation for a decade!) <br /> <br /> The acting was not terrible, but neither was it credible, and in the end the only thing I worried about was the two hours I will never return. Don't waste time - go to make an appointment on a dentist appointment!
