Excellent premise, poor performance. The cast of great actors is watered down in a waste of badly written, poorly managed, mishandled films. Only the quality of redemption is represented by the numerous shots of food. <br /> <br /> Joan Chen, Mercedes Ruehl, Kyra Sedgwick and Alfre Woodard should fire their agents.
