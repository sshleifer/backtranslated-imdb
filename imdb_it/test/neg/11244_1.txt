I just saw this movie last night. Within 30 minutes of starting, I was hoping it would be over. <br /> <br /> He had a promising start; the first 10 minutes. The premise of this film (a friendship that goes nowhere after spending days (and years) together in "separate" beds in hotel rooms) is not credible. He kisses her somewhere along the way, and she hears Ohh, so terrible about it. <br /> <br /> Very little substance to attract your interest. The acting does not hold. It is very passive. Regardless of the amount of film being shown, the viewer never develops any kind of thoughtful connection with the characters on the screen. You learn that his next statement will be as boring as his previous one. ("Do you have a cigarette?", He doesn't smoke, he wants me to stop smoking, he doesn't know by now.) <br /> <br /> She calls him in the middle of the night to visit him after a year of absence, comes in from door, does not even embrace, does not kiss or express any kind of emotional connection. He doesn't even bend forward to lift the suitcase to help her. That's not how real people behave, it's not how best friends behave. <br /> <br /> When he receives his call in the middle of the night (he is in town for a day), he shows little interest in seeing her face, he acts more like a weight for the night. At this point they've known each other for two years and he hasn't seen her in a year. Not credible, not real. Presumably, he wrote a book on Entropy and Enthalpy, but we never see him write, read or discuss his interests in Physics with her, not that he could handle the discussion. We learn that a watermelon in L.A costs $ 50, (it was not the kind of silicon you deal with) that has no problem granting that fruit. We also discover that the airport goes out when some really really fake snowflakes fall from the sky. I'm sorry but also to L.A. <br /> <br /> We never see how these two characters survive, we never see them at work. We never see them in trouble, they are always on vacation. They have an infinite time, they have no worries whatsoever. <br /> <br /> Beautiful life. Unreal life Unreal characters. Bad title. Bad movie.
