I was lucky enough to read the book in advance and I know a little about Tudor in England. <br /> <br /> the screenplay and the editing of this TV movie was for the most part really horrible. I felt like I was watching a bad dramatic movie over the reference period and then a movie. <br /> <br /> before there were too many cuts between the important parts. And leaving aside the important events that occurred at that time, one is the fall of Henry with Rome for his desire to divorce Katherine of Aragon, which led England to break away from Rome and found her own church. they barely remained attached to the book. I'm all for creative freedom but at the limit, especially when it's a well written book as a starting point. in the book Mary gives birth to the first Catherine and then has the young Henry. Both their father and Henry are the eight. in the film they show first Harry, then Catherine. And you suggest that Catherine's father is William Carey. <br /> <br /> There are too many negative moments in the film to write them all. <br /> <br /> I will however say that Jodhi May and Natascha McElhone play as the Boleyn sisters were probably the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> if you haven't read the book and you don't know anything about Hennry's 8 court I will advise you to stay away from this movie. And for those who read the book, the film will bother you for the lack of details and important plot.
