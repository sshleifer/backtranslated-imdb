This show is based on the concept that noisy + repetitive + repetition = fun. The comic writing is non-existent, in fact it faces serious repercussions even comparing it to fun of any kind. Here is the premise. Two girls accidentally get their cheats posted on the internet and the hilarity follows their initial success, they come up with the idea that a web-cast should do to show their brilliance. <br /> <br /> OK, so where should I start? Let's start with the trace of laughter, often used but never reminded that, the viewing audience should laugh. According to the foley, this show is the funniest thing on the planet. We should drop all the loads in our pants due to the brilliance of the humor in front of us. Laughter takes place seriously every few seconds. Probably usurps Scooby-doo for the king of laughter that overrides the use. <br /> <br /> Then the silly-in-the-face-of-the-best-of-our-lungs-the-most-crazy-of-words-to-seem-silly trick is also used. Whoa and let's not forget to create new words to look like a funny trick. Is this web-o-licious and poop-tastic? What the hell ... <br /> <br /> Finally the acting. I can't complain entirely here. The actors are young and inexperienced, but this should and can be corrected with good professional help. Due to inexperience, the nick should help the actors define their job. Instead, as usual, the actors are placed in front of the camera and said "acting". Which for the most part is the robotic acting of the lines, the missed times and the overall epic failure. <br /> <br /> The lack of anything in this show makes it a disgusting representation of how not to be funny. Do not waste time. This show is degrading to all humanity
