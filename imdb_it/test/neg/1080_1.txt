This is a painful Hollywood remake of a classic British film. Everything that made the original "Italian Job" fun was bled from this festive plague of a "scripted" movie by Donna and Wayne Powers and listlessly "directed" by F Gary Gray. I am surprised that Troy Kennedy Martin (the writer of the original film) allowed his name to be used in the credits of this pig. Martin has worked on some of the best film and television projects of the last 40 odd years. Even being vaguely associated with this skunk IS NOT A GOOD THING. <br /> <br /> Humor is forced, the drama is tiring, all the characters are nice balls (except for Charlize Theron, far-fetched, handsome safe cracker / rally driver) and the plot only matches the original following points: <br /> <br /> (1) Three Minis (modern versions of BMW, but still Minis) <br /> <br /> (2) Use of the names Croker and Bridger for 2 of the main characters < br /> <br /> (3) Interruption of a city's traffic control system to provide a safe route through it. <br /> <br /> (4) Um, that's all. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, what you get is a noble and implausible number-based robbery in which a gang of pirate friends eventually gets the better of their evil partner. Believe me, it sounds awful long before they do it. The cast does its best with what is given, but it seems that everyone has accepted it as a sanding exercise after reading the script. None of the bizarre nature of the original film and its distinctly British flavor has survived Hollywood cuisine. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and watch the original 1969 movie instead of this sucked chest wound. It's amazing that Noel Coward didn't make an Aunt Nelly, jumped out of the grave and kicked the teeth of everyone involved in this warm remake in mid-throat. <br /> <br /> Italian Job? More like Italian Jobbie.
