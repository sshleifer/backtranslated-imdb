I didn't expect too much from this movie, but I was still disappointed. It should be a comedy, but there are only four or five scenes in which I actually laughed, and I think it's pretty poor. There isn't even a real storyline, I always had the feeling that most of the scenes could have been put anywhere in the movie because there is no connection between them. But the worst thing was Kim Franke's "acting". He has a facial expression throughout the film, as if he were to play a retarded guy, but I guess it's not. All in all, I consider it four out of ten, I've seen movies worse than this, but I wouldn't spend more money on it.
