CONGO is probably the worst big-budget film of the 1990s. It is so ugly that it is endlessly watchable. A group of people with different programs probe deep into the darkest Africa, where they encounter a temple of riches just like in the mines of KING SOLOMON - but with cannibal gorillas guarding those riches. For their part, humans have a "talking" gorilla named Amy that helps save the day at one point or another. So much for the plot. The dialogue is speechless, the acting almost uniformly atrocious, certainly campy (Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson are both available to ensure the ham factor), and the abyssal special effects. Wait till you see the cannibal gorillas. And the lava! Oh yes, did I mention that there is a volcanic eruption to complete the grand finale? Laura Linney of all people agrees with this shaky journey. What could he have thought? This is just about the same time that she appeared with Richard Gere and Ed Norton in PRIMAL FEAR, a film that helped secure her celebrity.
