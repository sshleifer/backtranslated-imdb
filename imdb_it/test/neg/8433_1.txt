I have seen many films in my time and this is really the worst film ever made in the history of film production anywhere in the world. It took me 3 efforts to watch this movie. The first time I fell asleep after 15 minutes of boredom, perhaps because I was already tired because it was late at night. The second attempt I managed to overcome the 35 minutes, but once again I found myself sleeping. I can go on like this, but I think you're understanding the point ...... nothing happens in this film. A complete waste of time and money. This movie really sucks. Look at it and you'll know what I'm talking about. If you can get 40 minutes in this movie without shaking your head and wondering what the hell is the point of it all, then you're really a masochist. The only reason I gave this movie to 1 out of 10 is because 0 was not provided as an option. I just thought the world should be warned before hiring or worse yet ... buying this junk. AFTER!
