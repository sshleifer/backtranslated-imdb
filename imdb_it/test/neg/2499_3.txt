D'Amato's hardcore / horror hybrid does not live up to its extraordinary title and intriguing premises, in which various contemporary vapid types are attacked by a monster on an atoll previously used for nuclear experiments, but for the most part the film is so slow, the action so sad and the cast so clearly rejected by having to have sex with each other that the film becomes a task to watch. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because the film creates a promising idea. A group of scientists is taken to the atoll by a naval officer in a small ship. The scientists ?? three women and two men ?? they are an intriguing section of sexual types, who suffer at various levels from nymphomania, co-dependency and frigidity; there is also an intriguing foray into the world of female sex tourism, in which one of the women stops in a brothel to be assisted by two hunky Caribbean stallions for hire. The creature itself ?? a mangled native insulator with a horribly scarred face and an unjustifiably long pinch ?? it has some affinities with the old Black Lagoon Creature and is the kind of nuclear nightmare that has settled on postmodern man since the Cold War began, although those of us Westerners have retreated into hedonism and relativistic science. <br /> Porno The Holocaust is certainly a film that shows the post-sexual revolution of the Westerners who come across their mirror image in a nuclear monster, but the torpidity with which it unfolds really lowers the ferocity of the idea. There is a promising interaction of action shots with POV blows, which suggest that the monster (which looks / chases like horror monsters from the POV position tend to do) is similar to the voyeur in the audience coming down from sex between people wonderful." The sight of the monster that forces a beautiful young woman to suck his exaggerated member certainly throws the ugly fantasies of the target audience on their face. But D'Amato has developed similar best ideas in other films, and Porno Holocaust is a potentially ferocious idea disappointed by the execution (even D'Amato's usual cinematic abilities leave him down with so much work-room stuff).
