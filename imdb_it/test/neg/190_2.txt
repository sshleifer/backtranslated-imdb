Let's not fool ourselves, okay? We all know that this film was made thanks to the success of the films "Grumpy Old Men". Unlike those, however, this farce has no humor and very little heart. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven is the only bright light to see. It breaks my heart that it has finally been given the chance to show its abilities to a new generation of spectators, only to end up in a piece of misfortune like this. There was a moving scene that foresaw his standing by someone he was falling in love with. His beautiful performance was the only quality acting in "Out To Sea". Everyone else is doing things. 2/10
