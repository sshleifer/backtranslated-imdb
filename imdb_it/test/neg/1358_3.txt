Every now and then an indie arrives who has a fantastic cast and a story that seems really interesting and not to be missed, but the film sucks. Some recent films belonging to this unfortunate category are "Levity" and "The Safety Of Objects", and now here is "The United States Of Leland". <br /> <br /> Said impressive cast includes Ryan Gosling, Kevin Spacey, Don Cheadle, Jena Malone, Lena Olin, Michelle Williams, Chris Klein and Kerry Washington. Gosling plays Leland P. Fitzgerald, the teenage son of a famous author (Spacey) who commits a disturbing and unforgivable crime (the murder of a retarded child), but does not remember and does not seem to have any reason. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle plays a teacher in the youth room who is trying to understand Leland (and also to exploit him by writing a book about him), and Jena Malone is his former girlfriend. We see their relationship deteriorated (due to his heroin addiction) in the flashback. Sounds like a great little drama, eh? I thought so too. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this film is poorly written, badly written. The dialogue and narration are painfully pretentious and full of annoying insinuations about "life", the characters are all two-dimensional indie clich√©s, and while it manages to make the Leland understanding in some way, it flies over its crime. <br /> <br /> For the most part, there are no problems with acting. Gosling (who was worthy of Oscar in "The Believer") is a tremendously talented young actor, but the way they are written, none of these characters (least of all Leland) really feels like real people, so there is no it's a lot that you can do just murmur its ridiculous lines and look sad. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone is the most memorable. He has one of the most expressive faces I've ever seen. Even playing a character written in a bad movie like this, it can break your heart at a glance. When he has a good material to work with (like in "Donnie Darko" or "The Dangerous Lives Of Altar Boys"), it's really incredible. <br /> <br /> But this is not a good material. Perhaps after a massive rewrite it may have been something useful, but as it is, "The United States Of Leland" is ponderous, inert, and for a film that seems in love with how "deep" it is, it's really superficial.
