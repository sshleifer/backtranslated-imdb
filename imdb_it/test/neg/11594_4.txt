This is like a zoology book, since its description of the animals is so accurate. However, here are some details that seem to have been slightly modified during the transition to the film: <br /> <br /> - Gun bullets never hit giant Komodo dragons. No matter how many times you shoot the Komodo, the bullets don't come close to it. <br /> <br /> - The best way to avoid being eaten by a giant Cobra or giant Komodo dragon is just to be there. The exception to this rule is if you have been told to remain very calm, in which case you should run away, until Komodo is right next to you, so you should stay there, waiting for defeat. <br /> <br /> - Minutes of slow-motion footage in slow motion behind the end credits make viewing really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> - $ 5,000 is a tool to improve memory and a large substitute for losing your rowing license / being arrested. <Br /> <br /> - Members of elite army units do not see giant Komodo dragons arriving until they are within one meter of the oversized beings. Perhaps the computer-generated nature of these dragons has something to do with it. <br /> <br /> - When filming news that aims to expose tests on illegal animals, a journalist and cameraman with a camera are all the tools and personnel you will need; sound equipment, a second camera, microphones, etc. they are all superfluous. <br /> <br /> - When you hear a loud animal scream, and a person has a gun, he must take it out and point it at the nearest person. <br /> <br /> - When you pull out a gun, the sound of security will be issued and it will be removed, even if your finger is not close to security <br /> <br /> - Journalists agree to go halfway way around the world to expose something - without having the faintest idea of ​​what they are revealing. Fundamental research and vague knowledge are out of date in modern journalism. <br /> <br /> - The guns contain at least 52 bullets in a clip, and then more than the one in the next clip. Nevertheless, those with guns say they will need more ammunition. <br /> <br /> - The expensive cameras (also, remember that the journalist has only one camera) are regularly left behind without even a moment of hesitation or regret. These cameras manage to get back to the reporter on their own. <br /> <br /> - The blonde girl is really stupid. <br /> <br /> - The same girl who says she doesn't enter a house because a Komodo dragon can easily cross it, thus making it unsafe, she takes a team to a building made of the same material for protection - and none he says a word about it. <br /> <br /> - High-tech facilities look like simple offices with high school chemistry ensembles. <br /> <br /> - Genetically modified snakes grow from normal size to 100 feet in length within a day, but do not grow at all in the weeks to come. <br /> <br /> - The military routinely destroy entire islands when people do not respect the deadlines of contacts. <br /> <br /> - Men with guns do not necessarily change direction You are shooting when their target is no longer right in front of them. Instead, they continue to shoot in the air. <br /> <br /> - The more you look at yourself, the greater your chance of surviving the giant creatures. <br /> <br /> - Women's intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn minds. <br /> <br /> - Whenever you're being hunted by giant creatures it's a good time to hit the girls of your age. <br /> <br /> - Animal noises are an appropriate masking noise to 'swear' at the same volume. <br /> <br /> - Old Israeli and Russian planes are regularly used by the US military.
