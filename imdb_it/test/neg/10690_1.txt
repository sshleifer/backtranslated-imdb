my friends and I watched this movie last night. it was pretty incredible. by any means, this was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. at the beginning it was tolerable. It smelled of BAD IMPROV but it was rather hilariously fun, even though the scenes were too long and neat and the bad quality (I read $ 400 in budget above ... looks right) of the movie itself. <br /> <br /> the biggest problem came from the lack of a script; With a sudden background, I know how difficult it can be to keep the scenes short and efficient. what happened in this film is that the actors were left to improvise the scenes and didn't know when to stop, but they continued to go on for years on stupid subjects. at first I thought it was because the film was short and they needed long and useless scenes to enrich it. as the film progressed, I realized that it was just a bad movie. <br /> <br /> there were many parts where I could see that the director had a good idea for a shot but not the resources (or talent!?) to get it out effectively. many scenes were taken from a single shot (cause, you know, improvisation) for what seemed a really long time. so boring! if you can bear to endure and an hour and a half of terrible improvisation, watch it. it's really fun to share but also really stupid and annoying. the acting goes from right to absolutely terrible. it seemed that the only good parts were the parts that really had nothing to do with the main plot; the kid who swore a lot, the barber, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> but yes. painfully bad I felt literally hurt. after an hour or so, my friends and I got bored and left.
