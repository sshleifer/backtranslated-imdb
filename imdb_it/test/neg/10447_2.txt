I was attracted to watch Shark Hunter from comments posted on IMDB. The film was ugly but the shark was beautiful, blah blah blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. This film was bad on so many levels that I'm glad I had the chance to go fast. The shark itself is ok. Its appearance is decent and it is the only thing that saves this film from getting a 1 (I gave it a 2). The acting is incredibly negative and the dialogue is equally regrettable. I didn't expect much, but I was continually surprised by this suckfest. Antonio Sabato Jr. is a kind of biologist or scientist or something, I wasn't really paying attention. He goes down with the expendable crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this submarine station that the shark took out naturally. By the way, all the scenes showing that someone working underwater is not underwater. First of all, if they're just coming down to find out what happened at this station, what's up with all the huge tranquilizer darts and harpoons and stuff. These are the things you normally take with you when you investigate an accident. The shark theory was put forward by Antonio as he started, so it wasn't like they went to know what they were facing. Antonio and this young university student, horrible actress by the way, jumps to the diver's commands when the submarine is in trouble. What is that? Unless everyone has some sort of sub-training before leaving high school, I find this a bit silly. The director seems to think that if the crew members work in the background, then it's a good idea to put someone in the background. Metal processing is very important when you are on a subtitle I imagine. Anyway, I could go on, but I've already said too much. Bottom Line: Go to your local video store, rent this video and then destroy it. Then send an email asking IMDB to remove all records from this movie from their site. All the memory and evidence of this film must be destroyed. We can do it if we work together.
