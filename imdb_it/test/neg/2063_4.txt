Some people complain that this is NOT the work, but then they do not quibble with the CABARET film which was not even the original show. All films of musicals / operas are and must be "adaptations" or do not work. CABARET took more freedom with the original show than the PORGY AND BESS film and yet maintained its original integrity, reworking the material and was judged an artistic success. The same goes for PORGY E BESS, who reworked the work in a dialogue book / songbook because the public loved musicals but kept away from the few filmed works. It would have been economic suicide for Preminger to produce a film of the opera - he would have lost a fortune for Goldwyn Studios. <br /> <br /> That being said, this is a good fit. The acting is excellent, Andre Previn's Oscar score is magnificent, as is choral singing, and the individual vocal accomplishments are incredible. Robert McFerrin (father of the famous musician Bobby McFerrin) nicknamed Porgy and Adele Addison nicknamed Bess. While Sammy Davis Jr. sang his songs in the film, his recording contract did not allow his voice to be heard on the soundtrack album, so Cab Calloway recorded his numbers (spectacularly) for that release. Brock Peters' bass / baritone is extraordinary and Pearl Bailey is her unique self. Diahann Carroll, although a well-known singer, has the small role of Clara that required a high soprano, so old and reliable Marni Nixon nicknamed her sing. <br /> <br /> Gershwin Estate hates the film and refuses to grant music rights, even if the dramatic rights are in the public domain. This sort of hate feud has blocked CAROUSEL's video release for almost fifteen years (although in that case it was the dramatic rights that were in dispute) and is preventing both PORGY AND BESS and ANNIE GET YOUR GUN from being released on video . <br /> <br /> Of all the theatrical productions to which the film versions have been assigned, these last two are the only resistances to the video. Only a campaign of letters to the Gershwin Estate of New York could loosen the reservation.
