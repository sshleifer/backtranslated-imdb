I say that Ben Johnson and the other Canadians say "Ben Johnson?!" - he was a damn MOVIE STAR boy, a COWBOY, and in 1976 he was screaming playing a sheriff in stupid facts for catastrophic movies like this, cashing in the DEAD BIRDS OF KILLER BEES that apparently everyone was thinking of getting us right now. So there are these bees and they kill some people by flying in the mouth and chasing them underwater. Eventually these idiots find the swarm and die and this woman is trapped in her car by the whole swarm. The cops are like, what do we do? Uh, bees die when it's cold So where could we make it cold? I know - the New Orleans stadium! Then they drive this car and its trail of killer bees back and forth through the streets of New Orleans, with a megaphone that says "GO DOWN THE STREETS OR HE WILL BE DEATH". And the future home of tens of thousands of flood victims with its broken toilets becomes the narcotic destiny of this particular bee buncha. I don't know what the greatest indignity is about this great city ... well, I know, but this also sucks. More appropriately displayed on an extremely faded 16mm orange print, although Betamax is a good alternative!
