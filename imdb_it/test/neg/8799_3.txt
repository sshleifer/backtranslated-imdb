Too much archive material (almost a third of this 53-minute film) really slows this down. Of course the plot is that John Weston (John Wayne) is sent by Marshall George Higgins (George Hayes) to participate in a fixed rodeo (say "Ro-DAY-oh"), but the development and interaction of the characters are sacrificed . The relationship between the Bad Girl (usually a Latina - also in the great "Duck Soup" [1933]) and the heroine Polly Ann Young, a Loretta Young double (hey! She's his sister!) He could have benefited from longer on the screen. The happy ending is too abrupt, although this time John Wayne kisses the girl. <br /> <br /> The most interesting shooting material is the long rodeo parade of real Indians, squaws and papooses. But when the best part of the film is the acrobatic work of the Mighty Yak, Yakima Canutt, who gives us the leap from horse to horse and several racing jumps on a horse, you know we're in trouble. As noted by others, the final fight with the villain is very poorly done. <br /> <br /> My copy of "Platinum Disc Corporation" contained an added, spartan, unsuitable (pseudo-classic) stereo pseudo-classic piece of music that ruins the authenticity of the original film. (The DVD box had "enhanced audio 5.1" on it.) If you're going to modernize it and color it, you should add a "western" soundtrack with acoustic guitars, "klip-klopping" clogs, harmonics and an accordion. <br /> <br /> Finally, we must say that this is one of the weakest efforts of Lone Star.
