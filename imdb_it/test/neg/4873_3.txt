MST3K forage. It's so bad that it's worth seeing just for that reason. There are some hilarious things, like the mysterious device that the villain is seen working on for the entire film, which turns out to be this little helicopter that moves around carrying and firing a machine gun without even a flicker, but is shot down lots of balloons (the kind they issue to political conventions). Many other wonderful touches of that kind. Star Charlie Sheen. There is a scene in which he spends five minutes recording a conversation, only to accidentally drop the microcassette in the Potomac River. If they had chosen Emilio Estevez in the part that would never have happened.
