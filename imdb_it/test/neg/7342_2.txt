I'm shocked by all the good reviews on the cover of this movie and on IMDb. Belongs to the $ 2 basket in your local video store. To say that this is a B movie is extremely generous. <br /> <br /> In addition to the lack of a single redeemable character, only slightly better than average acting, and a bad quality 80s-style image, the script of this film is boring and lifeless. This film is not just boring, it's pathetic. (Of course, sometimes there is a bit of chemistry between the two protagonists.) Even the final twist - rather the only twist - does not save this film. <br /> <br /> "Diamond Men" hire "" if necessary, but don't hesitate to turn it off once you've realized its worthlessness. 2 out of 10.
