If you are looking for an accurate portrait of Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary who helped Fidel Castro in his offer for power, it's better to read Cuban history or even type his name on a search engine (you're on the Internet, after all) . <br /> <br /> But whatever you do, DON'T LOOK "THAT!". <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, you just want a good laugh. <br /> <br /> All the reviewers of the time (and the spectators) gave "Che!" their vote for the worst movie of the decade. And no wonder; have you seen this parody? His facts are tenuous at best, Sharif is not even as convincing as a corpse and as for the imitation of Fidel Catsro of Palance .... <br /> <br /> As I said, if you want a good laugh . <br /> <br /> It's like watching a co-production between The Learning Channel and Mad Magazine. <br /> <br /> A star. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Palance can also do W. Fields?
