Bled is a very apt title for this. As you watch it you will feel your life being bled from you. The clich√© of horrors is about people doing exactly what they shouldn't (going down into the basement or going up into the attic) Then the problem gets unleashed So take care NOT to watch this movie. Show the brain that the victims in the horror movies have never been clear Don't enter. And if you need more incentives This movie? it's as bad as Uwe Boll's worst movie I mean, The house of the bad dead. I have often thought of inserting a review of a film on I.M.D.B. and, after looking at some of them based on the comments contained here, I discovered that I imagine that everyone is able to express their opinion. Please believe me on mine
