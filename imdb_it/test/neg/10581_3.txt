Here is a parody that is guaranteed to entertain people in Homer Simpson's IQ range. It is an economic blow for every great superhero, particularly Spiderman and Batman. But it doesn't end there; progressively worsens until it disintegrates into a pathetic set of trollop slapstick from the truck. <br /> <br /> For those interested in the plot, you just have to watch Spiderman under the influence of some heavy narcotics. What you get is Dragonfly Man ?? a boy who marvels, who loves the girl next door, suddenly inheriting stupendous superpowers. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script is as predictable as waking up in the morning and brushing your teeth, but don't do it on the word! For children, this is a little fun; for adults it is a great movie to get kids out.
