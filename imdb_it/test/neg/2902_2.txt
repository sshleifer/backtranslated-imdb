... and the boy is the deafening collision. A female lineman is taken by the spirit of a recently dead ninja, strips off to his underwear, pours tomato juice onto her body so her boyfriend can lick it, perform a seductive dance, then go kill the cops that killed the ninja from which it is possessed. Just to be hunted by a ninja master with one eye. Just like in real life, eh? Animated only by the choreography of the martial arts of Sho Kosugi (and his refusal to put his hateful children in this), you really have to see it to believe it. It is the ultimate mix of totally unusual genres.
