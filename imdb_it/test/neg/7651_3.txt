When my parents rented this movie, I was expecting a very funny movie since Randy Quaid is very funny in comedy movies. However, this film is not that funny and it is also a bit boring. You can see the surprise a mile away and run a long time for a movie that is supposedly only eighty-one minutes long. So I can honestly say it's not a movie that is in my list of favorites. It might work for some people, but it just didn't work with me proving to be pretty slow in the build-up with practically nothing that amused me in the whole movie. Randy Quaid is wasted and the rest of the cast is a list of very bland actors and actresses. The premise of the film had potential, as did the casting of Quaid, but all of this simply broke out and the inclusion of the horror element really seems superfluous. Of course, the sequence of dreams that the child had when he jumped onto the bed and suddenly became a whirlpool was very well done and would work very well in a film that was to be pure horror, instead of one that listed comedies as his first gender.
