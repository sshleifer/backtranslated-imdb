Oh dear! What can I say about Half Past Dead? I was really disappointed. I was thinking ... A Steven Seagal movie! Cold! We will see him kick people, throw people and break bones. We could even see him arguing with someone! Excellent! <br /> <br /> However, I had a rude awakening. This film can be summarized as follows: <br /> <br /> Make an episode of the A-Team, remove the lovable and clever characters like Murdoch, Hannibal, Mr T and Face. Then ask a screenwriter / director to write a plot, which even Ed Wood would be ashamed of and that is too big a fan of the Matrix and John Woo movies for his sake. Throw a lot of people with really bad acting skills and who don't have real names. Finally, add a main star who is becoming thin and no longer seems able to do his stunts. <br /> <br /> The result? Half dead past. An action film so ridiculous as to make me smile at least to the end. The holes of the plot are wonderfully large, for example, prisoners who, when the prison is invaded, fight the invaders rather than trying to escape. And what about the prison itself, which has armor that contains heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers? You also have a helicopter (with a striking resemblance to a Huey) with a kind of nose-mounted video game machine gun. <br /> <br /> Then there is Seagal in person. I like the guy. He can fight. He is even witty in a way that Jean-Claude Van Damme will never be. But throughout the film I kept hoping for that great fighting scene. Never happened. Instead we have people who shoot a lot and don't hit a whole hell. I mean, when someone runs down a narrow corridor and fires at a machine gun, there aren't many places where bullets can go beyond the corridor and into the target. Yet somehow they are missing? Even the A-Team would shudder at this madness. And then when it comes to any kind of one-to-one physical stuff, we are treated to a squalid Matrix trap, without the advantage of playing time. People get kicked for twenty feet through the air and other unfathomable acrobatic nonsense. <br /> <br /> C'mon Steven, you are better than that. Your career cannot be over. Let's say it's not like that! <br /> <br /> This is immediately forgettable (except that I am forcing myself to remember for the purposes of this review) and if you look at it, try to find it amusing in an A-type street team. But I doubt it will top anyone's "re-watchable" list. Out for justice it is not. More like out for lunch.
