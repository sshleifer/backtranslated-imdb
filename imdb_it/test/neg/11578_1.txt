I'm currently watching this movie and I have absolutely no hesitation in seeing it again now. The acting is ridiculous. Half of the cast must be retired porn actors, and to start porn you can imagine the quality of acting. <br /> <br /> The graphics are different from anything I've ever seen. I think there are puppet shows with more credibility. They can't even afford the empty spaces for weapons that shoot the pathetic excuse for monsters. Perhaps I should also note how incredibly impressed I am by the number of "bullets" their guns can hold. <br /> <br /> If asked to summarize the film, I would say that someone had rustled a group of non-hopers at the local county fair, slapped them on an island, added unnecessarily intense music and A 6 years I do the editing. <br /> <br /> I can honestly not make any possible explanation for why this film was released, recorded on DVD and costs $ 6 from my local video store for a day. If ever I had the benefit of knowing that I am much smarter than all the parties involved in this film. I hate this movie with great intensity. Why? I would like to know the Captain, I would like to know ...
