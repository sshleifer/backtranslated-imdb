I took 2:37 at AFI Fest in Los Angeles. It's a very good first film (even if the DV format starts to show itself in external scenes), and I'm sure it has good intentions to show us the "dark side" of high school - in other words, every side of high school. But the director does not have the talent to write or direct to the promise of the premise. There are several characters, but none of them is more than what the plot requires them to be. There is no depth in these caricatures beyond the machinations of "I am a problematic teenager X, I have a problem with Y". The perceived roles of men and women in this story are phenomenally annoying. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the men. You have the stone boy who is gay, the jockey who is also gay, the boy who rapes his sister and Mr. Peepants. As the stereotype requires, all gay men must be sexually dissatisfied and violent towards women and themselves. Of course (or in an unnatural way as the stereotype assumes), the two male gay characters beat women, Peepants and themselves. I would be perfect with these characterizations if the stereotypes were turned on their head, or if the characters somehow transcended them. Yet neither of them took place, and that's all there is in the stories of these characters. <br /> <br /> Go ahead, the ladies. A young woman wants to be a housewife bulimic, another is the pregnant robbery of her brother sister-rapist, and there is the girl who kills herself (I'll come back later). Once again, I don't think there is a requirement of political correctness for the directors (I'd be out of work if that were the case), but I think it's only justified if there's more in that character or in the story. If that archetype was used to reveal something about the character other than "I'm a teenager and life sucks", I'd be happy as a mollusk. But nothing new is revealed! Nothing is subverted, modified or sublimated. <br /> <br /> Finally, the girl who kills herself. This is blunt and HIGHLY sloppy narration. Should we sit down in 5 minutes of a girl who kills herself violently and we've seen for about 30 seconds throughout the movie? We've been following all these other stories for an hour and a half, and now we're invited to torture ourselves for a character that isn't part of the story? It is economic, exploitative and sloppy. Despite the millions of disgusting indie films that came before this, you have to EARN something like that. You can't just buy it on credit. So, this suicide happens, we get involuntary from the characters who go anywhere but below, and the film ends. What did I learn? I already knew that high school sucked - I've been there, done. I already knew that people have stereotyped opinions about gays and young women. I already knew that children with disabilities are mocked. <br /> <br /> What else is there then? Smoke, mirrors and some really beautiful views of the leaves. Oh, and the ugliest deus ex machina I've seen in a while.
