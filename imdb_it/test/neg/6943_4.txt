A sadly obvious and obvious story about a woman who was no better than she should have been. Sadly, the script is by the great experimental novelist John Dos Passos, from an original of the exotic French potboiler Pierre Louys. This time Marlene Dietrich is Concha, a Spanish beauty with a cold and manipulative heart. Don Pasqual (Lionel Atwill) lifts her from the cigarette factory, but she abandons him. He warns his tall and young friend Antonio (Cesar Romero) against her, but to no avail. A duel follows, Concha reproaches Pasqualito for trying to kill the only man he ever took part in, so he doesn't: he points the gun towards the sky, but Antonio shoots him. But instead of going to Paris with the young winner, he returns to the man who would have died for her. With an unexpected touch of Edward Everett Horton as Spanish governor. Dietrich plays the part of a Spanish woman constantly moving, twisting at the waist and postulating and then turning backwards, leaping, throwing her head, and so on. And she makes faces and has a curl in the middle of her forehead. The photograph is strangely crowded: no external scene can be filmed except through a tangle of bare trees, no internal scene can be filmed without so many details occupied that it is almost impossible to follow people moving through a room, no consecutive Dietrich scene it can be turned without a big wardrobe change. The carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streamers it's almost like an underwater scene in the Sargasso Sea.
