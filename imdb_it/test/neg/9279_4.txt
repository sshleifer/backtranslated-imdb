This film is a window on the world of Great Britain in 1973 - a world of holiday camps, pheasants and birds. Actually I was at Pontins Prestatyn while he was being filmed, so it's fascinating to see where I went on vacation as a child and what a world we left behind. The "plot", as it stands, is about Stan and Jack's attempts to turn a job into a vacation camp (25 fifteen a week!) In an opportunity to chase young women and dismiss Blakey. They join the rest of Stan's family and have a laugh at Arthur (Michael Robbins) and Olive's (Anna Karen), continuing to chunter, as well as Blakey's absolute bizarre, but the idea that young women would see something desirable in brilliant Stan (Reg Varney) or lascivious Jack (Bob Grant) is barely laughable. Fairly harmless in his time, now it's just a curiosity of a bygone era.
