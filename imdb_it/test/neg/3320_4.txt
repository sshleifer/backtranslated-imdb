"Queen of the Damned" is one of the worst adaptations of a book to a film I have already seen. The only thing I like about this film is the soundtrack, anything else apart. (Since I'm a fan of Korn, Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington of Linkin Park and Wayne Static of Static-X) <br /> <br /> There are so many mistakes and so many bad choices that I don't even know how to start. So many stories have been cut, like the legend of the twin (one of my favorites), the relationship between Armand and Daniel and even Louis is not present, to name a few. (The plot was dead) First, they should have made a movie of "The Vampire Lestat", because it's the second book after "The interview with the vampire", and not "The queen of the damned". They tried to put so much information into a single movie, that you got almost nothing if you didn't read vampire reports. <br /> <br /> So many significant characters don't seem to have any real importance in this film. This is the case of Pandora, for example. <br /> <br /> The actors who choose to play all the characters do not match many of the descriptions of Anne Rice, especially Marius, who assumes she is a beautiful, tall, imposing blond boy with blue eyes, like Lestat. (Stuart Towsend is also far from being like Lestat) I didn't understand why they changed the producer of Lestat to Marius instead of Magnus. <br /> <br /> "Interview with the vampire" was a fantastic film. I loved the actors and Tom Cruise as Lestat was PERFECT and far superior to Stuart Townsend. (I'm sad that Tom Cruise has refused the chance to play Lestat again) Only Antonio Bandeiras like Armand does not match Armand's looks, but still far superior to this shitty movie called '' The Queen of the Damned ''. <br /> <br /> Anne Rice was so demanding about the interview that I didn't understand how she just sold the rights for this terrible production.
