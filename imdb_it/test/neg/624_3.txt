I can't understand why many seem to hate him. <br /> <br /> This film ties together many of the overlapping environments of historical and biblical epics of the fifties, using set pieces, props and costumes similar to those seen in other films. Here, however, history attempts to traverse all of human history, with a plot of the history of the human race on trial, with a guilty verdict which means that the h bombs will explode all over the world. The prosecutor is the devil, played with diabolical joy by Vincent Price. OK, so it's a bit hokey to call the defender "The Spirit of All Men", but I think it's one of the things that gives this film a sense of period charm. The Spririt of Man is incidentally played rather well by Ronald Coleman, in his latest film. It is also the last film in which Groucho, Harpo and Chico Marx appear, but not together. Groucho plays Peiter Minuet buying Manhattan from the Indians, in a scene played purely for campy humor. Chico is not at all funny as a monk who thinks the world is flat, and Harpo, we are told, is meant to be Isaac Newton, to discover gravity. Most of the other shows are well done, though. <br /> <br /> The other things to cheat are that the process is supposed to be happening in outer space, which is depicted as a region of clouds and blue. There is something called "The great clock of outer space", which, when it hits midnight, can signal the end of the world. <br /> <br /> But in his heart, the film addresses the problems of weapons of mass destruction and the eternal question of whether man is fundamentally good or fundamentally evil; and puts it in what I think is an interesting way. Also, those who like the look of the fifties epic costumes should like the look of this movie.
