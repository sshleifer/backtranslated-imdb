Let's see: what are the advantages of watching Piranha, Piranha? Well, if you've never seen anything to do with Venezuela, there are plenty of travel videos on both Caracas and the countryside (and on the jungle side), and the various indigenous people at work and at play, plus a lot of indigenous wildlife. If you like William Smith, play a bit of an idiot (as he always used to do). <br /> <br /> And that's all. If it were not for William Smith, this could probably pass as a fundraising film for Save the Children or some other organization for the benefit of the "third world". The only time you see the title fish is during the opening credits. No mutant killer fish like in Roger Corman's piranha. You would imagine that with double the fish in the title there would be twice as many monsters that prey on the characters, but unfortunately it is not. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a photojournalist and his brother coming to Venezuela to make a story in one of the last unspoiled places on the planet, but their motivation changes rapidly in that of wanting to find diamonds, which are apparently enough abundant there. <br /> <br /> There is not much of real action or danger in this film. What could have been an exciting motorcycle race is overshadowed by the mass of landscapes and animal scenes that is inserted into it to design films in real time. There is not much more action until the last fifteen minutes of the film (which is probably how long the film would last without the whole traveloguery). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the only ways a movie can really be a BAD movie is to be boring or incredibly stupid. Piranha, Piranha certainly qualifies for that former badge, and is pretty much damn close to the latter. The only reason I won't classify it as a "1" is that the added movie is more interesting than the rest of the film.
