Kairo, or Pulse, as is known in the English-speaking public, is set in Tokyo and begins as an employee of Sunny Plant Sales Michi Kudo (Kumiko Aso) who decides to visit his friend Taguchi (Kenji Mizuhashi) to learn about a record of the computer on which he worked, when he arrives in his place he gives her the disc but then unconsciously commits suicide in front of her. Meanwhile, a student named Ryosuke Kawashima (Haruhiko Kato) connected to the Internet and continues to receive messages and ghostly images on his monitor, then asks the computer wizard Harue Karasawa (Koyuki) what is happening, he does not know, but it seems that the place where people's spirits go when they die is full and they need another place to go and the Earth is the best place ever, right? These spirits don't like sharing, so they make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something, I don't really know why the movies are a bit confusing ... <br /> <br /> This production Japanese was written and directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa and I realized that I hated Kairo, I hated everything about it and shows beyond any doubt that Asian cinema can produce something as disgusting as any American director. The script is a mess too long, it simply doesn't make any sense with scenes that seem to come from a different film, sequences that have no logical sense or that are not explained in any way and Kairo is also the most boring movie. sitting for this year. After two hours this is a real task to sit down, I really wanted to make it progress quickly, but I am sincere if nothing else, so I carried it to the bitter end and frankly I wished I hadn't done it. There are so many things wrong with Kairo, I guess the filmmakers had a surreal, ambiguous and deliberately inconsistent feeling, but those are features that I despise in a movie unless they are done correctly. Then there is the whole Internet business that I just can't connect, I use the internet all day and it's not in the least disturbing for me in any way. Then there's the fact that Kairo, as a film, provided me with zero entertainment value, maybe I'm a Neanderthal man, but I like the movies I watch to entertain me, make sense and not get bored to death. > <br /> Director Kurosawa has made the ultimate cure for insomnia as far as I'm concerned, if you have trouble sleeping sleep on the DVD and fall asleep quickly within 10 minutes. I didn't think Kairo was scary at a minimum, the whole internet thing was ridiculous and as scary you should see some of the pop-up advertisements about penis enlargement I get, now it's scary! I hate this movie, I hate this movie, I'm sorry, I just need to do that key point again, twice. Forget any action, tension or blood like there is none. If you have a very nervous disposition, then there are perhaps a couple of scenes that could make you insinuate, otherwise this is all a way for the PCs. Urgh. <br /> <br /> The film looks so dull and boring that it's not true, the camera sits there for very long shots and when it moves it moves very slowly, this has all the style of a Mexican soap opera. Since Kairo is subtitled, it is difficult to judge the original performances, so I will not worry, it is difficult to take care of someone when they do not even speak the same language and do not know what they are saying. <br /> <br /> Kairo sucks, I hated it and it's so simple and straightforward. Just because it's an Asian movie doesn't make it automatically good and the mess of a story, the holes in the plot, the fact that it doesn't make sense and it's an absolute boredom: Kairo would rightly be torn to shreds by people if it were an American Production The worst movies that I've seen this year at some distance. Kairo has a Hollywood remake like Pulse (2006).
