<br /> <br /> Spoilers <br /> <br /> I will be as kind as possible on this film (some people, including the filmmakers, may get angry when critics talk) ... <br /> <br /> There is a nice car accident and the credits look good and ... here; all the rest bites the big one. All the acting is terrifying, the script is embarrassing, the special effects seem to be made by preschoolers on cheap computers. All in all this film has some serious bowling shoe trends. <br /> <br /> As a horror film it is not very scary and if the horror of a "thinking man" is supposed to have reached a certain level, I kept thinking that the end of this film is very far away. Actually it could be an ironic look at the bad horror films and I miss the point, but somehow I doubt it. <br /> <br /> This is a complete stock for movie phones and I could not recommend it to anyone, and I'm sorry to say this while I look forward to the resurrection of British Horror. <br /> <br /> If you don't agree with this review, that fine, it's just my opinion, and I'm sure someone out there will love it (the director's mom, for example).
