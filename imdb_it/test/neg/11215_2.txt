I saw kung fu cheesy fight movies. Living in Taiwan are presented instead of sitcoms in America. I've seen movies make fun of themselves, but this film belongs to the sad category of fighting films that try too hard with terrible actors, horrible props and terrible music to take seriously. I seriously felt pity for the person who composed the music for this film. What a sadness it must be to be a composer who has to churn out crap like what I thought he should be called "Generic Ninja Fight Scene, Op. 1" or "Variations on a bad guy pointing a gun at a girl's head when backtracking a corner "or the bold" flight of the helicopter ". Then the fighting scenes were over and the credits were running. In fact they made me laugh through tears. If the "special effects" weren't enough to prove that this was low budget, the fact that only two or three crew members, presumably locals who, although good for the indispensable economy of Phillipino, were probably made solely to save money, I've never done anything from this movie series. They rented equipment, despite having made sequels to this film. This was also quite fun. The thing that really made me go, though, was not the music (which left me half waiting for a GI Joe Sargeant Slaughter to appear), but the ending ... I suppose this would be a spoiler if there were really a plot to ruin, but when the American Ninja drops the girl in Jackson's arms and then takes off the mask, I wanted to see him jump off the roof and Jackson abandon the girl to take it. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been the perfect joke for this joke in a movie.
