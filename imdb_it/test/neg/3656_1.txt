From reading the back of the box my first thought was that this was probably a Saw 2 knock off. I couldn't be further from the truth. It felt like they had given someone with a camera phone and $ 10.00 and I told them to make a movie. The plot didn't exist and neither did the acting. It was almost like watching a silent movie on the growing grass. It does not surprise me at all to find out later that the entire film was "improvised". By the end of this "movie" I had lost the will to live and could only have AIDS by seeing this piece of cinematic shit. It was about 70 minutes that I could have spent doing something that was less painful. How to jump from a building.
