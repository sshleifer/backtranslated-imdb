There is so much bad to say about this film and so little that it's good! <br /> <br /> The plot has enough holes to sink the Titanic, the characters are absolutely unbelievable, the monsters are so unrealistic, and I'm sick and tired of seeing films involving an ex-husband and ex-wife put together in some bizarre emergency - it happens too often in movies and has become another bad clich√©. <br /> <br /> I find it hard to believe that anyone would have invested $ 1 in making this garbage, it didn't matter that $ 100 or so would have to cost. <br /> <br /> You could make a better movie with more convincing special effects on your home computer! I didn't think movies could become so harmful! Avoid it at all costs: do something that is more fun and entertaining, like having a pulled tooth, or an enema!
