I saw it for the first time when it came out at the theater. Even though I was only 13, I was an avid reader of "hard science" science fiction stories. The film's technical blunders are burned in my memory. <br /> <br /> Some of the following may have significant spoilers. <br /> <br /> Even as a young man, I knew the premise was stupid. The rocket leaves for a lunar mission, in a cosmos where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew (even if the loose objects fluctuate as in zero gravity) and for this, the "cabin" (the area with the controls, whatever they called it) it was gyrostabalized to maintain the "correct" orientation (so that when they landed, why didn't they land on their heads?) and where, at least in the space near the earth, the rocket engines had to be continuously in execution - with propellant that burns without oxidizer. When the engines stopped, the rocket stopped in space, and could not start going until a PhD chemist determined the need for a small oxidizer. This time, the rocket recalled that it had gained momentum, and the next thing our heroes know they are near Mars (even a 13-year-old nerd knew that a minimum energy journey would take more than 200 days). <br /> <They arrive, they find that the air is breathable (although at the time the scientific data revealed that the pressure, even if the atmosphere was pure oxygen, would be too low to do something good). They decide to camp outside the ship and even build a bonfire. They arrive armed, even if presumably they go to the Moon, where firearms would not be necessary. <br /> <br /> I can see a collapsed civilization, meet stray Martians who look just like people, develop a philosophy of anti-nuclear war, and those who survive try to return to the home planet, and die in the attempt to crash on Earth! To do this would require a long orbital period, they would have died of hunger long before reaching their destination. <br /> <br /> The preceding film, Destination Moon, has used real science in the most effective way (even if their "rescue" with the oxygen tank forgotten the arm of the moment from the center of gravity of the tank to the exit nozzle). This film showed a painful ignorance even of the most basic science. Only the most technologically illiterate should think of it as a science fiction film: it is on par with the old Flash Gordon serials in which their space missiles took off from the belly and spiraled upwards, whose engines were always on. <br /> <br /> The story on this that I considered trivial, and I can recommend this only as a film to show students to make them choose technical gaffes.
