Would it surprise you that my ears and eyes almost bled from looking and listening to this terrible movie? My eyes almost bled looking at the horrible animation and the insipid story, without plot and empty. My ears almost bled, listening to the songs that seemed to be sung by a choir of howler monkeys. Then my brain almost melted due to the complete lack of intelligence in this film. It is formidable at every stage of the process. Talking animals are one thing, but a penguin that can only fly to keep the "dream can come true"? Show more confidence in children's intelligence, please. Next to Rock-A-Doodle, this is one of Bluth's worst.
