After completing the feeble novel, Heart of Darkness, I switched to watching the film, which was a complete and utter disappointment. At first, I expected the film to help put together the puzzle of a book. However, even though I had read the novel, the film still didn't make any sense, so I can't imagine how lost I would have been if I had skipped the book altogether. It seemed as if the writers had chosen their favorite parts and inserted them into the film, and left out anything that could help viewers understand the senseless storyline. This terrible film makes absolutely no sense, and I would strongly recommend not to watch it, because it will only leave you completely confused and disoriented.
