I was unlucky enough to see this movie at a friend's house. What a huge waste of time. What a beautiful piece of shit this movie is! Absolutely nothing is fun in it, from the shower scene to the offensive and degrading portrait of the Germans. There is no plot, the acting made me gag and in the end, I wanted to personally beat John Leguizamo with a stick. I thought John Woo's movies were bad ... this movie is officially the worst movie I've ever seen.
