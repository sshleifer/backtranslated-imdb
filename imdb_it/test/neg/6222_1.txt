I don't know where most of you were, but when I saw the movie we didn't have people singing like someone said they lived, we had people laughing, especially about the plot, the horrible dance sequences and singing of the likes of Brosnan. The only people in the audience who seemed to be fascinated by the movie were the people of the seventies generation who were a bit like reliving the past with songs. I was a DJ in the seventies and I even went to the ABBA concert at the Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in September 79, so I appreciated them and I still do it now. But this film should have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce. The sequences have been badly done, dubbing and editing are absolutely horrible and this must be Meryl's worst production. I can't believe an academic prize winner would go down so low as to make this piece of junk. So save your money, wait for it to be released on DVD and then spend your money on something better, like cat litter.
