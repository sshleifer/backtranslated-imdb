Man kills the bear Man becomes bear The man / bear meets the bear. The man / bear remains a man / bear after meeting the bear. The end. Seriously, this is the whole plot of this movie. Yes, I've simplified it to the extreme, but you get the image. I just hope I didn't see it. <br /> <br /> The man / bear he alludes to is a Native American Indian who kills a mother of a puppy. And while this may be moving, it certainly fails to really tap into the potential conflict between the two parties. Furthermore, there was a misuse of the two moose in the film. But this is beyond the point. <br /> <br /> Overall, far below par. Certainly need a lot more to be fun. Perhaps more laughter from secondary characters and more drama between the two main bears. This is what separates bad movies from good ones. "D"
