The evil gang of bikies in this film was called Savages, hence the title, but Minors Nuisances would have been a better name for this displeased crowd of weak actors trying to look dangerous. Whenever they wanted to kill someone, they rode their bikes generously very slowly so that the intended victim could easily avoid them or push them off their bikes. Their leader had a bad limp, but he still thought he could take the hero and win. As for Karen Black, she didn't seem to know where she was for most of the movie.
