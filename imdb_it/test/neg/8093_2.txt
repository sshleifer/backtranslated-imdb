Very spoiled, but only an observable "comedy" that works like a brother Farrelly refused. The most criminal thing about it is casting. For a minute I couldn't believe Jerry O Connell and Jake Busey as superstuds, who could tear any hat off a woman, nor could I believe (the beautiful) Shannon Elizabeth as a streetwise cop. The story is predictable, but on some occasions it manages to provoke some reproach, even if the "coarse" scenes, thought to be "comic shocks" (one involving an amputated testicle and another in a seed bank) are simply terrible. If this movie is on TV, it's probably worth watching if you're extremely bored, but please don't waste your money by renting it !!
