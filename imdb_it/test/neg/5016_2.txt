I'm not so old that I don't remember laughing at Bobcat Goldthwait a couple of times. But some in which in all his years of drug abuse he has lost his sense of humor and his brain cells. <br /> <br /> From the moment this film opens, one cannot have sympathy or empathy for the female protagonist. Nor will you find anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line. Obviously Goldthwait hates himself so much that he has to degrade to feel better, even if it is his fictional character that degrades. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen Shakes the Clown, you know how uncouth Bobpat 15 years ago ... this movie is worse. It wasn't even funny by accident. It's sad, pathetic and a total waste of time. May Goldthwaits' hands be paralyzed so that he can't write another script. Hit his tongue so that he can't dictate another little funny scene. He is sad and pathetic and needs to leave room for a new talent who is dying to enter Hollywood
