Help, I ended up in hell's cinema! What a completely stupid movie this is. It really isn't good at all. <br /> <br /> We explain: <br /> <br /> 1) The story is unbelievably unbelievable: an anti-EU terrorist group is chasing a group of boys driving Western Europe with a delivery of transparent bags full of pills xtc. And the worst thing is that they are serious! <br /> <br /> 2) The level of acting should be a real pity for all the faces involved. <br /> <br /> 3) An extravagant-eyed guy decided to let everyone speak English to make the international market take over. The worst advertisement ever! The native French and Dutch languages ​​that speak intelligently do nothing but make sense and the result is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 4) The soundtrack is totally out of place and poorly chosen. <br /> <br /> 5) The work with the camera, the modification and the effects should be a certain type of roadster film style, but it is not worth anything and is not intended to accompany this history (read: anti-story). <br /> <br /> 6) Hidde Maas. The hero of Wildschut never fails to convince. A real actor. I would usually give an extra point just because he was around. But no, I'm sorry, not this time, I wouldn't want to forgive myself ...
