I think it's the first time I go to a theater and I'm so disappointed. There were two reasons why I went to see "Astérix et les Vikings": first as a movie buff, and second as a great Asterix fan. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film does not satisfy any request. It's simply a big animated mess and shows that the Astérix franchise is going from bad to worse. <br /> <br /> Actually, it has been so since the death of the first writer René Goscinny in 1977. His faithful collaborator the illustrator Albert Uderzo took his place, but the following books were clearly lacking in the quality that was present during the Goscinny years. <br /> <br /> "Astérix et les Vikings" is based on the book "Astérix et les Normands" ", which was published during the reign of Goscinny. The basic story is the same: Goudurix, 'nephew' of Abraracourcix arrives at the village and Astérix et Obélix must transform it into a real man, while the Vikings come to Gaul to discover what fear is, because it seems that fear gives wings. <br /> <br /> The similarities end here What follows in the book is a never-ending series of laughter, gags and hilarious dialogues with the result that the Vikings discover fear and flee Gaul.The film is silly, not funny, frantic, mushy ... Well, just mention it a default and has a good chance of being applied ... <br /> <br /> The difference between the book and the film may be more acceptable if the film is good, but the new ideas simply crash into a bottomless pit Also the old films of Astérix like "Astérix le Gaulois", which have almost transferred the lines one by one without changing them, they are easily better. <br /> <br /> Animation has the quality of other films of the 21st century, but it has its flaws and every movie novice could find errors. The greatest example is the error of continuity, in which the day follows the night after a fraction of a second, in the same sequence. <br /> <br /> Imagine. They have taken animation studies from many countries and still cannot get adequate film production. <br /> <br /> Changes in the original story are simply unbearable. And they could still be even if there wasn't an original story. Goudurix, in the film, has a pigeon called SMS and acts like his cell phone (!). Grossebaf, the leader of the Vikings, has a rebellious teenage daughter named Abba (!) And constantly challenges his father's authority. There is also a stupid Viking magician, his stupid and muscular son, Grossebaf's faithful bride who is obsessed with decoration (her name is Vikea!) And ... well, I can't stand him any longer. <br /> <br /> We are far from the original gags of the original book. The biggest problem is the difficulty of transferring images to the big screen, mainly because the biggest laughs in books come from verbal jokes and visual gags that don't have the same charm on a theater screen. I remember that the best moments of the book were Obélix who laughed at the names of the invaders (all of which end in "af") and Goudurix tries to scare them in ridiculous ways. <br /> <br /> And if it wasn't all enough, someone on the advertising staff decided to write on the movie poster that there is an existing song by Céline Dion that will be included in the credits. If it was a new song, I could understand. But using an old song is just another proof that the film is so badly made that they are ready to do anything to attract viewers. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of this film is that it is so stupid and the end is so bad that we cannot leave the theater without being left in the cold. In a summer version, it can't hurt ... <br /> <br /> The only other acceptable point of the film is how Goudurix becomes brave. His psychological transformation in the book is too spontaneous and not credible, while it is better represented in the film and the point of motivation is more credible. <br /> <br /> So if you haven't seen the movie yet, don't waste your money on it. Take the book instead. <br /> <br /> Oh René, why did you leave us?
