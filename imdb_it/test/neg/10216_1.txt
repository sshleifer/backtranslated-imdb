I really should give this stink more credit than 1 star, because the film has so many lines that are almost worth the rental price. <br /> <br /> Acting, if you want to call it that, is so stylish and artificial that it makes the life of Ed Wood's actors seem like it. "Sammy", the solitary black character, must be Mimi's husband in real life because he appears in his other films, but has no acting skills. His jokes are priceless because of his absurd delivery, even though I suspect the intention was to create a nice character. His old man in his other turkey ("pushed to the limit") is of non-budget, middle school quality, with cotton eyebrows and sprayed white hair. <br /> <br /> I can't understand anyone actually buying this video, unless people like to organize their own parties at the Mystery Science Theater and need a copy of something like this at hand. It's really Beyond Fear, actually Beyond Funny.
