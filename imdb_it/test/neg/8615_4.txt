I saw this movie tonight and I have to say it's awful! I expected it to be fantastic, because you know, we don't usually have many Asian vampire movies mixed with Asian culture; but at the beginning it started badly: the introduction of the film seemed to have no end! The plot is so weak and if you take the fights and the soundtrack, you really have nothing useful! The director of this film does not seem to have any important notions about how much time to spend on introduction and flashbacks for example. (Not to mention some other things) <br /> <br /> For people like me, who want to watch a great vampire movie, I highly recommend watching "Lost Boys" or "The Interview with the vampire".
