... a recommendation! Gloria Grahame manages the type of orphanage where a cleaver is given a discipline, orphans are hung on meat hooks to punish them and bodies are kept in the freezer so they can be taken out when social services call. We know that the orphanage is short of money because Gloria puts all the orphans at work, and also because there don't seem to be enough clothes to go around - especially for the oldest maiden orphans (the age range seems 12 - 30) ish). The newcomer, however, turns out to be more than a challenge for Gloria - and in fact he has just pulled out the mistress of his mother and his mother (in a witty claw stroke and arson opening scene). Predictably, Gloria ends up alone with a kitchen hook. This was done for around tuppence but was / is a HUGE HUGE HUGE on the grindhouse circuit. The cover of my DVD promised "scary and politically incorrect scenes" and certainly didn't lie. I believe he is regarded as the Citizen Kane of the orphanage who fixes torture on porn movies. 4/10
