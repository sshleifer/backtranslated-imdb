The material is scarce .... the script is terrible .... the mediocre acting and the music telegraphs what the scene should communicate like a kick in the head. <br /> <br /> Give this a lady .... even Yancy Butlers isn't hot enough even in semi-nude scenes to save this tripe. <br /> <br /> I'm amazed that people are enthusiastic about Yancy Butler ... given what I've seen here and in a couple of other things I've seen in her she doesn't have the depth or presence to be a star ... and his behavior off the screen would tend to indicate that she knows it too. <br /> <br /> The last thing is where was this shot? I don't recognize the outsiders.
