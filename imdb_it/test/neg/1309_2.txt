Incredible, badly directed and atrociously written, this is watchable if you have an hour or two to kill or you suffer from insomnia, but just right. Robert Carlyle fully realizes his potential as an actor of supreme mediocrity with only one expression of his repertoire (that of a chronically constipated thug who nurses a paralyzing inferiority complex), which he sometimes manages to slightly alter by opening his nostrils and discovering a inclined yellow teeth (this to indicate anger, tenderness, pain, surprise, horror, hilarity, compassion, etc.) In his role as "best naval engineer in the United Kingdom" and son of a university professor, he is as convincing as my neighbor's cat . Tom Courtenay, equally battered, slinging and mistiming every line, appears permanently sous to the eyeball, and would no longer seem able to say a flood from a pool of his own urine if he were standing in it. All in all, another foolish attempt by the British to imitate the Hollywood pulp in its most junk. Dialogue is a series of poorly distributed clich√©s; the action is separate; the plot is useless and amputated; and the characters, if you can call them that, can't even make them the basic two-dimensional sphere of their American counterparts.
