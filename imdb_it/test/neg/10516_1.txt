In a world full of films - like "You Got Served" - that blow your head off with its huge mistakes, you'd never imagine there would have been worse movies ... until now. Ron Hall's "Vampire Assassins" does much more than cheese. KNOWS that you are angry with this. First: there are no killers in this film. In reality, there is only one good guy who fights throughout the film. Second: The location ... is basically a location: the home of a jackass (or basement. It depends on you). Third: special effects (in no uncertain terms) can kiss my ass. Fourth: acting beats "Plan 9 from Outer Space" in the worst acting of all time. Ron Hall can't act to save his life. Finally (and certainly not the slightest problem): MODIFICATION. The person who took care of this film hopes he never found it. The cuts and shots are HORRENDO !!!! Other problems: lighting (virtually none), the fact that the boy on the cover is not even in the film, and the fact that this film exists. <br /> <br /> To summarize this movie, simply let us know that I tortured the copy of the DVD before taking it to Hollywood Video (don't worry! I used the MVP subscription, so it was free!). NEVER SEE THIS FILM !!!!
