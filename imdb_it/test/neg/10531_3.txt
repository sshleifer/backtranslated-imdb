Steven Segal has made some terrible films, but this is probably one of the best since his career took a dip about ten years ago. The cast is better than usual, and while the plot and plot are a total joke, at least most of the action scenes seem pretty good. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably one of the worst in film history. Someone is executed because he stole money? Do some mercenaries kidnap a Supreme Court justice? Their goal is to trade the judge for the prisoner so they can find out where he has the money? Meanwhile the exhibition room is full of trapdoors and fake floors and looks like a set from one of Cirque Du Soleil's circus shows. <br /> <br /> Then there's the prison problem. Here, The Warden is a Homie, played by Tony Plana. The prisoners have all their colors and signs, and the guards are there to serve meals and keep the prison clean. Nothing like a group of prisoners fighting and beating some guards while the Guardian is watching. What happens? The director gives them a poop to speak. He could punish them next time. <br /> <br /> There are many moments in this film that are good for laughter. However, Nia Peeples looks pretty good, and Ja Rule tries to be an action hero. A lot of fun watching the prisoners all "do the right thing" and arm themselves so that they can free the Supreme Court from its captors. Regardless of how bad Half Past Dead can be, when you look at it, keep in mind that it is easily the best film Steven Segal played in Under Siege in 1992.
