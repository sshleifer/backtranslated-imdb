This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Historical precision is totally non-existent. For example, James Wolfe, who paints like an anti-French Canadian, is shown in London during the summer of 1759. The natives are like the Indians in a bad Hollywood movie of the '60s: they wear deer leather clothes and ride horses The Montagnais had never ride a horse). The film takes place in Quebec City, but the film is set in Louisbourg, which shows the Atlantic Ocean. <br /> <br /> The original scenario was to include the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, but the producers abandon this idea by saying that the costs for uniforms and participants would be more than $ 4 million! I think they never heard of the re-enactment. <br /> <br /> The whole film is planned to become a new Titanic: an impossible love during a historical tragedy (the fall of New France). There is also a song performed by Celine Dion at the end of the film (Yes, I stayed until the end of the film, but I am deeply sorry). But the worst thing is that this film costs 30 million dollars. I don't know how they spend all this money. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my anger, but I'm just too irritated.
