If I could give this excuse for a film a 0 or a negative evaluation I would do it. I was stupid enough to take this DVD in the shop, read the blurb and think, it looks good enough, I'll spend £ 10 and buy it. all I got at the end was a £ 10 coaster. Absolutely terrible, I don't even know where to start. I have no idea why anyone gave this more than 2 stars because I can't think of a good thing to say about it. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically, 7 people enter an unexplored cave, one of them is a reporter. no one else knows I'm there. When they enter the cave, they cannot go out and are killed one by one by a monster. There is no reason for the journalist. One of the characters has some demons from the past where his ex-girlfriend drowns in a cave 2 years ago ... doesn't there seem to be any relevance or reason for it, just an attempt at garbage for character building I assume? However, the monster turns out to be a boy who wandered in the cave like a normal child and lived there all his life. This without reason makes him superhuman, able to illuminate, see in the dark, take bullets, breathe underwater, be in two places at once and have a crazy force (able to move boulders, carry adult men as dead weight, etc.). ). <br /> <br /> In the final scene there are 2 women left alive, they wake up naked, just covered with a little carpet or something. Then they find the image of a child. The Monster then breaks into the door, wrapped in a carpet with a kind of animal skull over his head (he says in the director's commentary it was a crow skull, if that were the largest frekin crow I saw in my life) and literally goes "Raaahhh" like a kid on Halloween. I was watching him with my boyfriend and then he literally burst out laughing. The boy sees a picture of himself as a child and has a flashback about him sitting under a tree with his face all burned and then he gets up and walks around the cave. This is the backstage measure on why you mutilate people and leave you a little deceived by a story. The monster then kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other, cut off at the end credits. I know the rape scene was designed to be shocking, but as a woman it made me feel pretty bad and it was the thing that impressed me most throughout the film. He could have killed her and cut her into pieces and eat her and it would have been less horrible than the rape scene. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that eventually remain unanswered. Apart from all this, the scenes in which there were minutes at a time of just black and nothing else was annoying and the angles of the constantly sickening camera where everything is turned upside down and you can't see what's happening hurts me so much to at one point I almost turned it off. An absolutely terrible film. You could also take the money you would have spent and set it on fire, it would be money to spend better, as if an intelligent person who placed above me said, once you've looked at it, you can't look at it.
