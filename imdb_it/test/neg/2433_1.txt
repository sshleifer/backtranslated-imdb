I can't believe this show went well. First of all J.P. Manoux does a horrible job for David Spade and Pacha's voice is too deep compared to John Goodman's. The theme song is so annoying and the story lines are so stupid !!! The only positive thing about this show is that Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton remain as the voices of Yzma and Kronk. This show is a waste of money and a waste of time. Half of the episodes are copied from the film. In my opinion, The Emperor's New Groove has been one of the best films for children in years, but they have been completely ruined by Kronk's New Groove and this show. You should watch shows like Spongebob, Fairly Oddparents, Danny Phantom or Kim Possible but not this show.
