When my mother went to the video store to rent a movie for the night, my sister and I learned a lesson, to always bring my mom to the video store! In fact, the only reason she chose it was the presence of Colin Firth and she * cough * thinks she's a good actor! <br /> <br /> Start with some beautiful views of Africa and then GO DOWN AND LOW AND DOWN AND DOWN. After this movie I was very surprised that Colin Firth got the most out of this useless film that could destroy any actor's career. <br /> <br /> The story is about a divorced woman who is trying to convince her the man called Matthew Fields whom he met while impressing his friends because of his big house. <br /> <br /> Nimi doesn't like divorce at all and Matthew is going out with the local vicar who doesn't like his son John. ... and the same with him! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if you don't agree with me and I hope I didn't offend you but to all the people who haven't seen this movie, I'll leave you with a word of warning, DON'T LOOK AT THIS FILM !! !!!
