You might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting, but it's far from that. Let's take the concept as an example: the main characters have a great secret that they hide from their peers. It's just like Hannah Montana and That's So Raven. Subsequently, acting is only average. Selena Gomez seems to be half asleep through many scenes. Finally, the jokes are either clich√© or boring. If they are not using they are colorful, but a strange dialogue to make us "laugh", they are launching various props for the room. I really wish this show would use more original and fun material. In conclusion, Wisards of Waverly Place is a disappointment.
