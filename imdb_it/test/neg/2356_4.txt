Saboteur was one of the few Hitchcocks I had yet to discover and I was less than half overwhelmed. The French title "La Cinqui√®me columns" (The Fifth Column, a highly evocative phrase for underground espionage and sabotage organizations) set my expectations somewhat high like the images of the finale at the top of the Statue of Liberty. <br /> <br /> Basically Saboteur is as cheerful as steps 39 (note this is another evocative phrase, even McGuffin as a title) but lacks much of the humor (so the characters are rather down to earth) and it's definitely not as fast pace. Like a chase film across the United States from Los Angeles to New York Saboteur drags his feet from one sequence to another. The sequence of the villain's delicious ranch? Lovely ranch, nice villain but rather tame overall, doesn't really add anything. The meeting with the blind, mixing with the people of the circus, the sequence of the Soda City, the sequence of the ball in New York? Dishes fall, bringing more characters with very little added value of suspense. <br /> <br /> A big problem that I can highlight is the relationship between the leads Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane that is not growing as with Robert Donat and Madeleine Caroll in The 39 steps. So the whole narrative structure is fluctuating, depending on the addition of new scenes. And the new scenes only bring us closer to the end because it is not clear if the hook is the hero's escape from the police, from the bad guys or from his action to stop the traced sabotage. In the 39 passages it was clearly written as 1 / escaping from the police (so you know the hero can't just go to the police) and then 2 / run for his life and then the bad guys to prove his innocence. <br /> <br /> If you want a better Hitchcock than the wartime propaganda of the 1940s I would advise you to choose Foreign Correspondant on Saboteur. They are both films of pursuit with a captivating end, really very exciting and not only tourist visits in foreign correspondents, but also beautifully efficient scenes (the crowd of umbrellas, the tulip fields, the strange mills ...).
