Yes. Those of my generation who grew up watching those old Sunbow cartoons were ruined. The 80s Joe Tune was one of the best cartoons in television history. Well written stories, well-developed characters. Of course, it was nothing more than a glorified toy advertisement, but it certainly helped bring that line of toys. Quickly advanced almost twenty years later and enter Valor Vs. Venom. The entertainment was at maximum average. The movement of the characters seemed jerky and puppet. The film looked more like a sequel to Small Soldiers than a story of a special military force. So we have the character development or we are missing. Does Dusty like to be all dusty? Do Slice and Dice love to do things together? What? Did the authors follow a writing course on how to develop characters with the equivalent depth of Jar Jar Binks? As for the story. I like a bit of science fiction. But the whole concept of turning soldiers into a mutant army was done to death in Joe's universe. Mega monsters or Toxo-zombies anyone? But I give credit to the creators for trying to make fan fans happy by doing martial arts actions every 10 minutes. I'm not a big fan of SE and SS but I like the fight scenes between the two. If you can appreciate VvV for what it is, you'll like it. I admit I am not able to appreciate the VVV as I should. Once again everything, Joe is compared to what was done in the 80s, and honestly nothing can ever be compared to the glory days of GI Joe. If you can appreciate VvV for what it is, you'll like it.
