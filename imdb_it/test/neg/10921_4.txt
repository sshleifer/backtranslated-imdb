Although Charlie Chaplin made excellent short comedies at the end of 1910, others didn't make it. Examples like his new job and Shanghaied come to mind, and I would also like The Floorwalker in this category. <br /> <br /> Charlie is mistaken for a department store manager (and vice versa). This manager tries to steal money from the cash register and make a run for it, and Charlie is just an honest customer but is blamed for some missing items, stolen from other customers. <br /> <br /> There are not many laughs in it, except for the last couple of minutes or so with some great scenes on the escalator. For the rest, disappointing. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
