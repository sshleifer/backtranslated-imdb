Wow. They told me it was bad, but I had no idea. <br /> <br /> We have started a tradition. We found a copy of this film and we passed it from person to person. Anyone who has the film looks at it and then passes it on to someone else considered worthy to see this unique, creative and horrible film. I hope he will travel around the world a couple of times. <br /> <br /> It's painful. Really painful. It is also beyond so bad that it is fun. Well, okay, sometimes it's so bad that it's fun. But most of the time it just gives you the feeling that there's something sucking your brain from the inside. <br /> <br /> Wow. Watch it, then move on.
