I just attended a preview of this movie. A masterpiece of the documentary that was not. Totally absorbed by the subject, the film becomes incapable of leveling out any kind of critical comment against Ms. Faye. Tasteless and mushy, the only saving quality of the film was its use of puppets in an attempt (even if failed) to structure a sort of narrative. But the most disturbing experience occurred while the credits were being closed. The audience went up and applauded. Like fire moths, Americans in the 21st century are still attracted to freakshows. The story of the misunderstood monster is getting rather tired.
