Unless you are interested in seeing 2 hours of spectacular mountain scenery with hysterical characters, a lot of histrionics and an economic buzz of the 70s (though not much), I would recommend avoiding this movie. It is long and tortuous, it has a rather annoying amateur feeling. Masterpiece? No, a medium thriller, shot in an average manner, in a splendid Italian landscape. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of slow 1970s movies, when there's a plot to delight and amuse. In this case, it didn't work for me. The plot is trivial, interwoven with superficial and stereotyped characters, supported by hilarious mobs and the typical Italian widow dressed all in black, sobbing. <br /> <br /> If you don't know and know the Italian nation, the film might be worth seeing as the scenery itself is spectacular and rather breathtaking. However, this film is nothing out of the ordinary, there are much better Italian horror films than this one. Not much more than a feast of yawns. 5/10
