I had never heard of Dead Man's Bounty when I saw it in the DVD store a few weeks ago, and I thought I had stumbled upon an unknown gem, since Val Kilmer had a truly unique role. Unfortunately, it has not been more than ten or fifteen minutes in the film that I realized that it is a disaster of epic proportions. The first clue that you will see how truly awful this film is is near the beginning, when you have a lot of dirty things in an old sedan that laugh like a group of hyenas in a scene that lasts about five times longer. It's amazing how bad it is. And unfortunately it's no better. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmer is featured in the film's cover, perhaps to make you think he has a role in the film, but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of focusing on a group of imbeciles and the most inept conceptualization of a single city sheriff I've ever seen in a movie. He is played by Boguslaw Linda, who is not able or interested in covering his Polish accent, making it immediately impossible for the film to be set in the old American West. <br /> <br /> Does Poland have this kind of border past? I do not know. My knowledge of Polish history is not my strong point, but I can tell you this, the sheriff, as is known in the film, is the worst representation of law enforcement that I can ever remember to see in a movie. He is presented in a very ridiculous scene in which he wears a kind of bandage and a room full of men take turns punching him in the face. Before they start hitting him, he explains that everyone can hit him once, and then, after the first round, they hit him again, and if he can identify who throws his fists, he loses. What the hell is this shit? I am completely incapable of explaining why a scene like this would ever be included in a movie. <br /> <br /> In the course of the film, the sheriff continues to appear more and more beaten and bruised, drunk and battered, until in the end he does nothing but show up occasionally, stumble on the screen and mumble "not without. . .the law??" You see, there is a lot of chatter and preparations for a hanging, the details of which are as meaningless as the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> It takes place, by the way, in a city that consists of nothing more than two dilapidated wooden buildings facing each other on a flattened piece of land that is more of a path than a road. My understanding is that it is a part of Poland that should appear quite acceptable as the American Southwest, where none of the characters, except perhaps the dead, could have come from. <br /> <br /> I heard that Val Kilmer accepted the role because he was fascinated by his unique role, and also by the minimal use of the dialogue by the director Uklanski in favor of relying on the intelligently synchronized juxtaposition of the images unique visual montages. <br /> <br /> Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that Kilimer has not been able to overcome what must have been the truly satisfying feeling he must have received when he was offered the role. Personally, I would really feel that I had reached a certain level of success if someone approached me and offered me probably a few hundred thousand dollars to come and sit still for a while. I like to think that he didn't even read the script for this mess, because if he did it, I was in total loss to understand why he accepted the role. <br /> <br /> However, the film opens with a man carrying the body of a man, played by Kilmer, in search of reward. He soon finds himself involved in a ridiculous love affair involving the town prostitute, the alcoholic sheriff, and a lot of confusion involving a series of stupid and stupid characters. <br /> <br /> There is also a vast and absurd lack of understanding of American rituals. In one scene, a man cut a small tomato in half and cut half in Kilmer's eyes (for what reason, I can't imagine), and then later, a man gives a short talk about Kilmer's corpse, in which he explains that it was "one of the best men we've ever had", and then proceeds to take off his head with a shovel. What the hell?? <br /> <br /> Not convinced yet? Here are some other reasons not to watch it. In one scene the sheriff seems to be covered in ash, except for the perfectly clean areas around the eyes and what can only be described as a bright red lipstick. A man receives a head wound that soaks his head and body in blood. In a daze, he cauterizes it with gunpowder. Inteligente. Towards the end, the sheriff seems to have a broken arm. Sitting at the bar, he puts a rope around his neck and connects it to his injured arm, and uses his good arm to pull the rope, lifting his shaking beer glass in his bad arm to his mouth, rather than using his good drinking arm . Even smart. <br /> <br /> Why not just use his good arm? I have no idea. This, like the rest of the film, makes absolutely no sense, like the title. Summer love? Are you kidding me? Avoid this mess at all costs. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, here's something for the IMDb Goofs page ?? <br /> <br /> Errors made by characters (perhaps errors decided by the directors): This film was made. HAS!
