I can't believe the number of people referring to the main characters as 'boy cows' !! there are no such people !!!! There are cows and bulls and all the males of the bovine species are bulls and they have no udders !!!! There was also a real bull but it was like another kind of animal completely! my god is like drawing human ears on a cat, tits on superman or little mouse with shirley blonde curls - even in animation it just doesn't work! giving human qualities to animals is nothing new and it is to be expected, but changing their body into a transsexual figure is bizarre for a family cartoon: how many people - publishers, writers, producers, animators have seen this and have none better or not said anything - it's completely surprising! I'm not a snob and I like animations - simpsons, beavis and butthead, south park, even the ice age and all the new ones out there - beyond the hedge it was great - but this is crazy - totally crazy - I couldn't accept what many people are so ignorant and I have always hoped for a reason for the udders in the film - an explanation - none came of it - and in the end when they keep this newborn calf and half the belly is breast and pronounce it "is a boy, I almost choked !!!! Please, the writer / creator let us in the joke!
