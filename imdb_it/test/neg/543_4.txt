I struggle to see the point of this film. It should be a comedy but I didn't laugh once. The plot is the one that could have been interesting in a well-made film, but since this is played by comics, the result is absolutely incredible (as comedies should be). The comic book series was very poor, even with episodes, and it is fair to say that all the people involved did great things. One to avoid. I have also just discovered that the comments must be 10 lines long. The central point of these comments is to give an indication on the fact that the film is worth seeing: not to write a theme that springs from it or moves it. If you like: Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, young people, Alan Partridge, Arrested Development, Curb, Red Dwarf, then you could pass this. On the other hand, if you like lame jokes like the ones you can find in Friends and Dodgeball, have fun watching this!
