I voted this film for 3 and this was generous. The scenery is ponderous and flamboyant, acting for the most part is terrible. I think Peter O'Toole did a good acting job (Tiberius), but he must have been mortified when he saw the final cut of the film. John Gielgud, despite his appearance in the film, seemed to play a role in Hamlet. The parts of hard core pornography were neither erotic nor did they do much to delve into the story. Ok, Malcolm McDowell had a nice ass and the guy who played Macro was nice. The guy who played Claudio, looked more like traditional depictions of Nero and was certainly in contrast with the photo of Claudius by Robert Graves. The (calm) climate murder of Caligula, wife and son is inaccurate as it shows him after death lying on a ladder in an open area, when in reality he was murdered in the underground passage on the palatine hill that ran along the front Domus Flaviana which still exists today. There are places in this film where virtually anything caught my eye on it - merciful distractions. If you want the story, read Suetonius or Tacito, if you want pornography and sadism, look at Passolini's "Salo", but in any case, stay away from this movie.
