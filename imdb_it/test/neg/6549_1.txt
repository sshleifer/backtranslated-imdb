The only positive thing I can think of about this piece of junk is that now I finally have a good answer ready if someone ever asks me which was the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It would have made a little effort to make it more watchable ... much more effort and could have been brilliant too. <br /> <br /> Why would anyone want to produce such waste? <br /> <br /> I refuse to believe that a director can be so ridiculously lacking in talent. <br /> <br /> Creating a completely intolerable film must have been the point. <br /> <br /> Everything else makes no sense.
