Warning: this could ruin your film. Look at it, see if you agree. <br /> <br /> To think that we as humans cannot learn from the past. The futuristic society represented the fascination of what Hitler believed, obliterated a race of people (in this case men) for the benefit of society. It hurt my stomach. The plausibility of a Y bomb is also insane. Even in war our self-preservation instinct will prevent the extinction of humanity. We made mistakes in the past, for example: Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki in '45, but for this we avoided a bigger mistake in '63 during the Cuban missile crisis
