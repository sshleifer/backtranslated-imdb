A brief marital infidelity returns to haunt the loving wife Grace Needham (played by the always sexy Nastassja Kinski). She had left the city, and her depressing husband, to embark on a journey to sunny Miami, where she was pursued and eventually seduced by Julian Grant, a businessman with an evil and manipulative maniac, who is very well played by William Baldwin (why is it that all the Baldwin brothers interpret evil people so damn well?) <br /> <br /> Grace's seduction took place as the two drank champagne on a deserted beach that they privately reached by sailboat. Grace admitted she drank too much for her own good and revealed the many problems in her marriage. Julian earned his trust by stating that he would never allow those types of problems to occur if he had an affair with Grace. Julian's manipulation continued as he described a fantasy "lost at sea" that involved the by now uninhibited Grace, who sat nearby, listening to his every word and becoming more and more committed to his romantic dream. <br /> <br /> His manipulation paid like a few thin balls of yarn led to Grace's soft kisses, temporarily stopped by his walking away as if he suddenly thought to himself "What am I doing? I'm a wife I'm a mother I have a real life Real responsibilities Of course, the two of us have talked about being together, lost at sea, but this is just a fantasy. Look what we're doing here. The consequences are real. We are really alone on a secluded beach. Does it really happen? "<br /> <br /> She succumbs to the dream, while her kisses become more passionate. The once-guarded Grace who used to respond to the propositions of men saying" I'm married "enjoyed watching while Julian unbuttoned her shirt, leading to more kisses, caresses of the body and to her climbing on Julian's knees! She smiles, kisses, moans, laughs and often looks at the sun through what is unfortunately It was a short love scene in which everyone seemed to have most of their clothes. <br /> <br /> While I enjoyed the look of illicit passion on Grace's face while the devoted wife was once completely satisfied by having sex with a man who clearly loves to manipulate others, I will say that on the whole the scene does not deserved the "R" rating of the film. /> <br /> Julian has returned home to find his rejuvenated husband after securing a well-paid job, and is excited to be able to return to a normal life where he can once again be a loving wife and a caring mother. <br /> <br /> But the evil Julian Grant is part of the film and is not willing to give up on Grace so easily. Grace has a plan to free her life from Julian, but will it work? <br /> <br /> Obviously, I don't want to ruin the remaining storyline for you. However, I will say that I always like movies about a wife's sexual fiction (especially when she exhibits the attraction and uninhibited behavior that is normally reserved for her husband), but actually seeks revenge against the antagonist. This film would have been much, much better if the film had included more than the one in the plot. My feelings are if the film takes it up, so the film should end it. And this film definitely brought him. Unfortunately, some constraints in the plot have prevented this from being pursued significantly. There are many other films available that succeed right from that point, and I will include their titles in the "recommendations" section of this section. I am also open to receiving email suggestions of other films that contain a good storyline involving sexual pretense by an apparently devout wife. <br /> <br /> Overall, Nastassja Kinski and William Baldwin are both very good. The film is not.
