Adela is a rebellious teenager with the attitude that she is right and everyone else is wrong. It must be the center of attention and will act stupidly to do so. With her attitude she is sent to school of charm. <br /> <br /> Here he meets the typical characters of today's cinema; the nerd, the clumsy, the stepford housewife and the sexual minority. Things happen and eventually Adela "learns her lesson" so to speak. The plot tries to bring a deeper meaning to the state in which Adela is, but he absolutely fails to provide (at least I didn't buy it). So what's left is the superficial interaction within the same stereotypes you've seen in a million movies before. Also the director seems to have a breast fixation, Adela flashes her tits a couple of times too many, at least I can't see that they are relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> So the movie is OK, but if you're like me and you don't like looking at a teenager who pisses people off and do a behavioral turnaround in an instant, which I found really incredible, think twice before looking.
