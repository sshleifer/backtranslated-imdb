The only Riddle in this film was the way it was made. The British film industry needs to make films that people really want to watch and not try to get money from taxpayers (a'la BBC) to keep Luvvies in their lifestyle to which they have been accustomed, doing nothing for it. <br /> <The film was all wrong with British Films which was based on stereotypes, it had to be on a London where people were either posh and corrupt, gangster, luvvies or gawd blimey in jelly, the script was pathetically weak, in the the extent to which the police man extracted his phone and the ringtone was the "Sweeney" theme that I expected. The whole film was a happy sweeney / Minder rip-off buyer. <br /> <br /> the priceless manuscript that I noticed has been left behind and lost on some occasions and it is something that even with my limited street wisdom I would not carry around in my pocket everywhere, at beach and fights etc. Saying that Vinnie Jones is nice that it's the only thing in the movie, poor boy. <br /> <br /> When Derek Jacobi entered the water at the end because it was Dickens, oh my god, what a bunch of crap, and here I am positive
