A huge suspension of disbelief is needed when it comes to Will's "genius". Not only in mathematics - it is also very well read in economic history, able to out-shrink different shrinks, etc. etc. No, no, no. I don't buy it While I'm there, they could also have it with an "S" on their chest, fly faster than an airplane and stop bullets. <br /> <br /> Among other problems ... the true genius (for the time being to put aside the problem of what it really is, and if it deserves such a senseless tribute, it does not appear simply / ex nihilo /. It is never so multi-faceted, and it's very rare for contemporaries to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Better to have made Will a basketball prodigy, except that Damon is too short.
