I love movies ... and I rarely see a movie I hate ... but this was the worst movie I've ever seen, or at least close to it. Every movie that ends with a rape scene is horrible. Hands down ... I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie. I'm really angry, I want my money back and my time. TERRIBLE! Don't go see it, the cinematography is horrible, the plot is horrible, the ending is terrible. I didn't know what was happening during the middle of the film because I couldn't see it (and I was watching on a very nice, big TV) Rent saw, the hills have eyes, or wax house ... any of those are better if you want something of scary.
