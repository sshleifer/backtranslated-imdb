I have always loved bad creations, rhetorical criticism and my film professor validated for me in college. This isn't as bad as the Star Wars Holiday Special, there's nothing at the bottom of the lunchbox of that mistake. This film by The Fantastic Four, complete with Dr. Do-have-no-idea-why-hes-too-his-fingers-too-his-hes, is at the top of the list of colossal mistakes. Doom dialogue "Kill him! ... Let him go!" it is classic in that it is disconcerting in its hilarity. The editing is good, and the director of photography is not bad ... those are the good points. I cannot, however, subject all my friends to look in its entirety, but if I can get the chance, I show them "Can Jonny and Sue come into space with us!" scene I do I also include the final scene, where for some reason Redd Richards in his FF suit, together with his bride Sue in his wedding dress, enters the limousine ... the reward is the farewell arm as they walk away. Most people are completely incredulous that something like this exists.
