and it's only January, but I'm sure of it! <br /> <br /> By far this is one of the worst Swedish films I have ever seen and to be honest, Swedish films are not so good in general. It has been claimed to be "original" and perhaps can be seen as the one for people who have never seen an English language film, for us who have been to the cinema in the last 10 years cannot help but feel like Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein has been sitting a weekend watching the most successful films of recent years and has tried to compress it into a single Swedish package. What can I say that the result can be ... poor. First of all, the story is only weak to begin with, even worse when it's not just a bad story, it's a desire to combine very poor stories - first a failed attempt to do Swedish Matrix action and then combine it with a bad moral story . And if you thought it couldn't be worse, you will notice all the "interesting things" that have been thrown in there for absolutely no reason more than bad, trying to prove that Sweden can also make Hollywood movies - which we can neither we should try. For example, the main plot is proven to deepen the fact that young people play a computer game called Storm that has absolutely nothing with history or for example how there is an Internet side on "Storm" while all 'Suddenly they are only the main conscience characters - in fact I don't even think that Stein or Mårlind can see a point with three-quarters of the film, rather than trying to show extra side effects. For the actors, I have to admit that Eric Ericson does a great job, except he does the same job throughout the film, even though the tough Storm tries to be a film about DD's personal development that doesn't change a bit in his way of Act. Jonas Karlsson, to be honest, I thought he was a rather respected actor, but judging from Storm ... in reality he just had to be ashamed of this movie, his character and his scar. Finally, Eva Röse is just beyond the critics, both her character and her acting. The only reason Storm manages not to get a 1/10 is for Eric Ericson and, what can I say, at least he tries ..
