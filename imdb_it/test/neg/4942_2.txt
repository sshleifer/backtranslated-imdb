In order for a thriller to arouse fear, suspense or any emotion, the story must be credible. There is nothing credible or realistic about this film. The protagonists have different opportunities to escape or overturn the tables, but they manage to ruin every time. The antagonists who allegedly plan it and customized their shuttle specifically to trap people have left many improvised weapons around. There is actually a scene where the "intelligent" girl has a gun at the villain's head and decides to scold him instead of pulling the trigger. This was a completely predictable and mindless "thriller". Each character was one-dimensional. The "victims" were the usual mindless and brainless sheep who deserved to be slaughtered. Is anyone on this planet able to write an intelligent thriller?
