Four young elementary school girls witness the murder of one of their classmates during what they thought was just an innocent game. The killer is a strange boy named Milo Jeeder. Sixteen years later, the four survivors of the event gather in happier circumstances in the same city where it happened. They believe that Milo drowned in a river shortly after the murder, but they soon learn that even the demonic killer Milo is back, still a boy, unchanged even after almost twenty years. <br /> <br /> The cover of this film makes it look really nice (yet I still expected a bad movie to come out). When I insert the DVD into my player, the menu is displayed and makes the movie still beautiful. Unfortunately, this film is not all that thrilled me. The film is your average slasher film attempt and when I say media, I mean just like all those other low-budget slasher movies that have never been welcomed with open arms in most members of the horror community (I'm talking about you, the horror fan). In other words, you could get to any horror fan and most of the answers would be "this sucks". <br /> <br /> What mistakes did the film make? First of all, the DVD's cover makes Milo look really dark, but they all blow their faces in the film in many different scenes. He had the potential to be a very strange character. Secondly, the back of the cover tells Freddy, Jason, Chucky, etc. To pack up and move on because Milo is so much better ... why the hell would you say something like that when it's a no? -name, low budget slasher film that has obviously failed? I mean, increase your expectations about the movie, making it harder to impress you. In a last effort to attract attention, it is said (in very large letters) "From the creator of Anaconda". It shows you how much attention they will have to the film as low as possible. <br /> <br /> The film's blood sucks, the director gives you horrible corners when Milo attacks someone. The music is not so bad and I never fell asleep during the film (congratulations). I'm still trying to figure out what Milo actually is. My best bet would be that he is a zombie, if anyone knows, tell me. Don't worry, I won't lose sleep thinking about this.
