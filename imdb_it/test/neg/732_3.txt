I will confess that once I started watching this movie, he had a grip on me that forced me to look at it until it ended. Most likely this was a latent voyeuristic tendency in me that wanted to see our hero lighting up with his victim, or perhaps the fascination they got for making, distributing and showing this film that kept me looking for it, or maybe some bizarre fantasy of satisfaction of desires that there could be a point at the end of all the pain. But he's not so lucky. <br /> <br /> So you are advised not to start watching it first, for fear that the same thing will happen to you. Here there is nothing worth wasting an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The first-person mockumentary and the schtick on Fabian's "research" to impregnate the Falklands women turn out to be even more like a sophomoric (maybe Freshman - High School Freshman, that is) student film project than you can imagine. The effect ends up being both mocking to the local inhabitants (who, apart from the two professional leaders, are actually real people) and to engage in a rather disgusting sexual policy (it doesn't matter if you take everything literally or symbolically, it's useless and sexist). <br /> <br /> The reason I ended up looking at it all the way is the same reason that once you start picking a scab, there's an irresistible charm to keep doing it until it's completely turned off. , even when you know it's bad for you. You just want to see what happens. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a rather dishonest film, because in the end it seems to have no moral center, no elucidation of the local political situation, or any place in the genre of the political-sexual-personal cinema universe at la Goddard. In short, he has nothing to say and spends a lot of time pretending. The smug would be the one-word tagline. <br /> <br /> I would suggest that the directors rent 'Waiting for Guffman' a few times, or hell, even 'Blair Witch Project' if they want to chase the schtick with a little more style and a little more genuine emotion . Or at least the entertainment value.
