My God, this movie was nothing more than filming by numbers. The seller in difficulty cannot make it to New York, the mentor with a heart of gold takes it under his wing, the salesman moves to California and makes it grow big, then he loses it big, then bounces with the simple life, then it hits the bottom trying to get back on top. I don't think I can remember any part of the plot that took more than five seconds to develop. Case in point (spoiler?): When the character of John Kapelos calls to say that he and his girlfriend were coming to Santa Cruz to visit, and James Woods says there is virtually no chance that he would come, you knew for sure 100% that the next scene or two were coming. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Sean Young certainly looks good.
