No matter what other people have said that you can't review this movie without comparing it to the original, if it existed alone it would be a 2-3 out of 5 movie but it's a remake of a 4-5 of 5 movies and so has standards to be respected and we need to see if it has reached those standards. If the film were a reworking or, as in Planet of the Apes, a revisitation of the original, one would be able to watch the film in its true meaning, referring only to the original. Imagine it this way, if someone took the model in the "Mona Lisa", placed it in a different way, and painted it, you could only compare the framing, the concept, etc. To the original, but if someone has just repainted it in the original position you should compare it completely. <br /> <br /> That said, the film is not only not up to the original, but fails spectacularly, like it or not the original was one of the best films ever made, the scene of the shower will never be forgotten, the remake was thought to be a celebration of Hitchcock but ended up degrading it and its main work. <br /> <br /> The degrading aspects of this photo were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. It has nothing to do with the fact that they acted better or not, is that the relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was really innocent, Norman didn't really understand sex, had almost no contact with the outside world and when he met the beautiful Marion and watching her change she feels that she is doing it partly because she does not understand sex and her attraction to her, this makes Norman understanding and almost an antihero, you are on his side because he does not completely understand the world and is constantly fighting with himself and his 'Mother'. In the remake that all the dynamics is gone, I have to admit that Janet Leigh is not my type but she is very attractive and we see that, Anne Heche is really unattractive and therefore Norman who finds "his" attractive Marion is incredible if you add Norman by Vince Vaughn masturbates while you look at her and you get a Norman who is just waiting for an opportunity to frame any naked woman, no matter what it is, to those who don't like him at all, he destroys Norman's innocent nature of putting porn magazines in his room. It destroys a character that we like and we are sorry, it's like redoing "It's a wonderful life" and having the main character a pimp, totally degrading. <br /> <br /> The only other character that I had problems with Rita Wilson as Caroline, Marion's workmate. In the original, when Pat Hitchcock says the phrase 'must have noticed my wedding ring' causes a laugh as she is fooling herself, when Rita says it sounds plausible because in reality there is no other reason to where the man flirted with Anne Heche about her. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am very biased, the original "Psycho" is my favorite movie of all time, if the film was a reworking, with a different angle, so you could have turned these characters into head and would have been perfectly acceptable. Hitch notoriously should have made sure that the film was too bloody and done in black and white to reduce it. This also made the film more atmospheric and terrifying in its own way and gave it a beauty that could never be captured in color and is a sad statement about how films are sensitizing the public that people have said how the scene is shower was scarier than color. (nb before people think 'can't write' remember that I'm English and we write it in color) <br /> <br /> A remake should be just that, reworked, this is a fake, a complete and very ugly copy for what. I could compare myself but it doesn't make sense, almost everything is superior to the original. The only thing that is better is Viggo Mortensen's performance as Sam Loomis, John Gavin was very flat in the original (Hitch called him "The Stiff" behind him) and Mortensen offers a more believable performance if less likable. William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other actors who keep the originals. <br /> <br /> In general a film that should be labeled as Expensive Exparrassing Failed Experiment. Display only if it is comparable to the original or if the original is unknown to you. But also look at the original 'The film would have obtained a 3 out of 5 if it was original or a reworking but given that it is 0.5 out of 5 (for Macy's, Moore and Mortensen)
