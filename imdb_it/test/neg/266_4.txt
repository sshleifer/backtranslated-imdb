I liked Oceans 11, I thought it was pretty funny, aided by performances and directing. However, I was disappointed with this film. Don't get me wrong, it's not a real disaster, thanks to the stellar performances of Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and Matt Damon in particular and the efficient direction of Steven Soderbergh. However, the film really has a really lethargic rhythm, some of the films were so slow that I almost fell asleep in a key stroke. Secondly, the plot is very convoluted and there are many twists that make it difficult to keep up. Camera work was not as innovative as in the first film. Considering that in the first film, it was simple and professional, it was sober and embarrassing here, and the music was not particularly memorable. The script was not as witty or funny, and the film felt anti-climatic. At the end of the day he seemed a bit too lazy, despite the play and the direction of the experts. So much potential, but really a lost opportunity. 4/10 Bethany Cox
