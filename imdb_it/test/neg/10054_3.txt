The Bridge At Remagen contains some of the most absurd war dramas I've ever seen. Apart from the acting, which is made of wood, no tank commander attacks with his tanks parked in neat rows, in the middle of the streets and with the troops all gathered together with their arms not ready. The constant suicidal behavior triggered my "tilt switch" so often I found it impossible to enjoy the movie. Apparently the writers and the director have never experienced a real war and they never bothered to involve an expert he had. This film is the antithesis of the excellent detail of Saving Private Ryan. Unless you are under 7, I suggest you look at something else. <br /> <br /> GB
