The band is back for more! Ron Howard and Cindy Williams are now married! His brother is demonstrating against the project and Charles Martin Smith is doing everything possible in Vietnam to be sent home. <br /> <br /> The numbers of the 1960s are brought to light here, but it's all over, starting with New Year's Eve in 1963, then three minutes later, it's New Year's Eve in 1964, then three minutes later, it's New Year's Eve 1965, then three minutes later, it's 1963 again. Martin Smith is talking about his friend who dies in a drag race a year ago, and a couple of scenes later, this friend is winning his next heat in an endurance race and to complete it all, the drug scene and the flower children enter the image (or the images, in some cases, are displayed on the screen simultaneously up to three different shots of the camera ). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, you have to WATCH this movie, but I would advise you to stick to the original and leave it there. Wolfman Jack is heard at the beginning of the film before almost every song played in the background, but where did he go? Maybe he couldn't keep up with this movie, and stop it! 2 out of 10 stars!
