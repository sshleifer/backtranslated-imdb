Definition of documentary: a work, like a film or a television program, which presents political, social or historical themes in a factual and informative way and often consists of films or real interviews accompanied by narration. The key word here is information. I love They Might Be Giants, and I barely learned anything about them. <br /> <br /> The interviews with all the celebrities were practically useless. I don't care what anyone's Sarah Vowel thinks, and Syd Straw was definitely annoying. And are you listening to people playing TMBG lyrics as if they were fun / interesting? It was neither I think this was the problem: the film spends time discussing TMBG's love for coffee. So?? Millions of people love coffee. Was the presentation of the material fun? No! There were indications that both men were married, yet it was never discussed. And the material alone that they did? What prompted them to do so? These types of questions are not addressed or answered. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on with the negatives. I found the Dial-a-Song segment very interesting. If you want to know They Might Be Giants, just buy some CDs and listen. Seriously. This film is a huge disappointment. I can't believe that so many people gave a 10. Incredible.
