I could barely see the whole movie ... Only after about 85 minutes from the 110 minutes of the film did the journey to Mars begin, and then there were 5 minutes left for closure. These 85 long minutes were VERY boring and did not contribute to the film. When he finally reached Mars, the plot wasn't much better. Everything could have been assembled in a much shorter execution time and nothing would have been lost. <br /> <br /> What I can't understand is the piece of trivia that says that because of the movie the newborn children were named "Aelita" ... Because someone should want to name his baby after a bad , who despite having only one eyebrow, apparently has 3 breasts ??? <br /> <br /> The only interesting thing here is the sets and costumes for the Mars scenes. They are an interesting experiment in constructivism, as "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" was for expressionism five years earlier. <br /> <br /> I give him 4/10 for the attractive design ...
