As a devotee of Ms. Frank, I remember being so excited that the game was redone for TV. That is, until I saw it ... This film is a great example of how IMPORTANT casting is and how directing plays such an important role in creating a sense of purpose. The casting of any CENTRAL role is CRUCIAL for a production of this kind ... shows like AUNTIE MAME and MAN OF LA MANCHA are totally dependent on the charisma of the protagonist. And in the cast of this film, the whole thing is destroyed by the atrocious casting of Melissa Gilbert in the lead role. There is NOT A SINGLE TIME that Mrs. Gilbert approaches to inhabit the sensitive and mature spirit of Anne-Ms. Gilbert is "white bread" throughout the film ... the only time I was close to tears was while reading Anne's most obsessive line: "I still believe, despite everything, that people are really good" - This was said by Mrs. Gilbert so hastily, so unconvinced, that she could belch well and achieve the same effect. The legend of cinema and dance Marge Champion was the author of the dialogue for this production: she would have to repay her salary! Although Ms. Gilbert has ruined DIARY, other performances are satisfying for the more special part of Joan Plowright as Edith, Scott Jacoby as Peter and Clive Reville as Mr. Dussell. Maxmillian Schell does not have the soul and spirit rooted as Otto as he is the creator of the role on the stage and on the film (Joseph Schildkraut), but he is alright. Doris Roberts and James Coco in the Van Dann shoes are relatively superficial in their parts: they are shrill and stormy, but again, only on the surface. This could be due to the fact that the rhythm of the project is too hasty (as noted in previous posts) - this film is 45 minutes shorter than the film version - the difference due to the dramatic pauses, which apparently is necessary to propagate the appropriate MOOD for the story. This is NOT a mandatory view, especially for young people learning for the first time Anne Frank, abiding by the original version of the film and, if possible, the television production of ANNE FRANK: THE TRUE STORY starring Ben Kingsley, which is the thing closer to capturing the heartbreak and reality of Anne's never filmed situation! Note: Particularly scary is the fact that Melora Marshall, who plays Anne Margot's sister, is NOT included in the opening credits along with all the other members of The Secret Annex ... is listed in post-credits along with the actors they play Miep and Mr. Kraler. If I were Mrs. Marshall, I would have sued!
