There seems to be a specter of cinema. On the left, there are films made mainly for entertainment and / or commercial purposes. In between, there are films that are both fun and artistic. On the right there are films that are not commercial, but focus more on cinema as on art than on cinema as a product. <br /> <br /> I am not here to say that part of the spectrum is better than any other, but that when a film goes too far for both ends, it is rarely good. This is the case of Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> I had no idea what to expect when I saw it advertised. Some friends were going and they asked me if I wanted to come. None of us knew what to expect, and in the end none of us was happy. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are stunning images. Yes, I am amazed at how long the filmmakers have worked to find in the archive footage. Yes, the soundtrack is pleasant to listen to and probably the best part of the experience. The fact is that this goes so far on the right side of the spectrum that I said I can't say anything nice about the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> It is a sermon. It is a mixture of symbolism and obvious morality. He is not saying anything new or forcing the viewer to examine life in a new way. He's just telling us things we already know (that is, if we can figure out what he's saying). <br /> <br /> This film is simply art for art. An attempt to say "See how we can be deep and stimulating using editing!" When a film becomes smarter than its creators are intelligent or intelligent than its subject, it ceases to be a film and simply becomes celluloid self-gratification.
