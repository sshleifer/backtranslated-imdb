I was told that Jon was for a while for spiritual experiences. I imagine the film will be interesting. In fact it is not at all. Not so deep for such a subject. "eternity" life without end. Experiences after death and "dejavu". The film is not a comedy, but it is not funny at all, at least it is not. It's so naive. Fascinating film but naive film. A must to avoid. The sequences of the Middle Ages seem to come directly from fairy tales and it is not the question at all. Eileen Davidson is so charming and Voight is doing his best. Normal is a co-producer and screenwriter of this film. The film was launched directly on video, so I discovered it in a video store. It's a shame because I know that Voight was seriously involved with spirituality and the film is not that deep.
