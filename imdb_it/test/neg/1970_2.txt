After Kenneth Opel's inspiring story of invigorating me in the pleasure of reading during elementary school, I had high hopes for this series. The story of an underdog who traveled across the country to reunite with his colony fascinated my imagination and resonated deeply with my flourishing imagination. When I heard this series, I started browsing the Bardel Animation site and liked what I saw. The character's design seemed impressive and the frenetic plot seemed to have been respected respectably in a span of thirteen episodes. So much was my disappointment, then, when I decided to see a new start in the morning. <br /> <br /> The opening episode shows our hero, Shade Silverwing, chasing a tiger tiger in the deep hours of the night. Striking an ecological song, we see an elegant CGI effect if raw illuminates the moth, and the hunt takes a frantic turn while the little insect creates numerous illusory copies of itself deceives its pursuer. As a lover of biology, I had a decent understanding of the principles in place (tigers' moths can perceive the sounds that their predators use for echolocation and make a sound cover for themselves) but without such exposure I would surely have been lost . A little quibble, I thought. Surely the director will fill us in momentarily. I waited in vain. <br /> <br /> Once our protagonist finds himself with some of his companions, we are treated to some of the most boring dialogues I've ever seen on television. Chinook, Shade's child rival, begins to mock the little hero with the stupidest lines he has ever seen in a show. I can understand that writers do not produce Shakespeare, but one would think they would have social contacts in their lives - certainly enough to make communication natural. Oh, how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> Dubbing, although not horrible, was just a brilliant example of human achievement. "Oh Shadow, you broke the law!" Shade's mother sighs. "You must come with me, young man." Croaks Frieda, the elder of the Silverwing colony. The actors try, but at this point it doesn't matter, since the story becomes less and less compelling every minute. <br /> <br /> While each episode deals with a problem of the week, as is typical of most television series, dominant narrative arcs pervade the saga, for better or for worse. While the main point of the story is the reunion of Shade with his family, the subsequent episodes will face other narrative arcs, involving cannibal bats from the southern jungles and a war of pins between birds and beasts. Writers try to do too much at once, fighting to compress as many promising ideas as possible in the hope that it will capture the public's interest enough to keep the bloody show in progress. Unfortunately, these attempts are useless for everyone except the eight or ten years that this show is aimed at. <br /> <br /> While it's nice to see the Canadian media being perpetuated, it would all be sweeter if the enjoyment of the series wasn't limited to the animator family or fans of Kenneth Oppel's books. There are worse things out there that your kids might see than Silverwing, but there are also much better programs. Mediocrity passes and you read books instead.
