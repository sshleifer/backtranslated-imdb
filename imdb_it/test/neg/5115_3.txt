This film is exactly the same as Ridley Scott, "Someone To Watch Over Me", which is a classic. Tom Berenger and Mimi Rogers and the villain of the Fugitive are the protagonists. It is a quality film, with good direction and great acting. This film is the exact opposite. It's the same plot, minus the good acting and the addition of the TV movie direction. I must say that I like the interaction between Lowe and the woman. She is sexy and their love story is credible on many levels. Unfortunately, this alone cannot save this carbon copy of the classic Ridley Scott film. <br /> <br /> Bad TV movies usually have some qualities that make them virtually invisible. I think for me, the redemption value of this film is that Rob Lowe and the female lead have chemistry. That and I were able to observe and compare the plot with another quality film.
