Freely inspired by the novels of Earl Derr Biggers, the Charlie Chan series of 20th Century Fox turned out to be one of the audience's favorites, but when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor the studio feared that the public would turn against its Asian hero. This was a misjudgment: actor Sidney Toler played the role of "Monogram Studios", where he continued to portray the character in eleven other films made between 1944 and his death in 1947. <br /> < br /> 20th Century Fox had considered Chan's films as cheap "B" films, but even so the studio took great care of them: the plots were often silly, but the rhythm was strong, the dialogue witty, and transmissions (which saw characters like Bela Lugosi and Ray Milland) always expert. The result was a gentle charm that has stood the test of time. The monogram was different: the Chan films were simple and simple "B" films. Little attention was paid to scripts or cast and the resulting films were flat, mediocre at best, practically unwatchable at worst. <br /> <br /> Thanks to an adequate cast and a few interesting plot devices, THE SHANGHAI COBRA is among the best of Chan films made with Monogram - but even so it can barely achieve a coherent mediocrity. In this particular article, Chan (Sidney Toler) is called to investigate a murderer who kills with what appears to be a cobra bite; at the same time, he decides to make sure that a government supply of radio hidden in a bank vault, of all places, remains safe. Do these two apparently unrelated plots come together? Well ... it could be! Sidney Toler is always as fun as Chan, but most of his performances on Monogram seemed like "phone calls" - and this is true for COBRA as it is for any Monogram Chan movie. As usual, the really fun performer is Mantan Mooreland. The changing times led us to consider Moreland's comedy as humiliating for African Americans, but he was an actor and an experienced comedian, and taken in the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s his work has an extraordinary charm and fans of the 20th Century Fox series are likely to find Monogram's Chan a significant disappointment and the neophytes who love Monogram movies will probably consider them third-rate after meeting Fox films. Like other Monogram Chan films, THE SHANGHAI COBRA is best left to certain collectors. Four stars, and this is generous. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
