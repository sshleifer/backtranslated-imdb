I was reading in a magazine about some of the most gory and bloody movies that Asia had to offer and I immediately jumped on Netflix to quench my thirst. Boy, what mistake did I make. This film is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. First of all no plot, what I expected was the plot (see: "Revenge") turned into a series of events that were happening in an attempt to spend their budget for the special effects of $ 14.89 and waste time in the studio. They should have kept their money and not wasted time nor yours. <br /> <br /> When an important twist occurs, Tetsuo II: Body Hammer has a new identity and I didn't buy it. A flashback is given which should answer our questions, but it seemed to me as if I had activated Showtime at 3:47 and left ACID. The film continues and fades under control with a gaudy graphic and special effects (Olympic). <br /> <br /> Do I look embittered about this movie? Yes. Have I seen Iron Man? No. Was there a plot? No. Was it so symbolic that I didn't understand? NO. Was there a Body Hammer? Beat the hell out of me. So follow my advice and STAY !!!!!! <br /> <br /> (I have to admit that I had so much fun writing this and laughing at myself for this movie that if you want to laugh, WATCH IT !!!)
