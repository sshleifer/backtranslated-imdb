J. S. Cardone directed a well-known "Video Nasty" in 1982 entitled "The Slayer" and since then he has continued to have a hand in a handful of films; including the 2001 vampire movie The Forsaken. His latest feature, Wicked Little Things, boasts a decent-looking plot and a scary-looking poster that I seem to remember emerging a couple of years ago in relation to a film that Tobe Hooper was supposed to direct. Well, I guess he felt this was too similar to his stupid zombie mushroom movie "Mortuary" and so he refused this. I don't blame him for that either. The plot focuses on a mother and her two daughters moving into an old house in the mountains that once belonged to her late husband. However, what they don't realize is that about a hundred years before; a group of children who were used as miners were trapped in a mini-tree. Of course, isn't it the end of them and they managed to survive their ordeal and now roam the area in search of revenge ?? <br /> <br /> The film is essentially a collection of clich√©s; from the younger child with an "imaginary friend", the mother who rejects him and all the usual rubbish of zombies. J. S. Cardone tries to bring back fans of horror alongside shock and bloody scenes (mostly involving children) but it's not enough. The story didn't work very well and actually reminded me too much of the previous Mortuary, and it's not a good thing (although Mortuary is actually a better film than this). Even acting is nothing to write about; Lori Heuring has a discreet appearance, like the eldest daughter Scout Taylor-Compton; but neither of them can provide an interesting performance. Chloe Moretz is slightly better than the usual child actor. The plot has almost no credibility and indeed the script cannot even be bothered to explain the reasons why children attack the locals. It all comes down to a typical and rather boring ending and overall I have to say that if you know your horror movies, you can feel free to skip this!
