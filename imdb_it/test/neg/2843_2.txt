At first I thought that this should have been a bit of a comedy / horror when I saw the body in the bathtub with the lady who was standing there screaming again and again but, as the film progressed, it was getting flatter. The plot was stupid with a man shocked that real estate prices have risen, so now he decides to call a psyciatrist radio and pretend nothing happened because he has nothing better to do. Then the law gets involved and tries desperately to make us really care who the caller is and does everything to track down this guy. One suspect after another is accused. This film is terrible and the slow-moving love scenes of Adrian B. and her husband are boring and they just made me fast forward the film. Avoid it!
