I am and have been a serious collector of Christmas-related movies, TV shows, special holidays, etc., for over twenty-five years. Please, pay attention to my warning and don't be misled by sterling reviews and hype about the media in this movie. This is not a Muppett movie as we have come to know them, and it is certainly NOT for children. The fact that this was produced for a large television network was / was not a surprise considering their level of operation at this time. What is hard for me to believe is that Jim Henson's organization has dropped so much that it's involved in this parody of Christmas. I wish there were reviews to read that would have warned me before wasting my hard-earned money on this piece of junk.
