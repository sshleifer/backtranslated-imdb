Ha ha. - oh no - what about this movie? Yes, green eggs and ham make more sense than this movie. Where does it start? Many of the good things have already been said - so I will not divulge in the same territory. I think you already have the movie summary - so I don't want to paraphrase the movie. <br /> <br /> First - let's start with that. <br /> <br /> 1). If you like psychological thrillers that make you think (like me), the first 29 minutes of this movie will be for you - this is one of those movies that illustrates the question that you always talked about on long car trips when you were a child (And if you had to choose a live family member, another to die for, or, if you were to die drowning or shooting) This film is a great concept - bottom line. <br /> <br /> 2) The wardrobe group did a great job bringing us back to the 70s. Realistically though, how hard is it to achieve? ..... OK, that's all for the good. Let's talk about the bad guy. <br /> <br /> 1). This film looks like a 2-hour "Twilight Zone" episode. This could easily be 90 minutes. This could have made the film tolerable. <br /> <br /> 2). Do you remember in the movie "From Dusk til Dawn?". The film started out interestingly, then in the middle of the film did it take a degrading turn? Yes, the same thing here. I would venture to say that the writers started with a concept, so they had no idea what to do with it. I got a profound reflection on Transformers 2. <br /> <br /> 3). Yes, we get the dilemma in the film. We understand the philosophical subtleties and the utilitarian approach - but the story has skipped too much, has not worked out the arc of current history and has taken a direction (forgive me) completely offensive. <br /> <br /> 4). The ending made no sense. Not at all. Nobody. <br /> <br /> This film would be a winning card in the philosophy of college 101. If you are out of your mind, in bed sick, or if you have ever enjoyed being hit in the face with a cake, and you can view it for free on- line - by all means, do it. <br /> <br /> If you have to pay anything to watch this movie, don't waste time - you're better looking at the old Howie Mandel standing on You Tube. You will have more philosophical stimuli that will reorganize your sock drawer.
