This is probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Independent or not, solid writing is a must. Ditto for directing and acting. I know these actors can act (I've seen them in Sporanos and others ...) but this film is very ugly, very ugly. Maybe it's the script, maybe it's the director. Probably a bit of both ... Probably a lot of both! Technically OK, just ugly, bad, bad ... I have a theory that the supporters of this film also own Poker magazines, because I saw a very favorable review in one of the magazines. "Hey, we did it, so it must be good, right?" Not so fast Bucky. I know it takes a lot of hard work and money to make a film, much less sold and distributed, and for this I recommend these people. But the final product leaves a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> P.S. I won a free rental and chose this blockbuster movie. I'm going to get my money back tomorrow.
