I will say this earlier ... the film would have been a science fiction classic from the 70s if it had been performed much better. <br /> <br /> Having said that, let's examine the plot ... start with Peter Graves (or is it Clarence Oveur?) in search of President, then cut into a university campus environment full of authoritarians in trucker caps and headphones and retarded athletes who all act as if they were perpetually at age 8. shows a boy who apparently goes to America, has a party, then is taken to a medical laboratory where he is drugged, wrapped in a plastic bag and then prepared as if the doctors were bagging vegetables for packs of steam ... okay, in reality it is put on the ice so the doctors can extract the organs they need. <br /> <br /> Then he cuts to another junkie man thinking that the place he lives in is a bit strange after a can of beer (of all possible plot devices) that he finds in a river makes him look suspicious (damn those beer cans!). He and some equally stupid love interest of his feeling that they need to get to the bottom, so he lags behind as he escapes through what is basically a large administrative building with some evidence he discovers on the road to cloning. ..and how it is part of it. <br /> <br /> He escapes his controllers after shooting someone and an old reporter helps him find his "father" - the man from whom he was cloned. It happens to be a clone of Peter Graves' brother. After a debate about what to do with him and his trials, he returns to the facility to find his girlfriend (who has been lobotomized in the meantime to be even more stupid, harmless and ready to host a talk show according to the SOL crew). He is captured and put in a cold store just like his retarded friend of Nazi construction since the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a clash at the Graves brothers' home resulted in several deaths, including Graves. The reporter and his wife are killed in the midst of an exciting conversation with a bomb. It seems that the conspirators have won to some extent ... <br /> <br /> So, Peter Graves turns out to be able to survive while being performed with a metal poker by the miracle of the cloned parts and giving another vote for me just like journalists talk about cloning. <br /> <br /> Definitely the MST3K fodder, but in the lower part of the spectrum as regards the general wickedness.
