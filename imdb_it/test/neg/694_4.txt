Why the powers that continue to launch Jennifer Lopez in incredible roles? She was excellent in Selena, and quite good at Money Train, who hired her in roles where she could basically be herself. However, roles like this only draw the line. I could never see Lopez as an FBI agent (see Out of Sight for that insignificant performance), but as a psychotherapist? Give me a break! <br /> <br /> Basically, Lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist, who is involved in virtual reality experiments where he enters the minds of his patients to help them solve their problems. When he enters the mind of a coma-killer serial to help save one of his victims, he breaks all the rules to try to break the madness of his inner mind. <br /> <br /> Lopez's acting here is generally below average. I can't get over that sharp squeak of a voice he has. It's not Julia Roberts, but she comes across the screen as if she believed she was on the same playing field. Well, it's not even in the same stadium. Of course, she is a very sexy woman; however, this will not bring a movie, and it certainly doesn't bring this movie. With any other cast in his role for this film it would have been excellent, especially if he had been cast with someone who could give the character more credibility. <br /> <br /> That said, this film is visually stunning. The colors are fabulous and the plot is not bad in a B series movie. Even the audio here is superb. This film earns points for the fairly original plot, and important points for its appearance and its sounds. Unfortunately, the acting and the poor cast lead to a few notches. <br /> <br /> My vote: 6/10
