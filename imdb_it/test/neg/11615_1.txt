The most self-indulgent film I've had has the misfortune to rent. Unwatchable. Much of the film is obviously improvised, <br /> <br /> and not good. It looks like Toback did the first take of <br /> <br /> everything. The movie becomes good for a couple of minutes when Robert Downey Jr. appears, then goes to hell again <br /> quickly.
