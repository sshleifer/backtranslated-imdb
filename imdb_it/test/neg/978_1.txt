I saw "Deadly Voyage" because there was David Suchet, after enjoying it in the "Poirot" series. And it's always worth looking at Joss Ackland, so I entered the film with the expectation that it was a potentially useful movie. Alas, it didn't have to be. <br /> <br /> I will not bother to criticize the performance, the rhythm, the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film; others here have already expressed their opinions on these elements. The only thing I want to address is the message of the film, since it proclaims in the introduction that it is based on a true story, and in this the presumed importance of the film is blocked. <br /> <br /> "Deadly Voyage" focuses mainly on an impoverished African black man named Kingsley who wants to move to the United States because he believes he can make money there. Nothing more, nothing less - his motivation is absolutely selfish. (Obviously some people will prevail by saying that he was doing it for his family, but he actually decided to have children on the income he could earn in Ghana, so he really created his problem.) To this end, Kingsley decides to settle aboard a Russian cargo direct to New York. In doing this, it faces difficult conditions, members of the racist crew and other challenges. <br /> <br /> But this is exactly where the film leaves me indifferent. Why should the public care about Kingsley? Simply because it has a goal? Goals are not such a rare commodity that his should be privileged over, the goal of the ship captain or woman he left at home with his newborn baby. Kingsley's goal is illegal in the eyes of the US government. It is also illegal as it steals from the Russian shipping company. If it does so in the United States, this would result in the elimination of a system that it has not implemented. And if he is captured, the shipping company will be fined $ 45,000. I very much doubt that any of the illegal immigrants worry about what their chosen course of action is costing someone else; they are clearly only for their own gain. He could have spent the $ 1,000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film, for the legal transition to the United States, and applied for residency and a work permit. Instead, it takes the illegal (and dangerous) way. <br /> <br /> So since Kingsley's journey is illegal, selfish and cannot be ethically justified, why should we worry about him or his ordeal? Simply because it faces challenges? Why should its challenges be privileged over the challenge of the Russian shipping company to arrive in New York without illegal immigrants? Why is it black and the shipping company is white? The reason seems to be due to the fact that Danny Glover (the film's executive producer) and others involved want us to root for Kingsley, as if he were a hero on some sort of noble journey. But once you accept illegal immigration, a fool's theft and mission are not noble at all, you don't care about him. <br /> <br /> Before anyone plays the race card, I assure you that I wish I felt the same regardless of which ethnicity / nationality the parties were involved. Imagine if a British person decided to hide in a train bound for Bhutan, cross the border and collect "unwanted" Buddhist antiquities, to be brought back to Britain to sell. How much sympathy could the challenges he faced generate? Very little, I would bet. So why should we feel different for Kingley? Why is it black? Why is he poor by American standards? The filmmakers rely on us to share their views on the fact that the end justifies the means and that a $ 45,000 fined shipping company is irrelevant to the remote possibility that an unqualified worker earns slightly more in the United States than he could if he had just stayed in his own country. I didn't buy it for a minute.
