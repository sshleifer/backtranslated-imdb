All the while I thought to myself "Oh God, why!" At first I thought "Just might be average", but the acting and the plot in many parts was atrocious. <br /> <br /> Every part in it was so predictable, even if the first film seemed to show a great resemblance to the ring, it was a half decent film, but this seemed to take all the good things of the first and made them terrible. Some pieces have made sure that all the spectators get wet, eg. The part where Geller fell from the building made me points. My girlfriend had to keep telling me to stay calm and I continued to comment on what should have happened later, and many times I was right. <br /> <br /> Because entering the house makes it come after you, it makes no sense. It was a poor excuse for many murders, and no depth was seen. <br /> <br /> You can see all that is coming, which made you realize that it made no sense to look. Oh shes behind her ... I didn't see what is * yawning *. <br /> <br /> Surely these people must have thought of ... oh I don't know, carry a knife around or at least try to counterattack, instead of being eaten but someone's hair? At best during the film I was very slightly scared (and I mean slightly), I was just crying for the credits, while they were shooting I exhaled a short "Oh thank God". If you haven't already done so, don't waste your time and money on it; useless, plot less, sorry sorry for a sequel!
