Although this starts promisingly, a woman in a car moves around dark streets in the middle of the night in the middle of the forest until it almost hits a man holding a lizard! This gave me the impression that we were going to see something special, something almost David Lynchian (if there is a similar term), but unfortunately, the film starts going everywhere, not having a core center, just a kind of tortuous story about a woman trying to solve a mystery of a small town. The character study goes everywhere, and I don't really care about any of the characters that it seems, especially when part of the story suddenly enters flashback mode. I had some hopes for this film, but all in all, it was a bit disappointing.
