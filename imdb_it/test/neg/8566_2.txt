The only positive thing about this film is its final breakthrough. In 97 minutes of film we can only save a single idea, which was completely wasted in this film, I must say! For over 90 minutes this film is just a collection of clich√©s, bad acting, stupid ideas and revelations, complete lack of suspense, stupid deaths, terrible special effects; all this in a pathetic and not original plot? until the last three minutes, where, FINALLY, a good idea has appeared! It's nothing exceptional or an extremely original idea, but, at least, it was a good "decent" idea, the only one that the whole movie has! I won't ruin it, but I have to say that I think that idea with a better plot, a better FX and, certainly, a better acting, would turn into a good movie. If you watch this movie and you can endure it until the end you will know what it is all about ??
