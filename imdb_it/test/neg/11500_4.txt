Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy pair in history, and deservedly so, so I'm happy to see any of their films. Ollie is recovering from a broken leg in the hospital, and with nothing else to do, Stan decides to visit him and bring him hard-boiled eggs and nuts instead of candy. Chaos begins with Stan snatching the rope of Ollie's cast, and manages to push the doctor (Billy Gilbert) out of the window, clinging to it, taking Ollie hanging from the ceiling. When the situation calms down, Stan receives Ollie's clothes, since the Doctor wants them both to leave, and he even manages to sit on a syringe, left accidentally by the nurse, full of a sleeping pill, which takes effect while driving (which can be said is done with a car in front of a big screen. Full of a nice classic comedy and not bad (even if repetitive and a little predictable), it's not great, but it's a black and white film worth the worth watching Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 of the Comedian.
