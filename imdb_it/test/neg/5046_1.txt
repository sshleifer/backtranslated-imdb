This is just one of the hundred million films in which filmmakers try to put too many dramas into a film that is not at all dramatic. As in the beginning, the part where the monk pushed the arrow into his own hand, then shot the same arrow in the gergoyle five minutes later, without any sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing worse than the plot is the CGI, which would be very much rivaled by a homemade flash movie. It seems that the actors are doing their best to play a group of 1970s robots; dialogue doesn't make much sense, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Many things arise without any explanation as to how or why, such as a lady who suddenly turns around a zoo that was closed a few hours ago. And when he sees this thing flying towards her, his first reaction is to take a picture, rather than what he does ten minutes later: the power-walking (not even running) as his life depended on it - which, of course , it is not. <br /> <br /> In general, not recommended. I'm glad they are still making new episodes of MST3K.
