I've seen tons of garbage, in every language, on every topic and every trend in the cinema. Of every period, every director and every type of budget available. That being said, I really have to declare it: <br /> <br /> This is one of the three worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's painfully bad. It's pompous. Is sad. It's incomprehensible. It's annoying. It's a real mess. It's a piece of you-you know-what. <br /> <br /> And most importantly: one point is missing. And even if he had one, the characters are so unreal and annoying that it is impossible to overlook the lack of cohesion of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> It's just strange for the sake of being weird. <br /> <br /> I felt really bad looking at this garbage. The theater in which I saw it (the Lincoln Center in New York) was full when it started. In the end, half the audience was released. In the end there was a question and answer session, but none remained. With the exception of about two killed, all the others ran to the door, including me. <br /> <br /> Save 2 hours of your life. Probably one of the worst ever. <br /> <br /> If there is a cinema in Hell, this film will be broadcast 24 hours a day, for eternity ...
