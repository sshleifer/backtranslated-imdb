Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back! This is a horror film, not a thriller, not a suspense, a horror movie. Yes, this film is a horror. Terribly bad After many years lurking here on IMDb, I was moved to create an account just like that (like at least one other reviewer here) I can warn people DON'T WATCH THIS FILM! You are affirming your soul, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies so ugly, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you're not wise enough to press the fast forward button. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'd like to hear the director's voice on an "enhanced" DVD (there's another terrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking. The producers had to assume that there were enough crap out there for the name of Val Kilmer to make this film at least even balanced in international distribution. <br /> <br /> Actually I had the misfortune of choosing it to watch movies on demand, which did not provide subtitles for the Russian dialogue. Not that it mattered much. By striving to hear the Russian, translate it into your head (if you can) just to find out how boring it is to add insult to injury. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie a "1" because I can't give it a lower rating and because it got a remarkable thing. Somehow it made a film almost entirely underground, NOT feeling claustrophobic. Now this is an ambiguous result. <br /> <br /> HERE IS YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (not a pun) is as if they had run out of money and decided to stop shooting. The "climax" of the film takes place literally a few seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I've ever seen in a movie. Exercise your simple escape mechanism even if you find yourself looking at this - the shutdown button.
