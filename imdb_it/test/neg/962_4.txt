Rudolph Mat√©'s 1950 film was renewed for the 1980s, Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid) is a university lecturer who has had a successful writing career, but has now gone down the tubes with his marriage. The initial exposition plants the notion in the minds of the spectators that everyone has something against him, so when the revelation comes that he has been poisoned, we are not so surprised, unless, of course, we are familiar with the original. Dexter, after saying that he has less than 48 hours to live, decides to go back to his steps with the help of one of his students Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan), but they find that they have many obstacles in their way. <br /> <br /> The film starts off promising in black and white, while Dexter staggers in the rain towards the local police station where he wants to denounce a murder ... his, but the style of Huey lewis that accompanies the 80s this scene only serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this will be bad enough, it's just a question of how bad? Of course, soon enough we will be using the old media flashback, but now the film uses full Technicolor. There are some short tributes to Noir, while the embracing couple stands in front of a Venetian tent, but here there is really nothing to recommend, the performances are horrible, in particular Ryan who plays the usual dizzy blonde with a smile lovey dovey. The film is a lazy attempt to put some unnecessary music into an already excellent premise, obviously trying to cash in on Body Heat audiences, the apparent results are undoubtedly aimed at an audience of teenagers and, of course, they are welcome . 4/10
