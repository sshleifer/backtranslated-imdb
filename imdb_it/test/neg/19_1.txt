This film cannot be serious because it has a nerd-looking child named Curtis who kills people. The other two psychopaths are pretty nice, but that Curtis kid is so ugly because he wears these huge, dark and ugly glasses. The actor probably wandered around on the wrong set and really had to go to Revenge of the Nerds. Another thing I hate so much about this movie is that Curtis enjoys turning people around. I kept my finger on the fast forward button because it took too long and what happened with his voice? He looked like he was fourteen and not ten. Another thing I hated was that he kept smiling like an idiot and there was no reason to do so. <br /> <br /> Then they put that annoying baby in the freezer and somehow found a flashlight in there. It didn't make sense and neither did the music. The music did not fit any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow, boring and a waste of time. Watch a different movie on your birthday.
