"Imperium Nero" is the second film in the series of six productions "Imperium". I have already commented unfortunately on the first one: "Imperium Augustus". This second TV movie produced and broadcast last weekend by the Italian state network has the same flaws. It also contains a considerable number of historical errors. Some examples: Nero is a child and Agrippina calls him: "Nero, Nero". At that time the name was Claudio. He was called Nero after his adoption. Nero did not meet Acte when he was as young as in the film, but after his marriage with Octavia and his appointment to the Emperor. When he becomes emperor his children are not adults: Britannicus has a month and Octavia has a year. And many many others. If you are a fan of ancient Roman history you can find other examples. The "Imperium" series will continue with four other films: "Titus", "Marcus Aurelius", "Costantinus" and "The Fall of the Roman Empire". Long last!
