This could be for those who have been in summer camps, but it's definitely not an entertainment field. I went to one before, but it didn't make me scream up and down for joy. Instead, it hurt my head. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is that Bill Murray actually had hair in the 70s. Yes, and he didn't mind running some too. But to make him run a lot, you would need to give him a woman to chase. <br /> <br /> It's not like some stunts can't be fun. For example, the running joke with one of the advisors who always wakes up somewhere else due to the movement of his bed. Instead, it's that the jokes and the stunts have been poorly prepared and performed. It just wasn't fun. <br /> <br /> For someone who loves comedy, this is a pain. Others are glued to it for life. I wish it was more like Leonard Part 6, but it doesn't come close. "F"
