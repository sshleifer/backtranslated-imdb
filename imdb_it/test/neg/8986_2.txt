The story is about a sensitive woman, Tory, who returns to her hometown and begins to relive her traumatic childhood past (the death of her childhood friend and violent father). Tory discovers that his friend was just the first in a series of ongoing murders. Can his psychic powers help solve crimes and stop continuous murders? <br /> <br /> You don't really need to find out why, Oh my God! It was so so so bad! I know that all Nora Roberts fans will crowd this movie and give them 10 tons. Then the rest of us will see an IMDb score of 6 and actually think this movie is worth watching. But don't be fooled. The ending was predictable, the TERRIBLE acting (I didn't even start talking about southern accents * y'all *) and the story was trivial. Remember ... you have been warned!
