****** Spoiler within ******* What a boring, predictable, not scary snoring party. The film had no character development: I didn't feel empathy for any of the characters (except it could be the kid), and I didn't care what happened to any of them. The film had so many clich√©s or elements stolen from other horror films. <br /> <br /> The film was so predictable. Many times I would like to say to myself, "Let me guess, {fill in guessing} happens later?" Yes, I was right. Even in the opening scene, I predicted that the "attack" on the family was from a man, probably his father (because only his wife and children were attacked). Sure enough, this is what happened (of course, you have to wait 79 minutes to find out for sure). And, of course, another "evil man" scenario. Why was he bad and killing his family? Because he is a man, duh! <br /> <br /> As someone else has said, this movie can be scary for someone under the age of 13, or for a movie from the 70s, but it's FAR from being a 'scary' movie according to today's standard. And, like so many other horror films, many of the scares were "fakes". Scary music, scary music, scary music and ..... A raven suddenly flies to the window! Wow, scary! <br /> <br /> How did the old bank boy manage, sometimes, to cross an open lot without his father seeing it? I thought, for sure, that the old man was a ghost. No, just a lousy movie. <br /> <br /> I rated this film a 2 out of 10, because it kept my attention enough to get the whole thing through.
