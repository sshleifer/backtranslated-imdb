I don't think it really matters too much about the plot of this film, the main thing you'll notice is the extreme amateurism of the entire production. Acting is what you would get if you chose random people on the street. The sound is really annoying - a medicine cabinet closes with all the taste of a gunshot that shoots you in the ear, while at the same time the dialogue is perhaps a fifth louder. Various noises on the set dominate the soundtrack to an enormous extent, with dialogues that take a far back seat. The theme of music seems almost a quarter of the one in which the film was released, since much of the film has no music. Camera work can be described as a gnarled mess, with close-up shots in which the average angle would be much better, the cameramen turning and pushing the camera anyway, absolutely no attention to frame any scene, they just turned it all over from any position it was more comfortable for the cameraman to stand. If the cameraman was taller than a foot of the actors and you end up watching the tops of everyone's heads, well, so be it. The change is just a butcher job; Everything is thrown together in the most abrupt way possible, nothing flows or transitions in any sense of the word. I don't know if this was shot on video or maybe a rented camcorder, I tend to think it was the latter. <br /> <br /> I only did it at about three quarters of this before I shut it down, I was just annoyed by the low quality of the production that I couldn't stand anymore. It's like a first-class audiovisual class project.
