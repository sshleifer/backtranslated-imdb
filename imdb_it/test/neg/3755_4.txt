The big fat slob 'Uncle Buck', played by John (eats-a-bag of) Candy, visits his family's healthy members for a week to baby-sit two cute boys (Gaby Hoffman and MacCauley Culkin) and a pretty but snobby teenager (Jean Louisa Kelly). The shenanigans begin when Buck has breakfast and then tries to sleep in a bed two sizes too small for his body airship. <br /> <br /> Mostly boring, but full of two or three funny scenes including Buck trying to get a word broadly on the phone with his angry girlfriend (Amy Madigan) and his encounter with a very disgusting clown. <br /> <br /> Candy looks like it weighs 600 pounds.
