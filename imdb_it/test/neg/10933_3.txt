My husband wanted to see this film because the review in the newspaper said it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, I don't like Michael Douglas or Glenn Close, I should agree. Not for conventional reasons though. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that must be watched late at night when you don't want to see something that really requires thought but you don't want to go to bed yet. <br /> <br /> Yancy Butler is a really nice bad guy. She is not the best actress, in fact she is not good at all but she is perfect for this role in this film. All others in it vary from pine to oak, including the somewhat disturbing boy who comes across a deformed Pinocchio. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: The finish takes a step or two too far, complete with the clich√© not entirely dead, with a roar, you'll still be able to get a moment and then there's a Pinocchio shot with his frozen wood grin that makes you wonder if they were going to relax or simply forgot that there was botox in the makeup. <br /> <In any case, it's an exhilarating eighty-five minute and despite being a bad movie, you should be deprived of the humor gene to not enjoy it a bit. Don't pay for it, but if you're in that kind of indifferent mood then this is right.
