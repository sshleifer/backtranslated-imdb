About a step above Olsen's twin film, there is no surprise in store here, except for how repulsive the puffy, hunchbacked Depardieu wanders around the shirtless beach. Was this boy to be some kind of heartbreaker? Quasimodo hubba hubba? Well, whatever. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is a great actress, whose career in recent years has shown many of her potentials both as a comic and a dramatic actress, but surely this film has done nothing to offer her a break-out role . His silly character has no trace of personality or self-esteem, he spends his entire vacation crushing a cute boy who he thinks is the greatest boy in the world (basically because he's a cute boy), but he can't be honest with him for two seconds . Lord, let me tell you something; if a guy is really inside you, he is not going to step on a huff because you tried to get your dad to pass as your boyfriend. He might be a little confused as to why he would do something so foolish, artificial and um ... incestuous, but in the end it will just be something you will laugh at together. <br /> <br /> Plot and dialogue affect everything at the right time. No originality and no ingenuity ... but it's shocking, shocking, SWEET and Ben are reluctant, reluctant, so viewers who think Titanic is the greatest film ever made will obviously say that this movie is fantastic because they won't notice that they don't has a brain on his head A star.
