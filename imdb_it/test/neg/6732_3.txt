Can they possibly get worse than that? Probably. But after all, Steven Seagal is able to do what he does. Very kind; this time, instead of mortally wounding the bad guys, he scarcely injures them. With a reputation for being a bad agent, Seagal is tasked with delivering a special package from France to America. But it is not an easy task with so many people trying to intercept and hinder the mission. The fights don't have enough bites and the big bang is just big and that's it. Anna-Louis Plowman appears to be the only member of the cast not to appear in wood. The cast also includes Jeffery Pierce, Max Ryan and Harry Van Gorkum. Don't blame Seagal for this clunker.
