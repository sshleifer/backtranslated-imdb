I have to admit, that among the many thrillers I've seen, this must be one of the worst. I was shocked to find that this job had a budget of 1.5 million. When it started, I thought the opening sequence was pretty good, fairly standard for this type of film, but still pretty good. But as the film progressed I began to feel very uncomfortable with the lack of rhythm I was seeing, each sequence seemed to take hours. The reason could be that by now the film had already bored me to tears, nothing happened except an infinite number of accusations punctuated by confused flashbacks and occasional attacks of bad temper. Well ... after going through what seemed like a life of these scenes, we finally reached the grand finale ... a dancing demonstration, all dancing about how the lack of imagination can completely ruin what could have been a good movie. <Br /> <br /> In general I found this film predictable and boring and I would not recommend this film to anyone other than those people that I personally don't like, but if you have a couple of hours to lose and want to see a thriller it's not even remotely scary, this is the movie for you.
