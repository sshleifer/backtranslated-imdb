First of all, even IMDb is loosened from this movie, since the cast list is VERY "gappy". For example, the main characters like Buddy are also missing. <br /> <br /> Now back to the movie. I love watching movies, but this has tortured me throughout the entire game or for many minutes. It was HORRID. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And the reason it bothers me so much, is because I was pretty excited to see it in advance. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is good. It could have been a great movie if done correctly and with careful casting. Golden Brooks was a huge disappointment. Now I see that the only role he can be good at is the sexy, energetic, funny and energetic chick he plays on Girlfriends. The melodramatic roles are not for her at all. He basically killed his character, Rachel. <br /> <br /> I love some of the cast, like Deborah Cox, Mel Jackson and Darrin Dewitt Henson, but even they couldn't save this catastrophic movie. Of course it's just my personal opinion that I can't stand Hill Harper as a man, and it didn't help me to like him more here. The voice of Golden Brooks bothered me so much that I actually had to force myself to finish watching the movie. He seemed to have whispered all over the joint. The director won't even waste my space, he did a bad job. The editing, photography / focusing of the camera and almost everything in this film was SAD. Not to mention the dialogues! Absolutely unreal and many times hilarious (when he had to make you cry and look inside you). <br /> <br /> As I said, it could have been a very nice film, but it was seriously messed up. I would NOT recommend it to anyone, unless they are important to cinematography and want to see an example of "What not to do" for their future work. <br /> <br /> Have a nice day everyone !!!
