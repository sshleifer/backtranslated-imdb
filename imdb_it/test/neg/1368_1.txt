I saw this film when it was first published in the Pittsburgh Pa. I had traveled from Youngstown, Ohio, at a distance of approx. 85 miles. I knew nothing about the plot or the players. I had not read reviews or spoken to anyone who had seen it. Believe me, I will never make that mistake again. It was advertised, I think it's the first feature filmed in the new 3D process. This is what prompted me to make a 170 mile round trip. There was a queue of waiting two by two that stretched (no joke) 2 or 2 ½ blocks in length and moved very slowly. I could wait to be seated. If I had known only then what I would soon know, I could have been ¾ of the return to Youngstown when the film started. <br /> <br /> At the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding. The novelty was quickly exhausted and from that moment on it was pure suffering. <br /> <br /> Without going into the terrible details, I can only offer the following advice. If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, presumably the worst film ever made, in my humble opinion it stands out on this garbage. <br /> <br /> I don't know if this has ever been shown on TV, if so I don't know why. If you ever get the chance to see it, do something else. Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, ask someone with a hose. NOTHING. Your time will have been better spent. <br /> <br /> This was my first film review. It could be my last, unless I get a worse movie and I wouldn't make the book happen. <br /> <br /> Bill <br /> <br />
