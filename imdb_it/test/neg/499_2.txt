You must acknowledge Cimino's contribution to the cinema. He gave us both the most overrated film in history (The Deer Hunter) and the worst movie in history (Heaven's Gate). And before we start with 'It's bad but it's not the worst ever', let me explain. <br /> <br /> For over 20 years I have listened to critics and avoided "Heaven's Gate" - in fact it was not difficult because you are not bombarded by the opportunity to watch this movie. Then, a few days after seeing the documentary "Final Cut: The Making and Unmaking of Heaven's Gate", I came across a used $ 9.99 DVD of the long version. My advice after 229 minutes is to look for the most negative review ever written about this film (you will find a wide selection), and imagine that the reviewer is the devoted mother of Cimino and is doing everything possible to make a positive cut film of his dear son. Then you will have an idea of ​​how big the chaos of Cimino is. <br /> <br /> While practically everything is wrong in this film, what finally gives the right measure to make it worse and worse (and a classic 'less than zero' example) is its shameless distortion of history. Although the cattle association sent a group of regulators / gunmen to Johnson County and had a list of targeted names, the real facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated. On the morning of April 9, 1892, Nick Ray and Nate Champion were besieged and finally killed by an army of about 50 heads of cattle and cannons hired in Texas who had come to Johnson County to clean up the "rustlers". County citizens then besieged regulators who were eventually arrested (or rescued) by the army. Women did not actively participate in the fighting and, apart from Ray and Champion, there were minimal losses. After all, these were sieges, not assaults - and there were no carts of immigrants circulating around the encampment of the regulations (the first Westerners, on the contrary, it was a device to make films and not a real tactic of the Indians ). And weeks before the regulators arrived, a number of Johnson County residents were hanged without trial, including Jim Averell, the keeper of a modest ranch, and his wife Ella Watson (whom Cimino resurrects as his two protagonists and shows also Averell living in a mature old age). <br /> <br /> There is no sin that makes films bigger than the fictional story, if you intend to play fast and loose with historical facts, then change the names and positions to protect unsuspecting members of the public who may move away from a film that believes that what they saw actually happened. Fortunately, so few people have seen this film that the damage was minimal. Perhaps it's hard to blame Cimino for his distortion of history. It could probably escape the fault however with a defense of madness: the film offers a lot of support. If Cimino was crazy during the production of Heaven's Gate, it would explain many things. But my vote goes to "lack of talent directing" instead of madness. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about Heaven's Gate. Actually you can see on the screen where some of the huge budget went; expensive sets - beautiful epic camera shots - artistic dance sequences. Isabelle Huppert (a strange casting choice that really worked) offers a pleasant and enjoyable show even though most of her scenes are extremely boring (which tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to worry about the characters) . Dialogue is generally solid if rather ordinary. <br /> <br /> But do not fall into the shit that this film experiments with storytelling, mixing carefully structured moments of character interaction with explosions of theatrical collective action. This implies that there was a method for Cimino's madness. "Experiments" is another word for when a director loses so much in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible. The simple fact is that there is no evidence that Cimino has storyboarded a single scene or made any attempt at control or organization. What it seems is that he has just turned his DP into a theatrical action and obtained an infinite selection of colorful shots: 1.5 million feet of vaguely set scenes. Then he tried (unsuccessfully) to shrink and assemble everything together in post-production. <br /> <br /> The final scene of the battle is truly exhilarating as the baboons wearing city women (perhaps borrowed from an "Fiddler On The Roof" touring company) throw countless sticks of dynamite at the regulators. Unfortunately, each explosive falls short of the target and explodes harmlessly. After seeing this happen 50-60 times, you can relate to the woman (the one who looks like something from "The Grapes of Wrath") that puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. This is probably what Cimino's mother did after writing that review. <br /> <br /> So believe what you have heard about this film since 1980. It is a sloppy, disconnected, ill-timed and historically distorted disorder. Of value only as an example of "how not to make a film" for film historians and as a source of entertainment for those who know the true history of the American West.
