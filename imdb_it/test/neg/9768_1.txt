This film is absolutely horrible! I thought because there were good actors like Gabrielle Union, Hill Harper and of course the infamous Billy D. Williams. The film is long, and drags on with a documentary style that shows Gabrielle Union, who died in the film, talking about her family; which by the way is a confused family because you never know who is who and who is related to whom. I would not recommend this film to anyone, and I wish I could pick it up where I got it from. I fell asleep from time to time because of boredom. Don't waste time or money on this movie. He could have been more faithful to life with more drama and less boredom.
