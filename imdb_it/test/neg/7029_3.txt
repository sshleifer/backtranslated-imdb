This movie was terrible! Ashley Rose Orr, while a talented tap dancer and singer (actually a little better than Temple was in terms of it), is a terrible actress. Play as Shirley as the character we saw on screen in his films, whether you play his person on screen or off screen. So what we get is an overly sad and totally unrealistic (not to say uninteresting) portrait. If one wants to see that side of her, one can simply rent one of her films. The only bright light here is the portrait of Gertrude Temple by Connie Britton. I don't think it was terribly realistic, but at least it was well played. Save yourself the problem and rent The Poor Little Rich Girl.
