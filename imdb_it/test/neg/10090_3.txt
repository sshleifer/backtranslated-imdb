Imagine every clich√© stereotyped and overwhelmed by every movie and television series set in the streets of Brooklyn between 1930 and 1980. Compile it with a cast of interchangeable caricatures instead of real characters. Launch a mix of "period" music and cry electric guitars during the "rumble" scenes. Then he spends his time trying to understand (or worry about) which Deuce will be killed in the final (anti) final horn. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie points to not just be another romantic comedy, teenage slasher, explosive action movie, teenage comedies, kiddie musicals or an Oscar nominated vehicle. But bringing something new or interesting to the genre of street gang tragedy may have been nice.
