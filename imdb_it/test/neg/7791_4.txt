I like Noel Coward, the spirit. I like Noel Coward, the game writes. I like Noel Coward, the composer and the singer, but I hate actor Noel Coward. For me this is a man who should have remained firmly behind the scenes, writing his shows and composing his music and making his profound and hilarious remarks. It should never be allowed in front of a camera. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, he is one of the best talents of the twentieth century, but the man could not act and his voice ... with his R's and his tonal quality too round ... well , could easily grate the cheese in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is one of my least favorite offered by Coward, as he unconvincingly interprets a psychiatrist to engage in a relationship with a much younger woman, aggravated by the fact that the much younger woman is a friend old school of his much younger wife. <br /> <br /> Celia Johnson is more a joy to look at as Cowards' coward wife as always. It is his performance that saves this obtuse dull film. I imagine that her little adventure in Coward's Brief Encounter four years before has qualified her for this role, since she must have raised some eyebrows by playing such a promiscuous woman and this gave her the chance to win back some fans and get some compassion. <br /> <br /> She was such a wonderful actress and you can see why Noel Coward used her so much in many of her productions. <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the film is gray, poorly interpreted, predictable and overall boring at an almost tight level. <br /> <br /> If your Noel Coward you want, take the time to watch In Which We Serve, Blythe Spirit or This Happy Breed. Three treasures by Noel Coward. With adorable movies like these I suppose I can forgive him for this turkey. <br /> <br /> I only gave this four stars for the addition of Miss Johnson, but overall I would avoid this like the plague.
