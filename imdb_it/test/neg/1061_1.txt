This film is surprisingly poor. He was on television when I tuned in an action scene and was chuckling at the macho cheese dialogue, waiting for Leslie Nielsen to appear. It took me a couple of minutes to realize that it wasn't actually a comedy, it was meant to be taken seriously. What needs to be remembered is that someone sat down and wrote this film, and worse yet - other people funded it and gave it the green light. <br /> <br /> Rutger Hauer obviously does not read the scripts before he registers, or that or has very serious debts to pay. <br /> <br /> Strangely, this film is so poor, that you find yourself staring at it, wondering how it was actually funded, and how a TV channel must have paid money for the rights to broadcast it. The dialogue between hero and villain while trying to shoot each other from the sky is particularly painful, with dialogues that sound like they were generated by a "Speak & Spell" from Texas Instruments. <br /> <br /> The Hollywood money machine is the worst. Funny though.
