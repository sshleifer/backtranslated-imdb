Possible spoilers As Peter Jackson showed so brilliantly in his "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, it is quite possible to make good movies, even great ones, within the heroic fantasy genre. The genre has distinguished literary antecedents, dating back to medieval chivalrous novels, in particular the Arthurian legends, on which Tolkien and other authors drew. The "Lord of the Rings" aside, however, it is difficult to think of any other sword and sorcery film that is valid. I would agree with the reviewer who said that the best of a bad band was Ron Howard's "Willow", and this too has made little difference to be a mediocre film compared to a negative one. `Red Sonja ', however, cannot get the even more modest distinction of simply being a bad movie than a scary one. <br /> <br /> As with `Willow ', many of the elements of the plot in` Red Sonja' derive from "The Lord of the Rings". An evil ruler tries to gain control of an artifact with supernatural powers to achieve the ambition to dominate the world, but is hampered by an assorted group of heroes. The film, set in the Hyborian era, a barbaric era in the distant past of the earth, begins with the villain of the piece, the evil queen Gedren, making unwanted sexual advances to the heroine Sonja. When these are rejected, Gedren (not a woman who does not accept an answer) reacts by killing Sonja's parents and brother. (In 1985 it was presumably still considered politically correct not only to make the boss a bad woman but also to make one of the main reasons for his evil frustrated lesbian lust). Gedren's next move is to capture the Talisman, a kind of fluorescent green soccer ball with magical powers, slaughtering the entire female priesthood, poorly dressed, charged with protecting him, just as they are about to destroy him because they feel his powers are become too dangerous. Among the dead is Sonja's sister, her only surviving relative. However, Sonja herself has not been inactive, but has enrolled in a martial arts academy from which she graduated summa cum laude and intends to take revenge. Along the way he joins Kalidor, a heroic swordsman tramp who looks like Tolkien's Aragorn, Prince Tarn, the spoiled ruler of a kingdom that fell into the powers of Gedren, and Falkon, Tarn's faithful servant. The rest of the film is quite predictable, as Sonja and her allies try to overthrow Gedren and prevent the destruction of the world threatened by the out-of-control Talisman. <br /> <br /> What is it that makes this movie so bad? Well, acting, for a start. Arnold Schwarzenegger in the role of Kalidor gives the typical performance in wood with the poker face that has become his trademark, at least in the first part of his career, with a strong foreign accent. Compared to Brigitte Nielsen as the heroine, however, she resembles Laurence Olivier. Miss Nielsen seems to have had even worse language difficulties, delivering each line to the mechanical voice and without tone of someone who has just completed the third lesson of a course of 'teaching yourself-English by correspondence'. One wonders if she was hired for the role only to make Arnie look good by comparison. The other characters, while not conducting their private struggles against the English language, are simply cartoon caricatures, in particular Prince Tarn who must be one of the most hateful youngsters on the screen ever. <br /> <br /> An even worse mistake than bad acting, however, is the almost total lack of imagination of the film. This is a particularly obvious flaw in a fantasy film, as such films must rely on their imaginative power to convince the public to suspend the natural feelings of disbelief that would be caused by a fantastic plot. When we look at Peter Jackson's masterpiece we can persuade us, at least for the next three hours, that we are in Middle-earth, that elves, wizards and hobbits exist, and that the fate of the world really depends on the destruction of a magic ring. When we look at "Red Sonja" we are convinced of nothing, except that we are looking at a group of actors with bad accents fighting each other on a hill to hold a lime green football. <br /> <br /> This lack of imagination also begins with the title of the film. The British science fiction author Brian Aldiss, when he challenged the exotic names given to his characters, replied that it didn't make much sense to create a fictitious alien society with its own distinctive culture if you wanted to ruin the effect by calling the hero Joe. (Of course, Tolkien was able <br /> to get away with giving Sam's name to one of his main characters, but that was due to the fact that the Hobbits had to be reassuring, the equivalent of Middle-earth of tweedy - smoking English members). Likewise, giving the heroine of a story apparently set in a barbaric era for a long time a name of common girls like "Sonia" (which is the way the name "Sonja" is pronounced) is as appropriate as to call it " Betty "or" Mary-Jane '. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have been made on a very small budget, which makes me wonder why they took the trouble. The fantasy must be made convincingly, or not at all. It was obviously shot in a remote mountain area, with little or no attempt to suggest a distinctive culture.The few buildings we see, such as the temple of the Talisman or the palace of Gedren, are obviously economic ensembles. that the capital of Tarn was destroyed by Gedren using the power of the Talisman, but in reality we do not see this event, all we see is what could be a storm that takes place on the other side of a hill. ask how Sonja have he intends to overthrow an entire kingdom with a few allies, but when you see how small an army Gedren has available becomes more understandable. When an earthquake threatens to destroy the building, you wonder if this is the Talisman at work or simply a crew member who inadvertently leans on the set. If we can enjoy this movie for nothing else, we can at least enjoy it for its involuntary humor; a nice example of the school of cinema so funny and funny. Ed Wood would have been proud of this. If it had been shown on California television the night before the retirement election, Gray Davis would still be governor. 2/10.
