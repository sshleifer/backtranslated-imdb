The plot in Petites Coupures has definitely left this spectator stunned. <br /> <br /> *** spoiler *** <br /> <br /> Within about 48 hours, the character of Auteuil has a relationship with a teenager, loses his wife's affections, attempts to seduce Scott Thomas, she is rejected by her continues to grope another female character in the back of a car and then finally turned to her problems. <br /> <br /> *** end of the spoiler *** <br /> <br /> wha ??? <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves in this film is Kristin Scott Thomas. Similar to Charlotte Rampling, it looks like a * natural * protagonist in French cinema. My hope is that one day Fran√ßois Ozon can name it in a part where he can show his true talent. <br /> <br /> There are some nice French films like the remarkable Le Colonel Chabert that asks for a DVD release, but this is the tripe that is chosen. <br /> <br /> Avoid this. <br /> <br /> zzzz ..
