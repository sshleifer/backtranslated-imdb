Obviously, a number of agents did not see past dollar signs when they signed their clients for this 117-minute * homage * to the courtesan complex. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film could have gone well, if it had the $ 1 million it was left out of it. Seriously. The amount of the check does not matter, prostitution is still prostitution and no amount of "love wins everyone" can change the fact that no marriage ever promises to imply "richer for the poorer, for prostitution as in loyalty ". Imagine the story otherwise, though: 2 stripped, borderline "desperate" and completely stupid kids. They clash with a wealthy businessman. The marriage of children is strained from imperfect times and the fact that the husband is something of a loser. Enter Mr. Tuxedo, exuding charm and stability - a virtual magnet for the biological clock ticking - and with him the temptation of his wife, the tensions, the suspense. Who will choose? Perhaps, under those conditions, I could really be interested. As-is, frankly, Redford's selfish and manipulative playboy wraps the cute character. A woman who will sell herself is only what a boy deserves that his wife will do. The indecent proposition makes the husband a TOTAL loser, lacking in every positive male characteristic, and makes his wife an economic slut seduced by money rather than confused by another potential love, a woman without a moral center and self-respect. <br /> <br /> All the impressive talents (acting, directing, cinematography) wasted on this film - and it was an impressive number - failed to save him from his $ 1 million line. If I see this turkey in another bridal shower, I'll roast it! (Or maybe cross it with Titanic and get the ribbon through the ocean!)
