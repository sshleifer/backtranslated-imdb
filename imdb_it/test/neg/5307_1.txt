Sometimes, when I hear an A-list cast, I am huddled together for 2 hours in a movie, I hope, and pray it be good, not for my $ 10 or 2 hours, but for the sake of these careers actors. In the case of "Be Cool", everything has been lost. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, John Travolta (aka Chili Palmer) and a musical director played by James Woods are driving in the car talking about movie sequels, and as most are not good. If you look at the fact that this scene was shot in the same way that Quentin Tarrantino filmed his automotive scene in "Pulp Fiction", and listen to the dialogue you can't help but reflect if this is 1) a disclaimer to the public that this the film is going to suck, or 2) an attempt to make the audience laugh at the humor of two people talking about sequels in a sequel. Oh the irony! (In case you are wondering, choice 1 is correct). The fresh and shiny Chili Palmer of the first and good movie "Get Shorty" is reproposed to play a missing music professional. Steal a hot young singer (Christina Milian) from her Jewish manager ghetto (Vince Vaughn) and turn her into a singing sensation. Obviously a film about an ex-gangster can never be complete without new criminals that cause chaos. This time the mobsters of choice are Russians, played by American actors who can't act in Russian if my whole family beat them to the head with their bare hands. <br /> <br /> As a Russian I was not so much offended by the way this film portrayed the Russians, but instead as a writer I was more offended by the horrible dialogue. This film tried too hard to make the audience laugh. It has potentially transformed good lines into redundancy. The Russian, black and gay jokes were the same ones written only twenty times. After calling the character of Rock's af ***** (he plays a gay bodyguard to Vince Vaughn), and the character of Cedric the Entertainerer is a ***** (he played a black rapper with an entourage who threatened those that they didn't play his tracks with guns) I wanted to get out of the cinema because it was painful to sit. If this was "Get Shorty", none of this should have even been in the movie to create a drama, or a bad laugh. <br /> <br /> What was missing in this film was not in "Get Shorty" was Chili's spicy attitude. He is a completely different person in this sequel. First, old Chili would have had more dialogues. John Travolta has no more than 20 lines spoken in "Be Cool", because it is staged with repetitive lines, and the hundred and seven cameo appearances of the most casual celebrities. I don't want to spoil the shock by revealing all the cameos for those who actually plan to see this movie (PLEASE, DON'T !!!), but I'll say that it will always amaze me that these people have agreed to be in such inanity films. <br /> <br /> What was even more stupid was the lame ballad sequence with Travolta and Uma Thurman (he plays James Woods' widower LUCKILY is killed in the first 10 minutes of the film). Tarrantino has never made Pulp Fiction an idiot like the director of "Be Cool" with whom to joke. This dance number was boring, long and throbbing. The Black Eyed Peas playing in the club with a total of 10 people did not make the scene memorable. <br /> <br /> There were so many holes in the plot that I left the theater wondering WHY?! Everything about this film was a big question mark. I didn't understand the whole point. I couldn't even explain to you why the Russians were trying to catch everyone, or why this movie was ever made, why I'm baffled. All I got out of this movie is that everyone in Los Angeles has a partner and the only way this film was probably funded was through all the advertisements for Diet Coke, Yahoo !, Honda Insight Hybrid, T- Mobile, Trimspa (also the spokesperson itself is in the film) and the Bad Screenwriters Guild. Plot holes, stupid dialogues, too many random cameos, horrible acting (even by professionals), and a not so funny attempt to imitate "Pulp Fiction" makes this film the worst movie of 2005, and it's only the third month of 'year.
