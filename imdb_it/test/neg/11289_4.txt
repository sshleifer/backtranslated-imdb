Ty Cobb is, by far, the most interesting and belligerently crazy athlete ever. His baseball career is unmatched with absurd statistics, brilliant strategy and pure sheer violence. Every game he played was a show of human skill and cruelty. So, obviously, the film about him does not deal with anything, focusing instead on the writing of his biography of the author Al Stump. Now this is not such a horrible idea in theory, as Cobb himself slipped even further into paranoid dementia as the years progressed and the stories of his mad outbursts, even if an elder is shocking even by standards desensitized today. But instead of focusing on these events, which I assume was simply too interesting, the film is a pseudo-romanticized road movie with clich√©s, a cliche plot that will make any Cobb fan cry any tears of vinegar. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones does quite well as an annoyed Cobb, but somehow manages to overestimate his supervillainy of cartoons. Most of the Cobb stories are barely credible, but making it even crazier seems to be both impossible and useless. Robert Wuhl, who portrays writer Al Stump, is a dark vortex of non-existent talent. He sucks life from every scene, trying to make this film his Nagasaki. There is a reason why we never see him again as a leading man (Arliss does not count, he is barely a show). Even the inevitable "role reversal" of Cobb and Stump is eventually made even worse by his sheer inability to utter words that do not sound like a poor book on the narrative voice of the tape. <br /> <br /> For all the terrible writing and the bland film on display, there is a sequence that stands out as much higher than the rest of this failure that accepting the same film is almost impossible. A hyper stylized flashback sequence showing Cobb's overbearing psychology and brutal athleticism while actually playing baseball is pure brilliance. The camera moves in a bizarre way and the whole event seems like a dream due to the unique style of play of the Cobb monster. Each slide, shot and tackle are made even more powerful due to the improved sound, and Tommy Lee Jones OWNS the intensity of the main player. It amazes the viewer about the possibilities of a real Cobb biopic in complete freedom with the same actor. It's worth watching the movie for this incredible few minutes alone, just to see what it could have been. <br /> <br /> I could be a little unfair with this film because of my knowledge of Ty Cobb and want it to be something that is not, but making a film so boring and castrated on this maniac is meaningless . I'm glad Ron Shelton's career has slipped since then.
