Put in simple words or better a word, it would be more suitable for PATHETIC !!!!!! The film begins by attracting a bit of interest in the plot, but, like a few minutes from the audience, is becoming restless about toilets and snacks, or getting a breath of fresh air outside the dark closed hall .... <br /> <br /> It seems to be watching a movie from the 60s in which the colors were boring, directed by a novice and played by high school students! The film is about a short-haired American actress trying to make a comeback in the movies by starring in one of the not-so-famous Indian films. His acting is true Sad complimented by the bad delivery dialogue. <br /> <br /> OverAll: I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie. Still want to watch: then try looking at it at home, when it is broadcast on some TV channels, believe me it would be fun since this film would not receive a single advertisement and no sponsor. <br /> <br /> And better to carry an aspirin, you may need it if you can't find a remote to change channels! post scriptum I have no idea if the other reviewers also watched the movie? I did and I lost my $ 10 on the ticket!
