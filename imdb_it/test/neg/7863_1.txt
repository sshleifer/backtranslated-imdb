This film is so bad that it actually becomes fun. One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The funny thing was that the trailer contained scenes that were not in the movie. Only by watching the trailer would I save much of my time. It actually showed everything that happened in the film, except the conclusion, and it was also so obvious. <br /> <br /> It is honestly difficult to think of a reason why this film was made. This is so bad. Horrible. <br /> <br /> I would give him 0 out of 10 if that were possible. There is nothing else to say about this movie.
