A terrible, very artificial writing, from a "do-gooder" who knows absolutely nothing about race relations in LA, or in the US in the present. Positive positive reviews are a mystery to me - but they could only be provided by people who think that someone's "good" intentions should be applauded regardless of how superficial, simple and simply unrealistic the results are. If you want to see a movie that deals in a realistic way with the modern problems of Los Angeles. The movie you need to see (and probably already seen) is Pulp Fiction. There is more honesty and realism about the race in every two minutes of that film than there are in 4 hours (oh I'm sorry, I heard 4 hours) of this stink. <br /> <br /> If anyone ever needs proof that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, then this is the movie for you.
