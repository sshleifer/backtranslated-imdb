The film starts with a lot of voiceover, a bad sign. Then he slides downhill with silly and stupid scenes involving hunters and Indians. But it reaches new and impressive minimums when all the cheerful mountain men dance each other in an alpine meadow. Meanwhile, the happy and fortunate Indians sit and watch them. It's a better scene than the dancing cowboys in "Blazing Saddles". There is a small flaw in this comparison; "Across the Wide Missouri" is not a comedy. <br /> <br />
