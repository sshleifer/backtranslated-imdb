The film itself is just a collection of scenes that have no intrinsic meaning for someone living outside of Russia. I will not deny that some of the images and techniques were quite revolutionary at the time (filmed in 1928), but the problem with the film is that it has no interest in the intellectual or common man. We are simply observing an organized form of images, ranging from an arm beating a horse, to a toothless soldier in war. Everything in between is embarrassing, casual and completely useless. It would have been possible to invent a forum that would keep the viewer interested, but this would not be the case, even if the director's method is quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> In general, you should see it if I am a student art, with hallucinogenic drugs or a student of pre-Tarkovskian cinema.
