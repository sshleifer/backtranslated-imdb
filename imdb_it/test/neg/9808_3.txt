Was Vanessa Redgrave taking mogadon during filming? It was as if he were reading from a self-portrait. I saw more life in a wooden spoon. Or maybe it was all part of the character? whatever, it was very annoying, I kept wanting to shake the screen to get it done. I read the book a long time ago and didn't like it very much, except that Septimus's descent into madness was very well done - but I don't think Rupert Graves showed it very well, his acting was all on the surface. The connection between his life and that of Clarissa is not very well done, but I suspect that the attempt is to show the sacrifice made by the soldiers to allow people like Clarissa to continue their distracted lives. The film is very bizarre and has no real unity. Hated
