The first few minutes that showed the cold and crisp character of the character of Willis were rather pleasant, especially with Jean Smart, but after all this it was really tedious. This is just a big man slain and stuff for a long time irritating kid with no innovation. I know the casting probably chose this guy to prove that Willis was just as irritating in his younger self, but I found this kid particularly irritating and a little hissing.
