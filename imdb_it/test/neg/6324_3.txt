Ok, where to start. I can't believe how many good reviews I've read here. I saw this (2004) and I had to fight to not press the stop button, I decided to continue only thanks to all the good reviews I read. After seeing it, I felt it was my duty to let the world know about this. First of all it seems that the film never starts, the plot does not actually occur until about 30 minutes before the film ends, leaving the viewer to wonder, 'when will this begin? So don't ever call it a "revenge movie" because revenge doesn't even begin until more than half of the film has already passed. Furthermore, the film tries to make you believe that this is a post-apocalyptic Australia. I am sorry that showing dusty rural roads for half of the film and a bad letter on a sign did not convince me, even for 1979 this was not science fiction. Anyway, add it over a homoerotic subtext in random order and you find yourself a lousy movie (I have nothing against gays, there was really no need to do it). The only good part was the first scene of the chase, good direction considering that it was 1979, and another good part is how it kills the last boy. So basically, I suggest you watch the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes and you'll have a lot more fun than if you sat in the middle of all that stuff in the middle, which could lead you to dig your own eyes. Don't say I didn't warn you.
