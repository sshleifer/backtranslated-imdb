Ok, I had reasonably high expectations for this. The controversial topic was a good concept. As a horror fan, I admit I was fascinated and very excited about it. <br /> <br /> It turned out that they had a great idea, but it was done terribly. Let's see. This movie seems to work in 3 modes: Happy, Sex and Dark. The problem is that the film never decides what it wants to be. The "Happy" parts that I believe should be in contrast with the "Dark" parts, but they don't work. The soundtrack is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> The cinematographic transitions between these 3 modes are very bad, I can't even begin to say how much the direction and editing suck. There is sex in the most unpleasant and unattractive way. I don't complain, but even by Horror standards they were not necessary and fillers. <br /> <br /> The characters are all unlikely, except for Paula (Powerful). Her friend from Monaco is a whore and perhaps one of the most annoying characters in the films I have recently met. <br /> <br /> There's a bit of plot that I won't go into the details ... It's not the stupid and most talented hands they would make a good movie. There is also a nice turn and a fantastic conspiracy going on. Don't try to understand everything because there are huge holes in the plot here. <br /> <br /> It's all so badly done that you don't care about the victims, the authors, or anyone. And to think that it would have been fantastic. I can say ANOTHER thing that is, the film sheds light on today's unethical medical procedures. With the advancement of genetics and controversial sciences, this may have been a great philosophical film that raises and discusses these questions. But you won't find it here, just a series of scenes glued together with people and things you don't care about. <br /> <br /> Jump and look at Flatliner, you're welcome. <br /> <br /> 3/10
