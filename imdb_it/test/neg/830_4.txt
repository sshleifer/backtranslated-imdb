Even before this film it is clear that Ali G has become the exact character he has decided to parody. However, I'm not a fan of the Sacha Baron Cohen character, but I was curious to see how a man of such a small talent managed to convince the universal studios to finance a film of almost an hour and a half on a 3-minute joke. A very thin plot is just a torrent of jokes of penis and marijuana and I have to admit that I made her shudder when I saw actors so respected as Charles Dance and Michael Gambon who lowered themselves so low for employment. Saying that I have to admit (even if I'm a little ashamed) to have raised the title on more than one occasion, and no matter how bad this film was it was never boring, and never once did I think of turning it off (mainly on because of the splendid Rhona Mitra). That being said, watch this movie only if you are an adolescent boy between the ages of 14 and 17 and you find hilarious jokes.
