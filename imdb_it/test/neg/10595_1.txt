I saw this movie for the first time the other day and I was bored with tears. I guess I was looking for some flashbacks for the wonderful series I remembered. I saw the Mod Squad TV show religiously throughout the day and it was fantastic. He was full of action and the relationship the 3 had with Greer was captivating. There was nothing like this here. When Greer was murdered, you get the idea that these 3 could be imported less. The actor who played Pete is a really good actor but they wrote his part as if he were mentally challenged. Pete in the TV series was quiet and serious but also had a fun side. They had this guy who acted like he was a junkie at the time, drunk or just ignorant. I would definitely not recommend this movie. Especially if I were a fan of the TV series. It will be a complete disappointment.
