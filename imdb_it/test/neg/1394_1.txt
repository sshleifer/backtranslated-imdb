Yes, it's real people, this is undoubtedly the worst show in the history of television. If you want to see a sad, sad and lonely comedian, try to entertain the masses with a half hour of tired and pale social chatter that your cousin, a little retarded, said at the Thanksgiving table, this could be the show for you. This is considered a ruthless comedy, but my friends, to tell the truth, make it look like Tim Allen Richard Pryor. Avoid at all costs. Unless you're a masochist.
