The really terrifying thing is that the filmmakers thought they were doing something smart and sexy. Instead they probably made the most stupid horror photo of the year! <br /> <br /> This film begins with a group of art snobby friends in a gallery. This freakish European freak comes up and starts talking about the main character's pretentious fruitiness, sounding like he's just come from an episode of Dark Shadows. Then he offers her a smoking stick (yes, a bizarre stick), which she eagerly accepts! She takes some red shit and puts it in a spoon for her free base! If you ever happen in real life, don't do it! <br /> <br /> She is transported to a strange world, Jean Rollin, hell that should be sexy but it is not, where there is this thing that looks like a rotten creature from the black lagoon! <br /> <br /> Soon she turns all her artistic sleazeball friends into her new form of supernatural crack. No matter how these idiots go crazy and turn blue they can't leave him alone. At some point she manages to distinguish the marching creature! <br /> <br /> After the final battle and the stupid woman is vaporized or anything else, the so-called hero is left alone to pack his copy of Michael Moore's Dude. My country and can not resist the smoke that sticks once again to try to save his deficient friend. What a drug. <br /> <br /> Four-star rates for pure involuntary humor.
