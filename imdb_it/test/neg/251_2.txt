This film should have been classified as three film summaries linked together to form a feature film (including many shots of people walking slowly down corridors and dark streets). BE WARNED! The first hour of this film is simply a re-hash of the first two Aztec films told by the main character. The real movie doesn't start until the thing is almost finished. I have to say that Bat's exaggeration is pretty funny. <br /> <br /> As for the robot, I thought a robot was a mechanical device that might or might not look like a human. The Bat's "robot" consists of a reanimated radioactive corpse enclosed in a lead-body robot. As Tom Servo said, "It's not so impressive, it doesn't even have knees!" This, and the robot takes about an hour to cross the room. But once he takes you, LOOK! It will disintegrate with a touch (powered by radio? Pluh-ease!). <br /> <br /> This is a great movie if accompanied by Joel and the Bots. Otherwise, you're just a greedy of abuse.
