"Carlito's Angels" is a parody of "Charlie's Angels" that does not fear to falsify itself at times, however this does not mean that the film is above criticism even by the spectators - it is amateur and youthful (I think it is fast -motion "stopped being fun around 1914). Aggressive rap music often stifles dialogue and the film seems longer than it is, even if it barely runs for more than an hour! Girls are hot and adorable, with wonderful lean bodies, and even if they never get undressed, their clothes leave little to the imagination. Checking the pages of IMDb, I discovered that one of them (Alessandra Ramos) is actually facing a film career, I wish her good luck, because even if this film is bad, she (like the other girls) gave him all the energy he has and I wouldn't mind seeing her again on the screen.
