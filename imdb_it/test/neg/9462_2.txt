** Spoiler * Gives away the irrelevant ending ** <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this film, there was a brief introduction to the world of blood from the master of gore films, H.G. Lewis. He talked about how this film was lost, and then found years after the director's death. He also talked about how blood films were measured by the amount of blood on stage used in it. Blood Feast was a 2 galloner, 10,000 Maniacs was a 5 galloner. But then he goes and states that Dr. Gore had 15 gallons. I want to know where half of the 15 gallons went. Watching the movie, I saw very little close to 15 liters. Okay, there was a fairly large amount of blood, but not where close to 15 liters. Some dismemberment scenes were definitely rather bloody and realistic, flesh bows and all the rest, but I wouldn't say 15 gallons. <br /> <br /> "END !!! ENNNNNNNNNDDDDDD !!!" Does it sound familiar? This is what you should have said towards the last half of this movie. After the character Igor was thrown into the acid bath, the film slowed down to become a painful cat. There was no coherent end, as it did not fit in with the previous 90 minutes. She left with a van with a perfect stranger, GREAT OFFER! This is what happens when one maintains an individual (I will not say a person, because he does not qualify as a person) very innocent for the world around him. The doctor teaches the girl that a man must be loved, so every man he meets, who loves. <br /> <br /> Although HG Lewis told us at the beginning of the film that maybe we don't like acting, directing, or even blood ... I go with choices A and B. BOTH ARE TERRIBLE! ! It was enough to give me bad dreams of cropped editing and people with shifty eyes while talking to a person. But I passed the film and I came out stronger. Too bad he couldn't say the same after finishing ROBO C.H.I.C. <br /> <br /> This was a BAD movie. Usually I can take my doses of vinegar to a good extent, but every now and then, you get a movie that bites back. I think this film took off with an arm or a leg (haha ... * sigh *) Admittedly, I enjoyed watching the scenes where the good doctor stared at his future victims and opened his eyes REALLY wide and confined to fix it. It was VERY similar to Fuad Ramseys in Blood Feast when he stared at that lady in his catering shop, and he didn't use his power after that. I guess this film picks up where Fuad's powers left off. <br /> <br /> * Final judgment * The film should have been lost. Have a nice day <br /> <br /> -Scott-
