This was the biggest disappointment of a movie ... :( Suck, because I really didn't see the time. <br /> <br /> All the twists were shitty, they were ALL flashbacks !!! <br /> <br /> What makes a film good robbery is the CREDIBILITY of the work: yes, it must be surprising, so the audience is stunned, but if you go away and go to that bull #! t ... what is the dot? <br /> <br /> Also the main shot was a bag snatch anyway! You didn't see the team that was operating with its full deceptive and brilliant potential. There wasn't even a GOOD robbery in this movie! They were all crappy, including that crap from that idiot Frenchman to go through lasers ... it's easy to do that when they are composed later! Moreover, that kind of thing has already been done in at least one other film .. and it was stupid then well ... <br /> <br /> Also, there's no reason to even have half of the 12 or 11 in this movie! What a difference it really makes half of the cast to the result of this film? the SCENES don't even need to be there! <br /> <br /> The first was classy. This was CHEAP! And it makes the whole team lose credibility. Especially Ocean himself to bow to the Bennett.
