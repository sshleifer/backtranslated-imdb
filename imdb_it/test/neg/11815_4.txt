Pam Grier is the sister sister of the 1970s, who appears in many blaxploitation films that have recently been discovered and appreciated by a new generation. I can safely say that BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA could be the worst Pam Grier film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Grier is Lee and Margaret Markov is Karen; are two prisoners who escaped from prison after Karen's revolutionary friends attacked the paddy's wagon. Chained to each other, the film becomes THE DEFIANT ONES for women, but has three separate lots: a fat criminal (the Filipino star spun Vic Diaz) wants Lee dead, a bounty-hunting cowboy (the excellent Sid Haig ) look for the two girls; and Karen's revolutionary friends are looking for her. The film eventually becomes so twisted and uninvolved with the two women that the title should have been MEN CHASING WOMEN. Grier, an action star, has no chance of participating in any of the many action scenes (too long). Markov is excellent as Karen and Grier are OK as Lee, but in the end both are forgotten in the many subplots. An interesting scene has the bounty hunter forcing a police officer and his boss to throw his pants so he can shoot the one with the smallest penis (judged by his bitch), but he is easily forgotten in the middle of the whole chaos. <br /> <br /> BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA starts off like a movie of women in jail complete with lesbian guards and a shower scene, then goes completely to a hunting movie. If director Eddie Romero (famous for directing Filipino horror films) had just limited himself to the WIP theme, it would have been fine. Instead, BMWM gets really old and fast and the surprise ending simply marvels the audience because they sat through a 90-minute movie to finish like this! Another problem: where is the film that should be set? While some of the accents are Hispanic and cities have Spanish names (Los Robles, etc.), all natives are obviously Asian! Hmmm ... Recommended only for the most determined fans of Grier, who even then will be disappointed.
