I was only fourteen when I first saw Alien movies and immediately liked them. Original, terrifying and classic. Sigourney Weaver was the perfect choice for the character of the female hero and deserved a statuette for her act. In 1979 something eternal was born that the immortal series continued with a film nothing less legendary than the first. Alien3 was another point of view, but I think this was the most stressful and unique part of all, this was my favorite. Unfortunately the last one was a failure in many ways. He was tense, illogical and full of petty massacres. I didn't like it at all, but I never thought that a worse part would ever be made in the future. Well, in 2004 I was wrong. Alien vs. Predator was a bad break, and should have been directed by a more talented director or should never have been realized. But when I saw Alien vs Predator Requiem I was totally shocked, too, devastated. When I sat down and decided to look at him full of doubts, even though I never thought that such a bad film could be made. Without a script, without a director and without actors, I don't understand how a film can be made. Because this film lacks these three terms. What you get is a beautiful show of massacres without a story but with a lot of boring and boring dialogues. Waste of money and waste of time. This film is rather impudent, which honors the fans of both sides (Alien / Predator). Shame!
