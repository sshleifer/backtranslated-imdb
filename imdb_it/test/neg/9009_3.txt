I tried to write a summary of the plot for several minutes and I can't do it. But with a bad movie like Night of the Blood Beast the plot doesn't matter. An astronaut accident lands and he thinks he is dead. His body later revives, but it is found to carry the embryos of a strange form of alien life. But how did they get there? And where is the alien who implanted the strange creatures in the body of Maj. John Corcoran? <br /> <br /> IMDb lists the Night of the Blood Beast runtime at 62 minutes. It's right? 62 minutes? It had to be longer than that. I felt endless. Even with the MST3K comment (which was very funny by the way), the real movie seemed much, much longer. And it's pretty much a snoozer from beginning to end. I like many of these alien-type movies invasion of the 50s, but not this one. He failed to capture my interest at any level. The baby's aliens were too foolish to be taken seriously, the blood beast was pathetic, and none of the characters did anything for me. Add to that the usual cheap Roger Corman traps and you'll have a real movie loser.
