I usually like these stupid movies / without brain activity, but this was just too stupid. There were too many clich√©s and the plot didn't really make much sense. There were many negative aspects and the ending was extremely poor and abrupt. We haven't even been able to see if the big master plan worked. We also saw only the hiccup of the protagonist on his farthest dead, the professor (who died because of stupidity (see below)). <br /> <br /> A scene bothered me particularly. Why did the professor only have about 5 minutes of oxygen in his container when he went over the dam manually? And if they only had oxygen containers containing 5 minutes of oxygen, why didn't they bring two or three? So would he survive ?? he was damn stupid. The film is full of such stupid things. I can't recommend it at all.
