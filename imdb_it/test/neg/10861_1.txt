This is my first "horrible" vote on IMDb and I couldn't think of a more deserving film to honor it with. I was hoping to entertain the garbage and found the garbage of the saddest and most boring type. I found a film that nobody ever cared about, including its creator. <br /> <br /> "Hell Ride", directed, written and performed by Larry "Friend of QT" Bishop, has a simple plot about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys, two motorcycle gangs and a horrible murder in the 1976 which has yet to be avenged. Larry seems fiercely determined not to tell this story, concentrating instead on putting his main character, who is strangely waving, in situations where he can caress women who pretend to be pleasure. It also has a dialog box containing enough horrible fire games / metaphors to put out "fire" for life. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper escapes complete humiliation, others are not so lucky. Sometimes they come on the road with their bikes, making us feel even more sorry for Michael Madsen, since his high handles seem to add insult to the wound of having to appear in this movie. There is plenty of nudity enhanced by silicon, but rather little action and no sense of humor, making one reflect on the kind of audience they had in mind. <br /> <br /> My guess is that most people who watch this movie, including fans of trash 60s motorcycle movies, will feel cheated. Do yourself a favor and revisit the real things.
