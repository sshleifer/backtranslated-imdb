POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER <br /> <br /> Not a terribly objective review, but I just found this film horribly depressing. Like a lot of work by Russell T. Davies, <br /> <br /> asks more questions than I can answer. His best work (Bob & Rose, Doctor Who) reveals hope against odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat. These edifying themes seemed strangely absent here. I suppose the fact that you look back after days of watching is a testament to the quality of the program, but the resolution was too shabby for my taste. <br /> <br /> However, I would not agree with the reviews I read complaining that the end seems "attached". I think that every conclusion follows logically from his premise and the ending represented a solid personal conviction that perfectly solved the main theme of the show. Although I never really questioned the progression of the events, I felt that there was a lot that could have been expanded. I also read that it was originally conceived as a four-part series instead of two, and it is possible that the truncation has damaged the completed piece. However, these defects appear everywhere, in sequences and themes that sometimes seem rough or sketchy. <br /> <br /> To his credit, Davies is absolutely not afraid of writing big, and you have to admire the pure audacity and scope of this project. The premise you face here is stuff from movies or novels ?? it is a brave and ambitious thing to deal with in the middle of television. Strengths include Christopher Eccleston, who is positively hypnotic in the head. For me, he was and remains the best reason to look. The depiction of the Messiah's humanity was brilliant, inspiring and engaging, and a true recognition for both Davies's screenplay and Eccleston's acting. I also thought that the representation of the reaction of the modern world to the second coming sounded true. <br /> <br /> So, two stars simply because I personally want my entertainment to be fun. I'd rather be relieved or at least distracted by my fiction. I have a whole real world around me ?? filtered by CNN or newspapers - if I choose to be horribly depressed. There are certainly less subjective reasons with which to judge this piece, but I fear that my judgment on this is obscured by my emotional response.
