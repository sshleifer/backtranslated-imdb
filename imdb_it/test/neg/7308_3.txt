Actually this happened: the mother-in-law and her father-in-law had lunch with the couple the day after the wedding and gave her money in public. The young Elizabeth disturbed so much that she never forgot the problem. We must remember that he was only 16 years old. She was so embarrassed that she was afraid of sex all her life. Perhaps this started to look like a trauma. Even the constant interference of his aunt and mother-in-law. As she says, she kept all her children away from her, criticized her teeth and ways (which she considered inappropriate for an empress), and when Sissi finally went to Venice with her husband and children, her eldest daughter died , and the mother in the law blamed her for that unfortunate and untimely death. Never recovered.
