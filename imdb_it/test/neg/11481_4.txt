The Adventures of Sebastian Cole speaks of a boy named Sebastian (Adrian Grenier) who, at some point, imagines himself becoming a writer, since it really takes time. This film is presumably the years when he gets his writing material, the years of adventure, hence the title and the previous quote. In it we experience advent stories and warnings typical of love, drugs and sex ... changes. Yes, there is a slight turning point here that is very interesting, namely that Sebastian's stepfather (Clark Gregg) very soon makes a rough decision to get a sex change that has a huge impact on Sebastian's family and on his relationship with his step -dad. <br /> <br /> Clark Gregg plays Hank / Henrietta, Sebastian's stepfather and is very good at the part, very credible without being exaggerated, which is a path that this film could have taken quite easily. Fortunately they didn't. Adrien Grenier, whom I only know from Entourage, is also very good of his like Sebastian, and together, he and Gregg have an excellent relationship on screen. It is always quite engaging to watch this relationship from guys (?) As it develops and is genuinely heartbreaking at times. <br /> <br /> And this is the best of what this film has to offer. Unfortunately, it brings with it a mediocre photographic work, direction and cinematography. It's not bad, but it's very different from being good, or memorable in the slightest. Even the characters are subtly written, and it is clear from the beginning how most of the strings will go on stage. The only really fascinating character in every respect is Hank / Henrietta by Clark Gregg. I have already said that Grenier did well, but Sebastian's character is not only unattractive, but completely unlikely. I honestly don't see why anyone in the audience would be heading towards his character in whatever he does. He hopes, whines, cheats, lies and no longer has aspirations except to be a slacker complete. Would it be different if it were perhaps a secondary character or a comic relief, but to have it as its main objective and to be invited to take the character seriously? Here we go. <br /> <br /> And I don't really hold it against this movie, but I just want to say ... choose a different song in all these movies, Hollywood! There is no longer "Where Is My Mind" by Pixies, we all know it's a good song, stop using it in every other movie! <br /> <br /> I feel like I could continue to tear more and more of this movie apart, but in all honesty I didn't hate it. I've never been interested, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The Adventures of Sebastian Cole is not a bad or boring movie, it's not even very cool or addictive. It is very irregular and the script could have used a lot of work. I guess the point of the film is to take a look at the life of a writer before he made it, and it worked ... if that writer published fiction pieces I wouldn't want to read.
