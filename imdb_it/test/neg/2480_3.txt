I have seen every episode, and all the characters have remained the same little absorbed and absorbed brats, there is no development of the character in 5 years (getting pregnant is not the development if you are still the same girl as the fathers, only now Delinda complains with Danny because dad is not around) Sam doesn't change or he never grows, which makes her boring, repetitive and so annoying that she is sickening after the third season, Danny is a typical soft character who is ordered by everyone in his life, (he did not preside over the morals of his) especially Mary and Delinda. The old boring clich√© will never accept that their on-off relationship will become boring very quickly. <br /> <br /> James Cann can act and his character is OK to watch, only he is just another former CIA man who has huge contacts and training etc. so that you can stop any thief or crook known to man, even if the cameras can't do half the fun things for a while, yet in 5 years writers behave in a stupid way, why? Because they have all this expensive and advanced technology, but not a simple walkie talkie (communicating is fast and easy) you never see the safety that walks on the floor, only when there is a situation, and suddenly everyone is just there. <br /> <br /> The plots move very quickly from scam and rob the casino in one way or another, to typical American girlish ships, the same things done to death all over the world, have sex , but I hate you, I've always loved you, I think so, but I love her / him, instead, but if, maybe one day blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> I would recommend "Hotel Babylon" to people who like Las Vegas, have much more success simply because the characters are interesting and engaging and not forced into the throat for 6 months a year. <br /> <br /> Am I happy to be English ?? I'd rather see the same actors in 5 different shows rather than 5 years constantly worse in the same.
