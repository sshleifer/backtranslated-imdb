Although there is a very small plot and all that exists is just improvisation, it was still a good start by a new director with no previous funding and a clever move by Andy Warhol to make his cemematic productions more salable and visual . In any case, this story of a street crook depends too much on showing Joe Buck naked (almost always!). And the creative use of a flashy montage really fades after the hundredth time and the cutting of the dialog becomes really annoying halfway. It would have been much more amusing or even dramatic if they had made a documentary on the daily life of a prostitute or braggart, instead of letting the actors invent an unreasonable plot and dialogue.
