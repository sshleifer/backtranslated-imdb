A work colleague told me to watch this film, since he considered this film one of the best films ever. So I looked at him. First of all I have to admit that I don't like traditional films and I prefer watching movies with a real meaning. <br /> <br /> And that's the point, because I don't like this movie. It has no meaning. It's just a combination of funny, stupid, boring, funny, absurd and electrifying pieces. At first I thought this film could be a true mystery mystery (like the German law pack), but the film was too mysterious for me. <br /> <br /> David Lynch might be able to create a combination of the most diverse images, but the composition seemed terrible to me like a combination of milk and beer. Both of them are good enough, but together?
