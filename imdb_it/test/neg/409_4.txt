I had not read any of the books nor seen the first film so after receiving the passes for a preview show, I had no expectations. <br /> <br /> 'Angels and Demons' was a confused and twisted film devoid of direction or credibility. There was a very small development of the character and I never found myself worrying about the situation of the protagonists; the opposite was true, I was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would have succeeded since the first part of the film focused almost exclusively on why the Illuminati are who they are. <br /> <br /> The film jumps from position to position with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everyone in the film is an ally when they meet for the first time. Any analytical mind will realize that this is highly unlikely. <br /> <br /> The climax is extremely clichÃ© and lets you ask what happened and you wonder why no one considered some of these points, it seems very tacky and not necessary. > <br /> Actors are not particularly credible in their roles, especially since I found it difficult to believe that scientists, professors and churchmen acted the way they do without considering the consequences of their actions. The events that happen are not plausible and the rhythm of the film is debatable with the characters who jump on themselves in a tight schedule and I had to wonder how the protagonists manage to get from position to position in time, every time. /> <br /> The most enjoyable part of the film is the cinematography, I found it a beautiful movie to watch but it was such a mess, that I found it would not be worth paying to see in theaters.
