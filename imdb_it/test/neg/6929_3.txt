I loved the book "A Little Princess" for most of my life, and I was very excited that there was a movie. But I was appalled by this adaptation. Not only is the acting in wood, and the plot is a complicated mixture of various incidents in the book, but the theme is completely wrong. The real theme of the story should be that a girl can be a princess only when she acts like one, like Sara does when she gives 5 of her 6 sandwiches to a beggar child, even when she herself is very hungry. The theme of the film seems to be that all the girls are princesses, which greatly reduces Sara's actions, and it seems more like it should be written on a Hallmark card rather than applied to this story. <br /> <br /> There are many other things wrong with this film - too many to list, but here are just a few of the bigger ones: this story should be set in English in the mid-1800s, not in America during the WWI. Miss Minchen is harsh towards Sara from the beginning, doing her actions when Sara is left without a penny much less surprising than she would be if she were initially sweet and sweet, as she should be. Nowhere is it said that Becky is black. Sara's father * doesn't * come back, he's dead. He is his best friend and collaborator in the diamond mines who finds Sara and brings her back to his place. In fact, diamond mines are not even mentioned at all, even though they are the source of Sara's wealth. <br /> <br /> Through all that Sara has faced, she always behaves like a princess, giving what she can, and forgive those who have hurt her. He would never have called Lavinia a "two-brat bully". Such a thing is completely out of character for her, and undermines the whole philosophy that must be well educated, no matter what. <br /> <br /> This is by far the worst adaptation of a book to the screen I've ever seen (with the notable exceptions of "Ella Enchanted" and "Anne of Green Gables the Continuing Story") book is wonderful, and cleverly written, so I don't understand why the director felt he needed to be changed to make it interesting. I would suggest that anyone who wants to know this story should look at the 1987 version, which is far superior. Or better yet, read the book. It will be more than worth your time compared to the hour and a half wasted on this version of the film.
