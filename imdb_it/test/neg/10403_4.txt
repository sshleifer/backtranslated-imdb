Stanley Kubrick, a director who holds the highest level of esteem for his masterpieces (Clockwork Orange, 2001, The Killing, the Shining, Dr. Strangelove, etc.) He removed the film from circulation, leaving him alone from hardcore fans and completists. After seeing the film for myself, I could see why. At the age of 24, Kubrick had already perfected his trade in fixed photography for LOOK magazine and had made some short documentaries. Like many other neo-novel directors who came in the decades following him, his ambition for Fear and Desire was, in short, simply to go for a cheap movie, more than likely to see if he could do it. At that level, it was successful. However, the film itself is not. <br /> <br /> I can't really say that the film is a failure because there was something I liked about it. Although the film's story is over, and the actors (whom Kubrick had no idea how to direct, not being a theater man), his ability to produce and capture some great images gets his seeds in this film. Sometimes, there are some close-up shots and quick shots in suspense / action scenes that attract attention. Unfortunately, this is all the good I can really say about the movie. Although there are a couple of "named" actors in the film (Frank Slivera, who also appeared in Killer's Kiss, and Paul Mazursky, a full-fledged director), overall performance is boring and very usual. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this is the main death of the film for me; every time I watch a Kubrick film, even his first film noirs of Killer's Kiss and the Killing, I can say who did it, since his style then stood out, that he would continue as he evolved as an artist . It was not "artistic" as I could have imagined (which is usually the case with first-time directors like Scorsese and Spielberg), but watching this film not only looked like it wasn't Kubrick, it seemed like a lot of the time I was watching a class B movie (or also C) from a director that the era had forgotten - not really "bad Ed," but close. The music is as normal as possible, the fades are pedestrian and the plot seems to have little attention. <br /> <br /> In short, as others have said and on which I can agree, this is a "doodle pad" of a future icebreaker, which shows some shots and some eye-catching changes (the best scene is when soldiers take the stupid girl hostage), but not enough to really recommend except those, like myself, who end up seeing all of Kubrick (or, maybe, I have to see every war movie with very low budget ever made ), if only for curiosity.
