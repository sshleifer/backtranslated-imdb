The idea of ​​bringing Dracula to contemporary times is not bad - after all, it could bring the series back to life by injecting a new element of history into a series that Hammer has almost exhausted in a long series of generally excellent films. However, as the current day turned out to be the early 1970s, the results were rather stupid and more like the LOVE OF THE FIRST BITE (a deliberate comedy). Seeing Christopher Lee in a movie full of hip-hop 70s and chords of electric guitar and laughable rock music seemed simply stupid. To make matters worse, the acting is much more exaggerated - with an intense and silly performance of "Johnny Alucard". I also thought it was really funny that it took Van Helsing's nephew to notice that "Alucard" is "Dracula" written backwards - no one else understood it by himself! Wow, what a cunning !! <br /> <br /> So, given that most of the film was bad, why did it still earn an almost respectable score of 4? Well, when the story came to the expected clash between Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) and Drac (Christopher Lee), it was exciting and ended very well. Also, and I know it will look very sexist, but if I had to watch a negative film, at least the character of Stephanie Beacham wore some really cute clothes that revealed her broad ... "talent", so to speak. So, at least, it was a good movie to watch. <br /> <br /> By the way, the film ends with the phrase "may rest in FINAL peace" eventually, although this was not the last Hammer Dracula movie with Lee. He returned for "The Satanic Rites of Dracula" only a short time later and was in many ways even worse than this movie about a monster.
