There is something strange in the antisocial feeling that you can find in some Cheech and Chong materials. One of Up In Smoke's songs, well, I often want other songs to start that way. But in this excuse for a video, the stoner duo shows us videos of four songs from their current album, also called Get Out Of My Room. A voiceover is heard during the opening credits in which some anonymous producers describe the album as a novelty recording that will only occupy space on the charts. Unfortunately, this voiceover hits the nail right on the head. <br /> <br /> Most of the RIAA-approved music recordings seem to keep the rule of putting the best material at the beginning of the album. Often, when that first song is passed, the most demanding listener notices that the recording has little, if anything, to attract their attention. The bands that challenged the mainstream convention, on the other hand, often saved their best material last, or at least spread it evenly across the record. In this case, Cheech and Chong seem to have decided to cover their bets. The opening piece, Get Out Of My Room, is an exhilarating theme song with an incredibly bad video. Many viewers of a music video from the 1980s will find the approximate direction a little nostalgic. Cheech's conception of British punk is also incredibly fun. <br /> <br /> Where everything goes downhill is the second number, I'm Not Home Right Now. Nothing kills the interest in a song like repetition, and it's difficult to get more repetitions of this auditory asshole. Honestly, you feel the urge to slap Cheech in the face and tell him we have the idea, he's not home right now, so please move on. The next song, on the theme of love is a strange thing, is the absolute background not only for this collection, but for Cheech and Chong in general. It's almost as if this song was created for the sole reason of prolonging the album's running time. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the stoner duo saved the best for last, but it is also curious to note that Chong is completely absent from this cut. Born In East L.A. is a simple number based on the old issue of Bruce Springsteen that mocks Reagan's vision of multiculturalism. As one is imbued with the story of Cheech, one must ask how many poor possessed who could not speak a word of Spanish were deported to Mexico simply because their skin was not as white as the sheet. Racism was an integral part of American culture in 1985 and still is today. If anything, it got worse, so you have to wonder how Born in East LA would be if it were written in the current era. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, two cuts do not make an album, especially when there is a lot of boring filler between them. The interviews before Get Out Of My Room, for example, are quite funny. Don't smash the side like a lot of Up In Smoke, but fun enough to justify their existence. Unfortunately, the two middle songs are reflected in their movie. The boring song makes boring stucco. If you cut the average half hour of the material from this video, you would have something substantially better. <br /> <br /> I gave Get Out Of My Room a three out of ten. They are earned from the first and last video. I'm pretty sure the stars look at stuff like this today and wonder what they were thinking.
