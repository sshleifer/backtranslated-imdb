There was a lot going on about the stealing of material from other Carlos Mencia comics (Mr. Holness, excuse me). Hell, even before Joe Rogan had a bad blow with him on stage, I knew that Carlos Mensteala was stealing material from Cosby and Kinison and from a multitude of others. <br /> <br /> To compound the crime of his theft, he repeated these comic book genes play BADLY. <br /> <br /> And this is a crime that continues to perpetuate in this show. I'm sure the writers of the series have to share part of the blame - it must be difficult to write jokes day after day ... but that's why people get paid so much they did it! These series scriptwriters must return to their day job of spilling burgers or whatever they were doing before they decided to pursue a career in intellectual theft. <br /> <br /> Don't say it steals all its material. You can tell when he came up with a joke by himself when what you're watching transcends the ill-fated and goes straight into the horribly bad territory. <br /> <br /> Because he likes to call people b *** h in his show, ten-year-olds call him a genius. They will grow up one of these days, Carlos, and when they do, they will dry you and blow you up.
