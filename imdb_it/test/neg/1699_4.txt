If you are a Catalan national-anarchist-nationalist with an undying reverence for the mythologies of the Spanish republic, this film could be for you. Two brothers, those of real life (one of them is Marc Recha himself), recall a fictitious version of a journey into real life they had made through the spectacular Catalan countryside, and the story is evoked (pots of walls pierced by bullets, artillery raises the soundtrack) but not shown. There is very little dialogue, and most of it is incidental: the story is told in a third-person voiceover, the voice is that of an actress who plays the real life sister of real life brothers. The images have little to do with the plot that exists, which is not much. Many are amazing and threatening pans on the rigid semi-arid mountains and rivers (think of Terrence Malick or Gus Van Sant - there is not a bit of both "Gerry" and "Last Days" here), interspersed with some stunning images and still frames. These are the most appreciated within the superb natural sound environment of the film and without the boring narration or even the occasional background music (some quite good, some rather strange, but all free). The best of what this film has to say is said in these sequences, with their occasional inclusion, without comment, of power plants and dams. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the brothers is left somewhat imprecise and generic; an important character is a biting catfish, never shown. The more the director's anarcho-nationalist Catalan-nationalist commitments are suggested, the more the film's richest and unspoken message is subverted and the experience becomes more irritatingly narcissistic. Although the director told the NYFF screening that the film was conceived from the beginning with his third-person narrative, I would like to see a version of it without fiction or music and with only the natural soundtrack and the minimalist dialogue - the result could be more moving, and in any case would not be much less puzzling. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, this is most likely the only film you will see this year when a boy enters the frame with a cloth object (the swimsuit he was wearing?) hanging from his penis . This is one of the few moments of the whole movie in which your interest is (I'm sorry) aroused by something that is really happening on the screen (what is it? Why is it hanging there?), But, as usual, they don't come provided answers. Very Warholian, very sixties, and not a little boring.
