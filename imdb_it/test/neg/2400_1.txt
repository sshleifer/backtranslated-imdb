The directors neglected to link the points - that is, the sequence of events and choices that led from Charlie Wilson and the anti-Soviet mujaheddin to Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden and finally to September 11th. The directors obviously don't tell us the background - why were the Soviets in Afghanistan? - but that omission pales in comparison to their inability to reveal that support for Islamic extremists in Afghanistan in the name of rabid anti-communism eventually strengthened the hand of anti-Western forces and contributed decisively to the chaos we find ourselves today ( 9 September, terrorist networks, a prolonged land war in Afghanistan, etc.). Since these consequences are not stated, the film leaves the viewer sympathetic to Mr. Wilson (hey, look at his latest projects on the Internet) instead of seeing him as an individual whose actions were contrary to the best interests of his country and the West in his together.
