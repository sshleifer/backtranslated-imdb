Intended as light entertainment, this film really succeeds as such during its first semester, but then succumbs to a rapidly rising script that lets it fall. Harry (Judd Nelson), a "reformed" thief, and Daphne (Gina Gershon), an aspiring actress, are employed as live window mannequins in a department store where they are late starting late and locked up inside , to which they observe, from their point of observation of the non-protective glass, an apparent murder that occurs in the street. The apparent murderer, Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local sculptor, returns the following day to observe the mannequins because he realizes that they are the only witnesses of the violent event of the night before and, when one of the two poses " moves, "the fun begins Daphne and Harry report their observations to a local police station, but when the detective who takes up a crime report recalls Harry's criminal past, he becomes cynical. There are many ways in which a film can become commonplace, and this is able to use most of it, including a mandatory slow-motion bedroom scene. A low-budget affair fired in Vancouver, even the procedural aspects of the police are displayed by heart. Gershon, always capable, tries to do something about his role, but Mancuso is incredibly histrionic, bizarrely, while attacking his lines with an obvious lapel. Although the film doesn't make sense, director of photography Glen MacPherson prefers not to follow the example, as he installs himself with the camera and turns on some beautifully crafted compositions on which a spectator can concentrate ignoring the holes of the plot and the spiritless dialogue . A well crafted score, appropriately based on action, is provided by Hal Beckett. The above dialogue is initially a bit new and jokingly distributed by Nelson and Gershon, but in a subsequent context of imperfect continuity and logic, predictability takes over. The direction reflects a lack of original ideas or points of view, and post-production imperfections bring the work back further than one would expect from a basic thriller.
