The only good part of this film was the end. Get to know the part of the movie where the lights come on and you leave to go home. No no, it might be a bit harsh - the dance in the film was sensational, but unfortunately that's where the plot ends. As long as the cast danced and no one spoke, the film was fine. As for Chayanne's debut - not bad, but I hope his next film has a little more depth. As for watching the movie, wait for the rental or TV. Don't make the same mistake I made and pay 8.50
