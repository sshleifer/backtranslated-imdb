I haven't laughed so much in a theater for years. The only problem is that it was not the intention of the film to break the throat with laughter. <br /> <br /> This film is absolutely overflowing with CGI villains, absolutely terrible duos, absolutely terrible * acting *, and enough geeky references to make the whole thing nothing but a complete cheese. <br /> <br /> As a gamer and geeky girl, I recognized all the obvious game references in this film as well as STUFF geek that was just thrown into the background as an eye candy (the Steamboy poster, thinkgeek.com and j-list.com t-shirts, and that hasn't redeemed the movie at all. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have been good to EVERYBODY was that the ghost children wrote characters that had been intentionally hurt in CGI to make it look like they were a game, and that they were OBVIOUSLY stolen from Japanese horror movies. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it was hilariously ugly, and something I would expect from a midnight screening of a quality B Sci-Fi channel made for TV movies. Don't expect more and you'll have a great time. Just don't take a drink or spit it all over when you get big sentences like: "Why did you bring that game into our lives? WHY?!"
