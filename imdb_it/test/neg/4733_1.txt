Where to start? I think that only three other films led me to publish a review on IMDb, and all were positive. What about this ...? <br /> <br /> Mind-blowingly, horribly, tragically, embarrassing, catastrophically, stupidly, irritatingly, completely and utterly beyond horrible. <br /> <br /> I am STONNATO this was done, no matter given a theatrical release. I think I'm literally in shock. <br /> <br /> They are not "snobs". I did not expect a beautiful film or a depth of intense character, but this is really beyond a joke. We simply need to ask more from the movies we see. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Like the black death.
