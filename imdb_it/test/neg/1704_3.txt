This film, if done correctly, has a lot of potential. Parody movies are always fun, and people tend to like them because they are carefree, stupid and silly but funny. This movie was fun in some parts, but it could have been a lot more fun. The acting itself was OK by all the actors, but ... I wasn't satisfied. It seemed a bit empty, and my summary title says it all about the effects. The correct green screens were not used for this movie ... backgrounds were added as a result of which they seemed just terrible. No wonder this movie went directly to the DVD lol. It wasn't ALL a total loss, it's fun and it will make you laugh (AT, not WITH most of the time).
