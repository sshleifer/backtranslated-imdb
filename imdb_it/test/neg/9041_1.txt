*** SPOILERS *** This film, called EATEN ALIVE here in the UK, is probably the worst movie ever made and is brilliant for that alone. A rich and sexy girl joins a strong man of action to look for her sister in the jungle of New Guinea. What follows is an indescribable mixture of cannibalism, crazy cults and religious maniacs that must be seen to be believed. The cannibalism scenes are quite terrifying, but they are so poorly interpreted and played that they prove rather amusing. The cast is terrible, except for Janet Agren as the female lead who is excellent. Look for the scene where she is stripped naked and covered in gold paint! My rating - 1 in 10.
