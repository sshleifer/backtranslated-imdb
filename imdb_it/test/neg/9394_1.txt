This is just another one of those "American romance with a fascinating stranger in exotic European settings". This genre has been cinematically bankrupt since the 1950s, yet they continue to churn them out. I let my girlfriend call me to see this - bad idea, we both hated it. If all you want to see is Tuscany, try looking at "Stealing Beauty" with Liv Tyler - a marginally better film. <br /> <br /> This genre film genre is very Hallmark Greeting Card-ish.
