OK ... this MAY contain spoilers ... but who really cares? Not, if you appreciate the seconds of your life, waste your time in this pile of garbage. There is no redeemable quality in this film ... and I say this as a complete fan of holiday movie series. I loved the character of Cousin Eddie from the other Vacation movies ... but it only works well as a support character. Do I blame Randy Quaid for the failure of this movie? Not at all. I think he is a great actor ... but this film lacks cohesion ... the rhythm is off ... it's simply banal. And the actor who plays the "Third" ... Jake Thomas ... it was simply horrible, more than probably due to a real lack of direction. I don't know why ... but his whole character scared me. <br /> <br /> Some say this is a horrible film because Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are not there ... It has nothing to do with that. The script, the direction, the acting ... the special effects ... everything is a train disaster. With orphans. And the kittens. Oh ... and the train has also run over some old ones. <br /> <br /> Please, whatever you do ... stay away from this dirt! I call it dirty because it dirty the name of the franchise for the holidays.
