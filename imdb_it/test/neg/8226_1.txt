I have no qualms about how the movie does NOT capture New Jersey (like Zach, I come from there). Beautiful. Everything. I lived there long enough. I don't need to see a movie that captures the state of the Garden. <br /> <br /> What bothers me is how bad this movie is. Let's make it easy for you. We will use some bullet points. There are probably some spoilers that follow. (Not that you wouldn't be able to predict the ANYWAY movie): <br /> <br /> - The musical location was forcibly forced and condescending. Example: great: "What are you listening to?" Sam: "The Shins. Have you ever heard of it?" "No." "Listen to this song: it will change your life!" And then they keep playing that Shins song that was in a McDonalds commercial. (You don't like it when the characters in a movie tell you openly - the viewer - how to react to something? I love it! Hey, they should have put subtitles during the various scenes that taught us to "chuckle", "Say 'aaaaaw" " "cry" "feel inspired" etc.) <br /> <br /> - The scenes were MUCH BAD. SO Cliche. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example: the whole movie, but no, really, example: I'm in the rainy quarry nearby to the ark. Big jumps - in the pouring rain (oh it's so TANGED!) - on top of a piece of heavy machinery and SCREAM! Oh how it moves! But wait! Here comes Sam and his friend (the annoying drug addict ), and ALL SCREAM !!!! BUT WAIT !!!! MY GOD !!!! Here comes! YOU KISS !!! LONG, DEEP !!!! IN THE RAIN !!!!!!!! <br / > <br /> - The dialogue was SO BAD - SO Cliche - SO MELODRAMATIC - Example: They will leave the ark and Sam says something like, "Hey, good luck exploring the infinite abyss." And the guy answers, "Also T u. "Oh ... Oh my! I never understood ... could it be? Oh my God it is! Large's life is like ... ohmigod ... AN INFINITE ABYSS !! Another example: Large and Sam at the airport. Sam says something like, "Is this goodbye?" Not enough for you? OK, Largeman says something like, "This is not a period at the end of the sentence ... it's an ellipse." And guess what happens when he tries to walk down the seaplane and return to his life in Los Angeles. You know what? Don't guess It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> - This is a Grade Z Wes Anderson review film. When he is not busy being melodramatic and clich√©, the film spends many times with crazy and extravagant characters. Hey, Sam's brother ... thanks Zach Braff for including it, because it made the movie much more structured. Also ripping off from Anderson: dialogue. Scene: Sam and Largeman are in a bar. In walks friends, "Vagina!" one of them says. Then they see him sitting with Sam, so one of his friends says "Sorry if I said the vagina". And Sam says "It's all right". <br /> <br /> - Inventive cinematography is not inventive but useless and annoying. Give me a break with the acceleration / slowdown of the movie. Once again, Wes Anderson does it effectively in his films. And it was done well in "Donnie Darko". But really, it was useless. Wow. A crazy party where people are taking X and snorting cola. Better unroll all the tricks! <br /> <br /> - You can count the good moments on one side (even if you miss your fingers). This is what makes SIN ALSO. The late quarterback thing ... well, that was good! The small thing that he (feature film) says as they are about to enter the quarry (something about turpentine) ... it was nice! Oh wait, that's all. <br /> <br /> You know, Zach Braff is, I think, always a little too cute. But it's nice. But, man, this is forced, pretentious, melodramatic (have you already got it?), Excessively cute, excessively everything. This movie is terrible. Apparently, they are outnumbered, given that this waste of time is currently estimated at 8.0. <br /> <br /> Please, however, if you are looking for something truly touching and subtle and unique. NOT. RENTAL. THIS. MOVIE.
