Okay, if you discount the value of the production, the ugly clothes and the big hair, this adaptation is still much lower than the 90s version. First Ann Firbank (playing Anne Elliot), she's literally over ten years old to play this role and her acting leaves much to be desired. Amanda Root (who plays the same role in the 90s version) can express more in her big brown eyes than Firbank can with all her face in a four-hour production. Anne turns into an angry, whining and boring character (and what was in the scene during the "long walk" in which she stops to launch poems?). Henrietta and Louisa looked so similar that the only time I could tell them apart was when they were close to each other (Henrietta was taller). And Louisa! There has never been a more hateful character! It was ridiculous to think that Wentworth should have been interested in her. She should be lively and pretty and charming, not stupid and silly with her ridiculous laugh that is like nails on a blackboard. When he starts singing, "to Lyme, to Lyme, to Lyme," I started screaming, "shut up, shut up, shut up!" The best part of the film was when Louisa dropped those three feet to the cobb because I knew I wouldn't have to see her in the movie again. Speaking of the fall in the Cobb scene; it was the silent scene misinterpreted, misdirected and edited throughout the film. How does a person fall down three feet, land on his feet, and still faint? <br /> <br /> In the positive dimension, the character of Elizabeth was much closer to the book than in the 90s version. They also included many other scenes with Anne and Frederick at the end. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I bought this movie, even though I knew how comparable it was, but I'm a great Austen fan, so I'll buy any movie adapted from one of his novels. Look at this move if you are morbidly curious or if you value the 90s version even more. The bottom line is that this version could follow the letter of the novel, but the 90s version follows the spirit.
