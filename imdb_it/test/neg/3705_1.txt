This film is, in all likelihood, the worst movie ever made. It's certainly the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen VERY bad movies. <br /> <br /> In this, none of what is interesting happens during the film. You could literally start the movie, take a short nap and then wake up knowing that nothing interesting happened while you were sleeping. And I've seen this movie three times, staying awake all the time. I feel I should be congratulated. <br /> <br /> The film goes as one would expect, according to a formula, without variations. The hunters capture the baby's bigfoot, are killed by their parents, and the neighboring city ends in a murderous frenzy. This is surprisingly boring for a version of Troma. <br /> <br /> So please do yourself a favor and skip this movie. If you have to see it you will understand why.
