The girls could be nicer if you are their escort or a spectator of $ #! +. What I'm saying is that it will take special circumstances for a non-effort reaction to this effort. The delivery of many lines seems to be strangely unnatural for some actors. Even lighting seems to be a problem, even if the wrong view could have represented my frequent squint. And if you watch this movie, be open enough to accept elements that no zoo or circus would reject: it's the creatures above and below ground that feast on dozens of campers near an empty Louisiana building. This is the discovery of a trio that is sent by their printed media to investigate the deaths. Then, two of THEM disappear and the survivor is part of another trio who embarks on the hunt. Eureka! I just realized what one of those "special circumstances" above would have been: unconsciousness.
