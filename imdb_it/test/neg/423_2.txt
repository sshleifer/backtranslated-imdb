I think I probably won't hate this movie if you speak Polish. I selected the English version at the first menu, but it gave me the Polish dialogue with English subtitles, just like the Polish version. Perhaps the dialogue was so disconnected because the person who did the subtitles failed to translate it into English very well. To exacerbate the problem, some of the dialogues had no subtitles at all. The acting was pretty ugly, especially the female lead, who was melodramatic about everything! One scene that bothered me was when a German woman was caught stealing and while the crowd was pushing her around, her shirt opened and the director showed close-ups of her naked breast for the next 15-20 seconds. I couldn't see how her breasts added to the drama of the scene or the movie. Perhaps the director was trying to increase the number of teenage boys in the audience. Much of the film takes place in an extermination camp set free by the Americans. First, the "American" uniforms in no way resembled the uniforms of the US Army. Second, none of the extermination camps in Poland was freed by the Americans. I would think that a Polish director who turned 19 in 1945 would have known better than an American born in 1966 that all six death camps were freed by the Russians. All in all, it's not a very good film if you don't speak Polish.
