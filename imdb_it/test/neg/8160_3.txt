"San Francisco, oh wonderfully desolate city, thank you, God, for having destroyed it, and by dropping bricks on our collective heads, and for dropping into oblivion tens of thousands of Your innocent and obedient sheep, or Lord, that you are so merciful in your heavenly ways ... "These were to be the lyrics of the title song of this film so irresistible and utterly lacking in intelligence. <br /> <br /> The film starts quite well, with Gable discovering a Cinderella with a very annoying but very appreciated operatic voice, and soon shoots at the celebrity. One of the many problems with our Cinderella is that it is played by Jeanette MacDonald, who, if one "takes the time" to look at all that make-up and the glitz facade of the 1930s, realizes that it's kind of ugly. Too bad to play this role, anyway. Yet Gable and all the others do the fancy here as if it were a damn beauty or something. Another problem with Cinderella is that her character is so deeply humble, healthy, innocent, lover of God, kind and generous - enough to make you vomit for a whole hour. MacDonald plays his role (certainly one-dimensional) with the type of "ahhh", "oh" and "ooh" which serves to annoy rather than to make it inclusive. <br /> <br /> Tracy was better, and had better roles, rather than playing this evil priest, heart of gold, lover of God and not child molester (staging in his "free time" - as if the priests had something to do - how nice). Even the always reliable Gable is not up to its usual standard; it's too animated, and his character is too selfless for someone who should be an ambitious western "villain" (although this is obviously the fault of the script). <br /> <br /> The plot is basically this: Gable and his rival Holt play ping-pong with Cinderella - using it as a ball. Such as? Well, first he's working (singing) for Gable, then he works for the Holt square, then back to Gable, only to return to Holt very soon. (And, of course, both of them want to have her as a girlfriend / wife.) And if the earthquake hadn't interrupted this ping-pong plot, it's a sure bet that it would have bounced back and forth ten more times, the cheesy little princess she is. <br /> <br /> There are many, too many, in fact, musical numbers. It's almost like they're trying to make the first "film-and-disaster" ever. How stupid. The things he sings in Gable's "joint" are fine, but when he starts humming those high-pitched, annoying cries during segments of the opera, that's when I heard that my ears were unjustifiably and unfairly attacked by the fire of sound enemy. In fact, there is a work number that lasts 6 minutes DAMN. 6 may seem little for those who have not experienced Vietoperanam first hand with such horrors of audio torture, but it's like with the dog years; a dog's year equals seven human ones. One minute of work equals 100 minutes of Chinese torture (or a dog urinating acid in one leg). <br /> <br /> I thought it was a catastrophic film, but it is more like an almost disastrous movie. (I read that some of the dialogues in this film were written by SILEN-ERA FILM DIRECTOR, Jesus ...) The melodramatic, and only occasionally funny, was interrupted by the real star of this film (ie the earthquake), only after well over an hour and a half. When Joe's earthquake finally shakes the city, and our characters clich√©, I almost heard "Thank God, death and destruction are finally here!" Unfortunately, Joe arrives too late in the film to save him from his growing mediocrity; the devastation scenes are very good, but even the part of the film's earthquake is ruined by a highly annoying and religious ending. See, Gable, who professes to be an atheist all the time (without actually using the word itself), finally finds MacDonald alive - after searching for days - and suddenly he becomes a believer because Cinderella is alive? !! What a fool! All he tells me is that the character of Gable is a deficient moron. <br /> <br /> The film ends with a very stupid note, in fact. Gable, after saying "thank you" to God for having "saved" his girlfriend (and gets on his knees) "finds" God (sees the light), and the little devil Gable of the film becomes a believer. How is it that an American who really feared God? <br /> <br /> Of course, no one thought to ask this "God" why the hell there was an earthquake in the first place! The sad and involuntary irony is that Gable eventually becomes a "sucker"; he had always made fun of the "suckers" who fall for the most awkward fraud of all of them - that is to say religion - and in the end he himself becomes one. This is what I call a triumph of the human spirit! Another irony is that the ending should have improved Gable as a person, but I see it very differently; on the contrary: just one big Joe was enough to turn Gable into a God-fearing, meek, small, obedient believer - who joins the world's sheep family. And as if this intellectual fall of Gable was not enough pathetic and disappointing, this first "musical earthquake" will end with a real chorus of mass (take this word as you prefer), noble and of a wonderful beauty scene: dozens (or hundreds) of earthquake survivors and proud, proud citizens of Frisco spontaneously (or perhaps "God" perhaps organized it?) sing the title song together in the hope of a better, brighter future without Joe. Hallelujah! If you're a "sucker" for Hollywood sentimentality, don't skip this movie.
