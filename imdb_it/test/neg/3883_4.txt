I saw it with great expectations. Come on, it's Akshay Kumar, Govinda and Paresh Rawal, who are all incredible in their comedy, I was really hoping for a laugh of laughter. Unfortunately, that's not what I got ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, nothing in this movie really made me laugh out loud. There were times when I giggled at one or two things, but nothing really made me laugh. In short, it was a poorly proven comedy and, in a sense, a bit of a Hera Pheri aspirant. <br /> <br /> Of the three main boys, I think the role of Paresh Rawal was the most powerful. It wasn't the most important role, but it certainly stood out more than Govinda or Akshay. Their performances were fine, I think. Nothing special, just mediocre. Although Govinda has stolen the limelight in Akshay in more than a few scenes. Lara Dutta and Tanushree Dutta also make appearances in this film, and both were pretty mean. The role of Lara didn't move me, or made me laugh, and the character of Tanushree Dutta just made my nerves! Music seems to be the only good thing about Bhagam Bhag. My favorite song is "Tere Bin", followed by "Afreen", which I really liked. "Signal" and the song of the title "Bhagam Bhag" are also worth listening to. <br /> <br /> You will like it or not. And judging by the poor comedy and lack of direction, I don't think you will.
