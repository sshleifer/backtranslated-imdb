This film should be called adventures in Cinemascope. It is as if the screenwriter and director considered page 3 of Cliff's Notes and decided that it would be a great vehicle for a film about the Italian Alps. Rock Hudson is pretty good here, but the dialogue doesn't look like Hemingway at all. This is a composed version of Hemingway. Hecht, the screenwriter, is a hack. See the 1932 version with Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. This is a great cinema and was made by someone who understood Hemingway and the war in Northern Italy. Gary Cooper is very, very good compared to his performance in For those who ring the bell where he is rigid as a board and thinks he is in a western. <br /> <br /> However, if you are a Hemingway fan, do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. The best solution is to get the full audio CD and listen to only one of the greatest novels ever written.
