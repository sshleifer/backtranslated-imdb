Tedium as only the French can do it. I checked the clock for the first time in 7 minutes and, 143 minutes from the end, I even thought about going out. I will not even try to discuss the inconsistency of the "plot" or the inability of the characters to be pleasant because at about 1 hour away, I realized that none of this was important. It was not simply self-indulgent or pretentious, it was a void. An emptiness that sucks the soul. This film has no saving grace, no pleasant character, nothing funny, and nothing sad. It's not smart enough to be dramatic and there's no time for it to be a little farcical. The most intriguing thing about this film is how he managed to get positive and positive reviews. I've been deceived by those reviews, but you don't have to be, gentle reader. All I want for Christmas is my three hours back.
