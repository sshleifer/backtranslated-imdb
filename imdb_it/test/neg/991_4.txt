Since their entire career was a pale imitation of The Beatles, it is not surprising that, shortly after the great Beatles "Magical Mystery Tour" fiasco, the Monkees would follow their insipid and creative throb of a movie called "Chief." Both films are not so much a true story with a plot (even if MMT has tried to define a plot) as they are a mixture of sketches and fragments, interspersed with music, songs and out-takes. <br /> <br /> "Head" has no plot, apart from the pre-fab-four which tries to free itself from the "box" in which they are (ie the type of casting of "Monkees" and the surrounding mercantilism) and yet, being always in the box again. Most of the scenes involve pauses in the "fourth wall" and intersect in other seemingly unrelated scenes. Filled with anti-Vietnam war messages and attempts by the group to showcase their other talents, the film bounces at random - even to be blamed on multiple directors. <br /> <br /> The film, like Magical Mystery Tour, is now excused by some fans as "wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic claims". Phooey. As an MMT, there are too many kids with access to too many drugs all trying to do something artistic and suck. <br /> <br /> As MMT, "Head" has some clever moments and offers some relatively unknown Monkees songs that are pretty decent. It develops a bit more charm than MMT and is a little easier to seduce, but it's not ironic at all, like all the rest of the Monkees, it was just a mimic of something the Beatles did first ... even when it's about laying an egg.
