Lou Gossett, Jr. is an excellent and captivating actor, but to make him take on the role of "president" and then have him play as if he were James Bond, run around carrying a gun and enter a warehouse to discover a plot to kill the Christians, and therefore being able to escape the alleged High Security Facility to live another day, does not do it justice - this film has so many unsolved problems <br /> <br /> I will try to list just a few: <br /> <br /> 1 - what was the purpose of "accumulating" a vaccine if no one is vaccinated? - for example, the preacher could have been vaccinated if the "tribulation force" already had the vaccine on hand - later, Buck Williams' wife will go to stay with the sick preacher and she will get sick herself; therefore, was the virus contagious? - If it was contagious, then why did Ray and his wife go to church without adequate protection? - Why didn't they get sick too? - and when Chloe drank the wine and "healed", how did she suddenly know that the wine was the "antidote"? - Was it California wine, normal red table wine? - would red grape juice have been adequate? and if the preacher had received the "communion" at least every time he preached, perhaps he would have already had an antidote flowing through his body? - Buck and Chloe have a "heavy" vaccine box that has never been used - what mysterious message should we see in this? <br /> <br /> 2 - The presentation of the "bad" forces that are working with the Anti-Cristo Nicolai to destroy the world, such as Russian, Chinese, etc., is indeed a relic of the 50s and the Early years The James Bond era and shows an Ignorance of modern society and humanity - should we believe that Russians and Chinese are continually trying to destroy this planet? - and for what purpose, mere destruction? - this was such a narrow view of this world and was so cliche to be ridiculous <br /> <br /> 3 - the main purpose of this film was the scene near the end where Kirk Cameron and Lou Gossett, Jr. are doing proselytism to non-believers in the public (showing Kirk proselytizing Lou) - it was a film with no significant plot, too many disconnected with reality and a completely inappropriate plot for a great actor <br /> <br /> Therefore, classify this as 1, since Zero is not available
