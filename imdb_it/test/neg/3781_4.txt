It is really easy to toast, roast, bark and otherwise burn this film for all its abundant flaws. It was created by high school students and teachers and an entire community; exhibition! Of course, I could look at the script which is simply ridiculous. A monster created by the garbage of a growing Californian city begins to eat garbage and to take garbage cans throughout the city. Soon this huge beast with wings begins to destroy buildings and even recite the "beauty and the beast" act with a young high school girl. Fortunately for her there is a gang of boys, her ex-boyfriend nicknamed "The penguin" and the drunken city to help her. The direction is terrible, the production values ​​are simply terrible, the acting non-existent and the slow rhythm. The film is difficult to sit - period. However, having said that, it is also a miracle of a film when it is considered that this thing was done by an entire community. You can see all the collective efforts of the actors, the actual mayor and the fire brigade and the actual policemen, at the location shots used in the area. I was also very surprised by all the local companies that contributed to the financing of the film, contributing in some way to the film. When you look at the film from that perspective, it's really a result. I knew nothing about it before sitting down and watching it. Now that I've discovered something about it, I'm impressed. But don't make mistakes - I don't ... NO ... I want to sit down again.
