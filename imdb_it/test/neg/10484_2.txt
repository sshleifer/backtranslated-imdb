When a government experiment rocket on the effects of cosmic rays on animals crashes in a small Texas town, people start dying. The county sheriff tries to investigate, but is hampered in his efforts by other government officials. It turns out that there is a mutant space gorilla on teenagers who kill free in the woods. <br /> <br /> I like cheap sci-fi and horror movies. I like monster movies. So I thought there would be a good chance I liked this movie. Unfortunately I didn't. <br /> <br /> I don't care about bad acting, the banal dialogue, the atrocious musical score or the gigantic holes in the plot of this film. There are many movies that have the same problems that I've seen and appreciated in such a bad way that it's good. <br /> <br /> But where the other guys of that type and Night Fright differ is that Night Fright is just a terrible rhythm. And drag on this. There are scenes that go on and on without anything happening: the search in the woods for clues is just people walking in the forest for a long time; there are several teenagers who seemingly dance endlessly at a party in the woods ... but nothing interesting is happening. If these scenes were shorter, the film might not have been boring (although I don't think that simply cutting those scenes would save this). <br /> <br /> Now I have given this movie three views to make sure I gave it a chance before slamming it into this review. Unfortunately, it got worse with every watch. There will not be a quarter.
