This film would like to be the kind of shocking, cerebral and intense film that many others of its kind have been successful, but it is not. It is at best confusing and absurd. When the turns were finally revealed, rather than saying "Ah, I understand!" I muttered something along the lines of "Okay ... whatever." In my opinion, when a film reveals a turning point in the main storyline, it should not be necessary to use a flashback sequence to show that it has provided some suggestions that would allow the viewer to discern the truth by itself. But this film has a flashback; and here's the kicker: go back to seeing scenes that weren't even in the movie! <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotyped, obnoxious and completely ridiculous. I feel that the "steaming" love scenes between the romantic protagonists were the most disturbing and heady I've ever played in a film that wasn't pornographic. It seems that the director was going to be shocking and extravagant with love scenes, but they were really just stupid. <br /> <br /> And don't even start with lousy accents and second-rate sets. I imagine the film was set in New Orleans, but apart from the aforementioned hints and a couple of shots of the city the film could have been in Anytown, in the United States. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: do not disturb yourself!
