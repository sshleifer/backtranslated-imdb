The innocent virgin Indri finds herself in a prostitution house run by a ruthless exploiter MG. Indri ends up incarcerated in MG's private prison after she refuses to make love with him. Obviously, Indri and the top of the world Helga join forces and plan to escape. Maman Firmansyah's joke, uninspired direction, and Piet Burnama's boring, talking script deeply undermine any sloppy vitality this film needs to qualify as a pleasant piece of junk unbridled behind bars: the slow rhythm painfully drags everything , there is no free female nudity Whatever (girls don't show any skin during the mandatory group shower scene!), the expected torture and degradation are both extremely docile and lukewarm, even the moderate crummy gag fails to impress, and even a ridiculous catfight sequence is nothing to get excited about. The pedestrian cinematography of Thomas Susanto, the ridiculous dubbing, the excruciating 102-minute duration, the haggard soundtrack and the soundtrack by Gatot Sudarto add further insult to the already frightening damage. Only a few decent unblocking action on the last reel offers some relief from the irresistible tedium of excessive abundance. A real yawn to yawn.
