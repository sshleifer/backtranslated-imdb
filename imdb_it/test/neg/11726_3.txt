Terrible in a completely new way, ANY BUT LOVE probably should be seen by movie buffs - at least as a precautionary measure that demonstrates everything that can go wrong with a production of "vanity". I'm guessing a production of vanity, since there is no other reason on the green earth of God to be launched as a non-singer / actress without talent and not particularly attractive as Isabel Gold in the role of female lead - still competed by artists the likes of "spectators" like Cameron Bancroft and Andrew McCarthy - except that he also helped write this bizarre little film. His singing leaves a lot to be desired, and yet, as incredible as it is, all the other characters in the film think it is fantastic. There are some moments of real charm or humor here, but VERY few. Otherwise it is a foolish and sad fiasco that turns from the numbers to paint the wrong numbers. You know how it is when people look at a piece of modern art and someone says, "My son could do better than this!" Well, this is a movie, one that your child or anyone else could do better.
