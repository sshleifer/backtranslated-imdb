I can't believe I actually bought this movie! It sucks! ... Where I live Mexican films Mexican films are never advertised, or even available ... you don't find them in normal rental locations ... so I had to buy it ... I really like Mexican movies! They bring me closer to my roots and my people, and they are very different from what you normally are used to ... but this was predictable !!! You could guess what would have happened ... It's not a horrible movie! It wasn't worth what I paid for it! jaja ... but if you have time and you're really bored, then you should watch it ... but if you love Mexican films, and you love the theater itself, then not watching it will be painful! lol
