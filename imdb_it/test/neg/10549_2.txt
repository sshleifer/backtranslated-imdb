The Toxic Avenger, Part II begins with the surprising revelation that after the Toxic Aveneger (John Altamura who was apparently fired during production and replaced with Ron Fazio) he freed Tromaville of his hometown from the evil that actually became a nice place to live in. This meant that Toxie no longer had any use as a superhero and now suffers from depression and a feeling of utter worthlessness (just as directors Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz should feel after making it), Toxie now works as a porter in the center of Tromaville for the blind '. It is not long before the problems raise the head, however, it is a bad chemical company called Apocalypse Inc. that plans to take Tromaville for some meaningless or other reason, but to do so they need to get rid of Toxie. After the evil president's (Rick Collins) close-up fails, he corrupts Toxie's psychiatrist (Erika Schickel) to tell him to go to Japan and see his father. Leaving his girlfriend Claire (Phoebe Legere), his mother (Jessica Dublin) and his home behind Toxie, he heads to Tokyo, Japan. Once Toxie decides to find his father and a woman named Masami (Mayako Katsuragi) he helps him in his quest. Meanwhile, in Tromaville Apocalypse Inc. we move to kill and without Toxie the citizens are powerless to defend themselves. Toxie eventually finds Big Mac Bunko (Rikiya Yasuoka) who has been led to believe that he is his father, however Big Mac is part of Apocalypse Inc. he plans to destroy Toxie once and for all ... <br /> <br / > Produced and directed by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz, the sequel to the fortunate The Toxic Avenger (1985) shows that the first film was a complete stroke of luck, a fortunate accident to combine the right mix of bad comedy, outrageous violence and so bad The Toxic Avenger movie, part II, is a whole lot of shit in comparison. The screenplay by Kaufman, Phil Rivio and Gay Partington Terry with a load of "additional material" credits does not contain a single funny moment during his entire 102-year span. The visual gags are terrible, Toxie walking through Tokyo with a wig and glasses to camouflage herself, for example, or a scene where she warms up a bathroom with a bad boy and while cooking Toxie she throws in a load of vegetables and spaghetti, a scene in which he puts electric wires on a woman's nose, he sticks an antenna on his head and a microphone in his mouth to which a Japanese radio announcer speaks, a bit where a bad Japanese has his nose burnt in the shape of a fish, a little where Toxie grabs a swordfish head and uses it as a weapon, or the embarrassing bad exaggeration and stupid idiotic facial expressions, a literary boy has a fish for a head and becomes a literary turned into sushi, the horrible comedy and sound music effects and the whole film in general is a pale imitation of what made the original slightly fun and memorable. The gags of bad taste are not there this time and also the stupid juvenile childish humor of the first is missing, it seems a real step back from the original and let's not forget that this is Troma here, so it is definitely a bad thing. There are some bloody fights and a bit of blood and violence, at least in the apparently uncut 102 minutes I saw, heads crushed with bodies that emitted blood, smashed faces, intestines, roses struck in some eyes and thorns wrapped around the throat , torn ears, severed arms and a very graphic and bloody scene of a man being cut into pieces. Unfortunately the special effects of Pericles Lewnes are not particularly convincing and come mostly within the first twenty minutes or so. The acting is of embarrassing proportions, as I have already said. As for the action, there is an ultra-cheap looking car chase at the end and some uninspiring and lackluster fights that use ninja cardboard throwing stars at some point. As for the horror, there is nothing apart from a few fragments of blood. As for comedy, this is very unpleasant. In fact The Toxic Avenger, Part II sucks on all levels and what's more it is also done atrociously, most of the cast seems to be people torn from the nearest street corner, continuity does not exist, cinematography is the point base and shoot and the special effects are anything but. One or two bloody scenes apart from this is total and simple crap, do yourself a favor, look at the original again.
