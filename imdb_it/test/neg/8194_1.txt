While flipping through the channel I came to a channel 124. It is an urban canal. I saw this movie and decided to try it. I almost became a mass murderer because of this movie. I made movies at home and I am oscar quality compared to this huge mass of Dookies. The lighting was terrible and the acting was inexorable. I'd rather watch Star Crystal ....... Holy cow may not be a good example. The main question about this film is ... Was it supposed to be a morality film? the reason I ask is because there was a line in which this lady in a wheelchair says "I would have been another statistic of the band" Oh, my head is starting to hurt me. After hearing that sentence I went to the kitchen and pulled out a knife ready to stab anyone who dared to watch this movie. But a little sense started and I just changed the channel to see the man with the afro paint. Well, that's all I have to say about this movie. If you want to endure this pain go ahead but not recommended for those with short fuses or a negative case of tourettes
