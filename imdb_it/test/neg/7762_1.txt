Week after week these women wipe out all the men on their feet. Come back down to earth. None of these women is "Knockouts". Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) resembles the type of woman that men collect at !: 45am before the bar closes after their vision and standards were equally damaged by ten or eleven martinis. Yet she is the queen bee, a super sexy man killer. The other three are not much better. And their constant open-mouthed comments ..... not to mention the fact that they jump in and out of bed with strange men and never take a disease. This show is pathetic and disturbing. I don't think any man would be terribly attracted to any of these women, even if he blew Viagra like Tic Tacs while on vacation.
