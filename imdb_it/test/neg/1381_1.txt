Besides the fact that this boy is a liar, he is also a total idiot and a thief in the comedy community. Once, when I tried to watch this excuse for a TV show, I think I actually put myself in the mouth a little. I can't help feeling a little more stupid every time I see one of his horrendous commercials while I'm enjoying the great central comedy programs like Reno 911 and the American body shop. Show like this that makes me worry about the continued existence of humanity. It's hard to believe that even Joe Rogan can make someone look like an idiot. Please start praying now that the central comedy will make its mistake and will end this show as soon as possible. Have we not suffered enough?
