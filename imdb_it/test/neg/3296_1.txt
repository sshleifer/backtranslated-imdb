A stupid show in the vein of the rest of them with terrible music and a laugh that must come from I Love Lucy. I got rid of the TV due to shows like this, but I took the first season in big games for $ 3.00. I should buy the Van Damme movie instead. <br /> <br /> If you were a conspiracy theorist, who believed that a small group of people are working against royal families and continue to invent this propaganda / propaganda to undermine the Valori family that I would like to show this show, Married With Children , Family Guy etc. but I'm not, I won't. <br /> <br /> BTW I'm not a Christian, I love the Simpsons and the Peep show. I saw two episodes and thought that if shows like this are popular, with whom are they popular? Then I remembered all those pictures of Walmart people that are circulating on the web and they thought ha ha! No wonder our culture is a joke around the world when this is the first evening.
