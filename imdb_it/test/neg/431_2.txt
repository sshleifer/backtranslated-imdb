This is a title in search of a film. It is a tone that seemed profitable for some study leaders and the rest is damned. When this film was made, there were still two things that CGI did not do well at all: people and fur. Furry people were therefore not meant to look good when they were rendered to the computer. This is the only example I can think of where the effects of a well-funded sequel have jumped far behind those of the original film. For the record, the werewolf design does not help a little. Apparently, the directors could not decide between the quadruple and the biped, they tried to do both and ended up with an equally awkward creature. The transformations are anatomically meaningless and the final result with a relatively high forehead and short muzzle seems to be a cross between Ron Perlman and a hyena. But back to the coarse part. This is a film that exists PURELY to cash in on its ancestor. I'm not a fan of the original Landis movie, but boy, it looks good in light of this. If you thought that some of Landis' humor was forced to try some of the terrible attempts here. The scene of chewing gum, the mood of the corpse, the dog that ... you know, you'll just have to look at you a little. Thomas Everett Scott is on vacation in Europe with friends and decides to take a break from acting the "ugly American" and bungee jumping from the Eifel tower in the middle of the night, which leads him to save a young woman (Delpy - Julie it's not worth just to become a star in America, ask Rutger Hauer) to jump to his death, and she turns out to be part of a cult of werewolves who are plotting for ... I'm not sure, something bad. stereotypes, gaping holes, a confusing ending, it doesn't matter, the studio was only worried that the title would fool millions of fans of the "American werewolf in London" in delivering their money. mistaken.
