Are you kidding me? The music was so strong in this show that I often couldn't even hear the dialogue. And the music was nothing exceptional. Does anyone know what Jake's mother said when he entered the door ??? And the mushroom cloud seemed close enough to have so little instant devastation. Anyone looking for the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this. I felt like a group of sit com actors were being sent to the scene and didn't know what to do with a dramatic dialogue. And what does a teenager in Kansas know about shopping in Soho ... couldn't we have a better line here? He was bored with tears and remained awake only by the screeching sound of the too-mixed way of loud music.
