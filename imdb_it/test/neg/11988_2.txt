I don't really care about the creative ideas put in these films, but seriously. There is no consistent part of the game in this film. This seems to be the trend, to buy the rights and then just make a movie that has nothing to do with what the fans want. This mess is almost fun because you know you're losing by hiding behind the lack of skill and control of money (not yours) that allows you to do it. Play a game, or hire someone to, and please make a real movie, or stay in the ring and have your ass delivered to you as you say it won't happen. <br /> <br /> wow, 9 lines of text and I'm done. I had to add blah to you, I'm sorry
