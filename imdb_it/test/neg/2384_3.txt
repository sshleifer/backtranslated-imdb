Marketing talks The cover of "The New Twenty", poster / home video, broadcasts a half-naked male in a "Wolfe video". For those who are familiar with gay-themed movies ?? this conveys a "must-see". (I enjoyed reading a reviewer (from another site) stating that they had been "tricked" into seeing a "Sodomite" movie. Are you serious? The slogan itself as the word "gay". The Lord gives you eyes, but not can you see ??) That said, despite the number of gay characters, stereotyped, no less (see: the solitary gay, the victim of gay AIDS and the closed gay) is more a long-term friendship and characters that grow to pieces. In reality, if anything, there is more (here is one for Christians to complain about) heterosexual couples who have sex outside, out of breath, marriage. Not to mention stabs in the back, drinking from excess and drug use. I see it more than a product for the TV-Logo or the Showtime film compared to the big screen. Of course, I loved cinematography, some actors could act and I always like to see a large group of friends who act like they've known each other for a million years. But we've already seen all this. Nothing really "new" here. Barely an original idea ?? so bringing back the same "old man" I have AIDS, let's face it "for most of the film and the boy, our friend has a serious drug problem, but don't face it until it's almost too late. It's so (respectably)" Queer as Folk "and" Broken Hearts Club ", respectfully. The film is about a group of university friends, now grown (not minded) who eventually have to grow up and everyone does their best while failing. Part of these independent films, the most interesting, at least for me, was the heaviest set, Ben He stole every scene, but again, there wasn't much to take.
