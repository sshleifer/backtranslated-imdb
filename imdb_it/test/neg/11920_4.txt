!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The premise is this: a shop is burned and the assistant Sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to take the conclusion to which Sergio agrees. br /> <br /> So far so good, but there's a lot of logic involved Sergio agrees to do this for the sum of $ 25,000, but why? Come on guys, if you were a handsome white man you run the risk of having a long time in a fierce prison (a real possibility of arson) for the sake of 25 thousand? I know I wouldn't, and since you have a criminal record, no employer would want to touch you with a barge pole, so $ 25,000 is so much for a life of workfare and wellness checks? There is also something else that seems to have gone unannounced from the premise, since Mister Lumpke told Sergio that his son made the fire seems not to know of the possibility that he may know too much. Wouldn't the alarm bells ring in your mind of someone who wants to keep you quiet if they told you something? <br /> <br /> I suppose we are not encouraged to think of such details since PYROMANIAC'S LOVE HISTORY is not a smart thriller, it's a romantic comedy with a tender heart / chick flick which is probably the thing best was the girls night. Looking through this page of comments it is obvious that the film has its defenders, but as a cynical male I was not too impressed and William Baldwin never exaggerated
