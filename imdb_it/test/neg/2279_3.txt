The director / screenwriter Allan Burns seems to have patched up two different screenplays together before he invented this little release: a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage. The result is an incredibly unpleasant film. Christine Lahti plays a cynical television journalist who befriends aerobics instructor Mary Tyler Moore and is about to have dinner with Moore and her family soon - only to find that Mary's husband (Ted Danson) is Lahti's secret affair ! Burns has a strange rhythm, stop-and-start to his dialogue that is neither realistic nor effective (only more and more annoying, because nothing seems to be said to be important). Moore skinny, with an alarming and fragile appearance in his body, has a radiant smile but does not convince as Danson's wife, and Danson remains stuck with an ungrateful and ungrateful role (he is there just to be a cad). The film attempts to cover all the bases in a classic case of overcoming (the role of women in the workplace, the television journalist, the cheating family man, the working wife and the mother who wants more, the need for a woman for female friendships, etc.), but nothing substantial comes out of these ideas since Burns only half-examines the problems. As a writer, he is surprisingly free from jokes, but he is also purposeless, and the heavy conspiracy is only fooled. * 1/2 from ****
