This is really one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. It's not funny at all. It simply depicts a lower-class northern British environment. I find it a very sad film in some parts, in other cases the cuts are where they shouldn't be. One thing that really annoyed me are the close-ups of useless objects that slowed the pace of the film. I did it only through the film because I speeded up some sequences towards the end. <br /> <br /> This film completely loses public attention. The main problem is that it makes more reasons for an action, which in turn tends to weaken that action. However, if there is a reason for an action, it makes it more passionate. All in all this film is everywhere. I haven't learned enough about the characters to worry about them because of the changing lines and stories of the plot in which I would have liked to explore a character's life. <br /> <br /> For example at the beginning the guy meets God in the bar, God looks like a cool guy. The film could have been processed at that time and I think it would have been a lot more fun. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enough if it is. Watch it if you want, but I warn you that this movie sucks. I respect the producers for trying to make it on such a low budget, but they could have done a much better job. I imagine that everything depends on the movement of the camera and the assembly, the acting was decent. But then again, this is just my opinion.
