I just finished watching this movie and I think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was so boring that I found myself zooming at X2 speed and finished in less than 30 minutes. I was not only disappointed, but angry because I had wasted my money on renting it. It ranks among the top five worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen thousands of movies! The plot was very confusing. If I had not first read the cover of the DVD case, before renting it, I would have been totally lost during this movie. I never thought that Tim Robbins, after making films like "Shawshank Redemption", would agree to appear in this film.
