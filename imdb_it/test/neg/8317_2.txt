I don't know what the neighborhoods are in which the people who wrote the enthusiastic reviews for this film live, but I'm glad I wasn't there if they didn't comment on the sympathy of this thing. Ok, let's learn to suspend our disbelief in films like the "Die Hard" series, but see little Jodie defeat an entire street gang, with a Glock, like a NOVICE, but ... come on. All he needed was a bald head and a torn shirt and she would be Bruce Willis. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Jodie, being the executive producer, blinded her for what would have been a joke and a waste of money. Or was experiencing a kind of fantasy in which she is the only blonde and all the others are a black brunette, or Hispanic. The dog is also black. Little Blondie is the only good one and (apart from a black cop) everyone else in town is a bad minority to take her. Your fear of your acting talent has diminished so much that you think that the only way to get yourself noticed is the only bright spot (literally) in a dark / dark / dark / neighborhood / film / cast? Apparently he thought he was in the wrong movie ... The Dark Knight. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous plot cracks, furniture that chews acting, gratuitous violence ("Look at girls! Now you can do it too!"). .. Spend time with your family instead of watching this drek.
