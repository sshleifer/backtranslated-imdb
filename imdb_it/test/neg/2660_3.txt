Nothing could be more attractive than the idea of ​​a good love story with Kristin Scott Thomas and Harrison Ford. The fresh and refined English beauty and the warm-blooded American male - what could be more beautiful? Well, this is not that movie. They immediately ruin it by launching Kristin Scott Thomas as a member of the American Congress. It's like throwing Hugh Grant as Babe Ruth. O Colin Firth as Al Capone. Kristin Scott Thomas is exactly the kind of woman you can't imagine shaking hands with a fat ex drug addict in dirty slums, or squeezing into a stinking crowd and kissing children. She would have been a far better cast than the English widow of an aristocratic senator, the type who belongs to the hunting club and goes to flower shows but has no idea how the other half lives. <br /> <br /> Then there's Harrison Ford as a regular cop. Certainly it's tough enough for the role. But the idea that is going to excite this wonderful beauty of high society is a bit difficult to digest. Why couldn't it be a tough but wealthy reformist politician with blue-collar roots who inherits Kristin's Senate seat? The two are initially quite sympathetic to each other, but Kristin has to be friendly with him, and he in turn starts to show her part of life's crudest part - the things that her husband protected her from. His political awakening coincides with the spasmodic passion of a new, more blue collar, lover - one who appreciates his refinement and refinement far more than his aristocratic husband. This is a love story! Instead, however, we get an empty, meaningless "thriller" in which the action drags on and nothing happens. Well, there's a "drive by" ghetto-style scene in which Harrison is almost killed, but it's so abrupt and inexplicable it's really more like a welcome comic relief. <br /> <br /> The sky is always gray in this film, and our refined, adorable Kristin always looks a little cold. When she should dream of passion, it seems more like she is dreaming of a woolen blanket and a cup of tea! She also looks a little sleepy most of the time, like she really prefers to take a nap in bed rather than cheat Harrison Ford. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'd say you can't blame her.
