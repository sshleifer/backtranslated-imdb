George Zucco was like Boris Karloff in the fact that, however poor the film in which he appeared, he would always have maintained a sense of dignity and turned into a beautiful performance. "The Mad Monster" is no exception to this rule. It's a poor movie for everyone (if it's funny). The directors obviously didn't know how to make the most of their low budget and the script seems to have been discovered in a day or two. However, Zucco is as handsome and credible as the mad scientist. <br /> <br /> The film itself is fun at the field level. For the most part, fans of the normal horror film will not appreciate the films of the PRC. However, these "Poverty Row" productions have a small but fair following. Occasionally they rose above their limits with "Detour" as a best example. They usually seemed that way. For all its technically poor qualities, "The Mad Monster" is a pretty fun way to kill a rainy afternoon. The Retromedia DVD is recommended, as it combines with another PRC production "The Black Raven", the original theatrical trailer, and above all an interview with Glenn Strange that talks about his role in this film. (4/10)
