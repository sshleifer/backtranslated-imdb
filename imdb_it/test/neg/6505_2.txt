Ok, so this was done back in 1993. Directed freely by Robert Iscove and written freely by John Miglis, it should be based on a true story. Hard to believe that anyone could be so stupid and blind to the truth. Of course it was obvious from the start that this lady was after all able to get. <br /> <br /> Tim Matheson, with a somewhat older appearance than I remembered, played the empty-headed man who sought romance in his opaque and empty life. Well, he came to him in people like Tracy Pollan, a slightly vacant-looking girl with a vicious sex as a means of winning over her boys. <br /> <br /> Come on, phone sex, even in the 90s it was an old hat. I can't believe someone could fall for that old line. But Mr. Matheson seemed to buy it. And it cost him a lot. <br /> <br /> The most difficult scene to do was when he finally threw the woman out of her apartment, putting all her stuff in the hallway (AHEAD OF HIS APARTMENT) and then she had the stupidity of not changing the locks. That's when I've had enough of this trivial movie. It made me want to wish the lady had tried on me so I could have the satisfaction of telling her to take a walk. <br /> <br /> I gave this chestnut to 1 in 100. That's how I thought it was wrong. I guess you can't blame the actors. But they were horrible. Did they really try to play with a straight face?
