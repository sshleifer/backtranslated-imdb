Zarkorr is a bad movie. This is not true even in its good category. It's just ugly. From the (lack of) set design to acting to special effects, everything about this movie stinks. For starters, it looks like the film was shot in empty rooms with a couple of props thrown in to make it look beautiful. Then we put ourselves in acting that is so bad that it makes an Oscar seem like a high school candidate. And to top it all off, there are special effects that are so bad that it seems like an amateur has taken them away in their garage. The cities the monster is allegedly crushing resemble my nephew's train train. So obviously fake that they shout to the viewer. The only good thing about the film is the monster costume. It's just a shame that they spent all their budget and left nothing for the rest of the film. And maybe even a decent script would have helped.
