The story of an erupting volcano in central Los Angeles looks like a beautiful plot for a catastrophic film. This one, however, missed bigtime. The film looks chaotic, has a plot that is hard to follow or believe and the acting was very bad. <br /> <br /> I agree with many comments that Lee Jones is good at commanding people around as a leader in some particular field. In this, he is running the emergency office. Being the head of such an office, it is of course a good idea to bring your daughter into dangerous scenes. Smart thinking. Ann Heche touches the walls and walks into tunnels which they suppose to be 678 degrees fahrenheit. Yes, right. Apart from bad acting, those factual mistakes make the film almost as silly as Armageddon. The only positive aspect of this film is that Ben Affleck is not there to make things even worse. Avoid this movie at all costs.
