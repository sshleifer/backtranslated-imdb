Presumably, a film in a magazine that sent journalists to investigate UFO reports with one more or less tolerant or agnostic of the whole affair and the other an Australian, an inveterate skeptic who laughs at the absurdity of UFOs. It's all a crock, a kind of rocket that makes money. <br /> <br /> It turns out that this film is actually a deception and a trap to actually enact the Christian teachings and the Christian explanation of UFOs, one I heard before. This is an ad hoc explanation that is not biblical at all, but invented by some modern theologians who can insert anything into their mythology. The paranormal? It is real, only demonic, unless it happens in a Christian context, so, of course, it is of God. Simple, if it is not of God, it is the devil, stupid! So I suppose Beethoven's ninth symphony was not inspired by God, must have been written under demonic influence. Or it would also be the logic ad absurdum. <br /> <br /> We are aware that since the Bible does not speak of life on other planets in the Universe, so there is none (a version of the failed Ad Ignorantium) and that God created the Universe so big, so big as to show us its omnipotent power. I think of Carl Sagan's observation that if God had created such a large Universe and only blocked life on Earth, it would have been a huge waste of space. <br /> <br /> So what are UFOs? They are demonic activities and concern the next Christian earthquake event, the rupture ... I mean Rapture. Before the tribulation, true Christians will disappear en masse from the face of the earth causing mass panic, confusion, traffic accidents and airplanes ... whatever. So Satan knowing that this is sending his demons to fundamentally create an illusion of alien spaceships and alien abductions that can then be used to explain this otherwise inexplicable event. All part of Satan's plan which will obviously keep people from looking at God or Jesus and falling into the lies of the Antichrist. <br /> <br /> This ad hoc explanation also represents the theological steward explaining a mystery with another, as opposed to the scientific method of explaining the unknown, the strange and the mysterious as much as possible, first from the known, if not exclusively from the known. <br /> <br /> It is like jumping directly to an alien kidnapping every time a child has disappeared and disappeared. I think I would look at more trivial explanations first as the child ran away, got lost, or was kidnapped for ransom or kidnapped by a predator pedophile before invoking aliens, or the supernatural or Satan or some of these. <br /> <This kind of deception or trap by fundamentalists is nothing new, as young people are often attracted to Free Rock Concerts, which can start with something harmless and then suddenly switch to open Christian music, followed by a sermon and an altar call. This kind of obvious deception that you might think would be more of Satan's game. But perhaps because the Christian faith will soon be in agony, these guys feel that whatever goes, any deception or deception or intimidation tactics are acceptable to try to keep the faith alive, which is facing serious opposition from both laity as well as Competing faiths like Islam, the fastest growing religion in the world that could very well replace Christianity, as Islam is much more cohesive and unified and logically more sustainable than Christian fundamentalism. Although this should offer a small advantage to humanity, as it would replace an intolerant thought system with another. <br /> <br /> And of course the film ends more or less with a variation of Pascal's bet. The Australian atheist, who is skeptical about everything, is said. Well, if you are right about the fact that there are no afterlife and death is nothing but rotting in the grave, no worries ... but what happens if you're wrong? <br /> <br /> Basically, statements that imply that reality is going to conform to nothing but an atheist point of view or a Christian fantasy, is a false dilemma or a black and white mistake. Even if atheists make mistakes, they will not necessarily make Christianity correct by default, nor if Christianity turns out to be full of holes in its theology, that materialistic atheists are therefore corrected by default. <br /> <br /> For all of us Know that the spirituality of Native Americans could prove to be the best description of the ultimate reality and that we could all wish to treat Earth and its creatures better. <br /> <br /> This film should be printed right on the box: Warning: contains religious propaganda and not intended for informational or entertainment purposes.
