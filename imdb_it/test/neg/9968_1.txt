The only thing of interest in this film is the topic. Taking a look at Manson's "family" from the point of view of family members themselves is a great idea. However, trying to make sense of what is not understandable is something that can really only be achieved in a masterpiece - and this is not it. <br /> <br /> Presumably because there was so much information to be squeezed into a script, this film was made in a fake documentary style, with repeated re-enactments. The trouble is that writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a film watchable, like the character, the story, the theme and so on. <br /> <Br /> Worse, there is an incredibly weak subplot that follows a small band of Mansonites in the last few days as they follow a reporter who is working on a story about the anniversary of the killings. It's stupid and useless, and a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film is a great wasted opportunity. The only ray of sunshine is the recitation of Marc Pitman, who plays Tex, who in real life did most of the actual killing. While the female characters come out of the gigantic heads in the flashbacks of the 60s, Pitman manages to convey real sensations. In short, don't worry about this movie.
