This is a film about people receiving a love letter. No one knows who sent it and nobody knows who it is for. A good cast, directed by Kate Capshaw, Tom Selleck and Ellen DeGeneres. This, however, is a completely drugged plot. For example, the character of Capshaw, one of the leading citizens of a small New England town, faces an immature university student who works at his bookstore during the summer. She chooses him instead of Tom Selleck, the city firefighter who is crazy about her. If this is not the epitome of stupidity, I don't know what it is. Just an example of how amazing this film is. Watching Kate Capshaw is a pleasure, but you immediately realize that she has never followed a day in her life. Another obviously drugged part of a stupid movie.
