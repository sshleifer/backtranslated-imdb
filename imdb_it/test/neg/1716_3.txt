It's certainly a direct-to-video, but the story isn't as bad as most other reviewers think. I really like the fact that the hero is doing the wrong thing most of the time. <br /> <br /> The reactions of the hero and the reactions of the rebels are simply human. Hopper's character is actually playing god. This may be the right thing to do, but some may not like it anyway. <br /> <br /> In the end, the gambling god is condemned to death, and the hero, who would have spent his life, can live. Quite a moral. :-) <br /> <br /> The most unrealistic thing I've seen is that the earth is doing so well without the moon stabilizing its rotation.
