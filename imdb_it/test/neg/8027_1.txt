S ono, l o n g, d u l l. . . <br /> <br /> Oh my god, boring. <br /> <br /> Such annoying characters: you'll be ashamed every time you see Jimy Smits, or the guy who played TomTom from now on. They must have never tried or reviewed the current film. Mel Gibson was absolutely wooden. <br /> <br /> This may not be the worst movie ever made, but that almost went straight to the video says it's damn close. <br /> <br />
