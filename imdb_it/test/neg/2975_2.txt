Ok, so I'm Singaporean and I'd like to say it's time to stop stereotyping Singaporeans and making films like that. Some actors / actresses are really talented, but unfortunately not much has been shown in this film. I was shaking on the seat when I saw this, being quite young at the time, my parents dragged me to see it. I could honestly say that I would have fallen asleep. And there was this arrogant and westernized boy who got on my nerves. Overall, a boring film and a general waste of the actors' talent. I saw better Singapore films than this. Chicken Rice War was good. However, I can't believe this would be considered a better Singapore movie. Sorry, I wouldn't recommend it.
