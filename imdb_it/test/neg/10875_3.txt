Tarentino should be ashamed of being involved in this horrible film. The acting, the directing and the screenplay are all third category - with the whole film played as an excuse for writer / director / star Larry Bishop. The only reason it was created is most likely due to its association with QT. The plot of the film is rather inconsistent, and in practice it tries to survive with not too obscure references to old B series movies and some cameos by guys like David Carradine, Dennis Hopper and Vinnie Jones. Everyone is listless in their performance, particularly Hopper who is in full-on pay-on mode at this point in his career. The saving grace, if there is one, is that the script is so ridiculous that it can be fun. Bishop strives so hard to get that brand of Tarentino that rings and fails miserably, which can be quite funny at times and irritating to others. I would only check one if you love bad movies ... or if you really like motorcycle movies.
