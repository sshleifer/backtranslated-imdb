I just finished watching this movie. I couldn't imagine watching this on VHS, because there were scenes where I needed subtitles to listen through an accent or a sound effect, even if the scene itself was in English. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is quite attractive. The few CG effects were very obvious insertions, but the effects of the prosthesis / creature were not bad. Not perfect, but photography and editing (which were pretty good) made up for a lot. Acting was generally bad, although it cannot be said that much of this can be attributed to the director, having never seen any of the actors before. The exception, I think, was M. Gomez (Uxia). He stole every scene in which he had a part, and not just for a beautiful face, but there was something similar to the urgency of his performance that none of the others had. The script could have been much better - the plot was still unmistakably Lovecraft, and many details about Lovecraft were written, but personally I could have done without much of the dialogue.
