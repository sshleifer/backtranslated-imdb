Yes, the cover of the video for this film made me want to watch this movie as a child. It was called "Screamers" on this particular cover with the slogan "Men upset!". He also highlighted this deformed-looking skeleton on the cover that triggered images of all kinds in my mind. Perhaps a kind of film about a strange virus that burned the flesh of a person, maybe a film about undead zombies that are more bloodthirsty than what you usually get, a scientific experiment that went incredibly bad and now strange men with meat that drips away their bones go on a rampage. Yes, all these thoughts crossed my mind, one that was not fish boys on some island with virtually no blood and all boring. This film is much more like Dr. Moreau's Island than anything else and frankly the film bores me too, it's a way for many scientists and not enough to kill my taste. These films are very important and not enough blood for my taste. Yes, I know, I have strange tastes, but I can't help it, I like my horror films to be really bloody or fast moving and exciting that this movie is really neither one of them.
