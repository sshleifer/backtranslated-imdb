A lot of trash that only Full Moon Studios could do has a group of college kids, staying for free in an old hospital without anyone knowing it, like a demonic creature with two faces (barely visible the whole movie because of an incomprehensible illumination) passes through the walls to kill every member who has a certain sheet of paper with ancient signs. Some of them (it will not be too difficult to prove, but a slight turning point is revealed in such an unintuitive and clearly executed way). It is the mind behind who kills the beast and must be revealed before it kills everyone. /> <br /> Economic mess, misinterpreted has a "Is that all ?!" kind of weak ending that will make you exasperate why you lost time. Tanya Dempsey, who couldn't make her way through a wet paper bag, has the heroine duties as the new member of the college student group named Clark. Oh, and the title refers to the sound the beast makes before it attacks the next victim.
