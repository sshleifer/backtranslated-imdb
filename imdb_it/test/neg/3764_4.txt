Wow, this was a real stinker. This first science fiction film has nothing to do but the pure field. There is so much mambo-jumbo science in the dialogue that is ridiculous. The female character played by Osa Massen is just a plot device for male characters who serve sexist comments throughout the duration of the film. Watch this with your girlfriend. I guarantee that he will boil his blood. The only good thing is the soundtrack that cleverly creates the mood of the film. The special effects are rather crude but not bad considering the vintage of the film. With some good B stars in the main roles, acting is not bad. But the lines that have been given must have given them a good challenge. The challenge of not laughing out loud.
