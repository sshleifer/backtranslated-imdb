This film has so much in it. Prehistoric society, adventure, romanticism, true brotherhood, violence, sex, religion; all depicted in abundance ... without a single word spoken !!! And why does it suck? This film will make you rethink the origin of humanity. If this were the product of anthropology, you would prefer to challenge Darwinian theory and Hegelian synthesis together. You can't bear to see it even with your brain closed. And now you're thinking, "I have to see this." I warned you. I take no responsibility if I regret spending over an hour staring at this artwork. Well, I warned you. This should be forgotten and buried forever.
