I've read a lot of books in my short life, but this is by far the worst !!! I just finished reading this useless piece of trash and when I finished it I threw it across the room! I hated it and let me indicate the reasons! 1. The soldier dies. Why should the author kill the soldier ?! Why couldn't he have kept it alive as a good love story that the author would do ?! I deeply appreciate Patty for trying to tear the eyes off that FBI agent. <br /> <br /> 2. Ruth get fired. Ruth (the black housekeeper) is fired and for no apparent reason! He tried to comfort Patty and then Patty SOB's father fired her without a good reason! Ruth, Anton and Patty were the only bright spots in the book. Oh and grandparents too! 3. The permanent Yes. The perm. Now you people might think why the perm would be upset? Well, that's why Patty's mom asks the girl if she wants her hair to be finished. Patty says no but Mom calls Mrs. Reeves (the horrendous hairdresser) and tells her to give Patty a permanent. Why would he do it on God's green earth ?! Because a mother should ask her daughter if she wants a permanent just to get her a permanent anyway! Mom always pretends that Patty has a say when she doesn't have a word to say !!! You should receive the "Worst Mother of the Year Award" for the things you give Patty. Thank God, Ruth cut her booty! 4. Discrimination, Racisem and Prejudious. I hate discrimination in this book. They use the word * beep * too much. Yes. I know that in those days blacks were free but they had virtually no rights but come on! Why teach today's children that word! It simply teaches them how to discriminate against people. Not only were blacks discriminated against, but also the Chinese. In the book people refer to Mr. Lee (a Chinese) as "The * beep * This is really contemptible and, last but not least ... Jews and Nazis. I hate the city for spitting a little girl. Wrong for her Anton's approval: IT'S AN OLD DAY !!! It was just a crush. As a 12-year-old child he can really love a 22-year-old boy. Let's go! This is not "Lolita." piece of dirt! I'm surprised this movie is not considered "dirty" as "Lolita" is. <br /> <br /> 5. Patty going to a reformatory. Patty shouldn't have Reformers are for thieves and murders, not 12-year-old innocent children! The teacher or whatever was called Patty, an ungrateful, spoiled brat.Ungrato brat my ass! should have community service or something. He didn't do anything wrong. I just helped one friend. <br /> <br /> 6. Favortisem. The parents played favoritism with their c hildren. Patty, their first-born daughter is clearly the least favored while Sharon, the five-year-old daughter, is their favorite daughter. Dad says he wanted to take Sharon to Hollywood but clearly forget the other daughter. <br /> <br /> 7. Dad. I hated it! He was so bad that even Patty would have had Hitler himself as his father. Her father beats her for no apparent reason and the way she talks to her in the end will make you so angry that they will surprise you to think "Patty would get better treatment in a concentration camp." <br /> <br /> Well there are people 7 reasons why I hate this book. Instead of reading this book, it reads "The Diaries of Anne Frank" or anything else because I warn you, it's very depressing and will leave you really crazy! The only reason he gets 4 stars is because of Anton, Patty, Ruth and the grandparents!
