quickly destroyed by poor quality acting, cinematography, numerous useless scenes and a terrible villain. Well, we see that Joe Estevez is bad (as usual) but it's not the only casting problem, the writer Vivian Schilling is not a great actress, on the contrary, well, it sucks. His script is not so bad, it's just bad direct. In fact if the direction had been better and if better actors had been expressed, this could have been a really good film. <br /> <br /> But alas, with all these problems "Soultaker" fails to be even a kind of passable as a horror movie, and even the pace is terrible. <br /> <br /> The MST crew enjoyed this, but it was certainly not one of their best efforts. 5 for that, nothing for the original.
