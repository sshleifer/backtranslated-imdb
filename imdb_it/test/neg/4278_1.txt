for all those who have read this book, Fanny Price ends up becoming a woman, a beautiful woman ... with a brain. Le Touzel seems to be taking medication. A terrible acting, ruin it! Henry is a little tall for his character. It is also too effeminate. Mary Crawford is brilliant. Edmond is a little too old. Ms. Norris is hysterical - OK, this casting decision works. Rushworth is also perfect. Yates also seems too effeminate. But Le Touzel is simply awful. This is not a good character for her. Poor Fanny! I would recommend this film only because it includes an almost complete textual account of the language used by Austen in the novel. The 1999 version is much more fun but terribly incomplete. If they could redo this version with an actress better suited to Fanny, it would be fabulous!
