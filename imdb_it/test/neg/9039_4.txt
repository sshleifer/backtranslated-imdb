One might think that a film that starred three of the greatest male film stars of the post World War II era would become a classic. These three, which are also my three favorites, go around in a daze, it seems they would prefer to be anywhere, but there. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that The Way West certainly had something potential to be a classic. In these days of political correctness, a film about American pioneers and the travails of their migration to the west has not been done now. It should have been done better then. <br /> <br /> Kirk Douglas is a former US senator who is heading for a train west to build a settlement in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Being a former politician, he ranks above the ranking he is leading. The script obliges him to have not only a covered wagon, but a carriage to drive the train. <br /> <br /> You think it's ridiculous, you should see the whipped scene where Douglas orders his black servant, played by Roy Glenn to whip him. I don't want to ruin it by saying what makes Douglas demand this from Glenn, but believe me, it's ugly. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum is the guide of the trails and of the three stars seems more bored. There had to be considerable friction on the set between Widmark and Douglas, but Mitchum merely skips the film above all else. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the friction was useful because the film calls widowed Douglas to keep an eye on Mrs. Widmark, played by Lola Albright. Now it's the best thing in the movie. <br /> <br /> Billing of the film says it introduces Sally Field. This was done between her Gidget and her Flying Nun days. He plays a piece of white southern garbage with the musical comedy name of Mercy McBee. We see her for the first time in the film sitting on the back of her parents' wagon, her legs cranky and inviting. Obviously she is involved in her invitation. <br /> <br /> His character is similar to the one found in every trailer in America and then again what was a wagon, but a large moving caravan park. <br /> <br /> Despite this film, Sally Field continued with a two-Oscar career. What that woman had to overcome. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen's son, Andrew, directed this object and, along with a horrible script, turned it into a turgid mess. Shame on Andrew McLaglen, he certainly did better in his career. <br /> <br /> And you will too, unless you are an astronomer.
