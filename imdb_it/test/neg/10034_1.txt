I saw this movie with my girlfriend. It was a total disaster. You can really see that it was made cheap. Written badly and with bad acting. I read several versions of the book by several authors and I also listened to a version on the audiobook. We could not take the film seriously because of the missing elements it should have contained. The experience of watching this was like The Blair Witch in Green Acres. Then there were parts that were vulgar. Show this little boy using a pan and actually show the contents. The witch throws the contents onto the boy and the whole family laughs. I thought it was ugly and very strange. I really can't understand why anyone would think it would be fun. Show another scene where Dr. Mize arrives and Betsy Bell is urinating in her dress on the steps of their house in front of her mother and her brothers. Instead of the mother who leads her out is the brother. How bad The kid in the first scene of the many scenes that deal with the way your body has waste begs for toilet paper and goes into the house and makes those strange faces of joy with sound effects. I think they should have left all this out. Reverend James Johnston's trick as an older man didn't really make you assume he was older. It made you think he was immersed in fish batter. The blood on Joshua Gardner when he falls off the ladder is even worse. The scene of John Bell's death seems to have taken out the flour and tried to do something to make him look like a serious sick man. For me a very disgusting comedy with bathroom problems and inexperienced people involved was the ruin of this image. These people would do better if they ran commercials for local TV stations for bathroom products. They chose a good subject and were not able to produce it properly. I consider this film Capital F less.
