Skip this version of Hollywood, a real piece of junk. An economic insult to the brilliant original "Spoorloos", or from the English title also called "The Vanishing". The brand is completely missing in the typical, grotesque Hollywood fashion, usually because of a group of talentless, corporate bean counters that don't have the vaguest idea of ​​something artistic, they just look for the "winning formula" and want it to apply to all glean a profit. Just like the horrible "The Scarlet Letter" made in 1995, which distorted the original story enough to fit the MacDonaldsland crowd, which became an aberration, not just a bastardization, but a pile of goop that was sort of like it but it does not have the appearance, the touch or even the spirit of the original. Except that that movie had at least Gary Oldman, which is interesting to watch in whatever he does. This dog has nothing to do, even Jeff Bridges, usually very talented, is embarrassing. The great tragedy is neither nor should it be "the film of the year", but rather takes one or more of the tragic events that are sad and too frequent in life and allows the reader / viewer to draw meaning and intuition from the human condition. br /> <br /> Do yourself a great favor if you are looking for a rental and skip this grotesque garbage and collect the original product in a French-Dutch collaboration in 1988. This is a great movie. This is a horrible mess.
