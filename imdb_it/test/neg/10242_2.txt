The strange thing about Galaxina is not that it is extremely bad, even if it is. The strange thing is that despite being extremely bad, it's not funny. Extremely bad films have their particular brand of unintended humor - the secret to their success, one might say. But Galaxina is quite different - it's MST3K's worst nightmare, a bad movie in which intentional * and * involuntary humor are drastically reduced. <br /> <br /> It is easy enough to understand why intentional jokes fail - and the reasons are quite varied. Sometimes it's a timing question; sometimes it's a bad idea (the human restaurant * could * have been hilarious, but it wasn't); sometimes it seems that there is a bit of confusion in the cutting room, with the punch line ending on the floor; and sometimes the jokes are just bad jokes. Bad movies take their laughter from such an involuntary snake. It is more difficult to understand why Galaxina never laughed at that point. There is something wrong with this involuntary humor in this film, just like something wrong (at least subtly) with intentional humor. It is an incredibly ugly film whose bad quality is not the salvific quality it usually is. It is absolutely unique in my experience.
