The Messengers is a bad film, generic and boring "horror". The film has a big problem: it is not afraid. The performances and the script are totally stupid. Use old tricks to scare and all supernatural events make Ride. I wouldn't call The Messengers a bad movie ... I would call it a casual comedy because it's so ugly to make people laugh. The only good thing about this movie is that it's short, so this shit won't stay with us for so long. There are many horror genre masterpieces that count on a low budget (like Subject Two, Lucky or May) that are sadly ignored, while this shit is all box office success. So, I don't recommend this weak and pathetic horror movie called The Messengers.
