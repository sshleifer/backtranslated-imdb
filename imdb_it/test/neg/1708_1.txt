As an independent director, I try to make at least one decent film. This piece of ____ was over the low budget. It was shot on video and not in mini-DV 24P at least. The graphic aspect of this was only baaaad. I met the director a few years ago at the ShowBiz Expo in Los Angeles and he was talking about that book, Film-making for dummies that he was putting together. I thought this little video would be something but I guess I was wrong. He could have increased the value a bit by shooting 16mm movies instead of that horrible video. The plot was stupid, like the acting and all the fake green screen, the sound and all the nine meters. I had a choice tonight to rent any movie and made the wrong choice. Damn!!!!! I bought JoyRide which was a damn good movie. Perhaps the director should read real movie books about the film and not try to cut corners when trying to make a low-budget film. Perhaps he should learn from the masters who did, The Night of the Living Dead and The Evil Dead and Chain saw massacre. just to mention some of the great low-budget hits of all time. This is a video that should be dead. I can't call it a movie because it didn't use the movie.
