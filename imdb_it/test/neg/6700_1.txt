Badland is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Most of the time it's fine and I can go on with my life, but I feel the need to warn others in this case. As a veteran of the war in Iraq, I feel it necessary to say that the story, the plot, the acting and the representation of what the soldiers go through on their return home were pure garbage. It was as if the director / screenwriter / anyone had stuck to any clich√© about the returning soldiers and had started to run and run with it ... Don't mention that I imagined that there was absolutely no research in this movie. The "Marine" uniform seemed to have just emerged from a shelf in an excess warehouse and was a model not used since the first Iraq war. I won't go on forever, this is a horrible movie. If you are interested in the stories of returning soldiers there are much better alternatives. I recommend going to your local library.
