This movie sucks. It's fun to see what's worse about this story, in which two American twins with hidden brains who know nothing outside their school can come to another continent and do unimaginable things there. He is simply so stupid and so bizarre. How can they only find two French boys, hit them and finally kiss them, not knowing anything about them? More realistic would have been to have the boys take them away and rape them, which could easily happen in such a situation. As for the fact that the French president drinks 'bad water', he was simply lame. I don't think he would have been too happy in real life. Everything worked too easily for the girls, and they could have been in trouble several times in the film, if they represented real life. <br /> <br /> My rating: 0/10
