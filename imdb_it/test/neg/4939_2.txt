Hi, today I watched this movie because of the average (5.6) IMDb. I thought it would be worth seeing. Even the comments here were quiet, but after starting to watch this film I realize that this film is not close to 5.6! It's just boring. You can describe the film with a few words, it's just the story of the standard horror movie with all the standard horror movie scenes. I don't know why people still like those movies or why they rate these films better than 1-3 in IMDb. Just a few examples <br /> <br /> Bunch of people who come from somewhere or go / drive to anywhere. Strange people meet somehow on their journey but hey maybe they are just nice so stay with them. Then a very important scene for every horror movie "Oh my cell phone doesn't work oh oh my too .. it's weird but we don't need it so enjoy our ride ..." uhhhhhhh our strange person is a weird psychopath better us let's sit down and scream a bit until he starts cutting parts from us or killing some of us. After a while the group of victims receives a weapon or the possibility of escaping from the battle never thinks of escaping or killing the psychopath if he has the chance to talk only about what to do until the psychopath takes his weapon with one any of the handful of standard tricks they got in those movies and they all come back as usual ... screaming ... a little more to kill ... oh and in the end it gets really exciting sometimes the bad guy wins sometimes someone of the victim can escape wow great movies. ... OK if I have never seen a movie of that type I would say it is a film that can be seen but if someone has ever seen a film of its kind it should be just a boring waste of time because almost everything in the film you know before to have seen it because every time it runs like the standard horror movie. .... mmm maybe there is a program for windows out there? Horrormoviemaker 2.0? You can simply pull a few adjustment buttons and get the new type of film Shuttle, Saw45674, Jeepers Creepers.
