I'm sorry to say but I didn't like this movie at all. It was just too boring. So boring I couldn't watch the rest. It is not as interesting as the Lion King or Aladdin. That's why I hate these stupid days because these days are no longer what they used to be. The movies that Disney has released lately really suck! I miss the old days when they made good films like the Lion King, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Cinderella, The Aristocats and Robin Hood. This movie is really horrible. I really did my best to get interested in this movie, but I couldn't. I don't think I can recommend this movie to anyone. I would recommend the ones I just mentioned above.
