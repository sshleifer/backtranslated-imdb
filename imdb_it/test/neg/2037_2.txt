I had nothing to do before going out one night, so I didn't want to watch anything too heavy, I chose the perfect movie. This must have been a gift to Barrymore from someone he slept with, director Raja Gosnell has done nothing but nonsense and writing about it is simply atrocious. In which high school can you register without a parent present and no proof of age or previous education? Do they let the children all come to the dance without shirts, with tight tights, shorts and a girl dressed as Eva wearing only fig leaves? Announces that he is 25 years old and his brother is 23 but there are no reprisals from the school, parents or causes of any kind against the newspaper for fraud or spying? The head of the newspaper wants to capture the teacher in a child sex scandal, but does he not realize that the teacher is approaching a 25-year-old, so any case could be trapped? Do they allow a camera to enter and record private conversations of people with minors? I wonder if I hired my younger sister to go back to HS with a camera on her and filmed under age girls for my personal use I wouldn't have had some sort of problems ??? NAHHHH No problem. Didn't he have to take the gym or go to the bathroom at some point? The secondary characters in this were like cardboard cutouts of what high school students are considered and all were a stereotype. Jessica Alba is just embarrassingly bad in this robbery for the camera on every occasion. In which world do parents get suspicious when their super-unfortunate daughter is miraculously taken out of the school stallion at the ball? And they don't ask the guy inside to meet him like any other parent in history. If a boy from my school or any other school had searched my sister and thrown eggs into her ball gown, she would have been cast in the body for the rest of her life. This film is so invented and predictable that it is nauseating, and because in the end they are all (the Alpo girls included) cheering for this girl when they hated her two days earlier ???? <br /> <br /> DUMB, DUMB AND dumb.
