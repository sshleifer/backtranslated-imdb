A good idea disappointed by heavy production. <br /> <br /> A good deal of the dialogue was incomprehensible due to the level of music / background and this did not help this review. Not even the Welsh accents, sometimes quite impenetrable. Towards the end I lost the will to live trying to follow the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film did not know whether to be a farce or a black comedy - and they require different approaches. Some of the incidents have been thrown so often that they only deserve a groan, some have been so incredible even for this kind of plot that they have made the story simply not worth following. <br /> <br /> The acting was for the good - even though the American has just become a clone of the mad scientist "Back to the future". The boy was very good. <br /> <br /> I looked at it all the way, but God knows why: I don't remember laughing once.
