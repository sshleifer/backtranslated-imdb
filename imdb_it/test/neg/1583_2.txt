OK, what was this story again? I'm afraid I've never read the book and, frankly, this was one of the most confusing movies I've ever tried to see in a long time. I feel a little confused about the number of flashbacks between the nurse, the patient and the man with no thumb. The film didn't even really explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it; or even how in the world they all knew each other. <br /> <br /> After having recently seen the movie "Pride and Prejudice" with Colin Firth, I tried to do a study on his film career by watching other films of his, and in no uncertain terms, besides "What a Girl Wants ", I don't find much of the place where he played. I'm certainly not saying it wasn't good. He really is one of the best actors I've seen in today's movies, but the content and quality of the movies he plays have a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> "The English patient" is another perfect example of where the director, writer and crew are too close to their subjects to see that the viewer is not getting the image ?? literally. The entire film seemed to show Ralph Fiennes as a dramatic actor with long periods of emulation that was boring. Nothing is really explained and each of the subjects from the beginning seems to need a psychoanalytic evaluation! <br /> <br /> The character of Kristin Scott Thomas seems to have fun describing erotic stories standing in front of a totally male audience and tickling other men other than her husband; Colin Firth, who plays her husband, doesn't necessarily have all his marbles in place and should he be a secret agent? I presume; and Ralph Fiennes walks around like a Roman Mr. Darcy (I'm sorry, Colin!) who thinks he knows everything. The rest of the cast is thrown (pun intended) to the four winds as the plot hovers. <br /> <br /> The subplot of the mental stability of the nurse (Juliette Binoche) and her motivations and involvement with Naveen Andrews is another element of confusion that leaves the viewer with an unpleasant taste. But of course, the viewer is still upset about how the first two characters (Thomas and Fiennes) ended up having sex the first time anyway. What was the attraction? There was no chemistry or accumulation. Just a slap, bam, thanks! <br /> <br /> And isn't it romantic that Fiennes ended up with a traitor to help the Germans by giving them maps in the desert? (sarcasm) <br /> <br /> To describe this film, I should simply say: "How to amaze your gynecologist with your mammograms and fool your sweet, loving husband who loves you". <br /> <br /> The incredible final section of this plot is to understand how someone would choose Ralph Fiennes on Colin Firth. Has Firth had very few opportunities to demonstrate his acting talents ?? in fact, watching the film, I thought it was one of his first. The scene in which he had waited for his wife all night was perhaps the only two-second clip worth seeing in the film. At this point, I have no interest in looking at him again. <br /> <br /> The best scene I liked was the plane crash in which Firth is trying to eliminate them all. Too bad I missed it! He would have saved another twenty minutes of an even more fruitless film. The desert aerial scenes were pretty clean, however.
