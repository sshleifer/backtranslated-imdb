A group of dirty teen bikers is out in the forest circling in circles. They are having fun; they know that nature is about to be unleashed by an emo refugee from a Deliverance or Hills Have Eyes movie. He is armed with matches and an accelerating fire. And he has an eye that is bleeding or something. Why eat a park? I do not know. Maybe he doesn't like Smokey the Bear, or something like that. But he wears the coveralls of the army / navy store, if that helps. <br /> <br /> The rangers send only one helicopter to fight the resulting flare; that's all you see, except for a group of people on a base that talks a lot about fire, but does nothing. Some policeman or ranger or militiaman or anything else has fallen from the helicopter on a defective lace. <br /> <br /> Everyone now rides their cross bikes as if they were auditioning for motocross. They pop forever, they jump Evel Knievel, they go around etc. They discuss incessantly. Fire shots are fake like a 3 dollar bill; it is the same film from a dozen different angles and the flame does not grow or move. And yet you never see any fire-fighting equipment. <br /> <br /> SyFy channel movie that has about 0% of science fiction attached to it. What can you expect from this: bad acting, economic effects and a story that is not going anywhere (like motorcycles and fire don't go anywhere). Laughter insomnia cure.
