This is a perfect example of the mainstream horror assholes of the 90s. Nothing is scary here and the film is almost bloodless. Yes, there is a bit of violence, but everything is as politically correct as in a TV movie. It is not a completely ugly image, I can safely say that I found it rather amusing. However, the lack of originality really hurts the "Voodoo". All in all if you're part of the mainstream public and pseudo-horror movies like "Scream" are your favorites then I love "Voodoo", but if you want something very macabre, avoid this movie.
