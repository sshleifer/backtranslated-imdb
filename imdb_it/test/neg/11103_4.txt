I saw this film only because Sophie Marceau. However, his acting skills are not enough to safeguard this film. Almost all the casts don't play their character well, except for Sophie and Frederic. The plot could give an increase to a better film if the right pieces were in the right places. I've seen many good French movies, but I don't like that.
