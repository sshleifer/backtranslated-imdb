I really love horror films and try to give everyone what I see as much credit (or sometimes more) as possible, but this is really pushing the ticket ... most of the cast was very similar, but almost none of they could act at all - but then we think back to the writing / dialogue of this mess ... some nice makeup but absolutely special ridiculous fx. All in all, they give me 3 out of 10 - and I'm having second thoughts about it !!
