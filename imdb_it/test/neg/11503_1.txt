I think it was just like Lizzie McGuire, except that it was much worse than the original. the only thing that is different is that she likes animals, science and all that geeky stuff. all the rest is the same. she likes a guy who is too nervous to ask. and later she finds a boy she likes and has no idea. I think people should stop doing the same kind of shows. and another thing that is the same is that it's always thawing friends are two girls and a boy. people don't think these things get old and tired and these ideas continue to be used again and again and continue to use these ideas. but I know people who watch this show and I know they like them.
