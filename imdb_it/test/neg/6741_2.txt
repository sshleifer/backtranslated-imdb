I've seen a lot of TV over the years. So much so that when I start seeing new shows that basically look like replicas of old shows, I feel insulted. Fortunately, I'm not too sensitive because all the "Hot Properties" update the cast (which means making them sexier) than "Designing Women" and release them in New York City instead of Georgia. <br /> <br /> The jokes are more TV-14-ish, but they don't make the show any better. The only thing this show has shown is that Nicole Sullivan is so good that she could have made a show like "My Mother the Car" a classic. His comedic talents recall a modern Lucille Ball - just more fun. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is flashy and sexy which could be good for a mindless soap, but they're not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Fred
