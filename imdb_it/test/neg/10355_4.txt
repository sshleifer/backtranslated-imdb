There is something in this show that makes me look and hope for the future. In the script, the lines are few and far between, and the lines of the story are boring, so I imagine it should be physical comedy and graphics. I like the camera movement, the setting and wardrobe. It is very funny to counteract the obtuseness that reigns. And I'm pretty sure that every time I laughed it was because of the physical comedy of John or Molly. The two make a disgustingly pretty couple that makes me laugh and I want to throw up at the same time. <br /> <br /> So here I am ready to sit at Kath and Kim once again tonight to see which route this production will go down (or, as the case may be, looking forward positively).
