Lame B-horror that takes itself too seriously considering its subject matter concerns an old loved one who was transformed into a creature of the night by a tenant who came to rent from her. When the aforementioned tenant is killed, the mother must go out to feed herself and this causes some family fatigue and also attracts the attention of the authorities. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is that this film should have brought THE FUN. He failed to do so, although he had some delicate gore and schlocky creature effects to make the B-movie audience happy. I've seen worse but I wouldn't have given this a rec - 4.5 / 10.
