Overall it was a watchable movie. I didn't pause it or stop it from returning to it - a clear sign of a boring film - so it passed the first test. Best of all, he entered the story quickly, with no boring back story not needed for the characters. <br /> <br /> It will never fade like a great movie. Nor as a great movie B. I would recommend this film to slasher / horror fans who don't deal directly with video releases. <br /> <br /> Unlike some films of this genre, there is no nakedness, only moderate language and rather subdued gore. There is violence, however. The deaths were rather dry and unimaginative, unfortunately. The special effects of the computer were actually quite good. The way the 'creature' branded its chains in some scenes reminded me of the 'Spawn' and 'Ghost Rider' comics. <br /> <br /> A little pet wrath ... It's set in Lousinia, but nobody seems to speak with any accent. I had to look at the credits to realize that it was shot in Lousinia. <br /> <br /> Like most low-budget films, there are little tricks in the shooting. The lack of time and money would be the main factors for the goofs. For example, in one scene it went from mid-afternoon to black in a few seconds ... during a short drive. The other instance was the stand-in for the "creature" who didn't have the "creature" make-up when he fell from the tow truck ... he also seems to be wearing a shirt in the scene. <br /> <br /> In summary, I didn't hate this movie but I didn't love it. I will probably never rent it again, but if a friend owned it, I could watch it again in a few years.
