When all we have is a TV reality show with people teasing themselves for whatever reason is too fat or can't sing or cook, it's worth it, as far as I know Hollywood has run out of original ideas. I can't remember a time when something original or clever came out on TV in the last 15 years. What is our obsession with watching wanderers make a fool of themselves? I would have thought that these types of programs would have made the full round, but every year they come up with something new that is stranger than the previous one. OK, so people in this need to lose weight ... most Americans need to lose weight. I just think that all of us, somehow, enjoy watching humiliated people. Maybe it makes us feel better when we see someone else that looks like a jerk. I don't know, but I'd just like something intelligent to come out that didn't offend your intelligence.
