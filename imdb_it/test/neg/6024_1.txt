I remember that Hey Hey Fuss and I saw the Jackson Jive, it was a pretty straight comedy, but have I seen this and it's free and is it clear? Did I miss something? If the black community were to complain about any racist comment on a TV show this should be it and if you read my previous comments, I am not the easy to offend type. The basic plot is that an African / American moves next to this white boy and make these racist remarks as the value of a house will fall only for black neighbors and the white boy makes references as if he were easily offended by racist insults on) Nig-Nog Jungle Boy Sambo. (I apologize but it really happened in this show, I really am a guy who does well with the black community) People could say Hey lighten up but also when you take the racial Slurrs Away I can swear in an episode that I saw someone's eyes focused on something that is not connected to the situation. All in all horrible comedy.
