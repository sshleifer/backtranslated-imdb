In reality, the media is the only word that comes to mind when you see it. <br /> <br /> Acting was average (maybe a little above average), camera usage was average (actually below average. so flickering and colors were grainy and fuzzy.) The plot it was good, but it moved at such a slow pace and had not been used properly. <br /> <br /> This could have been much more if it didn't go at a snail's pace and we saw more in the backgrounds of the characters. <br /> <br /> We all see the flashbacks here and there of Alice and how her family life is so "bad" (her mother is a working class woman who tries to bring the end together for her and her daughter ). We see her back on when she was in high school and her friend tells her "tell your mom to make better food" and "everyone says she's your mom." Yes, it's embarrassing, but why should you run away from it. <br /> <br /> I could definitely see if her mother was drunk or someone was abusing her, but there was nothing wrong with her, except that she was embarrassed. How immature! <br /> <br /> We are not even given a glimpse of what the couple's lives have been like (except that they have been prostituting for a while and the woman has forgotten her name, given the baby when she had 9 years months.) This could really have been a lot more. She could have had Alice who had been abused by her drunk mom who was coming down to Florida with her friend but then prostituting herself. Or something along the lines of that other the true plot of this film (that is) Alice, a girl with a life at home of about 90% of the American population (WORKING CLASS) fleeing from Florida, but then she is diverted turning into a prostitute. <br /> <br /> I don't see why he won a prize at Sundance (he must have opposed a really weak competition for winning that prize). <br /> <br /> for me, Alice's accent in Boston / New England seemed forced. It didn't seem genuine. (I should know, I was born and raised in Boston, but now I live in Georgia.) <br /> <br /> 4/10 I'm not really worth your time in my opinion.
