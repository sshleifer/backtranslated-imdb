This film coincides with Mike Allred's comic book miniseries, "Red Rocket Seven", and tells the story of an alien who fled to Earth to wait for "Astroesque" that binds to the book of Revelations and the apocillus. This is only part of a bigger story (if the movie confuses you, read also "RR7"). You can easily say that Allred is used to telling stories with images. The direction is very good and the effects are not negative for a budget of $ 500. Unfortunately, Mike used many friends to play the roles and he probably didn't have the courage to say that they couldn't act. Furthermore, Mike does not show his writing skills in this film. His dialouge spoon-feeds the plot for you and won't let you enjoy the characters. This was actually disappointing considering his extraordinary writing skills shown in his comics. 4 out of 10.
