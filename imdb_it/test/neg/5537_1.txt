Why in the name of decency was this film made? <br /> <br /> It is assumed that the subtitles are limited to saying "terrible" on every single frame of this really sad effort. <br /> <br /> The horrible acting, the painful dialogue and the lack of talent on the part of all those involved in this nightmare for a heinous 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall impression? <br /> <br /> A group of excitable drama students got lucky with a lottery bag and proceeded to make one of the most painful films ever made. <br /> <br /> This makes Hammer Horror TV shows like material Oscar. <br /> <br /> And don't think for a second that this falls into the "so bad is good" category. It's not even that bad. <br /> <br /> But the sliding lights scene is probably worth another look.
