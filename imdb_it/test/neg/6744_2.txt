For me, it didn't look like GI Joe at all. When I saw him as a child, I didn't care. In fact, the part that I liked most about this was the initial part. So many facts change and the story turns. The Cobra Commander is presumably part of this stupid reptile breed in Antarctica or somewhere frozen. Even though I always thought it was a normal type considering every time you saw his eyes in the series, they were surrounded by normal colored flesh and not the blue where his face was. There's just too much stuff to try to make this movie spectacular, but for me it only ruins what I saw for the series in the first place.
