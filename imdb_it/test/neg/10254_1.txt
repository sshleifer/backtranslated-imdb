At the dawn of human civilization the cavemen sat down and made limping jokes, beat each other on their heads with what they could grab, and women were never seen and apparently once had tails. These cavemen lived in a geographically different region with a cockatoo, a camel, a monkey - but no women. This film tells the "hilarious" misadventures of seven (or so) cavemen - after burning their land with the new discovery of fire - passing from water to a new land where they find this woman with the additional appendix. Along the way we get "big" comedy moments like a fat cave man who swallows a frog that keeps croaking in his stomach. A monkey throwing stones at their heads. A man who swallows a mouse to catch the frog in the stomach. The obligatory "gay" caveman. The list could go on and on. This film is the very definition of film dreck. I was bored from onset and only got worse when the cavemen started to hit each other, making jokes about the lost word, hitting each other, and sucking poor Silk Berger who seems to have lost a bet for a producer to appear in this nonsense. She really is one of the two bright spots in this film. She is not very actress, so you have to guess why she is a donkey? The other "bright" spot is music. As soon as I heard the score, I told myself that it sounded very familiar. I had never heard the real score but the music was unmistakably that of Ennio Morricone. It is a beautiful soundtrack and the best thing in a film otherwise crude, boring, vulgar, devoid of imagination and ridicule, essentially on a group of Moes who finds a woman for the first time and, first wanting to eat it like an animal, is taught what she could do. Awwwwh! Sorry, I'm choking a yawn as I relive the plot! The end of the film has about 100 women mostly naked on the screen with all the erotic sensation of bringing out a scab from the knee. This film was painful to sit on and offers absolutely no merit. The fact that it has generated a sequel does not surprise me as it offers something that will prick the interest of the spectators - queue.
