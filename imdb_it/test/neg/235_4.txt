First of all, I wasn't sure who the film was aimed at - it seemed like a children's story, but I had something that kids wouldn't understand and found boring. There really wasn't much, Bruce Willis wasn't an actor at all. He did a lot of glances to the side with his half smile - unless you are a big fan of his, I wouldn't worry. And if it is the story that interests you (a boy who seems to have everything but is emotionally lacking he is taught lessons by a child), I would like to go and see About A Boy. It has everything this film lacked, humor, sadness and reality.
