This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Like Blair Witch it is just as annoying. The flashing lights of the helmet made things difficult to see and I think epileptics should pay attention because there are moments with strobing that makes this movie even more annoying. I think if they had been quieter they could have found a way out. Then, when you think the geek might emerge as a triumph, it finds itself in a nervous breakdown. Oh and when is the guy who has sex to realize it when the girl says she can hear something. He can really feel something. One of these guys must have seen at least Scream (where he draws his attention to these things) It is also a great disappointment when a premise offers so many promises and then someone writes the script. So I'm sorry people I've had this weekly at the video store and I still want my money back.
