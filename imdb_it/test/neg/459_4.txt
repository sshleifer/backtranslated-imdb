Less than two hundred and fifty years ago, the last of the great pirates wrote their names with blood and fire through the pages of maritime history. This is the story of a buccaneer captain whose name for a short year struck terror in the hearts of sailors and merchants from the Caribbean ports to the commercial houses of London ..... <br /> <br /> Hmm, which the opening to the film sounds like we were in a hell of bravado, looting, ripper of a real movie? Well, it's not. But it is not entirely worthless as a piece of curiosity. From 20th Century Fox, Anne Of The Indies is adapted from Philip Dunne and Arthur Caesar from a story written by Herbert Ravenel Sass. Direction is by Jacques Tourneur, the soundtrack is by Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson is providing the Technicolor photograph. Jean Peters is in the title title of Anne {AKA Captain Providence} and support comes from Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice. <br /> <br /> Originally intended to be based on The True Pirate Life Anne Bonny, the film eventually turns out to be a story about a woman seeking identity, and finding herself in the male-dominated world of piracy and sea-based shenanigans. Full of clich√©s and familiar screenplays, the film also suffers from a cast that is largely wrong. Peters gives their best, and Paget illuminates the screen with an effervescent beauty. While Robertson Justice, although underused, actually looks the part and doesn't overdo it like the rest of the male cast does. Some reviewers have tried desperately to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings, simply because it is the Tourneur in the chair of directing. But there is no depth here, this is simply a job for Tourneur, a licensed professional, but his thin and actually swarm-free track to go with the buckle in action stakes. <br /> <br /> Best used. 4/10
