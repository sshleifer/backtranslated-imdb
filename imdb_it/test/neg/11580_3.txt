A team of amateur journalists and tree swindlers take flight from a secret government project, Project Carnivore, on a remote South Pacific island. Scientists are producing giant-sized corn, but the genes are spreading to other species, creating abnormally large Komodo dragons and a cobra (one that is bullet-proof and swims underwater). With the help of the scientist's daughter, can they escape the island and tell the world? Even if I hadn't seen this movie on the Sci-Fi channel (which, unfortunately, I did) it would have screamed "Sci-Fi Channel" with its low production value, weak acting and some of the worst special effects in history. The effects here are comparable to another creature movie, "Raptor Island", though not so bad. I suspect there must be at least a handful of people who worked on both films, but I didn't bother to confirm it and probably won't. It will be a sad day when I see one of the two films again. <br /> <br /> Which doesn't mean it's not funny. I saw him at two in the morning with my sister's boyfriend and I can't speak for him, but I thought it was a good use of time. As ugly as it is, it's a funny picture if you like making fun of movies and the scientist's daughter is attractive enough to bring the movie (I think the actress's name is Michelle Borth). Even Michael Pare appears as a ship captain, and his poor choice of roles here makes his work on "Furnace" really respectable (even if that film is intolerably bad). <br /> <br /> I can't be too hard on this movie simply because it was more or less exactly what I thought it would be. Negative effects? Low budget? Actors without a name? I had no higher hopes. However, this doesn't even mean it's great. Coming up to par is nothing to be proud of and this will slowly fade away in the distant memory department. For the fan who likes this movie (and calls it "KvC"), hold on to your copy because you'll have plenty of time to get a replacement.
