I have the impression that I was watching a different movie to most other people I know who have seen this movie. It's not that I found the film offensive or anything - only that the script was incredibly amateur for a movie that obviously had thrown some money. I really respected the work of Paul Haggis on the script Million Dollar Baby and I was deeply disappointed to see how bad this script was. It was clear to me that he was desperate to be the "racist" version of Traffic, but I don't think Traffic was really a movie worth snatching away. <br /> <br /> The worst feature of this film is the way it shamelessly feeds its audience. Does Haggisreally think we are so stupid as to require a click of the empty spaces? Do you really need to see the column on Farhad's dashboard, with the address circled in black texta? Can't we be left to make ice in logic for ourselves? <br /> <br /> I also had a big problem with the dialogue that was so "on the nose". I have heard a critic say that the quality of the dialogue is deceptively high, because even if people do not talk this way, they certainly think so. This is irrelevant. It is the job of a script like this to use dialogue in a way that contributes to increasing the characteristics and credibility of the situations (in this case highly plausible) that have been created. These characters all speak using the same voice and all they talk about is racism. <br /> <br /> Surely the aim of a film like this should be to promote the fact that the race should not really be a problem in these situations, but making it the only goal of each scene, it does not become racist innate in itself? The characters go around spitting out their philosophies and conveniently memorize the statistics on race relations as if they were regurgitating excerpts from the research essay they have just written. It is absolutely unconvincing and obvious. <br /> <br /> A film should reveal its meaning gradually, not slap it in the face in the opening scenes and then never leave it. I see that Haggis' intentions with this film were honorable, but I dare suggest that by directing his script he was unable to identify and, therefore, overcome his flaws. I really hope that the writer / director will be very careful in the future when he approaches this "mosaic" narrative style. It has been done well a number of times, but getting the balance between the personal right and the political right is very difficult. And Robert Altman will be no less in that department.
