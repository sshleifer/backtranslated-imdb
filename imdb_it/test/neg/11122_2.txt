Well, the Sci-Fi channel continues to bring out these turkeys ... and they seem to get worse every time. When normally good actors like John Rhys-Davies and Giancarlo Espositto come out of the charts, you can imagine how abysmal the cast REST is in this waste of time. The only thing halfway is the creature's rubber outfit (which can be seen in a flash so fast that you don't really have time to see how fake it really is). The dialogue ... the plot ... if this "film" (and I use the term freely) was food, Jack-In-The-Box would be a gourmet meal compared to this. Watch a repetition of "The Munsters" for the 372th visualization: your time would be better spent (and even more frightening)!
