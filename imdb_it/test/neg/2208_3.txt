Poor Casper Van Dien, his career is a long way from Tarzan and Starship Troopers. <br /> <br /> A Meltdown is a policeman who is dating TV reporter Stefanie Von Pfeten and her brother is a scientist who is trying to face an accelerated comment directed at Earth. But in the fugitive of comet business, even a near-miss causes some real problems as Earth's orbit goes out. <br /> <br /> From the survival of the Earth we go to the survival of Van Dien and his family. His daughter's boyfriend, the gangbanger, Ryan McDonell, actually proves particularly useful when he suspects that a guy who knows how corrupt a cop could mean a lot of damage to the Van Dien group. <br /> <br /> My only question here is why didn't they have Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton and the rest of the crew to look after the bad comet? <br /> <br /> Pass these people over.
