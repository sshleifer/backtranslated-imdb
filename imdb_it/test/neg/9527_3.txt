The story, as I understand it, is "based on real events". This can be good or bad, depending on the type of license that is taken with those real events and how they are rendered. <br /> <br /> In this case, the results are sufficient to gag a worm. I didn't expect much to come in - anticipating a story of wealthy high school kids embarking on an ocean cruise under a stern skipper. That is, what I imagined was a training film along the lines of something that concerned the training camp or the basic training, the type in which the sergeant instructor says: "My task is to get you out of your victorious civil ways ". Well, that's it, in a sense. Children start as children and end up as an organic group. But this is much more nosy than any training camp I've ever seen, outside of a deliberate comedy. Who did this thing? The air is full of slogans that belong, not in high school, but in third grade. The dialogue offends the ear. Jeff Bridges usually does a better job than average, but in this case his performance is mediocre. It brings nothing extra to the party, even if given its lines, it's hard to know how much it could do with them. The rest of the cast is indistinct and some of the children are painfully inadequate. There is a lot of tears and considerable crying. The best scene involves a dolphin. <br /> <br /> Immature clich√©s continue to the end. The Coast Guard is engaged in the role of the hard court at the hearing following the disaster. The interrogator does nothing but hit Bridges in the lead with his misinterpretations and the incorrect construction of events. "You let the crew drink alcohol, don't you?" (A couple of harmless drinks.) "And you didn't punish them, even if you punished them for killing a fish." (The dolphin business.) The technical details surrounding the sinking have remained obscure. What is a "white squall" anyway? And if it's as dangerous as Bridges claims, why wasn't the crew alerted and put on life jackets? But why go on? If "The Albatross" were a Dreadnaught, it would still be torpedoed and sunk by the ridiculous comic book script.
