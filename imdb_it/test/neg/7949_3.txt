Why redo the original "Assault"? In my opinion "Assault" was Carpenter's true masterpiece. It had all the elements that contained Carpenter's good films. External threat on a small group of individuals. People take the challenge because they are forced to do so. Isolation! He only remembers that the guns in Carpenter's original did not produce any sound, being therefore much more threatening than conventional devices. And now this remake. Focusing on the psychology of the "main character I" and his relationship with the main character II (evil but honorable). The anonymous threat in Carpenter's film has been replaced by a rather conventional conspiracy / corruption background. The "remakers" did not understand the main plot of the original. And so he produced something fairly ordinary.
