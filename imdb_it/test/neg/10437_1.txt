Have you ever read a book, then seen the movie, and you wonder: how did they ruin everything so badly? This is one of those. Huffaker's book, "Nobody Like a Drunken Indian" was great, incredibly fun ... this movie is not. It seems that nobody cared enough to move the direction so we worried about the characters. This film, which touches on some real concerns about Indians, makes you wonder why we have not seen any more comedies on the Holocaust or on slavery. Not well done.
