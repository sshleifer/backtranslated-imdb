I have already commented on this film (with the name of TheLegendaryWD). But I see that there are others who have commented since. All I can say is: WHAT THE F ** K!? "I can't believe that 16 people have commented on this film or seen this film. Add to this the fact that a couple gives them excellent reviews (probably the creators of the film that went to one of those places in a shopping center that provides internet services and has written a good review - since there is no way they could or could pay for their internet provider ... just watch their movie Although I continue to admit that I had a soft spot for this movie, I thought that some of the people who wrote this may have confused it with another ... until I read the reviews ... especially the person who identified the tag line on the front of the box: "The Ultimate in Front Lobotomy" (what is meant by "f ** k" anyway? frontal lobotomy?) ... I completely forgot about it until I read it in People, we are a select few ... I say we meet once at year to see this movie ... wait, does anyone still have it? If anyone has it please contact me ... I'm dying to get drunk.
