OK, let's see ... a handsome young stranger is new in town, and walks around the local waterfront. Meet a cute girl, meet the hateful leader of the local club of young vampires, they are dared to follow them in this cave, to conflict with the beautiful girl, an epic fight ensues ... <br /> <br /> No, it's not Lost Boys, although you'd definitely be interested in telling the difference, since I think that even carnival music is the same. (Do you have to pay for movie sampling fees?) The ending of this stinkbomb is also taken from the Lost Boys. The trick is below average, even for a low-budget thriller, the characters are one-dimensional, and just exactly how many "Oh, I had this horrible experience" adolescent angst scenes require a movie? Humor is flat and stupid, and everything else is sadly predictable. Yawn. <br /> <br /> The only scary thing about this turkey is the promise (threat) of a sequel, an idea that hopes every distributor in the country will drive a bet.
