Nothing that Carson Daly has ever said or done on this show has ever made me laugh, or even smile a little. I do NOT understand how this show has survived for so many years. <br /> <br /> Even the "funny" band member is just like one of those high school kids who thinks nobody is good enough to watch it. Daly and that guy are just arrogant brothers. It seems they don't even try to be a little funny. <br /> <br /> Wonderful and GORGEOUS spectacle. <br /> <br /> It makes my soul cry. <br /> <br /> I can't stress enough how much AWFUL is this show. Don't look at it But if you absolutely must, I advise you to scratch your eyes and clog your ears with cement in advance.
