A plot that is stupid beyond imagination. However, having said that, it must be admitted that the main actors play their roles as if it were Shakespeare. And this is how it should be. It is not their fault that the writer appears to be in a coma. <br /> <br /> Hats off to what is really a very smart performance by Joanna Kerns. It shows that just because it is not on the page does not mean that a role cannot be captured and excavated. And it does it tastefully. Good for her. <br /> <br /> Ditto for Christine Elise who is called to be little more than confused and whining, but goes far beyond what is asked of her by the script. <br /> <br /> And also at the Grant Show. A graduate of soaps by day and early evening (Ryan's Hope, Melrose Place). It is always versatile and undervalued. Its main drawback seems to be its aspect impossible to ignore. He is a robust, well-rooted actor, capable of much more than he is generally given the opportunity to do. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is basically a window dressing. <br /> <br /> The direction is adequate and the script, as I mentioned, is quite idiotic. <br /> <br /> Watch this to enjoy three good actors in the series that delight in performing some much needed scenery worlds. It is funny.
