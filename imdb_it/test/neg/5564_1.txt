I HATE THIS FILM !!!!!! I've never seen a garbage so complete and complete in my life !!! I live in France, so I discovered that I was at the forefront of watching this terrible movie. At first, it seemed nice, a bit like something from a cursed forest that chews people. Unfortunately, it turned out that it was something very different: a good start with a girl who meets a boy and all that is not, then the girl receives threatening messages in the form of crows locked in her bathroom (ridiculous), from that piece And on, the film starts to slide downhill very quickly with a lot of desperate shots in the process. The film ends with the sacrificial druids galore and the ugly and stinking ancient creatures who come back from the past to kill a few people. At that point a lot of questions crowded around my head: why on earth did they make that lousy monster come back? Do the druids look like freaks dressed in sheets? Why did they even take the trouble to make this movie ?? The "climax" of the film was so stupid that I laughed to the end: the "horrible" stinking monster fights with the two young women (who seem experienced kung fu masters) and the professor is split in two or something. What surprised me was that the monster was so slow and awkward in battle, wasn't it to be a god of war or something? However, the film of his death throws was a pitiful sight. Brief condensation of the contents of this film: Kung fu mayhem + druid stones + mysterious murders "Ã  la thriller" + ancient prophecies + bleak crow + clumsy old boned god of war + mad professor = complete and total, sick, boned, worm eaten, GODFORSAKEN, GODDAM, RECYCLED, FALSE, WANNABE, LUDICROUS SH * T !!!!!!!!! The things I learned from this movie: - Ancient war years are bad for kung fu. -All young women studying archeology at university in France are kung fu experts. - The professors are so hardy that they can survive by being cut in two by a mass-what-chamacallit saw without wounds.
