this movie is so incredibly terrible! everything was rubbish. you can't say anything good about this movie, acting, screenplay, directing, the effects are all as bad as the other. even wood could have done a better job than this. I seriously recommended that you stay away from this movie unless you want to waste about 100 minutes of your life or how long the movie has been. I forget. this is the first time I have written a comment on a film on IMDb, but this film was only on TV and I had to let the world of movie lovers know that this movie sucked balls !!!!!!!!! !!! so if you have any decency in you. go to rent a much better bad movie like the critters 3
