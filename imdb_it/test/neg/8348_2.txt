This film is a disaster in a catastrophic film. It is full of great action scenes, which are meaningful only if you throw away the whole sense of reality. Let's see, talk to the wise, the lava burns you; the steam burns you You can't stay near lava. Diverting a minor lava flow is difficult, not to mention a significant one. It scares me to think that some might actually believe what they saw in this movie. <br /> <br /> Even worse is the significant amount of talent that contributed to the making of this film. I mean, acting is actually very good. The effects are above average. Difficult to believe that someone read the scripts for this and allowed all this talent to be wasted. I think my suggestion would be that if this movie is about to start on TV ... look away! It's like a train crash: it's so terrible that once you know what's coming, you just have to watch. Take your eyes off and spend your time on more meaningful content.
