this is the most overrated show on television. I think people keep watching it because they feel they should, because it has become a bit of a "cool" show to watch and talk to your friends the next day at work or school. rarely manages to arouse anything more than a giggle and never provokes any sense of irony or thought on the part of the public. each bar is interchangeable with "bars" that seem to be taken from a hat. the complete lack of originality combined with the same spin-out it generated (see: American Dad) makes me doubt the intelligence of an audience that continues to hold this horrendous show on TV. I press the family boy without points and may God have mercy on his soul ...
