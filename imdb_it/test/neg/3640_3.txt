This show made me (and many others) hate their lives. Let's face it, Zoey is perfect; she's pretty, she gets good grades, everyone goes to her for advice, she's popular, she goes to a fantastic school with fantastic rooms. Reasons why I gave this show at 3: 1. Acting is horrible. Sometimes I just want to hurt the people who put these talented actresses (especially Victoria justice) on television. 2. The characters are incredible and mismatched. You have your typical popular girl. A lively girl, superficial, stupid, stereotyped, played by a horrible actress. Then you have a typical jock that is a little normal and actually nice. Then the smart and stereotypical girl who is a maniac and obviously does not fit her perfect popular friends. Then a rich and pretty boy who would have been happier looking in a mirror all day. So I want to be the actress played by another smelly actress. And finally a normal person type. 3. The plot is boring and lame. 4. I hate how spoiled these characters are. They can't just be normal! 5. Everything ends up being perfect for them, and we are all reminded of how much our lives stink.
