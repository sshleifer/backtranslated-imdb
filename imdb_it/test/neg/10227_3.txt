This is one of the most original and unclear films I've ever seen. Even if you didn't like the antecedents of this movie, "The Bad News Bears" and "The Mighty Ducks", they are destined to have done a better job than this. From the moment the new teacher greets her class and says "Don't worry about us, we are all losers", you can see everything that is coming twenty miles away for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> All the usual suspects are here. In addition to the spunky teacher, we have a group of those who should be captivating kids (they are snotty, yes, but not so affectionate), a small sheriff of cities they love to torment, an arrogant head coach of the winning rival team, etc. to the point of nausea. Only Olivia d'Abo as a new teacher shows some possibilities. I never cared much about Steve Guttenberg and his performance as the sheriff doesn't change things. Jay O. Sanders is a capable actor but his character, the rival coach, leaves him nothing to work with. We hope that the writer / director Holly Goldberg Sloan brings out something better next time.
