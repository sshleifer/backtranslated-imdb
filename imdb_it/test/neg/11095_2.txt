"An evil spirit takes over a girl and spreads panic in the Louvre museum" is all I think, the summary of the film and the film itself! Which I think is one of the worst French or non-French films ever made in film history! <br /> <br /> Nothing good here except the music (only credits!), some tender moments of (Sophie Marceau), and of course the last shot of the movie .. Not because the age of what ends seemed to be an infinite number of years spent watching THE CRAP but also being as perfect as a magical CGI job that was too good to be true here! <br /> <br /> By the way, I want to change the plot summary to be like this: "An evil spirit takes over some movie artists to make lousy movies" .. Just like this for sure.
