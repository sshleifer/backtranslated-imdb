My friend Zac has rented this movie for free since his mother works at a rental store. I still feel robbed, because I will never be able to recover those 100 minutes of my life. Having seen the first "Dark Harvest" the night before this vision, I expected to see at least a bad remake of the first movie. Mistaken. <br /> <br /> There is not a single scarecrow in the film (unless it contains the one on the cover of the box), nor are there any real death scenes. The film received the R rating from an 8-year-old girl who shouted "god d ** n" to her father. <br /> <br /> There is no amount of tequila that can make this film bearable. Believe me, we've tried.
