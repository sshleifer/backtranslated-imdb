I'm sorry to say that this film was one of the biggest disappointments of the year. Following one of the biggest disappointments in the story of pairing a movie monster, you'd think they'd learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation. The sequel falls into many of the same traps, the plot was completely forced, the dialogue was so bad that the film could be better in mute, and the action was artificial and far from the pounding heart of each original movie monsters. The best part of AVP-Requiem is in fact the trailer, which while passing through the film realizes that almost every single death and every really good shot of the film has already been shown in the trailer that leaves little to reveal and little to be excited. I gave the film an extra star to show the very sexy woman in the almost nude. the film was like a color-for-number sci-fi monster who also played on the fact that nothing was a surprise when it happened, because you saw it thousands of times before. the main failure of both these films is that the creators thought that setting the movies in our time would have made us interested in the story as if one day it could happen to us. but what attracted people when they released the arcade game during the day was that it took place in a futuristic version of the ALIEN time trilogy that allowed more than one suspension of disbelief. it is from here that future films must be inspired. because to be honest, seeing a maid killed by the ALIEN we all feared since childhood just doesn't do it for us. let the series return to its roots. learn from the former masters and don't joke with a winning formula trying to create a "new bold vision", we liked the originals for a reason, we want to see them again. Finally, the ending is the real time of the WTF of the whole film, * SPOILER * after the great climax, the survivors fell into an ambush by soldiers of the Special Ops who justify their horrible actions by saying "we were following orders" and then they turned on a coin and began to behave well and became saviors. then, after the long retreat with one of the survivors looking ominously in the skies, we cut the most bizarre cliffhanger I've ever seen, with characters you've never seen in the rest of the film (Save the Government Dude), then with all the subtlety of a punch on the face they reveal that there will still be another film with the hint of a plot that would make a fiction film look like the original film that blushes and raises its nose. So, in summary, if you have to choose between this movie and do any other activity on the face of the Earth, skip the movie and do the other thing instead.
