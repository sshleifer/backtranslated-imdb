"There are some things you don't do," says the joke about it, a 2003 David Zucker comedy about a young man caught in a horrible situation after another daughter named My Boss's Daughter, and it's the tag-line that should talk both for the people who made this garbage, and for those who thought about watching it. There are really some things you don't do, with the placement of almost all types of content found in My Boss's Daughter counting as objects that you shouldn't do to the movie medium by including them in your photo. My boss's Daugther is a sordid; horrifying; grotesque experience, a heavy and heavy piece that is childish beyond words and disgusting beyond all expression. To see it is to bear it, to endure it is to survive and to survive is a result all by itself ?? if any of the cast; writers; extra; Hell, even the guys who worked as runners on the set, helped him produce something as terribly poor as the earth, then it will be or because they were sent here by the devil himself to destroy the medium of the film or, it will be because they probably earned work on behalf of the Friedberg / Seltzer group. <br /> <br /> Daugther of My Boss, (which I am quite sure should be titled "My Boss" Daugther ", grammatically speaking, revolves around his unfortunate male protagonist, Tom Stansfield (Kutcher), and a night in the house of his boss as he chases that seemingly elusive "goal" that is his young, blonde daughter Lisa Taylor (Reid) - someone who works in the same department as an imposing Chicago building under the strict control of Jack Taylor (Stamp). Lisa very early, is taking the subway to work with all the other shmoses despite the fact that she owns a car and that her father is the boss of that damn company after trying to talk to her, but having her attempts thwarted by a smelly child and a blind dog more interested in Tom's horse than anything else, he finally got his chance in the office when it comes to a post-dark party elsewhere and that should be to go to her house to visit her - and yes, she still lives with her father. He thinks the 1960 Hitchcock movie, Psycho, with genre roles between Norman Bates and his mother, reversed and then played laughter. <br /> <br /> The distinguished character creation is painfully evident in the opening scene where Tom sits on the subway train and travels to work with his yuppie cohorts. They are a ruthless and thin group, which has made the bags of those unlucky enough to make them get stuck in the door in the subsequent morning run, without ever returning them. One day it happens to Tom, and his desire is to give it back, so that he can jump inside us that he-not-like-other-boys (!) This, how does he first see Lisa get out of the carriage and it is a little shy approaching her like other men treat the whole situation as if it were a breeze if they were in her position. This rather obvious and flat attempt to try to "take" part with Tom is uncomfortable with what is supposedly needed to earn a place among these colleagues of this company. <br /> <br /> however, close up as My Boss's Daughter reaches any level of film production. From a seemingly innocuous premise of a boy who meets a girl and wants to meet her, comedy comes from hell. Tom coming home will not see him invited to the party, but is accused of sitting home like Jack's owl and generally keeps himself out of the fray while maintaining a spotless home. The character of Terrance Stamp has been established means business in the most rigorous way, firing people for smaller things like preparing a bad cup of coffee. Jack is not a frowning businessman, he is a cleaning maniac; obsessed with control and a borderline sociopath in the arrangement of bear traps in the garden so as to keep children away from his land. You can imagine that when we enter his large and exquisite home with orders that nothing should go wrong, there will obviously be trouble. <br /> <br /> The film amuses itself with this premise of danger for about ten minutes. The first time someone uses the worktop to open a beer and mark the top of the pristine area, you can smile, but when half of the house is destroyed and Michael Madsen peed all over the carpet, you have your head inside your hands . Every joke in the film is set in an omnipotent and awkward manner before being interpreted in a way that is slower and more heartbreaking than the smooth and flawless one, the only thing missing while following the next gag is the sound effect of someone changing incorrectly gears on a car while clunks and creaks on the next fall. Among the gross exaggeration, the film takes time to roll along a path of romanticism pushed and mushy while Lisa and Tom bond as they talk about characters at work and off the job, and perhaps they have more in common than the first thought. For the time being, the film opted for gags and freaks full of jibes more than anything else when there is an entire scene that exists only to hit paraplegics and a stupid subplot to do with a head-wounded sports neighbor a blind date in which some really unwatchable gags are explained. All the while, the character of Stamp enjoys putting people down and asks if the simplest task is too difficult for them, which should be the common answer while channeling Jack Taylor: he was reading the script before too complicated: a concept for you, Stamp?
