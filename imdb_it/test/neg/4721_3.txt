Cult buyers are undoubtedly familiar with the term "video nasties". This was a famous British list containing all the films that could bring "damage" to the company when viewed by an irresponsible audience (dramatization). For blood lovers, this is an excellent checklist as it contains cruel and disturbingly realist inhuman films (Faces of Death, Cannibal Holocaust, Driller Killer) and outrageous and sick horror films (The Burning, Nightmare City, The Toolbox Murders) . With this in mind, it is quite rare to see "Night of the Bloody Apes" listed among the other "nasties". Certainly it's bloody ?? but the blood and violence are presented so badly that I can't imagine anyone being offended by it. And the silly plot (about a desperate doctor transplanting the heart of a gorilla into the dying son's chest) is not exactly what you would call disquietingly real, neither of them. All that remains is a very entertaining pulp horror film with a horrible acting and a useless sleaze. The makeup effects of the man-ape are ridiculous and there is no tension or atmosphere to be detected anywhere. Only pleasant if you're in the right mood, in other words. The few sequences that show detailed correspondences of lady-wrestling (which one of the main actresses makes for a living) are very interesting.
