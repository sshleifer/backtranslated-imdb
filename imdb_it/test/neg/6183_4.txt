I read all the free posts on this confusing semi-noir and am puzzled by the high regard for what looks, in the cruel light of 2007, a very poor RKO assembly line product. All that endless film of fish, waves, fish, waves has little to do with the central conflict and is limited to managing the execution time. The editing is decidedly careless: the scenes end and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with what preceded them. The dialogue bears the traces of the Odets origins: high-sounding metaphors that could never have come from the limited imagination of these everyday people. But what really surprises is the way the triangle is horribly overcrowded, on all sides. I love Stanwyck, but she growls and writhes and gets wild wildly - an unruly performance of several notches below her standard. Douglas, exaggerating being lovable, then runs into an aspiring homicidal fury and is equally friendly, like Ryan, who growls and cries unnaturally. The second least interesting pair provides at least one recognizable human behavior: Keith Andes, whose character is a species of Neanderthal by today's standards, yet is as smooth and persuasive as Stanwyck's brother (much younger, one presumed), Marilyn Monroe, like his girlfriend, is natural and unaffected. On the windswept Monterey coast (and all that the Monterey movie, though largely irrelevant, is interesting as a document of how the city was), amid all the overheated hysteria, these two are islands of sanity . One last point and a spoiler: maybe the Breen office put it in charge, but does anyone think the happy ending for a second? Stanwyck could be temporarily regressed into an obedient woman, but I give a month to the wedding.
