I haven't seen such a stupid and stupid movie for some time. It has absolutely no logic, no horror - it does not scare you, there is no suspense, it is not electrifying .. I mean that I did not even find a part of the film attractive ... <br /> <br /> I don't know what they were thinking when they made the film .. You watch the whole movie to find out that there is a plant that can walk, drag dead human bodies and eat human flesh. Not only that, but it can also speak, for example, of imitated sounds, such as a cell phone ringing or a human speaking ... so it is as if the plant emits the sound of a cell phone, so they look for the cell phone and discover that it is a plant. .. how smart of the plant to set up an ambush. <br /> <br /> This is clearly the level of creativity of a primary school child ... Bad !!!
