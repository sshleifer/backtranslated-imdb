This film was terrible. John Wayne is a brutal actor at times. The female protagonist who plays the role of "Maura" did a good job and did her best to make the scenes believable despite the inept, one-dimensional, beyond the action of Wayne. Seriously, did you see him when he should have talked in his sleep? Ridiculous. And his character became such a horrible person in the second part of the film and then did nothing to atone for his behavior and is still forgiven by everyone, including his grim nemesis, without even a "sorry". The story was completely unlikely. Should we have believed that two adult men, both huge successes in their respected fields, would sabotage a job and risk the lives of innocent men simply because they didn't like each other? You can randomly select any scene and it will probably let you shake your head in disbelief that someone has paid money to shoot this movie. It's a shame because the only other Wayne movie I've seen is the shooter and the good guy, both of which were great movies. Unless you are paid, don't worry about watching this.
