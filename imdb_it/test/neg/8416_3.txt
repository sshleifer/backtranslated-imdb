This is a silly parody of private eye thrillers as a writer (Michael Cain) is called a "ghostwrite" an autobiography of a colorful and waning Hollywood star (Mickey Rooney). Sometimes stupidity becomes hateful. This is not Cain at its best. Rooney is really exaggerated. Considerable support from Lizabeth Scott, Lionel Stander and the attractive Nadia Cassini. It is not easy to look at.
