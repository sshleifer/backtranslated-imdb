This film made me think ... of how I could write something without personally dissing the director and all the actors, who, as an Australian, are proud to have come out and made a film. <Br /> <br /> But the film itself? Let me tell you a story .... <br /> <br /> I found this DVD in my local rental shop yesterday and I had vague memories of the reviews when the cinema came out here, so I thought I'd give it a go. <br /> <br /> For some reason, I decided to look at the 'special features' before watching the movie itself, not something I usually do. I transformed the "making of" halfway, since I had enough tears to 'we are not so wonderful to put together such a strong film with such a raw attitude'. <br /> <br /> The movie? Ugh. Full of clich√©s and development of the pathetic character. The actors? Good guys, you are Australian and I applaud you. And, just as a footy team is as good as the coach who runs them, unfortunately you DO NOT have a script to work with. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film actually trivialized so many of the subjects that seemed to want to cover. I have seen many reviews here that refer to it as nothing more than a soap. Agree. <br /> <br /> Finally (and forgive me if I don't express it correctly), I was extremely disappointed that there were no optimistic nuances at all. Yes, we all know that life is full of difficult things, and yes, we know that things like incest occur, but I find it really difficult to applaud a film that doesn't have a single jewel in it. I believe that a director has the responsibility to put him there IN SOME SOME. Otherwise, the film is all based on the feelings of THEM and THEIR, they created it for themselves, not for an audience. <br /> <br /> I think it's the basis of why this film is not so great. The special features mention that the director wrote the script in a 36-hour session, the day after he tried to end his life. Well, it may have been cathartic for him to do this, however the film smells of self-indulgence when you know the story behind why it was written. "I feel horrible, I will write a film about feeling horrible." (Note: I read the interview with Andrew Urban, and I understood why Thalluri needed to write something to help him solve his problems, but I believe there is a line in the film that cannot be overcome: the line of making a films exclusively for your emotional needs, and I feel this is what happened involuntarily here) <br /> <br /> By his own admission, the director had no technical experience and, unfortunately, this makes the film like a film no more than twelve years of media project. <br /> <br /> Regarding the recommendations that this film should be studied at school, or that all teenagers should watch it - I'm not sure about that either. Because there is a VERY dangerous line at the end. I too have been to a place where I thought that someone who no longer has to "face life" is "lucky", but as an adult I fear that this line could be influential on a young spectator who was in a vulnerable state of mood. It may be there to promote the discussion, but again, it does not reflect any possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole. In fact, it almost indicates that there is more sadness to come. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen Elephant, but I could just find it, given all the comparisons here. <br /> <br /> Nothing personal here guys, I hope someday you can make another movie, and we all have to start somewhere, so forgive me if I've been too hard. I am glad that you are proud of what you have created, that in the end it is what life is all about. It is not a film I would recommend anyway. <br /> <br /> Oh, I liked the way time frames often clashed, I thought it was an interesting way of filming. <br /> <br /> But the whole "It is the quiet that you must look at" - we already know.
