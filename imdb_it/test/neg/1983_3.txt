I really like Kinski, he's a great actor. I saw this film because I heard that there are autobiographical aspects in this film. <br /> <br /> The film is full of symbols like a piano sinking in a river or strange shadow images on the walls. So the narrator always says abstract phrases like: "A child sells luck, but his stage is empty now". This is really disturbing and it wasn't really necessary, because everyone understands what this film is about. The film shows how Kinski's character treated the woman, and how he kept them under control. If there really are some aspects of Kinski's life in this story - then he was really a pig. So you don't need to watch this movie unless you want to see Kinski naked or if you love junk movies to laugh.
