I made sure to watch this movie because it's a science fiction movie from the 50s - one of my favorite genres. Unfortunately, while I was looking forward to seeing insecure eyed aliens or power-hungry conquerors, the aliens in this movie were a huge disappointment! First, you only see one at the beginning (and it seemed pretty ordinary) and you even have a little taste of a spaceship! Second, the alien was neither the evil conqueror nor the benevolent friend of humanity - but a real odd ball. And finally, the plot itself seemed so stupid, full of sermons and heavy as to arouse more yawns than chills. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, five people from five different parts of the world (Germany, Great Britain, Russia, China and the United States) are kidnapped by an alien. The alien provides each of them with devices that can destroy all life on the planet, if they wish, because the alien admits that his race of people would love to inhabit the Earth, but they themselves will not kill to get it. So, he returns them all. While it is 100% obvious that nobody wants to use these devices, the alien then announces the identities of the five on TV without saying that the weapons are so powerful! So all the militarists of the world want to find the five and force them to reveal how the weapons work. Much of the rest of the film consists of some of the five hiding and one is tortured to reveal how the device works - how the Soviets want to use it !!! This part of the film seemed pretty stupid to me. Of course, the USSR was a wicked and corrupt nation (sorry, but it is a fact - especially under Stalin), they never thought of using it as they did in the movie! Later, one of the five (the German scientist), somehow understands that devices can also be used to kill only all the evil ones who hate freedom. So, he uses it to wipe out all the bad Commies and presumably others who were anti-freedom and the world then becomes a paradise !! Preach, silly and full of holes in the plot - this film does not deserve your time, even if it is an interesting relic simply for the way it deals with communism - in particular, the tensions between NATO and the Soviets.
