I can't remember a more banal, disturbing and superficial film, in other words a real movie of the worst kind. How can someone watch this movie and recommend it to others? Only if they don't like to admit they made a mistake. It seems to sum up the worst female aspirations. No real substance for everything happy and superficial. Yes, this will satisfy the masses. Well, not this member of the masses. What a trivial drivel load. I wanted to leave the cinema within 5 minutes of starting. And to think I paid Â£ 7 to see this! I think this still represents the movie idiot as with most media these days. So I like a little reality in my musicals, call me sad or what?
