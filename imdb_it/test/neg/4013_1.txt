This video has audio intended for someone to listen to while you sleep. And the same can be said for the video. <br /> <br /> Will Morgan and his wife pretend to be aware of the minimum wages? With a camera that rolls? And does his crazy little crap complain? Give me a break. They are both rich. They are sitting in their fake $ 350 a month apartment to shoot this movie with their $ 1,000 a month for each video team of 12. <br /> <br /> Respect Morgan, but now his experience of "30 days "it is nothing more than trying to deceive all the voluntary spectators who are willing to be deceived. <br /> <br /> C'mon Morgan, are you filming doing a job of $ 6.00 per hour and are you paid by naive employers who don't see those big cameras shooting everything ?? And don't we think you don't get paid under the table?
