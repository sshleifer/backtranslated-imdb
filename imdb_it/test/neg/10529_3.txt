I really tried to appreciate this movie about a doctor who has the chance of a new life with a young woman if he can come to terms with his wife's death. I suppose it was a strange light romantic comedy, but the theme is a bit uncomfortable for me. <br /> <br /> But putting that aside, I found that the dialogue was too much like a theatrical game despite being based on a novel and also, the mediocre acting was embarrassing to look at especially from the young protagonist Vincent Spano. <br /> <br /> I have tried to recover all the films of the eighties that I lost during that decade. It was in my opinion that the eighties fans seem to focus on the same main canon of films that usually present the actors and the actresses of the pack and neglect the other films like the Creator that have fallen through the cracks. But in the case of this function I must say that I can understand it. Not all of these films from the 1980s were magical and the Creator is the proof.
