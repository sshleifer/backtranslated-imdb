This is the debut of Jonas Quastel as a director and, to be honest, he shows. It seems that he threw in every kind of photographic makeup he learned at the film school to try to add a style to a poorly written script, which helped him write! Film has Lance Henriksen and a group of others looking for a plane that crashed into his daughter in the northwestern Pacific and also a special car that his company has built and also wants to recover. The first 5 minutes of the film are fuzzy or shaky or blurred! Quastel tries to capture the "Blair Witch" mode with these kinds of shots and they become annoying very quickly. And there are also POV shots ranging from "Wolfen" and "Predator". These shots are from Sasquatch's point of view (POV). Sometimes the editing is very rough, as a scene seems to move in the middle. I heard that this film was shot in about 12 days and I suppose instead of "starting over from one to another" they just started again without stopping and edited the scene together. And the rest of the film is a fade from one scene to another. There are so many scenes that vanish that I lost count. Now, the naked scene with Andrea Roth. Is not she. you can easily see a double body. And you know you're watching a bad movie "B" when a hot girl decides to go to the nearest thermal spring and take a bath in the middle of the peaceful northwest. ******** ALERT SPOILER ******** <br /> <br /> And the Sasquatch itself is not bad when you do not see it and he is just a blurred image behind some trees or bushes but when you finally see it at the end, of course you're disappointed. First of all, it's not that high. The actor who plays Sasquatch is just hairy at certain points on his body. It's a partial dress! And he's bald! I have heard that a make-up artist died during filming and perhaps this explains why the costume seems to be done quickly. Some of the sound effects that come from the Sasquatch are nothing more than the familiar roaring of the lion that we have all heard in other films. I must admit that Henriksen is not bad. Yes, he is working with poor material, but he has one of those interesting faces that can actually improve certain moments in the film. People keep saying that a good Bigfoot movie has never been made, but I don't agree. I've always said that "The Creature From Black Lake" is a good movie and I highly recommend it. I'm a sucker for a Sasquatch movie but this is just for fun.
