I don't understand the humor in this film. I also found the way the Koreans were portrayed in that film offensive, although it is actually just a caricature of the Koreans in those areas. First of all, the actors are Japanese and they make the most rude expressions of the Koreans in that movie. I dislike the way these people are expressed. I felt anger just watching that scene, and how they were so poorly interpreted in the film. Humor only lasts for a laugh, and then you don't understand why it's even fun. It is a crude humor with the most disgusting representation of society. Overall, I found it to be an offensive film ... Maybe it was just because I had never lived in the "hood" or seen any "hood" movie, but I don't want to do it either.
