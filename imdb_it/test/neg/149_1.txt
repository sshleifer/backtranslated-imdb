I just watched this "movie" and actually made me want to write my first comment on IMDb.com, even though I've been a user for over 9 years. The reason I looked at this is because I like splatter movies and sometimes I like to test my limits and see what really scares me. first of all, the blood in this film didn't shock me, not even the idea that someone invented it and turned it into a movie - what really shocked me, is that there seems to be a market for this kind of crap. don't get me wrong - I'm all against censorship, but this film seems to have been created for a kind of fetish crowd that seems to start from this type of sh * t.it didn't give you the same kind of disgust and guilt that it was proved after seeing films like "august underground". that movie is terrible to watch, but at least you have the feeling that the filmmakers want to show you how vile the violence is. in the case of "niku daruma", it seems to have been done strictly to arouse people. I prefer films that impress, because they are well made and thought, like the films of Gaspar Noe, or Takashi Miike, or Funny Games or Man Bites Dog - those movies will stay with you for a while. I will have forgotten this movie by tomorrow, and the only thing that will remain with me, is the thought, that somewhere out there, there are people getting excited by watching this sh * t. if you read this, please check yourself in the next hospital or shoot yourself - this obviously does not apply to blood hunter dogs, who simply love the splatter. you are strong! peace
