The maximum risk is quite surprising for a person who has seen his films later. Director Ringo Lam has made an average action film, which can be compared to most other medium-quality action films, which is a special predicate for a Muscles from Brussels film. It has a fairly elegant style, an interesting atmosphere and, last but not least, the beautiful Natasha Henstridge. Even VanDamme doesn't make you cry for his acting, he does a relatively good job. Obviously you can't compare the Maximum Risk (oh, what a creative title!) To `Ronin`, but after seeing 'Knock off' it's a damn good movie ... in special standards, of course.
