I just have to comment on this film because I voted for 4, and I think it's pretty high for a soft-soft movie. The real storyline is kind of a hokey (who would you expect otherwise) but Hafron is so incredibly fun and offers everything in a cyborgish voice, so it's easy for him. Whoever wrote the script certainly had a certain spirit! I must have laughed out loud ten times, and that's no reason anyone should take this movie. The only softporn movie that I saw that had some merit in addition to the beautiful women (and believe me, Emmanuelle is so beautiful ... just look at the cover!) <br /> <br /> Any film that I can entertain considering how much the plot was poor and the acting is very bad, even considering that the film was not made to entertain artistically, so to speak, it has at least a four in my book. I mean, who wouldn't look at it before stopping! Or will my mother shoot?
