This film can't decide what it is - a soft porn movie or a science fiction movie. Not enough plot for a real movie, but too much for a porn. <br /> <br /> In a very distant galaxy, a good princess (we know she is good because she has long blond hair, she wears a white toga, she is polite, and is sadly plotting on her dying mother when we see her for the first time) vault) inherits the kingdom from its elder sister, who is bad (and we know this because she has dark hair and wears too many tricks, abuses her male sex slaves, sneers and curls her lip all the time, and imperiously speaks of the horrors that will perpetrate when she is the queen). The evil princess gets angry and tries to organize a coup, but the good sister goes away to Earth. Obviously, buck naked materializes in a bar during a race of wet t-shirts. It really goes downhill from there. The acting is ridiculous, the dialogue seems to be written for a porno, and the general plot is ridiculous. There is not even enough skin to make the type of person who looks at this for the skin happy. I love the "good" bad movies, and that's not even funny in a "bad movie" level.
