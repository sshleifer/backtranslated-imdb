Some spoilers **** A soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica approach intimacy, it's a beautiful, low key, truly erotic scene. I also loved the soundtrack and soft and muted cinematography. I am not clear if the curious stop and start the film structure, since they are originally digested in serialized form (the announcer describing the action in sections is rather annoying). My biggest problem with this film is the rather absurd representation of a transwomen and her life. Of course, she must be shown as a sex worker (what else), battered, impracticable, absurdly bubbly / feminine, completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and unable to make any interpersonal attachment in the world. Moreover, she is always shown with a two-day beard growth (for some strange reason) as to emphasize how beautiful her life is. And he's waiting to get a gender reassignment surgery when he apparently didn't do anything else to make his transition. In truth, the character looks like a drag queen, not someone in the middle of the transition. <br /> <br /> These are the typical fantasies of people from the outside that are not really connected to the transpeople. The fetishization of the film's GRS surgery is a way to objectify the people who are going through the transition. I was not impressed by this aspect of the film. At the very least, why not have the character played by someone who is truly transgender ... I thought the male actor who portrayed Veronica was ok, but not better than that. Much better was the woman who portrayed Charlotte, a very complex character full of energy, self-loathing, desire and contradictions. If she was so fascinated by someone with a feminine energy, a Charlotte could go out to a bar for women in two seconds and find her. Yes, she was attracted to Veronica but more like an abstract idea of ​​someone with masculine / feminine characteristics (a gentle touch but with a good punch), not as a unique person. Yes, what A Soap says about love is often adorable and moving, but that does not mean that an already stereotyped minority should be stereotyped a little more in the process. <br /> <br /> This film also shows that the Danes are bad dancers. For such a promising premise (best performed in a film like "Different For Girls") the final film is a disappointment.
