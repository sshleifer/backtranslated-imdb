"Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is one of Hitchcock's first not too known American films. But if "Lifeboat" (which unfortunately also belongs to this category) is an undervalued masterpiece, not all films signed by the master of suspense at that time (the early 1940s) really deserve a visit. And to tell the truth, not discovering this film is not really a loss. <br /> <br /> "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is a classic and traditional comedy, where it is rather difficult to find the touch of Hitchcock. Perhaps you can see his shadow (which is not much) in the cruelty that Carole Lombard is able to do (but it is well hidden in an impersonal package), in a scene of vertigo in which two of the characters are trapped on top of a fair attraction and perhaps in the character of the mother. And this is all! Even for Hitchcock fans, there's little to connect. <br /> <br /> And for amateur comedies, there's not much more: none of the situations is exaggerated enough to be really fun, and we're far from Hawks's masterpieces, for example. And if one or two scenes are pretty funny, there isn't even the most fun in Hitchcock's filmography, which created comic situations in almost all of his films (even "Psycho" could be considered full of very dark humor). So, there is very little to save in this film, which can bother no one (or maybe just both Hitchcock's hardcore fans and screwball comedy, who are in love with Carole Lombard), remains one of the first American Hitchcock not too well known films.
