This is one of a rare movie, where instead of a bowl of popcorn you should watch it with a bottle of vodka. To be completely honest we are a group of people who really know the man, Mo Ogrodnik, and we decided to drink fools ourselves for this movie. <br /> <br /> The cinematographic aspect of the photography by Wolfgang Something seems to have left out both close-ups and breasts. . There is also the beetle that beats. As Violet would have said: "This (plastic peen) gets on your bottom". Mouse and subsequent rat porn are fabulous. <br /> <br /> Okay. So if you're still reading, let's explain who we are. Mo Ogrodnik teaches at NYU and we are a group of his students, who, finishing a film lesson with her, decided to poop themselves and watch the directorial debut here. He also wrote Uptown Girls. I can't tell you how much was hammered in our skulls. So this film is rather the experience. At the bottom of this post will be a drinking game that we created for this movie. <br /> <br /> About 13 minutes in this game, none of us could see straight. The huge amount of Dido in the first thirty minutes has created enough reasons to drink to pacify an elephant. There was something secretly pleasurable about seeing two underage girls hit by a Kurt Cobain in an absolutely contextless context, except for his mysterious convenience store scene where it was oh-so-natural when reading a local newspaper. Because that's what we all do. The heart-shaped glasses were deliciously derived from Lolita. And something in that provocative scene of the naked chit-up suggests the story of the director of pornographic homosexual experiments. We wish we were joking. <br /> <br /> Enough intellectual contemplation. ON THE DRINKING GAME! This will ensure that the viewing experience is positive. It's very simple, and will most likely send at least one member of your group to immediate care. <br /> <br /> The Mo Ogrodnik / Ripe Drinking Game: 1. Each time you see something related to pornography, take a drink. 2. Each time you see the author's name Mo Ogrodnik, take a drink. 3. Sex. 4. (plastic peen) require two drinks. 5. Every time someone points a gun at another character, take a drink. - At this point you will probably need to fill / pee any piss remaining from your body.- 6. Whenever there is blood (INCLUDING "LADY BLOOD"), please take a sip! 7. The underused hula-hoop girl requires a drink per second. 8. Free use of the "magical black man" requires a drink. 9. If you can't understand the line, KEEP DRINKING, Beyotch. 10. Whenever you are able to predict a line, take a drink. Trust us. It's easy. <br /> <br /> That's it, internet! Keep drinking, and try not to make it. <br /> <br /> - Hawaiian Smirnoff Punch, Jr.
