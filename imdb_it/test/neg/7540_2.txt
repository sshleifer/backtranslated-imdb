The film is set in Newcastle upon Tyne in the north east of England, the city where I was born and raised. The film is also fundamentally dishonest - the way it presents the city, the children, but above all the men of the city. In this film they are all stupid, violent, thieves, hooligans. <br /> <br /> I suppose I can comment on the plot (predictable), the performances (with unattractive competence), the direction (lazy and unimaginative), but for me it's all irrelevant to the director's insult city ​​and its people. <br /> <br /> So the invitation in my summary to the director and writer, Mark Herman, to leave the northeast.
