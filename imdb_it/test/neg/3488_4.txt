One thing I noticed about British horror films of the 70s is that they don't stand up to the repeated views of THEATER OF BLOOD, like all of Amicus's anthology films. Add THE BEAST IN THE CELLAR to the list <br /> <br /> Much of the drama in this film revolves around the construction of a revelation of the plot at the end. Once you know what the revelation is, it becomes a rather flat film. It opens with a pretty good hook, but after that we are treated with long and boring sequences of two old ladies who speak little. Correct me if I'm wrong, but how many people watch a horror movie expect a couple of old ladies to talk a little? The only type of interest that can be found in THE BEAST IN THE CELLAR is the anti-smoking position. Some people have mentioned that this is an anti-war or anti-military film, but be careful and you will see that every time a squaddie turns on a fly, it is killed. Rather strange, considering that attitudes towards smoking were not nearly as hysterical as they are today
