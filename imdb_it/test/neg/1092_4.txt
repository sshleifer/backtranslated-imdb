My mother didn't let me watch this movie when I was in my second year, because she said she was too violent. Well, years later, and the only reason I remember this movie is because of my mother, I stayed awake watching it on PBS. Well, maybe the growth after all this year led to the great disappointment of this film, but I found it lame. It hasn't aged well, and this has made the acting erratic, huge incredible holes in the script, but there are some interesting scenes like car chases and a great shooting. I will not stay for this movie again.
