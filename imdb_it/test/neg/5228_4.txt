Based on a novel by Stephen King, NEEDFUL THINGS provides the intrigue and eeriness to keep you in your place. A mysterious man (Max von Sydow) arrives in the city and soon becomes the most talked-about citizen. Could it be that the devil himself opened shop as an antique dealer in a small town in Maine? von Sydow is masterful and dynamic in this role that dominates the screen. Also starring Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedelia. Harris is constant and Bedelia deserves your attention. Also in support I am J.T. Walsh and Amanda Plummer. Not the best, nor the worst adaptation of King's horror on screen.
