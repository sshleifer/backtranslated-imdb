What a waste of time! I expected better from Cameron Diaz! I guess it wasn't his fault that he was in a terrible movie. the film does not capture the beauty of Europe ... and has not been successful in guiding the audience in suspense or wonder. weak attempt at narration and narration - dialogue is boring and has not been able to convey what I sometimes think simplicity is beauty. no love, energy, electricity on the screen. sin !!!!!!!! 1
