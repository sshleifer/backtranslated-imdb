Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a film about a girl possessed. Should I describe the plot again? The Exorcist and The Exorcism of Emily Rose are two terrifying terrifying films. Classics (IMO). Blackwater Valley Exorcism (BVE) is not. Not by a long shot. It certainly isn't as terrible as a cheap copy of The Exorcist could have been. From the beginning to the end it has the feeling of a "made for Sci-Fi channel" production. It's one of those movies that will probably be faked and ridiculed on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (or a similar show). <br /> <br /> The make-up and the effects were absolutely ridiculous. The acting was terribly ugly. There wasn't a single performance that didn't make my eyes roll or giggle. Oh, except maybe for Jeffery (Re-Animator) Combs as the sheriff. The script wasn't so terrible, but it certainly wasn't anything special. <br /> <br /> It seems that through most of the film everyone is more focused on who is sleeping with whom than the one with the demon girl in the other room. Oh, there was something I learned from this movie. Apparently if your teenage daughter is possessed by a demon, then all you have to do is lock them in the room. Come on, come on. And if your daughter is possessed, don't worry too much because this makes them talk with funny voices, eat rabbits, try to stare at you and put the smoke machines in their bed. Besides this there is nothing to worry about. Apparently it was owned by a low-cost D-List daemon. <br /> <br /> There was none of the horrible actions made by A-List demons such as the crucifix report, painful body distortions, or even projectile vomiting. > <br /> Totally laughable movie. Not even a discount rental is worth it. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
