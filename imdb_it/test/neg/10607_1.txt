Pure shit, decent cinematography ... I liked some colors. That aside, this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Boring, lifeless, I've never been interested in any of the characters. I kept waiting for a real plot to be formed and the film took the rhythm. Nothing has ever happened! I think they spent too much time working on hair and wardrobe, forgetting that at that time there was a movie.
