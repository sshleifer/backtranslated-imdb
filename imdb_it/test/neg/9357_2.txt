I was very disappointed in this film. Twice I was tempted to go out because some parts of the film were so demoralizing and depressing. The film contains elements that allude to all the deaf things in life (pornography, murder, suicide, fornication, hatred, gang war). The graphic nature of the violence in this film was particularly disturbing. <br /> <br /> And Richard Dutcher does a great disservice to the LDS Church in retaining missionary attitudes, commitment, spirituality and obedience as unfocused and poor. /> <br /> My biggest objection to this film, however, is that it is the exact opposite of a wellness film. <br /> <br /> Dutcher's Army's One was in place. His city of Brigham was pretty good. This film, in terms of casting, acting and drama, was the best. But in terms of inspiration or building it was as terrible as it could be. In fact, this film has so demoralized me that I'm sorry I went. I lost interest in supporting Dutcher more and more in an LDS-themed movie with a ticket purchase.
