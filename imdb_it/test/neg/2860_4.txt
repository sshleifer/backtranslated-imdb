Child's Play has created a new horror genre, THE KILLER DOLLS, Some of these films don't have too much money to make it but I think the only film that makes Chucky's shadow is this. Ok it's a typical video or TV product but Pinocchio is not real and the murderer is the child. Children's imagination is too big and this movie plays with it. The roles are good and Candance Mckenzie is great. <br /> <br />
