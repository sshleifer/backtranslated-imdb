This is the worst movie of all time, no doubt, and Schindler's List, actually had more laughter. Not only that, it tells you how little fun this movie is and how big SL is, considering it's heartbreaking and contains 1 laugh. I wish I could meet "Yahoo Serious" so I can strangle him personally, for this and all the other very, very, very bad movies I've ever been in. There are also very few things to say about Australia, as they like this stupid fruit. Don't get me wrong people (Mel Gibson) from Australia are fantastic, they brought us Mad Max. It makes me very sick to people like this garbage, (a review I just read said it was "very funny", disgusting, it's not so). I, personally, will boycott this movie and start an online petition to ban and burn all Yahoo Serious movies to be, and I stress this, so DELAYED. <br /> <br /> These are just my personal thoughts, no doubt they are shared by everyone who has seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Note: if you are forced to watch this movie, in Clockwork Orange style, call me to commit to euthanasia for free.
