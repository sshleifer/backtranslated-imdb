An expedition party composed of quarrelsome and hateful jerks makes trekking in the dangerous African jungle in search of both a fortune in diamonds and a missing young woman named Diana (the lively brunette Katja Biernet, dressed only with a succinct loincloth that sports a lot of his warm and curvy body) which is worshiped as a goddess by a primitive mortal tribe called Mabutos. The director / screenwriter, Jess Franco, fails to inject any style or vigor into the generally bla and tortuous procedures, allowing the slow rhythm of crawling on an often painfully slow clip and staging the rare action scenes with a singular lack of skill and panache. The bad dubbing, the excessive amount of grainy "National Geographic" films, grooves, jazz lounges, terrible acting, talky, incident-free narrative, warm soft-core sex scenes and static photography don't even help make a difference. Fortunately, there are a lot of tasty free nudity on sight to relieve tedium to a reasonable extent: besides the delicious Biernert, both Aline Mess as fierce, evil high priestess Noba and Mari Carmen Nieto as the conniving and treacherous Lita are equally easy on the eyes . Even the beautiful jungle scenery is very beautiful. But overall this picture appears as a barely edible and therefore immediately forgettable foam.
