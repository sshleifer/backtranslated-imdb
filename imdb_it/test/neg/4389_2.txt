A stupid comedy for teenagers that turns a serious misunderstanding that includes (but not limited to) a prostitute who is confused with a foreign student, a girl who beats, a girl who loves a gay, and the straight boy who loves her and gossip. None of the following is fun or even fun. The use of Nation Lampoon to be hilarious in the day. Now the name is sadly synonymous with shit. And this is no exception. I thought Topenga was pretty when she was in "Boy Meets World", but it seems like she let herself go (and yes, I know she has a name, but in the fact that she doesn't do anything else, she will remain as Topenga) <br /> <br / > My Grade: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kati Lohmann remains topless; Boti Bliss relies on a double body (BOOOOO !!!)
