I don't remember too much about this movie, except that there was a clearly free destruction of the devices (lamps). Almost all the fighting scenes included the useless and unbridled destruction of useful lighting fixtures, even if they were equipped with shades of cheese, 70s style, to maintain the temporal setting of the story. On one occasion, the destruction of a raucous lamp occurs in a scene of domestic struggle among the brothers both in the living room and in the dining room of the mother's house, with the slots in both rooms. Still, the most damaging destruction occurs moments later in the office of a bookie and includes, but is not limited to, the overthrow of an appliance with a ceramic horse head base, which is then disintegrated and the severe dent of a cylindrical shadow like a type falls back into us during another punch fight. Later, this lamp is also overturned when the boy is hit, causing further damage to the plasticized color. <br /> <br /> While this film encourages a particularly wasteful attitude towards lamps, it must be borne in mind that lamps, regardless of their economic or clumsy construction, heavy appearance, are still valuable for the lighting they provide. However, if I ever feel the need to indirectly break a lamp, I highly recommend this film.
