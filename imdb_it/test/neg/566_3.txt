I loved the first 15 minutes, and I loved some of the dialogues in the courtroom - which turned out to be the best showcase for the director's method of directing the method - but this film ultimately disappoints. Although considered a mere metaphor for the oppressor / oppressed dynamics that were and are prevalent in the relationship between the US government and its "disobedient" citizens, it still lacks punch and credibility, and eventually let me look at my watch hoping that the obvious ending would have already happened. <br /> <br /> And for the record: despite rumors circulated about the contrary, this film has never been banned in the United States (I cannot comment on the rumors of United Kingdom censorship, but I am suspicious). Hollywood refused to release it after its first film festival, and I am more than willing to believe that the Nixon government had any influence on this decision; however, the fact that it never appeared on American television is simply a reflection of the way of doing business of this rather attentive and publicized medium. Regarding the present, you can have your personal copy of the DVD delivered to your home via Amazon in a few days.
