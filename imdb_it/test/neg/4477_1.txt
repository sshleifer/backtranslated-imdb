I really didn't look forward to this title. It looked and seemed fun. The idea that someone made a monster movie on the 50s might have been worth a laugh, but instead this title is just boring. First of all, there is almost no Froggg in the whole movie which is the biggest disappointment. I have to sit for over 75 minutes of drama and limping dialogues to get some glimpse of the Froggg cradling a naked chick. Why? Furthermore, the film lacks a funny plot. I mean give me something that is a little more interesting than a simple group of talking heads. I wanted to see some hot chicks looking for the creature in the swamp, I wanted to see some cuties being dragged into his den in desperate need of rescue (Creatures from the Black Lagoon stuff), I wanted to see some stupid action scenes of the Froggg is doing a killing spree , or maybe he's escaping a stupid trap. Something exciting! Damn, have fun, be creative! Who wants to sit through endless and tiring dialogue scenes in a creature movie? My advice to directors: go on, your concepts are good, but your performance must be much more inspired. Have fun with the creature, put humor in the action and, most importantly ... put more creatures in a creature movie !!!
