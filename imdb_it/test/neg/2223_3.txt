Compared to the next ARABIAN ADVENTURE by director Kevin Connor, this is a masterpiece. However, this is not saying much. A THE EARTH'S CORE, in fact, is a stupid fantasy adventure in which Peter Cushing - who seems to be strong - and some other actor (who I don't know) uses a gigantic excavation machine called "Iron Mole" towards the center of the Earth - only discover that the interior of the Earth is pink and populated by monkey-like creatures that have enslaved humans. There is also a giant bird that controls the monkeys through telepathy, and we come to see it blinking in the foreground throughout the film. Above all, Cushing and his name also meet the beautiful Caroline Munro in the underground caves. And here's what I really have against this little movie: why oh, because every time Munro is in a movie, he only gets approx. 5 minutes of screen time? In the SPY THAT LOVES ME, MANIAC, DRACULA OF 1972, GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD - always she is in the background! How can Kevin Connor think we'd rather listen to Peter Cushing's fake accent and watch a ridiculous monkey-man whose voice sounds like a scratched CD rather than looking at the beautiful Munro? I don't understand. Please, someone directs a film where this English brunette is always on screen!
