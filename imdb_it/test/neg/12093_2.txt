I really like Ryan Reynolds and Hope Davis and actually had great hopes of watching this last night on DVD. Mainly while trying to avoid reviews until I look at myself and form my opinion A big mistake! My 2/10 is for the first segment which in all honesty is pretty decent and if they had made the film about the characters of only section 1, it could have risen above 5/10. Once moved to TV, reality shows the area smelled up to the sky. Ryan Reynolds has marvelously captured the essence of a marginal actor, but as a gay television writer and famous game creator / devoted father he was definitely less effective. From the blurb on the box I was expecting a flashback thriller along the lines of "Memento" - unfortunately this is by no means close to the standard one in the film.
