The only reason one or more users watched this movie was because they belonged to the crew, they were friends of the crew, or they were obsessive fans of Lance Henriksen or Lorenzo Lamas. I personally follow the "cult of Lance", so I was disappointed to find that, despite being the headliner, it is only in name. Playing with the rich criminal Newcastle, Lance is a joy to watch, but his entire screen time is relegated to the beginning of the film. Newcastle made a 747 coup including Ketchum (Lamas) and a group of forgettable characters. The biggest shock for this viewer was the fact that the pre-robbery scenes weren't that bad. With the exception of Aviva Gale, a bit hateful and rather confused, who every time showed off the finesse of an elementary school actress, the acting was decent, and none of the jokes really made me shudder. <br /> <br /> But once the robbery has taken place, the film falls asleep. Not only is their plan the most ridiculous thing ever captured in a movie, but it is dragged on too long. This is not a very deep movie, and you have to fill your 90 minutes, but these scenes are so boring that I almost nodded at two in the afternoon. A particular sequence in which we watch each of the characters perform the same task over and over again is particularly difficult to overcome. The name of the film is "Rapid Exchange", but the exchange is far from rapid - it is too long and inflated to extremes. Maybe it would have worked if any of the characters had real personalities, but come on, there's just so much you can ask for a live show on Showtime Extreme. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there are several laughs, intentional and unintentional (Lorenzo Lamas is apparently a master of disguise, which creates a couple of incredibly bizarre scenarios), and Lance returns at the end of the film, although for a short period of time. It's a bad movie, and I probably shouldn't have told you that, but it's not the worst thing I've ever seen. I wouldn't put it too high on the list of Henriksen films, since it was in some real gem with a longer display time, and in both cases the film loses a lot of steam when the robbery starts, but the best thing I can say for Rapid Exchange it is that the last two films I saw before were mainstream Mainage and overrated, pretentious Crash - and this was better than both.
