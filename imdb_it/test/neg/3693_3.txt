The plot of this film is very thin and there is not much acting. Val Kilmer - I don't know why he agreed to make this film - he plays a secondary role as a gang leader. In short, the film is boring to watch. <br /> <br /> A boy, who looks like a professor of archeology / religion, is exploring an underground area of ​​Moscow, which has a history linked to the construction of railways and the Bolshevik revolution. A church tragedy in that history makes "spiritual" exploration and spirits of malicious intent haunt the underground ruins. A friend of the professor decides to find his friend underground and hires a couple of Russian guides. The entire film is based on this plot and contains many repeated shots of the underground, and some effects of the camera; very similar to those seen in "Day Watch", "Night Watch", etc.
