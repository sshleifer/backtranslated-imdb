When you look at the cover and read about it, a completely different kind of film comes to mind than what you get here. Then again maybe I read the summary of the other movie called "Mausolem", instead, because there were two films of this title released in the same period with both plots that had key elements in common. Anyway, reading things about that movie here I know I've seen this and not that and that movie is even less what you could imagine a movie with that title would be about. I'll be honest, I expect a zombie type photo and you get it to some extent in this movie. However, there are more things that involve occult and strange powers like the initial scene of people being taken away by the coroner at the beginning of the film. The film also has the old theme of children going somewhere they don't belong to for having some crazy party, in this case it's actually a mausoleum. I don't think the other film really has that key role in the lead role in the film and I see that even the score for this film is higher, but it wasn't the film I was expecting.
