I couldn't bear to look at much of this shit. This is your standard stuff that some boring women love - old drama of the English era with many costumes and cliché characters that seem to be ripped out directly by Oliver Twist or some other Dickens novel. This uses the usual clichés of the Victorian era. Certain idiotic people really think that the whole emotional torture of that culture that is so bloody repressed is somehow charming and romantic. This is sap, pure and pure garbage and boring as watching the grass grow. As such it is perfect for women who crave some sort of romantic English snoozer campaign in a Victorian setting, but for this man this movie is nothing but cruel and unusual torture and punishment to watch a bunch of boring boring scenes with non-original characters who speak in that miserable forced and fake English accent.
