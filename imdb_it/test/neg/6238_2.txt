It's been a long time since I've been to the cinema as lame and boring as this. It is one thing to have a slow rhythm in which the characters are progressively developed, or some aspects of the film are clearly enhanced by such stimulation (such as "Lost in Translation"). However, there is a difference between slow and stalled progression, as happened in this case, I imagine that from the look on Helen Mirren's face she must have been upset by the disappearance of her husband !! Surprise, surprise !! What a wonderfully creative moment the meeting of the mistress and wife was. (sarcasm) And in what fantastic way the whole story fell apart at the end, truly a masterpiece.
