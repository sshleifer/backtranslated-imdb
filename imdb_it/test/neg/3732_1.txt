J.J. Jameson (from Spiderman 2) Quote ... Crap, Crap, ... <br /> <br /> Mega-Crap Pretends to be a (unintended) tribute to the Coen brothers ... hurt. <br /> <br /> There is no real mystery to the plot. <br /> <br /> Diaz's performances are totally uninspired. <br /> <br /> Bizarre characters don't really work. <br /> <br /> There are many "duh" moments. <br /> <br /> I love black comedy, but this movie is not funny. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it was not worth the electricity. <br /> <br /> There are many movies in this genre that are much more fun. <br /> <br /> I hope this review will help you.
