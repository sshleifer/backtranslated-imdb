Dr. Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a horribly disfigured woman. When one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation formula, Marnie sees it as an opportunity to become beautiful. When she is denied the drug because of possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. The drug works and she becomes beautiful. But the formula brings out the worst in her and it doesn't take long before she leaves a series of bodies behind her. <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard the expression "as exciting as looking at dry paint"? This practically sums up Satanik. During the film, one of the characters pronounces the phrase "Something so horrible, inconceivable". I wasn't sure if he was talking about something in the movies or in the movie itself. I'm really disappointed because I had high hopes for this. Satanik had possibilities, but they never did. At every opportunity, the plot has Marnie doing the most boring things imaginable. The writing is horrible. And part of the problem is Magda Konopka. It is not so attractive and cannot take the film alone. <br /> <br /> Another big problem with Satanik is the management and assembly. It's a mess. We see things and places that have nothing to do with anything in the film. The camera remains in place too long after the scene is over. I can't think of a single shot that would define anything but original. This group of filmmakers shows little in terms of imagination or talent. <br /> <br /> Maybe I don't know the Italian comic on which Satanik is supposed to be based, but I'm sure it will be better than this.
