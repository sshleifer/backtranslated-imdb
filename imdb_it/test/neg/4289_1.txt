The only thing that makes this recognizable is Corey's performance as the insane killer in freedom. What remains is an impossible story of revenge and matrimonial discord. During the walkie-talkie scenes I had the feeling that Cotten was squeezing a sweet potato and not a communication device. Another interesting thing about this is that Alan Hale (the "Gilligan's Island" skipper) is still not so fat, and can still lower his arms under his waist. Besides this there is not much to recommend here.
