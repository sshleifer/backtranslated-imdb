Stone has tried another type of film. Every Sunday date is not up to the average of The Last Boy Scout and the average is lower than all odds. The stone can be fantastic, see The Doors, Natural Born Killers or Platoon, but it can also repeat itself by seeing Nixon or Born on the Fourth July. His true brilliance is realized in the perfection of Michael Caine, The Hand.
