I read all the other comments that made this film an excellent film. I have seen nothing of the excellence that has been expressed. I thought it was long and boring. I tried twice to watch it. The first time I fell asleep and the second time I made it within six minutes of the end and I gave up. I guess it was mainly my fault with high expectations, but I don't think this would have completely ruined the film for me. The film was only bland. It had nothing spectacular or unique about it. The plot was not bad at all, the action sequences were non-existent, the dialogue was forced and the film went on forever. I would not recommend seeing this movie.
