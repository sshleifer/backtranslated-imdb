There was not much idea in the plot on many fronts. This is a good action movie, but it's all here. <br /> <br /> - The film claims that the Lycans were supposed to protect vampires during the day. Yet they are kept in cages and have neck collars. So they can't turn into their wolf form or do anything that no other slave can do. How do you protect vampires during the day? Who are the vampires protecting from? The uncontrollable lanciani? Slaves in human form are nothing but peasants. <br /> <br /> - My understanding is that vampires are immortal and don't age. Yet Sonya ages from child to adult. Do they stop aging at a certain age? I understand that Viktor is old because he was shot (as explained in the second film). But do vampire children grow old? Strange. <br /> <br /> - I didn't realize that vampires needed torches to see at night. Yet we see them carrying torches throughout the film. <br /> <br /> - Silver was the only thing that could have damaged the Lycan. Yet the wooden steaks thrown by the huge crossbows also kill the Lycan. <br /> <br /> These are just some of the things that show only a lack of thought in the story.
