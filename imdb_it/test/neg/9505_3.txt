This film is very difficult to understand, why does the couple want to divorce? No reasons are given, we know nothing about their life in Lisbon or even the work of Marie. We could only understand that a certain boredom appeared in this life. We don't even know who took the initiative to seek a divorce. <br /> <br /> The way of filming is a bit special: I didn't know the name of the director before the end of the film, when I read on the screen I understood why it was so slow, only 42 shots in a hundred minutes (I have them counted)! It reminded me of some Japanese films I saw in the 90s, in fact we have to accept that this is the expression of another culture even if the set is Western. I don't know if this story would be suitable for a Japanese couple. <br /> <br /> You can see the logic of the scenes but the result is boring, however I decided to look at it until the end because I wanted to get the spirit and the meaning of all this. In fact, I just realized that the story of these two beings may not be over yet as the train leaves the station without Marie. This is little for so long! I cannot recommend this work.
