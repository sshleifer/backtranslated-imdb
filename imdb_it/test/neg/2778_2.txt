Whenever a movie presents a dwarf or a dwarf in a leading role, the odds are 10 per 1 that the director threw to him because he didn't know what else to do to keep the movie interesting. In this case, the little character described is not so bad - he manages to maintain his dignity for most of his scenes (except the part where he drags the man at the head of the underground stairs), but the film itself use as a chew toy. <br /> <br /> The problem here is common with low budget exploitation films - there is a germ of a decent idea here, but the director and screenwriter don't know how to develop it. A good director would take the various elements of the story: brain transplants, crazy doctors with secret labs and a dungeon, car chases, punch fights, monstrous monstrous assistant to Frankenstein, mind control, betrayal and conspiracy, etc ... and Make an exciting, engaging movie full of cheap thrills and fun. <br /> <br /> Instead, what we get here is a group of people staggering and arguing in the doctor's laboratory, then a cheese operation in which the patient bleeds tempura, followed by some of the same people who stagger and discuss in the doctor's laboratory a little more, followed by another subgroup of the initial group that goes around and has an accident, followed by a dungeon escape scene that mainly concerns a woman who puts her shoes back on, followed by a chase on the roof (the real high point of the film), followed by a confusing series of events in which everyone in the film seems to run away from everyone else, followed by a nice walk in the countryside where everyone chases, collides, attacks or flees from everyone else, followed, well, not much else. <br /> <br /> In here there is a frightening peroxidic blonde dressed in white, a well-intentioned heroic type who is a bit blandly good-looking, a three-foot laboratory assistant, a big lunk with a mass of loose rubber glued to one side of his face, a child who marvels in the middle of the film to provide more of the "frankenstein factor", a brunette who falls in love with the hero for no apparent reason, and the same crazy doctor, who he must be the luckiest man in the history of super bad villains, because nothing goes according to his plan, but things still work for him ... and all because he remembered to insert an electrode in the transplanted brain in a point of the operation. <br /> <br /> This was not at all the worst movie I saw, or even the worst exploitative movie I saw, or even the worst ill-fated exploit film I've ever seen, but it is there, it oozes convenience and inattention to detail at every point, and there is no real reason why even bad movie fans can see it.
