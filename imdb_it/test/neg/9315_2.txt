Historical films always take liberties - conversations are invented where no one could know what was said, habits are adapted to be understood by the modern public, etc. However, historical films about historical characters should at least give a nod to the story. This movie no. The only scene I remember is when our hero surprises a murderer who sneaks into his room at night. Face the dangerous intruder with "I don't remember sending room service". The main entertainment value is in its wickedness; I recommended that my local video story put it on the "Turkeys" shelf.
