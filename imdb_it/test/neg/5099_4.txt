As suggested above, in the end I was not impressed by this film. It's beautiful to look at, the scenery is lush, but the details of the story, especially the characters, are absolutely incredible. The films must not be credible, but films like this, with a political touch and a social commentary. Similarly, I have no problem with commercialism as such, but again, films like this should not make casting decisions based solely on the box office draw. This is absolutely the case with Sutherland, who is frankly lousy as Doyle. His accent was far from authentic, but he fell into the biggest trap of all, his accent is his performance, and we end up with a caricature of Irish without personality outside his nationality. I find it completely unlikely that anyone involved has thought he was the best man for the job. All in all, this is a clear case of commercial interest in quality and when you're trying to be The Mission, that kind of thing destroys your chances for success. <br /> <br /> Speaking of accents, there were a couple more problems, one of which is the extraordinary modernity of Boy's accent that acted to dispel the feeling of being transported at another time. More surprising was the Irish accent pronounced by Samantha Morton, to say the least variable. His voice snaked between the strong north and the soft south, even in the off-screen voices, where I would have expected such discrepancies to be detected. <br /> <br /> However, these are minor complaints about Sarah's motivation and actions. She never seems to be comfortable with English, and almost instantly at home with her son and her tribe, the dilemma between the life she knew and the life she offered if they only saw it as child's play. Maybe many things were lost in the editing, maybe this was going to be a three-hour movie or a mini-series where these things could have been redesigned, but I can only judge what I saw. <br /> <br /> Now the biggest problem, Sarah's (Morton) relationship with Doyle (Sutherland) is incomprehensible. The fact is that his affection for him is not transmitted in any way until he has to choose between him and his son, the conflict he is going through at this point was frankly ridiculous and killed the film for me. <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed. this film didn't work at all for me, but it is top notch, you won't see anything more amazing in terms of set design, there are some good performances and my wife loved it.
