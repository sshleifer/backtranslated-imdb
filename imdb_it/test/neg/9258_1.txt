The director of Staten Island, Andy Milligan, is well known in the horror community for being an even worse director than Ed Wood. And with this as a weak example of its release I am inclined to agree with them. In "The Ghastly Ones" we basically have three pairs of litigants traveling to their childhood home (located on a suitably isolated island) to collect a legacy. There they are killed one by one and the events take place in a murderous / mysterious way with a delayed and frightened hunchback butler added to throw you for a ride. The film is so shabby that it seems that someone has just put it through a dishwasher, the sound is terrible, the dialogue is evil, there is a primitive gore dummy (plus some dismemberments and guts) and is technically inept in every way can be inept But is it fun in a bad movie? A type of. It is heartbreaking to watch but strangely funny in a destroyed train. Approach with caution. If you are not a fan of horrible films you are better at this depth.
