I'm a big fan of demonic puppets. Looking at the surface of this, it looks pretty good! You have Decapitron, the puppets and a new villain in THE TOTEM! Unfortunately, the little punk who is doing this project to animate inanimate objects cannot act. Stink! His girlfriend is worse. If they had been left out, it would probably be cool, BLADE VS. THE TOTEM. I would watch it for 2 hours. Instead, the role of puppets was abandoned, and the entire film suffered. The mystical Skull type who created the totem is somewhat trivial, and the appearance of Decapitrons is long awaited, short and really disappointing. You better watch the first one again.
