Danny De Vito shows us here that he is definitely, indeed infinitely, a better interpreter on the screen than outside. He plays the part of Owen, a miserable aspiring writer with an irritated old mother (delightfully played by Anne Ramsey) who would like to see dead. Billy Crystal is Larry, a very frustrated writing teacher who has a separate wife who tries the same way. So Owen, after seeing Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train", suggests exchanging murders. <br /> <br /> As a director though, De Vito's control is inconsistent while he wastes this clever idea, while his film falters from the very humorous to the very sweet. He and Crystal agree in the main roles, but the show belongs to Anne Ramsey as the irascible Mrs. Lift. <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 20, 1992 - Video
