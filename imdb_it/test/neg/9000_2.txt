Problems: 1) Although advertised as "a loving tribute to Poverty Row", many of the old shots are not even Poverty Row movies - mostly from the RKO movie "The Most Dangerous Game" (1932), with some from the silent version (!?) of "The Lost World" (1926)! <br /> <br /> 2) Much of the old movie is simply used as a filler (the old movie of the ship) or as silent shots (for example, of Bela walking, looking or staring) often repeated; <br /> <br /> 3) Where is the pantheon of Poverty Row Master Thespians (Bela, Boris, Lon Chaney, Jr., George Zucco, John Carradine, Buster Crabbe, Tom Neal, etc.) who emit their do you punch the lines for the "new" joking characters (like in "What's Up Tiger Lily?" by Woody Allen or "Dead Men Do not Wear Plaid" by Steve Martin)? Even the weak comment by Mike Nelson on the colored "Reefer Madness" is more fun than this. <br /> <br /> High Point: The long but extremely illuminating conference by Gregory Mank that makes you renew respect and admiration for Bela, John Carradine and George Zucco. Only the price of the DVD is worth!
