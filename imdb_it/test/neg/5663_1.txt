Have you ever gone on Youtube? Well, the final question is YES. See the boats of ICarly and Nickelodeon? No definite answer. <br /> <br /> Many people think that ICarly is a boring and idiotic program, and others think it's the best program on the face of the Earth. I saw many of the panning loads of reviews on his head and some giving a bunch of roses. In my opinion, Icarly is for kids, but the show is just awful. <br /> <br /> If you haven't read the last review, here are the reasons 1-8: # 1: Steryotypes # 2: Goofed- up drama # 3: Everything is stupid (Taco truck for example) # 4: Carly thinks she's cute but she's bad # 5: Anyone over the drinking age is stupid # 6: Is Sam tiny but strong? # 7: No real companies # 8: Average teachers <br /> <br /> # 9: The webshow brings out 3DFX. Just look at the webshow to understand what I mean. 10: The webshow also transmits personal information. # 11: Almost every famous thing is insulted. He quickly insults the Japanese race, Solitare, Mercades-Benz and Pac-Man, to name a few. # 12: There are too many repeating jokes (Sam's obsession with meat, Freddy's computer, Gibby taking his shirt off, etc.) # 13: Show-based video games suck. # 14: Freddy has a lack of masculinity. Why? It's becoming non-original. # 15: The show is aimed at a female audience. I also hate shows aimed at a male audience, so I prefer Icarly to be for both sexes. # 16: The words "nub" and "no chiz". # 17: Excessive use of laughter traces. <br /> <br /> Part 3 arriving early spring! Just in time for spring break!
