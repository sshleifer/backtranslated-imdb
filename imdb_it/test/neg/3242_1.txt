Oh if every day you want to see a supernatural thriller that turns out to be a comedy watch this movie <br /> <br /> This movie was a shock because it had so many actors, but what do they do and how do they fit? <br /> <br /> The management of the college scenes is like a school play in which each person speaks and then the next person arrives in front of <br /> <br /> Okay reasons to laugh at the movie: 1) Akshay, Suneil, Aditya Panscholi, Sharad Kapoor, Arshad Warsi as university students 2) Akshay brings a pistol to college 3) some pathetic acrobatics and SFX <br /> <br /> there are many other flaws like why the snake doesn't save its lover is raped and enters so late? also why not kill them all together there alone? <br /> <br /> But after all they have to make a 2 hour movie so then you have a tortorius movie <br /> <br /> The movie is painful to watch The film was directed by Rajkumar Kohli who was an expert in making films like this in the past and had a successful film like JAANI DUSHMAN (1979) and NAGIN Rajkumar Kohli wants to help his son's non-existent career Sin da VIRODHI (1992), Aulad Ke Dushman (1993) and QAHAR (1996) all flop tried to promote his son and also throws big stars so that his son is noticed, unfortunately nothing could help his son's career <br /> <br /> The film has several comic scenes like the scenes of death, how the actors after being hit by the snake are so ready to fight it again and the climax <br /> <br /> Direction of Rajkumar Kohli is ugly The music is bad <br /> <br /> This brings us to the cast Akshay Kumar - ordinary stuff, doesn't have much to do rather than stunts Suneil Shetty - terrible Sonu Nigam - the worst deb award user goes to him, gives the comic a new meaning Aftab- terrible Arshad Warsi- nothing to do Sharad Kapoor- bad Aditya Panscholi- irritates Sunny Deol- is comical in the scene when he comes to save Sonu LOL Manisha Koirala- ordinary Rambha - The couple of Akshay Kiran Kumar, Raza Murad are as usual Raj Babbar - exhilarating for wrong reasons the girls are horrible That leads us to Munish Kohli This guy has a huge body, he is even stronger and taller than Akshay Kumar . His voice is bad, his expressions are painful. The only thing he has to do in the film is to wear glasses and make a bad face Rajat Bedi is horrible
