Except for the appearance of the talented Austin Powers imitator, Richard Halpern, this photo was your misfortune for the film. Outdated film references will not help the public that might come across this venture in the future. Watch for "Groovy" Austin Powers in the hot tub. It's a hoot and a half. <br /> <br /> Bad special effects are overcome by the appearance of numerous little stars in skimpy clothes, so at least this should keep him entertained (if that's what excites you). <br /> <br /> For my money, I would like to rent the classic parody DVD like "Airplane" or "Lobster Man from Mars".
