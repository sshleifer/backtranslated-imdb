Let me say at the beginning that I am not a very artistic person and that I do not "get" new art. That being said, this film is absolutely crazy, and in my opinion it is not crazy in a good way. Shot entirely in black and white with a series of very freely linked stories, Avida is a film for those who can look at modern art and say "wow, I feel the energy and passion of this painting". The only reason I gave this film 3 out of 10 is because I actually managed to laugh in some parts, even though mostly laughing at the film's utter madness. Two of the characters throwing chairs on a lawn, like doing what these characters were doing, I have no idea. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
