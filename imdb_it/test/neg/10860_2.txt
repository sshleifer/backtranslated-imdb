Once upon a time Quentin Tarantino was a relatively successful director. <br /> <br /> Now, unfortunately, not only does it make terrible films, but it puts its names like those. <br /> <br /> A supposedly cool retro flashback to motorcycle movies of the 60s and 70s, this plumbs of new depths. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I enjoy it when a blouse falls into a movie more than the next, but I also felt kind of squalid looking at this. To use a word I never thought of, its msysoginistic (see, I can't even write it). The plot (in the vaguest sense of the term) is as incomprehensible as Vinnie Jones's accent, the fact that his terrible acting ours is not particularly worthy of a testament as can be thought. <br /> <br /> This is simply terrible. Shocking. It almost made me cry. With horror.
