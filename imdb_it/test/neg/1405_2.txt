=========== GREAT SPOILER ================================== This is a terrible movie with no funny characters. So many clichés and meaningless scenes. He needs a good editor but there may not be any films left. Please save your two hours. The only decent and unpredictable scene in the film was when the younger brother refuses to stop his brother from killing himself. The description said "moments of dark comedy". Maybe I missed those when I blinked. The horrible characters begin right at the funeral. Funerals laugh and complain about food while they are at the funeral of a young man who committed suicide? Then the father digs at the only child left? Just at the funeral? How is it possible that the neighbor whose husband betrayed her with the character of Sigourney Weaver is the villain for telling her husband? The father does not even know that his son can play the piano, although everyone else around him seems to know he is a great pianist. The film tries to push every dramatic cliché possible in a film: a father who leads too much his athletic son to succeed, a dysfunctional family who loses a son chosen to suicide, his son has lost the feeling of being lost and alone, drugs, marital affairs , son conceived by chance but raised as the husband's son, incest, homosexual tendencies, bullies, possible terminal illnesses, etc. etc. etc. DO NOT REFUSE THE 2 HOURS.
