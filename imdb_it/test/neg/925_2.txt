this film is a non-dissimulated attempt to appeal to a young demographic of fourteen or twenty years and an insult to all of them. I refuse to believe that this age group is so vapid as to be entertained by this unnecessary "remake". at the beginning of the film one of the characters proclaims: "I am surrounded by idiots". this is the decisive moment in the film, which is constantly proceeding from there. full of clichés, of "spavoli" of red herring and of inexplicable events, the film is also full of characters that are not exactly brains, a formula all too familiar in silent films of horror. and the disgusting "is so obscure that I don't see" scenes stolen by Chainsaw Massacre but simply annoying, building no tension or horror. it is difficult to film in the dark and sometimes darkness is a great vehicle in a film that is supposed to have tension. but my feeling was that the less we see in this case, the better. maybe he didn't want to wait until morning because he didn't care, apart from the fact that it could cost him more money to do night scenes well, or he didn't know how. who knows? Unless you've ever seen a horror movie in your life, or you're two or three, every aspect of this movie is predictable and done before. warning: Paris Hilton is in this movie. enough said. all in all a blasé film that raises the question, where is the h * ll wax? he was treated as a lost leader. if you're bored as possible and all the other rentals are out or you're just in the mood for a bad horror movie, which isn't really scary, or you'd like to see Paris have a shattered pole in its head, go ahead and take a possibility. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but if this is what the producers of this film think a younger audience wants, then they are disappointed. a profit-oriented film, without any attempt to achieve any kind of art or respect for the genre. You know, smart characters create a scarier movie. I believe this is the debut of Collet-Serra as a director, as well as advertising and music videos. he has another one released in 2006, called Goal 2. we hope his goal is to make a better film.
