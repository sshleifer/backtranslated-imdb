I saw this in a preview screening and I must say that this documentary-style film is the biggest load of tripe I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Completely unattractive, low-budget, boring, junk, terrible acting - The whole audience (young and old) experienced the coma without laughing for the most part ... there were literally only 2 places in which you will laugh in the whole movie <br /> <br /> Many people left in half - Can I blame them ... I kept thinking that the film would take, however, not It has never happened and I wish I had left. <br /> <br /> The humor was really lame and I'm surprised this ever came to the big screen. I'm not offended by the adult content of this film - It wasn't funny. The people who made this movie really don't deserve your money, so please don't pay to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not even fun to be shown on TV, let alone the cinema. .. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give it 0 out of 10, but the system won't allow it ...
