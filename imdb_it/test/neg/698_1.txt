I really like this genre, but The Cell was one of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch. While about 25 percent of my audience wandered in and out of the theater while watching (or left entirely) I was stupid enough to stick out. The main problems of this story (there were too many to list all) is that with this type of film you have to do two things ... one, give the killer fear (being that they capture him for twenty minutes in the movie he went ) and you have to give the victim whose life is at stake (the girl in the tank) enough character development that you really care if they arrive in time or not. Not only did I lose track of the girl, I was given such a superficial vision that she was just a fuzzy face and when I remembered that it was part of the story I didn't really care what happened to her. While the images were interesting in a way of LSD flashbacks, often times they made no sense and this should be a lesson that images cannot make up for the lack of a good story (see Phantom Menace for another example). Finally, does anyone know or worry about what was happening with the women kneeling in that field and staring at the sky? Ridiculous.
