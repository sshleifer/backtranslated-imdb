This is a film that should have been a mini series as it tries to get too much information in too small a space. The whole story is constantly bombarded with sub-plots, introduction of characters and nonsensical information that goes nowhere. There is a background plot in which the boy meets a girl, she has doubts but she gets married anyway and then her doubts emerge and she goes to see if they are real. They prove not to be, but her husband will not believe she is not unfaithful and her near-boyfriend does not want her because she is not unfaithful to her husband. That being said there are no less than 1000 sub-plots and character introductions that make this plot almost incomprehensible. In the first 15 minutes you are flooded with so many things and situations that you just worry about. You don't care about any of the confused and messy cast that moves in and out of history like vultures feeding on a corpse. Everyone enters and takes some interest from the viewer. After half an hour, and completely uninterested, I watched the remaining two and a half hours out of pure morbid curiosity. I couldn't imagine where he was going, but as if staring at a fire I couldn't get up and turn it off. The production values ​​are superb but the resulting film is a waste of time; wash your socks instead.
