This story has had a good story about four elderly men who share a deadly secret about a young woman they met 50 years ago. After all this time, the young woman returns to take revenge on men. This story occasionally made me doze during the film amidst the tiring elevators and thunderstorms. But it is worth waiting at the end when we only discover who the mysterious woman is who continues to torment the old in their dreams and interfere in the life of a young man. Most of what I liked about this film was the suspense in which the young woman appears to men shortly before their death. The special effects were something. Every time I heard her calling to them, I thought "Not that face again". But it was a good movie, I just wish the pace wasn't so slow or the acting not so boring. And what I liked most about the film was the 1920s flashback, very authentic as the costumes are original.
