I fully understand why this film was made. Silence of the Lambs was an incredible film - a creepy thriller with a superb story and a high jumping factor .... <br /> <br /> What I don't understand is why this movie was made ... and because Anthony Hopkins has agreed to resume his role as Hannibal the Cannibal in this terrible and unsatisfactory film. <br /> <br /> There is no way to ruin the film beyond seeing it, but for those of you who prefer to waste your money, DO NOT READ UP. The film is absolutely horrible. It's so bad that the transition from Jodie Foster to Julianne Moore becomes a non-issue. <br /> <br /> The only way to truly enjoy the film is to set the clock and leave the theater exactly two hours into the film, because until then, it's a pretty interesting thriller. The compensation between Moore and Hopkins is comparable to that of Hopkins and Foster, and the performances of the other characters are pretty good. But literally at two o'clock, the film degrades into nothing but into a mischievous D-type horror film ... it's sick, and it's stupid and almost as if the crew had finished shooting time, and has thrown together a final in one day of filming. <br /> <br /> The initial buzz on the unsatisfactory and bizarre ending of the book by Thomas Harris led director Ridley Scott to order a rewrite ... and, honestly, after watching the movie E read the end of the book, I don't know which is worse. <br /> <br /> Please - do not waste your money OR time in this film, unless you are willing to leave EXACTLY at the point of two hours, because this is the ONLY way I will feel satisfied with the saga of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter ... continuing the mystery that made the first film, and waiting for it, so beautiful.
