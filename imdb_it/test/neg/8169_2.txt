Watching "Baghban" is the cinematic equivalent of trying to eat your way out of a saltwater taffy tank for almost three hours. This Indian film is a sweet and sentimental sticky soap opera that begins as "King Lear", switches to "Romeo and Juliet" in the middle section, then returns to "King Lear" again for its tear-filled finale. <br /> <br /> Raj Malhotra is a banking accountant who seems to have everything a man could want from life: a wife who loves him, a family that loves him and a job he is about to retire after life of faithful service. Although Raj and his wife, Pooja, have been married for 40 years and have four grown children, they still behave like a pair of newlyweds, cooing and sighing, blinking at each other and whispering sweet nerds into the ears of the another almost to the point of nausea. In fact, all the bloody brood is so happy, loving and harmonious that it makes the Von Trapps look like a dysfunctional family in comparison. Parents and children joke together, laugh together, also perform together choreographed, "spontaneous" numbers of songs and dances together (like many Bollywood productions, "Baghban" is a drama interspersed with a large number - in this case, too big a number - of musical sequences). <br /> <br /> Anyone who knows anything about the narrative is aware that this unadulterated bliss cannot be left unpunished for long, and that all that joy is only the prelude to a terrible catastrophe destined to fall on the heads of our unsuspecting party-goers . Knowing this, we spend the first hour of the film in a frightened expectation, wondering what shape that disaster will have when it finally arrives. The lightning occurs about an hour into the film, when Raj announces to his children that he and his mother have decided to move with one of their families, leaving the choice of which will be to the children and their spouses. Suddenly, as King Lear discovers the vipers hidden in family breasts, Raj discovers that his children are not so loving, caring and eager to share their homes and lives with their parents as he had originally thought. Understandably horrified by the prospect, the children, to foil their parents' plan, devise a scheme in which Raj will live with one of their children, while Pooja will live with another; then they turn off until, at the end, each of the children has had the opportunity to host both parents and then the cycle will be repeated indefinitely. To the great regret of the children, the parents adhere to the plan, even if the two are deeply in love with each other and have never spent a different period. Thus, the second and most of the third hour are spent with the two lovers (even if married) who are pining for each other, while their little ungrateful and insensitive brats do all they can to make their parents understand how unwelcome they are in their homes. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems with "Baghban" is that it lacks subtlety in both narration and direction. The love that Ray and Pooja feel for each other, as well as the almost dizzying closeness of the family unit, is placed so tightly in the first hour that the film almost collapses under the weight of sentimentality. So, with almost no warning, the script turns into a dime and converts children into insensitive and self-centered monsters and parents into passive and plaintive victims of that insensitivity. Raj and Pooja are a little too long in the teeth and a little too self-sufficient to make love with dreamy eyes, sullen and unrequited, more appropriate for the greedy children of the parents of four adult children. The purple style of the prose, in which every emotion is underlined and highlighted, leads to intense overacting and a strong dependence on trivial reaction shots and melodramatic music for punctuation. The musical numbers convey a certain liberating joy at the beginning, but they continue so long and appear so frequently that they quickly lose their effectiveness and serve only to distribute the material to unbearable proportions. At least a full hour could be eliminated from this swollen production with no visible damage to do - and a whole lot of good. There is really no reason why this film should drag on for a three-hour punishment. The most striking of all is the seemingly endless harangue to which we are subjected at the end, a speech in which Raj (who somehow managed to turn his experiences into an award-winning bestseller) teaches us all about the truth of parent / child relationships for exactly ten minutes at least. <br /> <br /> "Baghban" is a corny sweet, full of more sugar and goo than a box of chocolates from See. Sample at your own risk.
