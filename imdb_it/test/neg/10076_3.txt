To sum up, my group of friends and I spent about 45 minutes outside the theater sharing our favorite gaffes, plot inconsistencies, loose breakups and other ridiculous aspects of this movie. I found the story trivial to the point of being irrelevant and the lines of the plot as underdeveloped as the dinosaur embryos were still locked in the Jurassic Park shaving cream box. The assembly was poor and none of the characters generated any sympathy or feeling. In short, this film lacked the suspense and the thrill that the first film provided from the point of view of history <br /> <br /> Even the new dinosaurs were few and far between (although I really liked the pterodactyls ). short shots of the new species and only 2 were actually involved in the action. <br /> <br /> As a scientist and former paleontologist of childhood, the lack of any true scientific content (not that it had to be realistic, but logically formed ie how the dinosaurs were built in No. 1 and the disagreements of the chaos of Malcom) was disappointing. <br /> <br /> In short, the film seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to trot dinos on the scene to make money. I hope the movie goers don't fall in love with this trap (even if I apparently did)
