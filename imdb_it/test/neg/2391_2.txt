How to describe it better than scouty criminals on TV? And I don't mean on the COPS show; here, they are actually presented as protagonists. <br /> <br /> I do not see any corrective value in this show unless you have a perverse propensity for human tragedies. Whitney Houston is a tragic example of the fallen star; a star that Bobby Brown helped pull from the sky. Bobby Brown is nothing but a low-life criminal. Why watch it? Why is Whitney at his side, no matter how despicable? This couple should be locked up and it's a shameful shame that they are making money and getting a minimum of notoriety by looking at the septic tank that is their life and the human waste that is their character.
