Today I had a real desire for a science fiction film and so I decided to take a look at Battlespace. Unfortunately, this was one of my biggest mistakes this year. <br /> <br /> I see that the director, Neil Johnson, has directed over 500 music videos, and I suggest you come back to this. Music videos are a great form of entertainment, and not everyone can cut it by making movies. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this film is probably the voiceover. And this says a lot because the special effects are sometimes scary. Voice over didn't work in Blade Runner and it doesn't work here. The first hour is spent looking at the protagonist as he crosses the desert, while his daughter tells the story. I think the story could have made a great film, but not so. <br /> <br /> The second worst part is the effects. They are just bad and don't get confused in the rest of the picture, so you just don't believe it. And absolutely all the frames of the film have been filtered, and not in a good way. The filtering used as an effect is good. 90 minutes, ugly. <br /> <br /> And what is it with all the gadgets that always speak, and don't close!?!? If I had used such technology I would have gone mad. I was just waiting for the guns to fire: "I'm terribly sorry, but it looks like he ran out of ammunition." No, stay away. This film is not worth the time.
