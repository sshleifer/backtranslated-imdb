Not bad performance. Whoopi plays the wise / warm role quite well. However, the plot and situations cannot be believed (forced PC stereotypes). Sometimes they are good Jews and blacks against the bad white Christians (ho-hum). A typical Hollywood fantasy. The film has its moments, but it is not one that I would recommend doing as we see.
