You may not believe it, but when the credits to this film went ahead, I looked for the director's name. When I saw it, I burned it in my memory and never forgot it. This movie is beyond terrible. Makes Ed Wood films like Orsen Welles. At least the B movies are fun, this was an exciting experience for the soul. The quality was so bad, I started wondering who allowed this to happen. <br /> <br /> I hear Uwe Boll running fourteen miles a day. This is because wherever his films are seen, people have to take him out of town with the flame and the pitchfork. The script was terrible, the lighting was like a high school football game and the cinematography was just above the quality of Roger Patterson's Bigfoot video. The acting was performed by people who are too ashamed of the production to say their lines with any credibility. In the end there was a movie in which Alan Smithee would not put his name. I learned that day to avoid any film of this man despite the circumstances. From what I hear, this is not a bad thing to do.
