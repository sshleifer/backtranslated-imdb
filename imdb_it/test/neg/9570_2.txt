What I miss most in this film is that it leaves no room for imagination, everything is said. It's like a documentary film, but not as good as a documentary, because it's not a documentary. A patchwork film without a continuous story. Very superficial, nothing to think about, because the film already tells you what you should think. Too many different problems have been touched, but none has been worked out to make you think. I don't even know if it's a funny movie that wants to be serious or a serious movie that wants to be fun. Many scenes are very unrealistic and the acting is rather poor. The film is rather boring.
