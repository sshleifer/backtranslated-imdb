The glorious Edward arrives in the world when his supervisor tells him that he can leave those dirty Swedish dramas and head up the stairs to the splatter and gore department. Excited with his great expectations for the new type of film that he will soon change, he asks all sorts of questions, about salary, his work space and the lunch break. Well, not really. Edward is perhaps the opposite. Calm, stammering, he also has glasses. With the exception when he is crazy. I imagine it created a much more disturbing atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Evil Ed is a Swedish film for all reasons, but somehow a magical force came across good actors and turned their adorable Swedish accents into stereotypical American voices. I imagine these are some of the skills an actor needs these days. The acting is very wooden, as they are inflexible, not foldable (well, hey, what did you expect?). In addition to this the film has a jamming techno-themed song, it sounds like its E-Type. In any case, this only worsens the experience of the film. Since so far I am pretty tough on this film, there is usually a breaking point where the level of happiness is toned. But there's really not much to say. The projects look good, but somehow 'Hanz' wrote the coffee above and partially destroyed. That's how I watch this movie. If the film ends where Edward is taken to a psychiatric institution and reorganized the parts where he goes mad and kills people, the result would have been much better, but this is just my radical vision. I'd also like to see more movies from the loser limbs movies. <br /> <br /> There are also illogical things to discover in this piece of film. Let's say the actors are really American, they live in America, why should they work on a Swedish film, like Edward did? And besides, that bellhop, why don't you ever use the bell that is directly next to him? Instead he leaves with a light tap at the door. Good old Edward really has nice ears to hear this while he is riding. <br /> <br /> However, this film has had its moments, it's just a pity that there were not many. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't recommend it. It's a pretty cheap film, go ahead and buy. It's almost like I see a model for the price and the film. On the other side; if you like watching dubbed movies becoming more picky on the second could be IT. My verdict would therefore be a solid rock 4.
