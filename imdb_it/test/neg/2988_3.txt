A silly and violent thriller that is a rip off of "Deliverance" but without any charm and intelligence. The plot is ridiculous and the cast seems to be tired and anxious to be free from this hateful entry. This film is a solid example of a bad plot and a bad idea to the end. It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.
