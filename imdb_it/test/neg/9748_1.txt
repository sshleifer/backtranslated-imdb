This is beyond the shadow of doubt the absolute worst film I have ever seen. It's been a long time since I saw it, but the jokes are NOT fun, the plot is painfully predictable, defining the main stupid characters is vastly expanding their intelligence ... ugly! I just wanted to punch Tom Arnold and make him cry because he wasted two hours of my life when I finished watching this piece of film filth. I don't even know why I ever wanted to watch it, but remember if you see this movie: I DON'T SAY THAT I HAD NOT HAD YOU. <br /> <br /> PS The character of Tom Arnold sings a song in this film called "I'm My Own Grandfather". Nuff said.
