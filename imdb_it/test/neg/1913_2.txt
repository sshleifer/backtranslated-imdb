I rented this movie the other day b / c I love love stories, but this was the worst I've ever seen in my life. I find it hard to believe that Sam would fall in love with Kelley after barely saying more than 2 words when he has a long time great boyfriend who is completely devoted to her. I thought Kelley was a fundamental asshole for the whole film, and he never changed anything. The only good thing about the movie was Josh Hartnett. I thought he had done a great job of acting, and I'm going to start watching his other films.
