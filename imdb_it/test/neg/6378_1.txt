Comedy works best when it refers to things that are true. But even as such, an effort is needed to make jokes that everyone likes and even the grumpiest of spectators can smile. When I look at the Daily Show, I see the whole thing "it's funny because it's true", but I don't see the effort, though, and I often don't do it if it's fun or just trying to make a point (I notice it especially in the segments of the 'interview). The Daily Show began as a parody of news, by definition they enjoy understanding how the media interpret their news by pretending to be inept and stupid journalists and anchormen and have dealt with tons of topics, from science to movies and sometimes politics, then Jon Stewart has arrived ... and everything has gone to Hell. The early years of Jon Stewart's reign were undoubtedly golden, even though he was so funny, but then 2004 came and that's where you start to notice a huge possibility on the show from then on. The show's humor has become stale, Colbert is gone, Steve Carell has left, many of the show's best anchors have remained and now it's mainly about Jon Stewart and the show has gone from parody to semi-secret, essentially Evening News but with some gags here and there. For those who have not seen the show and find it difficult to find out what to watch on cable, I will give you a brief description of what the show is about (at least until 2009): - Bush, Cheney and all the Republicans (unless they happen to embracing an opinion shared also by the democrats) are stupid, wicked, corrupt and hypocritical, anyone who holds onto conservative beliefs is also evil, corrupt and hypocritical; - people who doubt man-made global warming theory are evil and stupid; - democratic vote; There, I saved you 25 minutes of your time, go and look at something else. At the beginning, I think the producers have hijacked the show for their personal political program, but when I actually see the interviews, it becomes clear what this show is about (the one I mentioned above), but we'll get there in a moment. First, according to Jon Stewart, The Daily Show's humor expects you to find a randomly filmed quote from Bush, Cheney or a casual Republican humorist because, well, why. Jon puts up the joke, setting it in the specific context of the writers and expects the random quote to somehow provide the ending line. So, unless you have "got" the context, it is completely useless as a trivial humor. Even the Daily Show is waiting for you to laugh when they show a montage of a politician who speaks and in another video that says something else, again inserting in a context that writers expect you to understand, making it so funny, why? Well, because Jon said so. Now imagine The Daily Show using that formula countless times for years every week, and you'll begin to understand what was a festival of laughter that is now 25 minutes of only silent glances (yes, even in segments of Lewis Black). At first, a fair amount of effort was put into these lines, but now much less is evident. And the interview has the strangest sense of prejudice I've ever seen. Jon Stewart calls Bill O'Reilly a bully, but what makes him, when he sucks all the individual actors and Democrats (John Kerry first, Obama today) who appears on the show and looks down on respected respected Republicans and conservative journalists experienced as Bill Kristol of Weekly Standard? He puts them in a sort of popular tribunal as if they were accused of a crime, often times when a person in the show that defends Bush is described as delusional, as if that person were out of the world and assumed that he spoke for most of the 'America, this is the de facto cure for anyone who preserves, unless you happen to share a similar point of view with the Democrats, if that were the case, it's a celebration of endless love. But anyway, it doesn't matter, in Jon's eyes you are already wrong before entering the show and are still incorrect afterwords. This is the kind of treatment that you get if you are remotely right. Now you have to ask yourself what could have something to do with humor. One wonders what will happen if the Democrats win the White House ...
