Excellent example of the disaster that occurs when combining a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal. For me it is rare to be aware of acting during the first viewing of a film, because I try to go with the story and save the analysis for the second vision. In the case of "Full Ride", the acting was so weak that the film was impossible to appreciate as a story; I was too busy (during the first and only vision) alternating laughter and nausea. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for most of the cast members, practically everyone in the cast is weak, the limits of individual talent do not conflict with any actual competent acting. Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are at least physically well matched, finding a common ground in the aspect too old for the credible age of their characters. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the script requires particularly intense and convincing performances to portray their characters that shows only the incredible lack of talent of Smith and Monroe. On the positive side, they know enough not to look directly into the camera and they don't stutter. <br /> <br /> Better to use a less attractive pair that could physically pass for the right age. The basic story is not particularly original, just another variation on "An Officer and a Gentleman", but it would have provided a nice showcase for a talented pair of "teenage" actors. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid
