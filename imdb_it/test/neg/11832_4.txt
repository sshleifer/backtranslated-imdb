"The death of an actor in a Broadway theatrical comedy brings together a theater critic and a police detective as an unlikely crime resolution duo. The niece of the dead performer becomes not only the object of affection for our critic, but also a first suspect in this death and some other murders that happen at the theater: "The Phantom Killer" places the young woman as her next victim, so it's a race against time for our heroes to capture the murderer, "according to dvd synopsis of the sleeve. <br /> <br /> Milton Raison's script sparkles a mysterious low-budget puzzle. With help, Dave O'Brien (as Anthony "Tony" Woolrich) does well in the lead role; his skills as an actor seem to be much greater than the productions that employ him. O'Brien and taxi driving assistant Frank Jenks (in the role of Egbert "Romeo" Egglehoffer) would have made a nice television investigation team of the fifties. The leader Kay Aldridge (like Claudia Moore) and the supporting cast are also good. Unfortunately, the story becomes tortuous and anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> **** The Phantom of 42nd Street (5/2/45) Albert Herman ~ Dave O'Brien, Kay Aldridge, Frank Jenks
