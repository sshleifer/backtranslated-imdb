Even though I watched this movie alone (thankfully), I still felt embarrassed as I watched it. I was led to rent it from the reviews on the cover and from the frames of the bloody / gritty camera on the back, which led me to believe it was some kind of documentary. These actors are laughable throughout the film, not entirely convincing. The story involves an Italian Australian band (?), Which only fights other bands, and then runs, fights, repeats. Presumably they train extremely hard, which makes them much better than other gangs. For some reason I don't think they could actually beat some of these other guys who are twice their size. I could be wrong ... no, I'm not mistaken, this film is not pleasant on any level. The assembly of the prison looked like a summer camp, instead of children, it was a festival of sausages of horrible actors, just hanging out and laughing and trying to look tough. This movie is not worth your time, save your money or throw it in the trash, but don't waste it on this movie.
