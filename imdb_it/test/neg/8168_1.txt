this is a film that reminds me of avatars - starring rajesh khanna from the 80s. the issue of parent-child division is interesting but was handled in a rather unoriginal way .. the characters were not fully developed and the children seemed to move from being extremely loving (in the first 15 minutes of the film) to being totally indifferent towards the parents, this transformation was not credible to say the least ... they explored this a little more. Amitabh and Jaya were unbelievers like this old helpless couple .. first of all it was not too convincing in this role, because it didn't seem that it was defenseless, I mean, why not go back to work where it is wanted instead of being w / children who do not they wanted them .. hema wasn't as convincing as a 60-year-old or ... it didn't seem like a day above 50 .. then the whole magazine of the baghban book that won the booker prize demanded credibility .. all in all, a film that runs a important problem but cld was improved, I gave him 5/10
