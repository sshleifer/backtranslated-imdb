I think this is a disappointing sequel. I miss many of the old characters (King Gator, Anne Marie, etc.), and I don't like the fact that not even half of the original voices are back to make characters. A lot of personality has been lost in Charlie, and the bad Red is not even half of what Carface was in the first. If you're a big ADGTH fan like me, it's worth seeing just to see how the story continues, but don't count on being 5 stars in your book.
