This was the most terrible movie of God I had to face. 30 minutes into the film and I couldn't take it anymore. Seriously, don't worry about this unless you're a sentimental fool or one of those pseudo-artistic types who love this type of tripe so they can feel more educated. Boring, even if the acting is fine; the child is simply irritating. Some scenes are a bit strange with very strange close-ups. I don't know why they did the whole film in black and white, but whatever effect they hoped to have failed miserably. There was really nothing to look at, and although it is a sad story, presumably, it is simply so stupid that it is difficult to feel sympathy for the characters.
