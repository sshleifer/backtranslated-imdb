Rigoletto is Verdi's masterpiece, full of drama, emotion and powerful and memorable music. The master must have rolled into the grave when this reckless parody of his work was released with his useless cheap frontal and coupled nakedness and his portrayal of the naive, but mainly Gilda, as a horny ditz. The work can certainly be adapted to the cinema --- look at Zeferelli's magnificent Traviata --- but when a work is as superb as Rigoletto, it does not need economic tricks. It might even have been acceptable if the dubbing in the music had been good, but it is a mediocre rendering of the book with second-level sound quality.
