OUR GANG had a chance on a feature film in its 22-year history, and was this the best that could be done? It's boring, forced and useless, and I respectfully disagree with the other poster in this movie; the 1994 LITTLE RASCALS remake was better than this. Almost everything is. Children are subject to civil war proceedings; it doesn't look like a film of OUR GANG at all, but like a clone of second-class Shirley Temple devoid of humor.
