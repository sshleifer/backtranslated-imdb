I don't know what some of these filmmakers think, repeatedly making the same kind of cliche film, where the bad guys win (bad girls in this case). Weak and very predictable interpretation. Nothing original. This same film has been made over and over again - no different from GOODBYE LOVER (1989), SLOW BURN (2005), or at least ten other films with the same plot and purpose. There are many holes in the film too. It's like they ran out of money and stopped filming. Or maybe they ran out of ideas. But don't waste your time with this. It will leave you upset only after wasting time looking at it.
