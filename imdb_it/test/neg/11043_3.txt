Oldboy is set in Korea and starts as a Dae-su Oh drunk (Min-Sik Choi) is rescued from the police station by his friend just to be kidnapped, Dae-su wakes up and finds himself in a small room that be imprisoned for the next fifteen years. Dae-su is nourished and cared for by his hooded strangers but is never allowed out of the room, Dae-su starts training to take revenge after he is gone, which he intends to do by discarding the cement from the masonry with a chopstick. However, before Dae-su finishes, he is gassed and unconscious, when he wakes up, Dae-su finds himself free on the roof of a tall, all-dressed building. Dae-su immediately starts trying to find out who imprisoned him, after meeting the handsome Mido (Hye-jeong Kang) the two fall in love and together with his help Dae-su finally finds what he is looking for, but the truth comes to a price ... <br /> <br /> This South Korean production was co-written and directed by Chan-wook Park and obtained any number of positive reviews (the type that distributors can choose between quotation marks and plasters on video box) and also won the Grand Prize of the jury at Cannes, while it was also nominated for the Palme d'Or, so surely Oldboy is a true classic? Well, it's not for me, since I can't understand why he liked it so much and I would go so far as to say that I practically hated him apart from one or two isolated moments. For starters I couldn't get into the story, I didn't like it because I thought it was slow and boring and while many out there would have believed that Oldboy had the most shocking blow he had ever thought was pretty simple and not very well executed. The ending in which Dae-su goes to the New Zealand Alps to be hypnotized feels labeled as if the producers wanted a kind of happy ending. At almost two hours I almost fell asleep I was so bored, violence is domesticated and it is the thought of what is happening that I imagine most people have a problem rather than what is actually shown. In fact Oldboy has a very low number of bodies of about seven and a mild sex scene, it's not really that graphic or memorable. I have not warmed up with any of the characters and, while accepting, Oldboy has a good concept and premise that he fails to provide and it is a film I will never understand because so many people seem to like it. <br /> <br /> Based on a Japanese manga of the same name as Oldboy, the film looks okay, there are one or two good visual moments here, although everyone is excited about the fight in the corridor that takes place in one click I was quite indifferent and thought the choreography was rather boring. Violence on the real blood on the screen is very small, Dae-su eats a live octopus that is apparently quite normal in Korea, there are fight scenes, a severed hand, some teeth are pulled out and there is some blood in the end. <br /> <br /> The budget was supposedly around the $ 4,000,000 mark which is actually quite a lot, shot in South Korea and New Zealand. Acting seems acceptable, but it's hard to tell when the actors speak a different language. <br /> <br /> Oldboy is a film that I found an absolute routine to seduce, I don't care for subtitled movies or foreign films or paying attention to the plot while I followed the thing perfectly but I didn't like any of it and it's so simple and straightforward. Apparently the second in the director's Choi-wook Park revenge trilogy that also includes Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) and Lady Vengeance (2005).
