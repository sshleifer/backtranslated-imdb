The only reason I gave this film to 2 and not to 1 was because for some reason I felt obliged to finish it! Basically, I wanted to see if there were aliens, UFOs, anything that suggested the movie's title, the film's cover and the beginning of the movie! I was very disappointed to see the religion thrown into the mix as it was. This may have been used for the benefit of the film, but I heard instead that the film was trying to send subliminal messages to me! Finally, how big was the wardrobe of this cast !? I became so distracted by the number of different, extremely bright shirts that every character had in every new scene that I started wondering if this movie should have been classified as "poor comedy". <br /> toe thumbs down!
