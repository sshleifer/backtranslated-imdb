I'm sorry for that But if you've seen this "epic", you will obviously know of the total disregard for the current text of the Bible. Now, I'm not exactly the next in line for holiness, but I know the basics. And the basics were these. God wanted to erase all of the face of the Earth because he believed he had been corrupted to the point of no return. He chose Noah, the rough diamond, and his family to spare because of their incorruptible ways. Noah builds an ark according to God's instructions to host him, his family and two of each creature while flooding the rest of the planet. These are the basics. In this film, there are other people who go by sea like street vendors and pirates. But I thought EVERYONE was wiped out. I guess the NBC executives have never been to church. There are other inaccuracies, I was told, but being the average Joe, I have no idea what they are. Sorry. Returning to the film, the acting brat was inaccurate, as mentioned before, but some of the effects were good, I'll give it. But overall, I saw a better and more refined interpretation of the story made as a small scene on The Simpsons. God help the leaders of NBC to come judgment day. 3/10
