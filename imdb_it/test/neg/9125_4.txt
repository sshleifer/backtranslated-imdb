As with many sequels, this just doesn't have the quality or impact of the original. The first belongs up there with the rest of the adults. This just doesn't cut it. The first film had a magical "good time" about it which is totally missing in this film. We fell in love with all these characters (not Richard Dreyfuss) in an age of innocence. Now, some years later, they have changed so much that they are mostly different people. While this is what happens in real life, we don't expect this to happen to our favorite movie characters! The film does not have the humor of the original and we expected to laugh. What little humor there is, it's dark. The first film also featured what is probably the greatest soundtrack ever, while this one is good, but not even close to the original. This film is so totally different from the original that it's not even a sequel. I gave a 4.
