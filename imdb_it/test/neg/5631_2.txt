STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Unorthodox journalist Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) leaves behind its time to wind up the local police and trying to romanticize a police staff member. But everything changes when the hostess of the pub on the side of the Thames she frequents is found murdered and a transcript of an unpublished novel is found with the confession of the legendary writer Charles Dickens. While digging deeper into both mysteries, he is immersed in the mystery and danger of what he expected. <br /> <br /> In 1998, former footballer Vinnie Jones shot out of nowhere and caught everyone by surprise with his cult classic gangster Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Okay, no one was wiped out by his acting skills, but his presence as a hard man seemed destined to guarantee a decent career as a hard film. But all this turned out to be a unique wonder, and all that it really got after supporting actor status among much more acclaimed actors in movies like Gone in Sixty Seconds and Swordfish, before descending into the kingdom of hell directly on DVD, the latest being this muddy and laborious thriller, which could have been okay if he hadn't taken other acclaimed and promising stars like Derek Jacobi, Julie Cox, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng and Mel Smith with him. What made him fall from the dizzying heights of success so quickly (apart perhaps from being a pony with a single trick) is someone's hypothesis (a dubious personal life is a possible hypothesis) but here it is. <br /> <br /> A The script was far-fetched and incomprehensible in that it would have been a task for anyone, but with a killjoy who looked at Jones in the head, it's even more difficult to understand. The juxtaposed roles of Jacobi as a former tramp and the same Dickens who speaks directly to the camera through the outside, are obviously suggestions to build something and the script is predictable also in other areas. Add to this economic-looking production value through the out and debut director (even the screenwriter) Brendan Foley made a bad first impression. <br /> <br /> What exactly did I expect with something that came free with The Daily Mail? *
