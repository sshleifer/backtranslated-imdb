I can't believe I'm wasting time with a comment - but this movie is strangely bad. If 20 different directors were introduced to film different parts of the film without having any idea of ​​the plot that was filmed by the other directors, this is practically the result I would expect. <br /> <br /> I also think that the scenes have been put in order - things don't always seem to progress in order. The film acts as if we need to know about half of the characters. <br /> <br /> And Steve Guttenberg tries to make a manic comedy, a-la-Robin Williams, in this movie. Ewww. And the whole premise of putting a former prisoner at the head of a group of kids doesn't seem realistic today.
