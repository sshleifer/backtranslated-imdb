This film is right there with The Oscar and Moment by Moment as one of the unwittingly entertaining movies of all time. <br /> <br /> It is worth the hiring for a wildly fantastic laugh. <br /> <br /> The story is absolutely ridiculous. Nothing in life would be like it was so absolutely incredible. the way James Woods looks and pushes heavy hitters, who give this alleged two-bit game a job 3000 miles away in Los Angeles, what a joke <br /> <br /> I love the old VW bug beaten to mean how low you came into life because of all the "tootski's". <br /> <br /> Sean Young is incredibly bad as "I'll love you forever, no matter what, wife" you'll see. it wasn't so fun to throw up, no matter how sweet and sweet Young tries to throw herself. And as if acting badly like you will never see. <br /> <br /> James Wood manages to get through the whole film and is so extremely funny and very, very exaggerated, you can't believe it, Woods looks like a parody of a cursed Saturday Night Live cocaine. But looking at Woods on "ludes" is worth the rental price. <br /> <br /> I like it when Woods tells the guy that he wants to give him some more "ludes" that he doesn't do that stuff anymore, right before, Woods just made three giant lines of coke. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny thing. <br /> <br /> The ending is so comical but right on par with the rest of the film.
