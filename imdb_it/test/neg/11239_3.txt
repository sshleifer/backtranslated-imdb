If a movie can't keep your interest for the first 25 minutes, it's too much for me. This concept that you simply have to face a slow first third of a movie and be rewarded later is nonsense. A good film must start and finish strong. Everything seems interesting and some decent shots and many promises, but in the end confused and irrelevant. There are so many other films from Asia to watch, many of which I'm sure many of you haven't seen, that I really want to skip this and look elsewhere. Why exactly does IMDb require a minimum of 10 lines for reviews? I said my piece and I hope this helps some of you move on to the next movie.
