Wow. I just saw Demon Wind a little while ago, and I don't think I'll ever be the same again. It has the power to inspire nightmares, but for all the wrong reasons, actually. <br /> <br /> Never before has humanity seen such a free change in makeup, for any reason. Or, similarly, so much bad zombie trick (?) That makes you hungry for those green Halloween marshmallows. <br /> <br /> Or so much naked old lady, after all. But then, there was "The Shining". <br /> <br /> The plot here is so amateurish that it actually contains almost a bit of charm, as does dialogue. The latest film shooting is so foolish that it is beyond description. It's like some drunken college student joins some friends and decides to create a Bruce Willis type dialogue with (I think?) A teenybopper dialogue from an Elm Street movie. The result is disconcerting, and would be really fun if it was intended that way. <br /> <br /> Ah, that hey. I laugh anyway. <br /> <br /> Hell, come with your friends and watch this. But make sure you are drunk first. Or you could go crazy. Especially if you are a university film student. <br /> <br /> Thanks.
