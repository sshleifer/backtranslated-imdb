This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I couldn't stay awake. The acting and the plot were horrible. I like movies B, but this movie has nothing that can make me laugh or think. OK, there were two or three funny moments at the beginning, so I have to give this movie 2 out of 10. If you really want to watch it, watch the first 10 minutes. After that you will be increasingly disappointed as the movie runs.
