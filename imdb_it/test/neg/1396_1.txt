I haven't seen this show in months, but for a while I was forced to watch it every day because I had a roommate he liked. So maybe it has undergone a big improvement all this time, even if the ads and the 4.2 rating on IMDb are not a good sign. <br /> <br /> It was clearly just a quick replacement for Chappelle's Show. Mencia also says it. And although I wasn't even a big fan of Chappelle's Show, his lines were at least original and intelligent (and much more angular than those of Mencia). Mencia's lines are completely unoriginal and stale. If you can't see it, I guess there's no hope for you. But to be honest, here are some examples: <br /> <br /> --Mencia blatantly breaks the Chapelle Lil Jon scene. Takes only. <br /> <br /> - "South Park" makes an episode on Scientology. A week later, Mencia has a joke about his show about how offensive he is to Scientologists. Keep in mind that the joke is not about Scientologists, but how much he has offended him in his show. When until now, he has never done a single Scientology joke, ever. <br /> <br /> - After Hurricane Katrina, two AP photos run on the Internet showing a black man who "steals" groceries and a white woman "find them". WEEKS later, after millions of people have already seen it, Mencia presents it on his show as if discovering it and seeing it for the first time (the Daily Show would have been about something like that in one day). Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Even more annoying than the joke-theft is the way Carlos promoted himself and his show, claiming that he is breaking down some sort of PC barrier (whatever) and that if you're not laughing, you have to be a modest faint who can't handle race jokes. Yes, Carlos, it's not because you're not funny, it's because we're all too offended to laugh (if it were really true, then why was Chappelle's show so popular?). He constantly reproaches his audience for "not understanding" if they don't get enough laughs, and often repeats and EXPLAINs his lines, a technique that most comedians stop using at 14. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that Mencia doesn't seem to be very smart. It's a bit tragic that there are dozens of funniest and most perceptive comedians trying to make it while this guy is making money. His show is supposedly the third most voted on Comedy Central, which is staggering (again, it has a rating of 4.2 on this site). Where the hell are they taking these numbers ?? Comedy Central tries to make itself feel like a "sharp" station, but as long as it tries to attract the stupidest possible audience, it will never be like this.
