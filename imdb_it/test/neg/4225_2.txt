I think the cards were stacked against the webmaster, because from the beginning there was this itchy feeling, like something was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Then it hit me. Nicknamed. For a while, they handled most of the lines both as voice and off screen, with just a little hint here and there, until it became painfully obvious. This is the kind of dubbing that croaks on the nerves, with nothing even remotely amusing about it. I hate dubbing, but at least, however misplaced, martial arts films, badly nicknamed, tend to have a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> What I wanted was a movie about a hacker doing hacking and stuff like that. Maybe like a downside of the Hackers movie table (it's about the person trying to keep them out instead of people trying to get in). What I got was a dark mystery with no written meaning, meaningless sometimes with a ton of bad chase sequences, a seemingly inept hacker who was sterilized without his little ego, and a director who obviously didn't know how to run a car photographic. I just wanted to come in, get the camera from the guy and shoot myself. The assembly was not much better. The acting? Well, I guess if the protagonist didn't have such a bad script to work from, it would at least be watchable. The main villain was OK, but pretty much everyone else was a joke. The dubbing was not helpful, but the acting was pretty bad, even taking this into account. <br /> <br /> Before going into something negative, let's emphasize some positive things. Well, one or two. Despite the rudimentary graphics, I really liked the cyberworld stuff, the little that was there, and I would have preferred to see a movie mostly around, in and around that of the warm surroundings outside in the "real world". The false image of digital identification seemed a bit cold, but ended up being rather useless in the scheme of things. The gadget of the heart, which reminded me of Cronos by Guillermo Del Toro, was interesting, although as a plot tool torn directly from the pages of Escape from New York, it was horribly conceived in the long run. There is a point where the villain is unconscious and our hero is right there. Why didn't you try the bad thumb print then (since the cardiac device was activated with the thumb)? However, some interesting gadgets and cyber stuff, if only they could have been used better. <br /> <br /> Now, who dares to compare this film to Blade Runner? Both films will take place in the future and there is a kind of old-fashioned romanticism in both films. There's a murder investigation, but I've seen a lot of movies with a murder in the middle that aren't like Blade Runner or Webmaster. Identity, for example. This is where the similarities end. Period. There is no comparison, just as there would be no Blade Runner and Hacker. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director with a great mind for art direction and knows some fundamentals of film making, such as where to put the camera. The webmaster is cheap and not just for the budget. It's cheap because of bad writing, and because it often takes the easy way (like writing in a character who barely appeared in the first place to save the girl at the end to take her to Point B alone without the Hero so that could do his thing, very convenient, or the attempted sympathy factor for a character for whom we have no reason to care, or foolish things like the machine that prepares to block them enough to allow someone to escape.). <br /> <br /> Try to be fashionable, try to be exploitative, try also an ending that is not surprising at all, and try to be electrifying. But a bunch of almost identical chase sequences, bad writing, editing, horribly filmed, bad acting, etc. They don't make an electrifying film.
