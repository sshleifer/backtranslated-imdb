I have no idea what these people were thinking when they made this film. No plot, very limited action, and what is there in the comment of the third person throughout the film ???? Instead of going around the planet to shoot in all these places, they would have to spend a little money writing scripts and actors. What acting there was, it was bad. This was 90 minutes of my life I will never go back. I should bill the director for the cost of renting this movie. To the director and screenwriters of this film ... please stop now. This film should have a tag on the front that says attention to boredom. The only good thing I can say about this movie is the computer generation. Okay as the generation is. This film should never have a sequel .... ever.
