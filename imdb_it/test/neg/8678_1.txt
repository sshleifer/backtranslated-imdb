I watched 40 minutes and couldn't stand it any longer ?? the television exploded and I went back to reading "Lobotomy for Beginners". <br /> <br /> It was hard to say which aspect of this production was very unpleasant - the dialogue consisting entirely of sound-bytes or recitation from numbers. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to determine the time when the drama should take place. There were references to Lord Nelson and slavery, but Edmund, the future cleric, played by Blake Ritson, was the only actor to believe that he was inhabited at the beginning of the 19th century. The other young and brilliant things had more appropriate tricks and costumes for a 21st century masquerade party - the bleached blonde Fanny, Billie Piper is the less credible character. <br /> <br /> British commercial television obviously believes in breasts, pouting lips and deep, deep looks form a beautiful story. Fortunately, Jane Austen had other ideas. <br /> <br /> If you want to discover the history of Mansfield Park, buy the DVD of the 1983 miniseries.
