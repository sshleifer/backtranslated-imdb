this is one of the stupidest movies ever, not the stupidest mind you are, but one of the most stupid. This is 96 1/2 minutes of sleep inducing material. Probably the worst Jim Varney movie ever. The last 30 seconds of the movie are the best and funniest part, but it's not worth sitting around for the whole movie. On the other hand, if you are a passionate fan of Jim Varney / Ernest, then like me, you have to add this movie to your collection. It has short, rare moments of humor, even if they are few and far between. The simple fact that this film is so hard to find makes it a collector's item and a must for your largest collection. I was lucky to find this movie online at a cheap price a couple of years ago. I think I paid 1.99 more shipping for this. And it was the only copy I could find anywhere. While this is a really horrible movie, it's still a must if you're a Jim Varney fan and a Ernest movie collector like me. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this film a 2 but this is only because I've never seen a 1 before;)
