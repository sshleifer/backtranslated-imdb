At first I was interested in this film after reading a synopsis and saw some amazing screenshots, and the promise was there for a compelling horror movie of Dario Argento's style. I have to say that Argento's films have occasionally been quite incoherent, and some feel like a handful of scenic elements that visually affect together with a vague connection. <br /> <br /> Given that Argento is credited as a writer for this, I must say that I'm not really surprised. Even his masterpiece Suspiria, once examined, shows the same tendency to tighten scenes that are sometimes unrelated, purely for the aesthetic impact. However, Suspiria also has the benefit of a singular main character and clear antagonists, as well as scenes that contributed to the final resolution. <br /> <br /> The Church, on the other hand, has none of this. It has no main character, no protagonist; moreover it doesn't have a real plot to talk about, and no crescendo, no climax, no epilogue and no resolution. It's a completely empty, inconsistent work, which seems like if Argento sat down and thought 'hey, which would make a scene visually interesting ... let's do it!' The film is a series of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Initially it might be interesting, and the direction of Soavi is excellent, I must say. Soavi cannot be criticized for the material, as it is made as convincing as possible. However, such good direction calls attention to the horrible failures of the script, and it makes absolutely no sense. The attempt at a central unifying plot is nothing but plagiarism in Carpenter's film, Prince of Darkness. Events only happen because the script wants them and reactions to those events are completely unlikely. The narrative flow is irreparably damaged after a point, simply because there is no possibility of suspending disbelief; it's too ridiculous. Added to this are numerous factual errors that are so clearly presented that it becomes embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If it had been more explicitly artistic and modified in a different work, it would have been chilling or tense. If it had been redesigned into a true cohesive narrative, it could have been compelling. But it was none of these. The best he managed was confusing and sometimes exasperating. Textures are introduced but never followed. The characters are forgotten and modified arbitrarily. No logic is ever applied to any situation. It could have been scary or interesting, but to elicit that kind of feeling it takes more effort on the part of a writer ... much more. <br /> <br /> All in all, The Church is not worth seeing for anyone but the total Italian horror enthusiasts are more style than substance. This is the style of Argento in the worst case, and it is a strong justification for the usual criticisms.
