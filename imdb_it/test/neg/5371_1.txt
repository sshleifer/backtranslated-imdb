This show is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, of course it is false. But it's distressing to watch. I personally know minds influenced by the most creative cinema that could "make it" look real. The young male guide could not be more unconvincing. Reads everything he says. Do we really suppose he knows what he's talking about? There's a myriad of ways for Blair-Witch, this show. Fear does not come from what seems "beautiful" and generated by the computer. Nor does it generate such proverbial lines as "What was it? Did you hear?" Furthermore, there are real convincing psychics out there who not only "want to be on screen". Another DUH factor is ... how these producers think we are going to buy that paranormal activity that simply will come true magically within the 2 possible 3 days (if we're lucky) they film. I don't think so. A 2 + week in a site would be more convincing. It is also disarming to think that it includes "NASA radar controls" and that computers that show bs fantasy make us really scared. AND IE: Exorcisms should not be staged like the movie "The Exorcist". When are they going to do it right? Devil's possession or other evil spirits influence people differently. They don't growl and lower their voices like Linda Blair or fall around like Courtney Love in a drug binge. As stated, better concentrations on "psychic abilities" would greatly help this show. We want to see and hear EVERYTHING you suppose to flash in front of them. Not cut for other bs stories. A final note: shooting stars do not generate interest when you have shown false images of UFOs in advance. I could point out once again that the dark-haired young man who hosts this show is absolutely terrible. Avoid this show. Out of fear: watch the old episodes of Unsolved Mystery ... not the new ones (recreation took it oh, so bad). But this is for another blog.
