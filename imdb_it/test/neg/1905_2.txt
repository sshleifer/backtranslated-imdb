If it wasn't for Colin Firth, the film would be ready for the dustbin! So predictable, so foolish and so badly recited !! Only Colin Firth, as always, shines from this mess like a single light at the end of the tunnel !! <br /> <br /> The worst was Jennifer Rubin's acting, for sure! Maybe it was because of this script (actually they actually wrote one or it was just invented "coming" ???). <br /> <br /> To make it short: <br /> <br /> It MUST SEE only for Colin Firth Fanatics (like me) since it is incredibly sexy and of good acting (fight hard against this script) mentally challenged "). These Colin-Screen-Time minutes make up a lot of this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't spend too much money on it, though. Try to see or get as cheap as possible (an auction or something) and then follow the Colin Firth scenes. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film could be dangerous to anyone's mental health.
