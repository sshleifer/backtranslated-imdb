Forced, cloying, formidable. Do these adjectives make you want to run and rent yours? Miriam Hopkins was brilliant in the original "Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde". Some of his other early films, especially "The Story of Temple Drake", are never shown, but they are said to be excellent. <br /> <br /> Here, she is cutesy, overbearing and completely unpleasant. Ray Milland as a bohemian of the Green Village Village is not at all convincing. <br /> <br /> The two children are terrifying and have no relation to the Village as it was then. <br /> <br /> Speaking as a native of Greenwich Village, I find the surrogate environment generic and fake. Not that I was around for a couple of generations but my relatives were there in 1937. It's not funny. It is not remotely authentic. We don't care about the characters. <br /> <br /> So many films have been made about the masses fighting against the capitalists right now, and done with elan. "Easy Living" comes to mind. It did not take place in the village. But it sounds very true. This sounds with a dull bell.
