The film was terrible. The production company should be required to pay a fine for the waste of electricity that transmits this nonsense. <br /> <br /> There were too many holes in the plot. Why should the DOJ send a murderer to assassinate a world leader? If they weren't the DOJ, why would they send someone they thought wouldn't do the job? To quote Butch Cassidy, "Who are those guys?" Apparently, the director doesn't know because he never told us. <br /> <br /> The characters were incredible. They didn't behave in any way that seemed to fit who they were supposedly. With the exception of the doctor, none of the characters was particularly compelling or funny. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste money on the electricity you need to watch this movie, feel free. Otherwise, go in the opposite direction.
