I really loved the Millenium series, played by Lance Henriksen, which is why I bought the film. Obviously at some level it was a mistake. Mutant movies / monsters are usually bad and this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> The basic idea itself is not totally judged wrong (well, however, this film would never have been a success, even with a good director & actors), but the way it turns out that this is just a class B movie. The scenes that should be scary seem more fun to me and the criticism is not at all credible. <br /> <br /> However, watching this film with a group of friends in a restless mood makes this film shine because it is so unintentionally exhilarating.
