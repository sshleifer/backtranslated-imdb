This film had great production values, good lighting, costumes, sets, cinematography and acting. But someone, somewhere, took the script, and replaced all the dialogues with the elementary school level, barely writing literally. I heard my IQ drop points every time a character spoke. <br /> <br /> Did they do it on purpose? Was it just an accident of Brain Dead Studio Executives? At this point, we don't know. <br /> <br /> All I know is that this film was a big mistake from start to finish. We don't even see how the team became a policewoman, so instead of developing any character, we get what looks like a bad TV movie from the 1960s. Or every time. <br /> <br /> Find the writers, beat them with a sock full of quarters. All the others, good work, but read your scripts next time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
