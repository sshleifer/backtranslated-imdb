You Belong To Me was the final team of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a team of writers and was a film on loan for Fonda at Columbia Pictures. Fonda signed a contract with 20th Century Fox to get the part of Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath. But after that it was usually his loan of movies that were good while he was cast in mediocre things at Fox. <br /> <br /> But the rule has been broken here. Although the character he plays has a superficial resemblance to Charles Pike of The Lady Eve, this film is not funny at all. In reality, feminists would probably be stunned. <br /> <br /> Actually Barbara Stanwyck didn't like it at all. She liked working with Henry Fonda quite well, but she thought this film was ridiculous. She should also have it. <br /> <br /> Fonda is another millionaire playboy, whom we would now call a child of the trust fund who really doesn't do much with his life. It's a kind of lovable spilungone that meets Stanwyck on a ski slope and literally falls for her trying to show off. It turns out that she is a doctor and they have a whirling courtship and get married. <br /> <br /> But apparently Fonda has a jealous streak, especially when it involves Roger Clark, another Stanwyck patient millionaire. And he doesn't understand his professional obligations. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck, like Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn, was and is a feminist icon. When he tells Fonda that he should go out to work and live with a salary and see if he can do it, Fonda leaves and finds a job as a salesman in a department store. She is so proud of him that he is actually going to give up his medical practice and live with him on the salary of his salesman. <br /> <br /> Today NOW he would be staking the film. Stanwyck didn't have too much conviction in his show, probably because he didn't believe it. I certainly couldn't. <br /> <br /> I don't think the public believed it even then. But the two stars and the rest of the cast did their best, but this was a special Thanksgiving.
