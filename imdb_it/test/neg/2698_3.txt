In fact, I reviewed the entire series of reviews, looking for those that gave this film less than 5 stars. They were few and far between. Which is absolutely disconcerting! Yes, I know it's a Disney movie and it's not directed by Christopher Nolan, but good God. This is an absurdity from one business to another. They should have done it and animated the bloody thing. <br /> <br /> And what's even worse is that IMDb won't just let me finish my outburst there, because my review has to be longer! <br /> <br /> The filming of "Awesome" in-game is LITERALLY taken from the Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf on the Playstation, the plot looks like an aping cheater, the multi-wire character and plot development paralyzes an already setup weak, and the grand finale is boring. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it was really the biggest movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Costumes, sets and sports equipment with an authentic appearance. There, I said it.
