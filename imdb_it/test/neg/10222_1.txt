Now I'm a big fan of animation - I love Svankmeyer and I'm usually in all stop motion apps, so I had high hopes for that. Then I came to IMDb and took a break --- I'm always very wary of movies with a bimodal distribution of votes on IMDb. Here we have another one - a group of 10s (shill anyone) and then some real basses. I am also suspicious of 10s with the word "visionary" in them. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are visionaries but this character is not one of them. Despite my fears, I saw this movie and I have to be on the side of those. The stop motion animation was fine, but the plots were trivial and overall seemed amateurish. Give yourself the real deal, get some Svankmeyer and let this work on the shelf too.
