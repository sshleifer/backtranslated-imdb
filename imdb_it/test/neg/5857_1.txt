I saw this movie last night, a satire of reality-style programs that seem to be going around right now. <br /> <br /> What can I say. I absolutely hated it. Interesting as watching dry paint and perhaps with just one or two slightly funny moments. <br /> <br /> Maybe it had something to do with me, surely not being a fan of the Survivor and Big Brother shows, but if this was a video / DVD or if I was watching in the cinema alone I wouldn't definitely endured more than the first 5 minutes. <br /> <br />
