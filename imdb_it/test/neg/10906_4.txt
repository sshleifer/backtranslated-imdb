The cookie cutter works extraordinarily in this obvious and unoriginal love story. The plot, as it is, has been done before a trillion times, so there is no need to tell it. Suffice it to say that all 12-year-old girls will love this movie while the rest of us will be forced to make a face. Even the soundtrack is horrible! It's not that I don't like figure skating, even if I don't, it's that I don't like clich√©s, bad movies.
