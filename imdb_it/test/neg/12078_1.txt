The 80s were the best of times and the worst of times for James Karin, he starred in one of the best cult horror comedies with "The Return of the Living Dead" and a year later he performed in this ... bad movie. A sequel to Hardbodies (but not really), it has a group of quite unpredictable characters trying to shoot a film in Greece. Through design or sheer laziness, the line between the film and the "film within a film" is not only blurred, but completely non-existent from one scene to another (which would be confusing if I were only interested in all that happens in the film in first place, Unfunny would be too generous a term. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nana, Fabiana Udenio and many other accomplices become topless, Brenda Bakke shows some T & A <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Only trailer for "Hardbodies", "American High School", "Strike", "Virgin Territory" (arrives in a double-feature DVD with the first film, for the masochist)
