The Ealing comedies constitute their specific subgenre in the history of the film. They were ironic reflections on British life in the late forties and early fifties. They are always fun but I think it is misleading to characterize them as comedies. They are cheerful and in good spirits, rather than laughing at funny crackles. However, the best of them is laced with a sober satire and crossed by an occasional dark series (in particular Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Ladykillers). I have an affection for all of them, but The Lavender Hill Mob is probably the one I have the most difficulty with. Compared to the others, it seems rather superficial. For me, it's a sketch for a movie, but it needs to spend a lot more time in development before it's ready to go in front of the cameras. <br /> <br /> Everything is a little raw. For example, no real context or background is provided. Henry is simply a dutiful drudge, whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions are not recognized, while Albert is a frustrated artist forced to prostitute his talent by trashing the souvenir shop for a living. This creates a reason for their crime, but nothing that happens later is a consequence of their characters or their plan. <br /> <br /> Other characters are introduced but are not real part of the story. The elders residing in Henry's guest house could (with his love for police stories) have been taken a thorn in the side, but they are simply used as a background "color". Similarly, the various policemen who enter and leave the action are simply there to keep up the continuous pace. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film is driven entirely by its artificial plot devices, which I find both frustrating and vaguely irritating. The not very ingenious robbery is accomplished with minimal problems, although Albert is prevented from carrying out his part in the plan (by Clayton by Sidney Tafler). The gold is then smuggled into France without setback. Everything would have gone smoothly had it not been for a small hitch, based on the French pronunciation of the letter "R", which results in the accidental sale of six of the golden Eiffel Towers to some English students. <br /> <br /> This leads to a series of frantic chases as Henry and Albert try to recover them. These scenes are well executed, but at every point the conspirators are frustrated in their search for female students from a series of entirely fictitious incidents. It is as if God was deliberately intervening to give them a difficult time. This kind of plot always makes my teeth grind. <br /> <br /> When they finally trace the last Eiffel Tower to a police academy show and tear it from under the nose of John Gregson's police inspector (why is he there, anyway?) all the shreds of the logic of the plot are abandoned. The last car chases are simply filling the time on the screen until we are back at the framing device with which the photo started. <br /> <br /> The film doesn't even bother to tell us the fate of Albert (Stanley Holloway), Lackery (Sid James) and Shorty (Alfie Bass). <br /> <br /> This brilliant little caper has the professionalism of the Ealing team, so it's far from being a bad movie. I suspect most viewers will find it noticeably more enjoyable than me (and why shouldn't they?), But I can't help but think that there would have been a much better film waiting to be made, if only more time and effort they had been spent to enrich both the characters and the story. <br /> <br /> According to the standards set by Ealing, Lavender Hill Mob is a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> PS: A curious note is that Audrey Hepburn gets a credit for her single line at first, but Archie Duncan remains anonymous despite her much more substantial contribution. I guess he just had a better agent.
