I remember seeing him for the first time in the 1980s as a teenager. Friend, I read the reviews on this junk and I find myself amazed by the vote. This film does not deserve four stars !!! This movie is NOT better than Topgun. Topgun has its problems; do not get me wrong. This film should be banned only because of its stupidity. So many stereotypes, so many loop holes, so VERY poor dialogue. I can't think of a saving quality of this vomit. This is not action / adventure. This is a bad joke on the film. A bit like watching piano 9 with F-16 series footage. This film not only challenges logic and common sense in the context of a military context, but sends a disturbing message. The military will not save your father from the imminent evil of the Middle East. So go out there and steal a multi-million dollar weapon and blow up the sinister clutches of anti-American Arabs. Because you can't reason with those animals. This is a Bruckheimer film without a budget. Bland's direction, weak acting, lame music, idiotic plot, equal to ... Iron Eagle.
