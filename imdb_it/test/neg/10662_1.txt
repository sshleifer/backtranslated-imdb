(HR is what Himesh is called in the movie, I think he likes it too.) It's amazing how smart, talented people fall into the same trap. <br /> <br /> I really like Reshamiya. It's amazing what he did. No one in recent years has returned from the wild and has left a mark for himself. <br /> <br /> And I really expected a great movie (What with the budget of 50 Cr and the nice actress). As intense as Reshamiya's thought is, he would excel in a sentimental and emotional role. Ironically the same is depicted, but for what care? Pure incompetence, carelessness, horrible acting, trivial background music, insensitive direction make it a real pain. <br /> <br /> Rule of Errors. (Ex. How can the German police issue public instructions on an English speaker? They communicate with each other in English!) Unfortunately this incompetence has become the standard in Bollywood's main line. There are some excellent but also bad directors. The worst thing is that the majority simply don't care. <br /> <br /> Songs are the only thing that saves ... <br /> <br /> Please do not repeat this HR and find yourself a good director (low budget .. No problem). <br /> <br /> The bad guy really should have shaved his head instead of the wig you know ... after all, it's a 50Cr movie.
