OK - I gave a "3" just because they obviously didn't have any money to make this movie, but I think it might deserve the "2.3" rating it had when I arrived here. I'm actually helping to raise the rating, despite being bored for the last hour and a half. I will save the "1" and "2" for the highest budget pieces. At least the producers of "Rise of the Undead" have not wasted so much money. They managed to waste 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The film is too claustrophobic for me. The entire film takes place in the same building, in dark rooms and corridors. With a setting like this, there should have been more action or character development, but there's just a lot of nonsense talk. I didn't know any of the characters. There's a student and a goth girl but we don't find out much more. None of the characters seem really nice. <br /> <br /> Terrible movie made without a budget. No scary special effects. Without suspense Nothing really interesting here, folks. I admit I downloaded this from the net. It was free but I'm throwing it away. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the filmmakers. Next time you'll be luckier. This is more like a soap opera than a zombie movie.
