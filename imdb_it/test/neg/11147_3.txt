The plot of this is reduced to Ah-nuld against Satan, and what I remember most about the film is a lot of explosions, shots, blood, noise, and let's not forget that flammable satanic urine. The story is meaningless, absolutely predictable and so full of holes that I couldn't take it seriously. Switch to "Rosemary's Baby" or "The Exorcist" if you want to see a really good devil movie and ... um, well, I can't think of any good "Action" movies at the moment (probably because I'm "you're like that far and few), so you're alone in that category.This movie gets a 3 out of 10 rating for its field value, and for a good performance by Gabriel Byrne like that old Devil Satan!
