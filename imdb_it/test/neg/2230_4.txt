My Take: Typically routine and lazy straight to the Disney video attempt. <br /> <br /> Disney must have fallen in love with the family film tradition that is the family dog. Many films have dedicated themselves to stories that focus exclusively on man's best friend. The Disney ones themselves have made a handful. They even made a handful of those that are literally dogs. Add this to that group. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the original for a very long time, so I'm probably not the right person to judge whether this straight-to-video sequel is more convenient. Anyone over seven is not the right person to see it. Perhaps only the youngest of the young would want to see LADY AND THE TRAMP II: SCAMP'S ADVENTURE, and they too would grow up and say that it was not the best kind of family entertainment they had ever seen. I guess that's right, I can say is that it deserves a rental, but there's not much to say. <br /> <br /> This sequel takes up practically the parts left after the original often called classic. Lady and Tramp now have a litter of cute Crocker Spaniel puppies ... and a mischievous bastard named Scamp who is a chip from the old block. Instead of home boundaries, Scamp wants to escape with the other landfill dogs in the city, unaware of his father's past as one of those street bastards. To capture the charm of the original, it throws into the same poor dog / rich dog affair, vice versa. Scamp falls in love with one of the dogs from the landfill called Angel (and who wouldn't want with a name like that and a voice that looks like Alyssa Milano?). That replay of the famous spaghetti scene! In addition to the "cute" factor, there is nothing in store for any audience in this lazy straight-to-video effort. Follow the original. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
