There are some scenes in this film (like the hero's first encounter with super-small Shirley Eaton) in which he seems to be about to break sexual taboos and make his premises (the females want to rule the world by enslaving men) justice , but never dares. The result is a film without sexuality and some domesticated violence. Despite the chilling plot, the film is not excessively bad until its climax, where its dilettantism spreads (terrible editing, excessive use of archive material). It is worth seeing only as a curiosity. (* 1/2)
