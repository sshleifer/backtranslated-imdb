This film has some good performances going on for this - and that's all it takes. The protagonists, especially Pauley Perrette, are tempting. (Although some of the bit players seem to act as a teleprompter.) The material - this is the problem. It seems to me that the writer / director has watched the entire sequence of Felicity in one sitting, then sat down to write a screenplay without falling asleep. He really reminded me of Felicity - a reflexive young woman who finds herself, finds love, with a shake-to-see-as-happens approach to the characters and their relationships. Except that while I usually liked watching Felicity, this movie left me cold. The writing is simply horrible. It is surprising that the cast can come out as well as they did, because dialogue is boring to the fullest. In the worst case it becomes trivial, wading and amateur. There is nothing original here, with elements of the plot recycled from gimmicks that weren't so brilliant to begin with. (Angels and soothsayers? Come on.) For the first half of the movie, I rooted for the actors and hoped to be rewarded for my patience. By the second half, I only wanted it to end already. My likes of the cast, who deserved a better vehicle for their talents.
