I'm great at acting, writing and directing, but not yet famous. My friends and I often rent bad movies, just for fun and a good laugh, but when we went to the local Family Video and found a movie called Biker Zombies in Detroit, we knew it would be the worst movie of all time and it was ! Biker Zombies of Detroit does not have a script! They can say they have one, but they're liars! There was a 4-minute scene of only two boys riffing about women and sexuality, and it was clear that it was improvised. And if they are going to improvise, it should be at least decent, but it wasn't, and by the two actors you could tell the wrong lines and say things that didn't even make sense. <br /> <br /> To give you an idea of ​​how terrible and delayed this film is, here is the beginning: a girl kicks off a boy, he punches her in the face and beats her, then violates her. Then we see the zombies that attack and both turn into zombies. <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of the movie! Not to mention the voice of zombie protagonist that runs through the whole film, trying to be sinister and stimulating, but that looks like Marylin Manson who has a conniption fit. <br /> <br /> The worst movie ever. I mean, people. But look at it if you like movies without screenplay, without plot, bad acting, bad editing, bad music and over 100 F words used in the movie. <br /> <br /> If this can affect video stores, my future films will win the Oscars.
