While reading the online script, I thought "Capote" needed a set up. Having just seen him on PPV, I can tell you that he was not trimmed, he was slaughtered like that poor family! Example: in the script, Truman calls Shawn "Adorable One"; here, he is "Mr. Shawn". Bad enough amateurs behind this de-flame film Capote and hit his circle (do we really think they thought so little about Nelle, did they tear up his little Opus as an odious joke?), Turn Perry Smith into this oh-so-sensitive victim, although he showed to send the Clutters. It is one thing to merge the facts, another is to throw the ball: the executions were performed between 12: 45-1: 19, on April 14; Truman is shown at the prison 22 HOURS AFTER! <br /> <br /> I was totally disappointed with "acting". Keener doesn't even try to look like an Alabama native. The way Cooper kept shouting "Alvin!", I was waiting for the Chimpmunks to show up! Hoffman does not give us the funny gadfly, but a pathetic suction that sees a horrible act like his ticket for the big moment. When Hoffman whines about being "tortured" by endless appeals, I wanted to give him a shotgun so he could do us a favor and smash his brain!
