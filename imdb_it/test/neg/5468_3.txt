Here are a couple of paragraphs from an essay I wrote for the university on TBOR. <br /> <br /> "The Book of Revelation is an erotic thriller about the sex, power and struggle of a talented dancer to regain his sense of self after being unfortunately raped by three cloaked women, the three women who rape him all have distinctive marks on their bodies, one has a huge birth mark on his buttocks, another has a butterfly tattoo on his belly and the head of the ring has a small circle on her So he lives his new life looking for these signs and, finding them in these intimate places, does what any sane man does when he needs to see as many naked women as possible to solve a mystery, have sex with them An hour and ten minutes in the film and you have the feeling of having almost a piece of every woman in Melbourne. <br /> <br /> The film is a gigantic piece of pretentious celluloid, it is like a drip of grand loquity in every frame, at one point towards the filmx the final apex is Kok I kinos give a sc ena to the same energy and strength as its first feature, Head On, in droves.
