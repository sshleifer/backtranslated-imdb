I don't know why all the previous comments are the approval of this film. IT, well not by far but ..., THE SUCKIEST MOVIE THAT I SAW LATELY, full of clich√©s, bad acting, actually no ... bad acting and has a silly plot ... If I had seen it in a cinema I would go out after the first 20 minutes. If you hate someone, let them watch this movie ... it's so bad. A girl who has an imaginary boyfriend / friend who gives up a relationship with a real one because her imagination is jealous ... but I think it depends ... she takes after her parents who also have some mental problems ... plus the character that is supposed to be I think of the lure, the thing that should make you laugh, cal's roommate is a bad case and makes me feel sorry for him ... and for the whole movie
