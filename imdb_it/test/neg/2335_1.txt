seriously, if I wanted to make a film that made sense zero, it would never do it, and the lesbian scenes represent its only strong point, I could have. <br /> <br /> david lynch is the worst, like this movie. anyone could have made a better film in which at least some answers were given and the story was not so slow and lengthy. history means nothing without something in the end besides credits. What a waste of time. I will never receive those 147 minutes of my life and hope others can learn from my mistake.
