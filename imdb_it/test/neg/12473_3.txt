At least for me. I followed Mr. Almdovar's career from the beginning and I wasn't crazy about this movie. I think Penelope Cruz was uncomfortable, the kind of woman she portrays is not that good, it makes the character incredible. Furthermore, the singing scene was simply strange. I don't understand the point and lip-synching was terrible. <br /> <br /> As a Spaniard, another thing that drove me crazy is the accents. Why do people from the same place have such a different accent? The difference between the two sisters is remarkable and does not make sense. And the village? are we in 2007 or 1950? I found myself explaining to my American husband that many of the things in the film are "old school", things are not like that anymore. <br /> <br /> I expected more, but this time Mr. Almodovar did not deliver, at least for me. I'm not saying that Miss Cruz does a bad job, I'm saying she doesn't belong to this, not portraying that character.
