Sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says "stay away from this movie". We should all pay more attention to that little voice. This could be the worst movie I've ever had the dislikes of sitting, or it could be the best reason to remember that your DVD player has a fast forward button. Made on a budget somewhere near $ 1.99, "The Cavern" is obviously a fast-paced flash made to ride on the current group of scary caves - a lot of dark - claustrophobic cavers - unknown threat shots like "The Cave "and" The Descent "". A few years ago there was a series of films similar to those that used sea ships instead of caverns. Everyone had scary boats / submarines - a lot of darkness - claustrophobic adventurers - unknown threats ... the same old old man. "The Cavern" is really "The Blair Witch Project" only that this time we got lost underground and we didn't get lost on it. Throw a flashlight with defective batteries, a cow skull with fangs stuck on of it for a monster, and one of the most stupid climax "twist" never staged. Having said that, let me push you to listen to me, the little voice in your head. I'm your friend. I want you to have a happy life. far from this movie.
