Comparing the Twelve Oceans with the Oceans of 2001 Eleven, did anyone else notice all the things that remained the same? <br /> <br /> - All the stars are back for Twelve, and Zeta-Jones has been added; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same director; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same producers; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same set designer; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same musical director; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same movie editor. <br /> <br /> Has anyone noticed the things that changed once the "Oceans" franchise was established? <br /> <br /> - Twelve's budget was $ 25 million (30%) higher; <br /> <br /> - Eleven got great reviews, but Twelve has touched extensively; <br /> <br /> - Eleven earned $ 450 million but Twelve went down to $ 362 million; <br /> <br /> - The domestic box office for Dodici has fallen by 32%; <br /> <br /> - Soderbergh collaborated with another screenwriter. <br /> <br /> Films are a means of direction, of course. I almost forgot.
