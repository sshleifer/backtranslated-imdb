The first two Bring It On movies were both pretty good in their own way. The first one was quite serious, the second one was satirically successful - and the third opted for the usual funny low-level comedy that we always see in movies for mindless teenagers that Hollywood is coming out of the carpentry shop. The whole point in this film is that the cheerleaders are totally hollow heads that hardly know enough to carry on a common conversation, and this is the measure of the comedy of this film. Ha ha. Not. <br /> <br /> There is no bit of intelligence in this film, no theme, no subtext, nothing for anyone with a half brain to be entertained by (and sure enough, I couldn't sit through all this) . If you are the kind of person who is entertained by fart jokes, this movie is for you. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
