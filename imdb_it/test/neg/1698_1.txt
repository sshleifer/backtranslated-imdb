The most annoying thing about "Dies d'agost" (August Days) is not simply that of NIENTE CAPI in this film, but director Marc Recha has the courage to pretend that this film is a sort of homage to the Catalan leftist journalist Ramon Barnils. Unless mentioning Barnil's name a few times constitutes a "tribute", this fiction is a total fraud. You will learn practically nothing about Barnil in this film, nor about the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), nor about the special role of Catalunya in that war. You will also not learn the collective punishment inflicted on the heroic Catalan people for years after the victorious and vindictive Franco. The video of the Catalan countryside is very beautiful, of course, but "It dies 'Agost' does not have a large enough and varied collection of such scenes to qualify as a travel diary. The large number of still images, for example images not very illuminating of the ground of the forest, it is the clearest indication of the scarcity of ideas here.The aimless drift of the brothers Marc and David during their camping trip does not produce a compelling cinema.On the contrary, his strongest impression is that of a film made from and for middle-aged, spaced hippies, don't waste time. Instead, read a good book on the Spanish Civil War. (I recommend the "Revolution and counter-revolution in Spain" by Felix Morrow, which contains a compelling account of the 1937 Barcelona Uprising) . <br /> <br /> Barry Freed
