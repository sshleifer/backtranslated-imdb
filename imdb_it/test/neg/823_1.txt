Bean, Kevin & Perry, British TV creations that have made successful transitions on the BIG screen. Now it's up to Ali G and I'm afraid to say it's not one of them! <br /> Ali has always been obscene but funny with it. This film was extremely sick and not at all funny. Scenes involving bestiality, gay sex and pedophilia should not be portrayed for entertainment. <br /> <br /> Ali G In Da House is rubbish and deserves very little money. <br /> <br /> 1 out 10
