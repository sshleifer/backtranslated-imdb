If you liked Grinch's movie ... go see it again, because it wasn't the translation of a Seussian film. Mike Myers' Cat is probably the most annoying character of "grace" of the screen in recent times. His voice / accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with a terrible sound, which is the only laugh I heard at the theater. Even the boys didn't like these people, and now the children laugh at everything. Save your money and go see Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you are really looking for a family film on a fun vacation.
