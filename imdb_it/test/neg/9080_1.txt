This is one of the few films - perhaps the only one - that has really haunted me for years. It was the first time I saw people being tortured, so much so that blood flowed from their mouths to grit their teeth and scream, etc. He was brutal; the worst thing I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Dr. Clement Molloch, played by Joseph Mayer, is still one of the most evil characters I've ever seen in the film, and I've seen thousands of them. He was so sadistic that I would never watch this movie again, nor would I recommend it. Makes Hannibal Lecter look like Mr. Rogers. If seeing people tortured is not your idea of ​​fun, then stay away from this movie. I know there are a lot of sick people out there, many of them professional film critics, who probably enjoyed this sordid, sick story. It is a "B" movie, however, with a stupid dialogue and some wooden acting by Charles Bronson. This is not one of his best efforts. Even if so, here are so many hideous scenes that you wouldn't want to see. Trust me on this.
