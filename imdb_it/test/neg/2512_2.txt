This is a rather useless remake. Starting with the shots of the opening title of the original was a real mistake as it reminds the viewer of what was a great cooler of a period piece. The new version that follows is an exercise in redundancy. <br /> <br /> Brian Kerwin plays a "city boy" photographer who returns to an abandoned semi-abandoned town populated by a handful of underdeveloped cliché characters: the lollipop that sucks Daby-Doll Lolita, the ancient coot seeker, the lame vet and his Asian wife, etc ... <br /> <br /> The character of Kerwin witnesses the crash of "something" on a hill and shortly afterwards strange things start happening while pieces of strange blue rocks are scattered around. The temperature starts to rise, all the water in the area vanishes, people start acting strangely, things explode. The character of Kerwin enters and exits his car more often than is humanly possible in a movie. The film does not develop a sense of place, nor character development, nor humor, nor tension. All that made the original gruesome Cold War paranoia original has been abandoned. It only passes through its minimal circles and then ends up right. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not very special - the inside of the ship resembles pieces of transparent film wrapped around strings that were then hung in front of the camera to frame some of the most banal and clumsy threads never put on the screen. The script is repetitive - everyone says it all at least twice, Kerwin can say "get out of here" at least three times during the movie, twice in a scene. A lot of things are not explained at the end - why do aliens need all the heat and water, for example? - not that anyone who looked would be imported; if the directors don't care why should we? <br /> <br /> Acting is adequate - better than the script, which sometimes has an impromptu quality under rehearsal, it deserves. Although actors often seem to want to do everything as soon as possible - a notable example of this is when Elizabeth Peña records the brief, token moment of "desperate hands frustrated to deal with the gesture" before following the sulking son Stevie out for watching him make a gesture of "sullen teenager breaking something from a table". <br /> <br /> Continuity errors include the sticker (GB) on the back of the Kerwin jeep that appears and disappears, a double action of the gas in the exploding machine, a city-person who is in two places at the same time - once in The POV of Alien Stevie it was shot immediately afterwards in a reaction scene, Elizabeth Peña who seems to have closed the car door twice ... you can say I was taken to prison, right? The film makes the biggest mistake. That's boring.
