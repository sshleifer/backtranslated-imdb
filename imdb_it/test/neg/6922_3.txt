Seeing that this has had a theatrical release anywhere in the world, it only serves as a reminder that it was the careers of those talented ladies Denise Richards and Milla Jovovich. It is also a particular type of film to be grated, of those who think they are intelligent, funny and original while being poor in every aspect. The full blame can go to Brian Burns, who wrote and directed this potboiler. His script takes a fairly original situation and doesn't go anywhere exactly. The situations develop completely without any inner logic, in addition to that of a desperate screenwriter. The characters are thinner than cardboard cutouts, they behave stupidly and without real motivation. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the inclusion of Mrs. Richards. We do not believe that his relationship with the character of David Krumholtz for a minute and the way it is brought back into play after the one-hour vote is particularly painful. Why would anyone fall in love with a self-centered person, obsessed with herself, arrogant like this in the first place, much less a second time? Especially after having supposedly found his ... true ... true love? And if any of these things is not enough to completely sink this film, that the central couple is. The mating of Krumholtz and Jovovich is only slightly more credible or developed than that of Richards, but it serves no purpose. There is no chemistry, no spark, nothing we can freely accept as a credible couple. Worse still, these two central characters are particularly annoying and irritating, doing annoying and irritating things that the viewer doesn't care about at all. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very poor result. Even fans of community fanatics might want to broadcast them, as there are dozens of movies made with more skill or more charm.
