If you have never read the book and you never intend to read it in the future, go ahead and watch the movie (6/10). It's a beautiful fantasy film with well done CGI, beautiful acting, a beautiful environment and a fantasy story above average. <br /> <br /> If you read the book like me about 10 times or more and really love it, don't expect too much (or better: don't expect anything). The story is completely different from the original book. This could explain that the film was voted 1/10 by people around 40 or more (like me) and much better by people who most likely have never read the book before and therefore expect nothing. <br /> <br /> Most of the differences between film and book are not really necessary and change the setting (in my opinion much worse): <br /> <br /> - The magic in the book works with rituals for classic magical effects. (Changing time, creating illusions, turning into animals, ...) In the film, magic is more like "jedi-school for the middle age" (TM) (wooden sticks instead of lightsabers). That the devil looks like the emperor palpatine (after part III) does not really make him better. <br /> <br /> - The mill in the book is not completely cut off from the world as in the film. In the book the story is set near Dresden, which Krabat visits once with his master and he also visits some nearby villages for the holidays. (This part may have been changed to cut costs.) I also don't understand why the mill is on the hill in the film while the nearby cemetery is located in the high mountains. <br /> <br /> - The whole district is the average run of the medieval fantasy style mill. A lot of mud everywhere, dirty faces, not a tidy kitchen, only very rough houses. The book has never suggested such an environment. <br /> <br /> - In the book the master tries to make Krabat his successor, but Krabat refuses. Krabat is halfway between admiration, distance and silent rejection. In the film Krabat always rejects the teacher openly as a stubborn schoolboy. <br /> <br /> - The film is set in 1647 instead of around 1720. This makes it impossible for the master to tell some stories of his youth probably around 170x. OK, the stories are still missing in the movie. <br /> <br /> Furthermore some explanations given in the book would have been useful and would not cost so many minutes: <br /> <br /> - In the book all the work done during the day is effortless and work at night it's like a normal job. This explanation is missing in the film. Sometimes kids are sweating and sometimes they're happy. <br /> <br /> - The book explains why only some "Gesellen" try to confront the master: if the teacher dies for trivial reasons, the "Gesellen" are And keep their magical powers. If the master dies during the fight, everyone will lose their power forever.
