I can start by saying that I'm a fan of bad movies. And this is a really bad movie. There are 100 passengers on the front, 3000 snakes, but I think it is more accurate to say 12 passengers and about 20 snakes. <br /> <br /> Snakes don't do anything particularly interesting, the whole movie in fact blunders with little success. Even if occasionally there is a big shot of pulsating arms and green goo puke (bad movies must have a real green goo?). <br /> <br /> But then the finale arrives and literally slaps you. You sit in hysteria. and for this, this film gets a boost up to 2 *. <br /> <br /> There are some movies in the world that you would like to show to your friends, just so you can watch the reaction when a certain event happens in them. <br /> <br /> For example The arrival of "Big Man" in R Kelly's "trapped in the closet" "The LINE" in "Shark Attack 3" (you'll know when you hear it) The arrival of the mother shark in 'Shark Attack 3' Almost all the scenes of 'troll 2' The ending of 'Dracula 3000' (only for total disbelief and confusion) and the end of this film is proudly found in this category. It is worth sitting just for that. So, get drunk, busted, whatever your poison is and watch this movie with some friends. <br /> <br /> Quite simply, if you like bad movies, take this, but don't confuse it with 'Snakes on a plane' ... no relationship. <br /> <br /> And don't pay more than five dollars for this ....
