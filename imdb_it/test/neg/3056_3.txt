It is difficult to decide if this film suffers from disgusting dialogues or if it is made to look like shitty actors. In any case, he suffers from screenplays that are at best mediocre. <br /> <br /> Although it was made in the late 1980s, the first part of the film plays like a teenage comedy from the 1960s (apart from the absence of true humor), especially the part of the "good girl", which is as annoying as a figure of Doris Day as one might hope / fear, including the slightly plaintive opposition to anything "funny" that her friends want to do. The net effect is that after a while you start to hope that she bites him so you don't have to listen to his voice anymore. <br /> <br /> A few bad words and free nudity, as well as some 80s style dresses is your only indication that this film was made in the 80s. Oh, and also quite passable music. <br /> <br /> Storywise, it's pretty formidable. A group of horny kids (apart, of course, those of the "beautiful girl") decide to celebrate Halloween night by throwing a party in a haunted house. Fornication and fornication follow, along with a reckless "spirit session" that starts the demonic revelry of possession that is the subject of the film. After this, the only suspense part will try to guess which order the characters will expire. You are sure not to worry if they do or not. Actors are so bad that becoming demons / zombies / supper actually improves their performance in some way, and the ridiculously clich√© dialogues are so annoying that you squirm in your place. <br /> <br /> Gorewise, this film is not special at all, unless you think that cheese is some kind of "special". For example, the demon head that appears occasionally is so fake that you wonder if it's a five-year trick. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that there is nothing funny in the film. Part of the music isn't bad, and the first of our insipid Scooby band to be possessed performs a wonderful and really sexy dance routine at some point, before it gets bad. <br /> <br /> Also, and I don't know why, towards the end of the film, I managed to get a little involved. The suspense that was missing in most of the film made an appearance late, and I started squirming because of discomfort instead of annoyance. What a horror movie should do. <br /> <br /> Concequently, I can't bring myself to give this film a low rating, since from some inexplicable miracle (I don't rule out being possessed by demons) I was actually a little scared. <br /> <br /> I don't pay money to see it, though. It's not worth your time, just cash. Watch it on YouTube while it's there.
