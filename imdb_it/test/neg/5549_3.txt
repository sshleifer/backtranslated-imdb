The low-budget schlockmeister Herschell Gordon Lewis reaches a new low (also for him) with "The Gore Gore Girls", a "movie" (snicker) that owns all its technical brands: badly recorded sound, poor lighting and OTT blood. This would be tolerable, even a little fascinating, if the film had at least one interesting plot ("Blood Festival", in all its ridiculous glory, is a good example), but "Girls" is a total nap. Abraham Gentry (Frank Kress), a totally unbearable private investigator, is recruited by a journalist to find out who killed assassins out of shape (you will stop worrying about who is the culprit long before these two envelop the case). As before, the attraction is not the plot, but the creative methods of bleeding (including the girl of a girl who is conceptualizing herself with a wooden club) and the occasional flashes of the skin that then risk ... but this does not it is sufficient to elevate the material over the bore
