First of all let me say, if you haven't enjoyed a Van Damme movie since the days of blood, you probably won't like this movie. Most of these films may not have the best storylines or the best actors, but I like this type of film for what it is. This film is much better than any other film that the other action guys (Segal and Dolph) have thought of publishing in recent years. Van Damme is good at the film, the film only deserves to be seen by Van Damme fans. It's not as good as Wake of Death (which I highly recommend to everyone who loves Van Damme) or to hell but, in my opinion, it's worth watching. It has the same kind of feeling as Nowhere to Run. Good fun things!
