in general, I don't make negative comments here. But since this is a piece of the festival, I don't want you wasting your time when you could see something else that might not play again. <br /> <br /> I thought the actors were pretty mean. For example, they didn't play each other, on the contrary, they waited to RECITE their lines which were rather poor to begin with. The dialogue seemed really forced. Norman or whatever his name has tried, or so it would seem, to be witty and biting in the lines he has chosen, but he has just fallen very short. <br /> <br /> After the words he asked if anyone saw the ending coming and some people were all "yes", and he called them all, but liars. Look, there were so many clues, the biggest of which was a briefcase full of money for a $ 500 hour bitch. I mean John gave her at least 20g of ... tells his story. Now no, you didn't see exactly what would have happened, but when the turning point actually occurred, I didn't care for first. I was just happy to get out of there. I asked him which draft he shot and he said 8.1, maybe next time he will wait to shoot up to 15.3 because this took a lot of work. <br /> <br /> But he seemed like a pretty nice guy, he's doing his movies, he'll probably get better and I hope he does it, not clumsily, I mean, I wish him luck. Just remember, this is just my opinion.
