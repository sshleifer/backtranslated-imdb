Until about 1970, Lucille Ball was a great comedian. He was such a perfect clown that I just wish more people had seen her with Bob Hope in "The Facts of Life" because she too could do the dead dry. as well as slapstick .. <br /> <br /> Yes, Lucille Ball was wonderful. . . up to "Mame". <br /> <br /> Trying to see Lucille Ball in "Mame" is physically impossible because there is so much Vaseline on the already filtered lenses that you would need Windex to see Lucille Ball in some scenes. So even if you see Lucille Ball in "Mame", you can't really see Lucille Ball in "Mame". Which is a blessing. <br /> <br /> This is the best thing I can say about "Mame", the film in the musical of the comedy movie (it could go on, but it started with a perfectly fun book called "Auntie Mame") . Giving this a bad blow is like hitting a sponge. So it doesn't matter if the music is croaking rather than sung. Most of the songs weren't much, though. There is no difference in the first three. "It's today", "Open a new window" and "We Need a Little Christmas" are all the same song. Celene Dion should make an album with them, they are so big and boring. The killer ballad "If you walked in my life today" needs a safe and secure voice (Edyie Gorme won a Grammy for doing it in 1967) that poor Lucille Ball didn't have when she shot this movie. (True, Elaine Stritch can't even put a melody in a bucket, but at least Stritch can put up a song.) <br /> <br /> If you still feel that your life won't be complete unless you watch the musical of the movie "Mame", note how we are dancing, but every time Lucy / Mame starts to do something beyond a paralyzed mix, the camera turns off, returning to the right when the number is finished and the star rests with the dancers. Again, it's just as good. Jane Connell was able to resume the role of the pathetic Agnes Gooch after Lucille Ball shot Madeline Kahn to make sure that the comic originality would not undermine the star. Connell is a theatrical actor who, like Carol Channing and Ethyl Merman, fails to downgrade his film performance, so he joins Lucille Ball to be embarrassing, albeit for different reasons. <br /> <br /> The sumptuous dresses are by Theadora Van Runkle (Van Wrinkle?) and provide the missing color to all but one of the cast. <br /> <br /> Bea Arthur as an actress Vera Charles, Mame's best friend, ignores everyone and does her funny thing. If only she had been in multiple scenes. She's too old for her role, but at least she didn't lose it.
