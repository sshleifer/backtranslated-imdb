Bugsy Siegel was 31 when he came out on the west coast. In addition to his dreams about Las Vegas, he played with the idea of ​​acting. He was a good-looking boy and about 7 years younger than his friend George Raft, so it wasn't such a crazy idea. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty was 54 when he made this film and despite his hair dye, he is too old for this part. Beatty was a mixture; Bugsy should have been played by someone like Alec Baldwin. Bugsy was a tough guy feared by his contemporaries; Beatty does not irritate the threat. <br /> <br /> This was a vanity project for Beatty, who did not come to terms with the fact that he is no longer a leading man. <br /> <br /> The other big annoying nuisance is Mantegna like George Raft. The raft had a distinct voice and mannerism, none of which even Mantegna tries to match. You never believed that Mantegna came from the streets. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty and Robert Redford have both pretended to be younger for years with the massive use of hair dye, and now it will be a shock to suddenly turn gray and play parts of characters.
