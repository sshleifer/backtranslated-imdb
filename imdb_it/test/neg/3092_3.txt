This film should have been much better than it was. Christopher Eccleston is an excellent actor, but even he can't save this story of a young woman in search of the truth about her sister's death. Spoiler warning: in fact the truth is that the older sister (played by Diaz) is just a spoiled, selfish and superficial girl who took too many drugs. Not much of a turnaround and not interesting. The film is also overladen with too many flashbacks and voice over and lacks dramatic rhythm. All in all, it is absolutely not to be missed - not to be recommended.
