I saw this movie and never got interested in this movie. I wouldn't think of going to Paris because I don't like this country and its national capital. I don't like learning French anyway because I don't understand their language. Why should I go to France when I prefer to go to Germany or the United Kingdom? Germany and the United Kingdom are the nations that tolerate. Apparently the Olsen Twins don't understand the French language like me. So I won't bother the trip to France, no matter what. I could also stay in the UK and meet single women and play video games if there is a video game. That's all.
