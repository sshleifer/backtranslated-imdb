Danny is beyond sorry. <br /> <br /> Continue to make the same mistakes and it is no longer interesting to watch. At first I could try for myself, like myself, an addict. At first my heart turned to him, and somewhere along the line he went over the line. It's almost as if he is continuing this behavior to keep the show going, and at the same time he is seriously risking his life, and the well-being of his family, especially his children. It is difficult even to have pity on the poor boy. I think he needs to watch this show, maybe then he might have a chance to save this marriage. I can't understand how Gretchen is with him, and I keep wondering how much it's just for the show, and how much love is. Danny, take a life - a new one that is! ... and don't get me started with Dr. Gary. What is it with him and his face? His skin seems to be stretched to the maximum. Furthermore, appearance does not mean anything, yet it does not seem particularly impartial. I think he continues to do it for his own money and often not in the best interest of Gretchen or Danny. These people are few confused and each reminds me of a dog chasing its tail. sad, very sad. Come and assemble together.
