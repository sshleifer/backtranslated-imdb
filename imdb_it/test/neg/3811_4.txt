I heard about this movie for the first time at the 2007 Chicago "Flashback Weekend" for "Nightmare on Elm Street". Robert Englund was really talking about the film and was very good at his part of "Hatchet". The same can be said for Tony Todd. Knowing that this is a low budget director / screenwriter who offers as much as the big budget and also the fantastic "Holloween" (2007) remake / re-imagination. <br /> <br /> Technically it isn't up to a couple of seats. The alligator attack seen was too dark. When it happened, the dark head of the alligator against the swamp that clung to the black trousers became almost invisible. The mood music in the swamp scenes was too loud in volume and canned, like a bad sitcom. And just like "Holloween" (2007) someone is smart enough to have a gun, but obviously shooting the killer is just a pause button for the killer. The ending, well, as soon as I saw where it went I knew what would have happened, not very original. <br /> <br /> The highlights of the film are the characters and their interactions. Unlike "Holloween" (2007) we had the opportunity to meet people and worry about what happened to them. Ben (Joel Moore, who is also the protagonist of "Spiral"), the protagonist of the pout and Marcus ("Not Another Teen Movie") as the best friend and funny man to cheer on during the film. Shapiro (Joel Murry "Dharma & Greg"), Jenna (Joleigh Fioreavanti) and Misty (Mercedes McNab of the films "Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Series", "Angel: The Series" and "The Addams Family") give a twisted reason for topless women. Mr. and Mrs. Permatteo interpreted by the television regulars (Richard Riehle "Grounded for Life", Patrika Darbo "Step by Step") as the older couple you know has no chance, even the tourist guide Shawn (Parry Shen) is a carved character. I hope to see more from all the protagonists of this film, but I think it will sound better on home video than at the theater, I'm sorry.
