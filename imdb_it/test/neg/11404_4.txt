Since 2002 Dutch cinema has finally improved again. This film is still a part and a school example of the ugly period of Dutch cinema. <br /> <br /> The story is unnecessarily told in flashback style. All the "present" sequences set in France are completely redundant and add nothing to history, emotions or power. For some reason, European filmmakers often find it necessary to tell the story not in chronological order. I never understood why, or what the attraction is. <br /> <br /> Autobiography is not exactly the greatest. It is not always clear if the film is trying to go and what it is trying to say. The story of an inexperienced young man in love with a young savage girl, who later turns out to be quite psychotic, might seem pretty good on paper and also shows some parallels with Paul Verhoeven's "Turks fruit", to which this film has often been compared to before and at the time of its release. However, the end result is anything but comparable. The story fails to capture the right emotions, which is also due to the actors' performances without fantasy. The way the story is told makes the film still far from interesting or compelling. I lost interest in this film about 40 minutes through the film. <br /> <br /> At the time this film was shot, both Antonie Kamerling and Angela Schijf promised rising stars with great potential and ambitions, but both their careers are practically drained by now. Angela Schijf seems to give her family more attention than her career (obviously not bad), while Antonie Kamerling tried to start a career in Hollywood. He never went beyond the fact that he played some small part in 2 flops of Renny Harlin. To be honest, I'm not surprised. It is not that he is a bad actor and he certainly has the right appearance, but his English is not good enough, to put it simply. Just listen to him as he speaks English at the beginning of this film and you'll understand what I mean. I'm not really bad actors, but for some reason it's not shown in this movie. It is probably also due to poor dialogue. I've always liked Beau van Erven Dorens. He has been criticized a lot but his acting seems very natural. He always keeps the characters close to who he is. <br /> <br /> It is definitely not one of the worst films ever made, but it is not exactly what I would recommend. The ugly and uninteresting storytelling makes this bad movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
