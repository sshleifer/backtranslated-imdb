From the title, from the tagline, from the summary of the plot on the DVD etc ..., I was expecting something at least a little epic, with the historical narrative and the romanticism that combined to excite you; this is what they did in Last of the Mohicans, for example, and I think they did a great job. Maybe I had too high standards for this movie and I didn't give it a good chance. But the scenario was barely OK (how could they not come up with something more beautiful when they have similar landscapes to work with?), The two lovers had no chemistry whatsoever, and the plot was so predictable that it seemed to have been written in 5 minutes from a twelve year old - and not very imaginative. Nouvelle-France is a love story set in an historical era full of events. But the story of Nouvelle-France is certainly not a marginal note, and the love story is trivial and fails dramatically to make the viewer attentive to the fate of lovers. Surprisingly, the only positive parts of the film derive from something completely unexpected and unpublished: the relationship between Marie-Loup, the heroine and her children (a natural one, one adopted). If only they had focused on his family and forgotten the love story, it would have been a much better film. The parents of Marie-Loup should have had more time for the screen and the development of the character, the current policy in Britain should have been more than a three-minute scene with almost no connection to the rest, the bad thing should have to be more developed or removed from the script completely (why hire actors like Vincent Perez, Tim Roth or Jason Isaacs to use them so badly?) Overall bad job.
