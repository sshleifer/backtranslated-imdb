Conrad Radzoff (Ferdy Mayne), a cult icon of the hamsmith, dies as a result of a heart disorder (not before he fired an ungrateful assistant and a television commercial director, both of whom missed him with insulting rains). His body is removed from his mausoleum by some film students (who wish to "invite him to dinner" ... they are big fans). What these guys (including a young Jeffrey Combs) don't expect is that Radzoff will be resurrected from a means to devastate those who removed him from his resting place. <br /> <br /> The list of violent acts includes Radzoff, who takes a boy's tongue out, setting a woman on fire, raising a coffin that crushes a woman's face, beheading a man and having another boy alive and cremated in a coffin. A really strange soundtrack and an annoying fog envelop the macabre activities of Radzoff. <br /> <br /> Troma's hokum cunning is limited by a very low budget and slow pace. The film seems much longer than it is. The film is not so bloody and we can hardly see much violence because the film is often too damn dark. Sometimes, Radzoff is a threatening presence, but other times he seems really silly.
