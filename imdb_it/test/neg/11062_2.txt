A virtual copy of The Cave saved for fewer budget effects and a slightly different storyline. I knew that the film was going to ruin when I saw the false flikering lights of the bonfire clearly reflected in a close-up of the face of one of the actors. The conflicts between characters and subplots seemed to serve no purpose and added nothing to the film, except for a few moments of silence. Acting was not as bad as the typical B series film, and there was a certain credibility in their fear, but as professional speleologists, they seem to be too psychologically unstable for the chosen profession. Overall, it's not worth wasting $ 4.50 for rent.
