I was on a mission to watch Uwe Boll's movies to see if they were as bad as this. The first one I saw, BloodRayne, was not a complete loss. I liked it more than most people, and actually I voted like a 4 out of 10. The next one was the first House of the Dead movie. Now that was horribly bad. I could bear to observe about ten minutes and a little fast forwarding, and that's it. I could see where he was going and I didn't need to see others to evaluate him only 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> But I also had access to the sequel (which however is not Uwe Boll's, but, mysteriously, written by the same guys who wrote the first one incompetently), and since he got a higher rating than IMDb than the original one, I thought I'd give him a chance. And actually I was able to see everything. It began with some funny references and interesting lines (like the way the president received orders from the vice president!), And as far as acting is concerned, light years are better than the first. Here we have some beautiful muchachas like the ultra-hot Emmanuelle Vaugier, whose coldness is in league with Carrie-Anne Moss, Claudia Black and Evangeline Lilly. Friend, I hope that a Matrix-style film will sometimes come to you. And the always delicious and super aerobicized Victoria Pratt. I love athletic women. And there was also Nadine Velazquez (Catalina in "My Name Is Earl"), who performed quite well. <br /> <br /> The plot was not much, and the action was not great, and the end was a disappointment, as they were not successful in their mission. Oh well, at least the two main survivors. Guess even a small victory. <br /> <br /> Great cast, but a rather bad film. Actors make it watchable, but there is no real substance there. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
