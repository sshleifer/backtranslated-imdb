What can you say about a movie that makes two hours seem like three weeks? The hero starts in ninjaville, in Japan, goes through an identity crisis (saving a shinobi), travels to America (saving a slave named Sam) engages in a wild west action (saving a native French / Japanese American named Julie), hunts for pirate gold, and then returns to Japan to fight a war. The film obviously has no idea where it can go at any time; I think the director modeled every scene after the last movie he saw. If you watch this movie, I suggest you rent the subtitles so that you and your peers can openly discuss how stupid the movie is without talking about the movie, potentially losing another stupid twist. <br /> <br /> Film the director was watching during the making of this movie: An American Tail, Fievel Goes West, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, The Goonies, Ninja Turtles, Kung Fu, Vampire Hunter D, The Ten Commandments . <br /> <br /> Notes of Interest - Most of the fear that inspires the all-time line. About 90 minutes (or 19 days) in the film, the main character has just beaten a bad American, and just as we head towards the VCR to end the pain, the hero proclaims "Let's go back to Japan" and the agony continues for another week.
