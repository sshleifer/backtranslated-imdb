This could be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I don't normally watch movies like this, but I was forced to see it at school. What a torment! <br /> <br /> The story is average and boring as it may be: boy meets a girl on the Spanish coast, boy and girl fall in love, but love between the two seems impossible and everyone and everything is against their love . At the end of the film, the film becomes a sort of strange kung-fu movie where the boys in white fight the boys in black. Terrible! <br /> <br /> The action is so bad that it makes you laugh. The dances in the movie that I think should be fantastic are so simple and ridiculous that even I can do them! And Georgina Verbaan is probably the most irritating person I've ever seen on the screen. <br /> <br /> Johan Nijenhuis is on his way to becoming Dutchman Ed Wood. His films are so ugly that they make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Victor LÃ¶w still offers a surprisingly good performance and Daan Schuurmans also plays well. <br /> <br /> So, please, for your own good t watch this movie. However, if you like to watch soaps, this could be really worth your time. <br /> <br /> Yuk! <br /> <br /> 2/10
