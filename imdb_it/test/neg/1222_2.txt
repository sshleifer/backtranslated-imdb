It would be a shame if Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duval saw this film as they will probably associate it in the years to come. "Oh yes", the audience will say "Comanche Moon", this is the mini series about Texas Rangers and Comanche Indians with Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duval. He was a real stinker and probably the worst movie ever. I think it was a comedy but not a very funny comedy, I really don't understand why they agreed to be part of it. "It would be such injustice as the original" Lonesome Dove "was a true classic western and this turkey is a real bomb and Jones and Duval will be remembered for this.
