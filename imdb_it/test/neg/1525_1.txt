Does anyone bother to check where this type of mud comes from before blabbering over its alleged revelations? Ask yourself a question: is my skull an open bucket that allows anyone to download their propaganda? Do yourself a favor and take a look at the bombardment mentality of pathtofreedom.com before wasting time with this masseur. <br /> <br /> These types of fruitcake from Urban Earth / Berkeley People's Republic, which openly despise a way of life just because it does not match theirs must believe that their case fails miserably on facts and objectivity. Otherwise why resort to voluntary distortions and blatant unilateralism? Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Don't be a sap. Take two seconds and cast a skeptical look before falling for yet another "end of the world" hysteria from those "take a village" types with a political agenda that is probably also on your left. Me. Moore (rather his unconscious followers) really opened the door with this kind of unilateral political junk passed as a documentary * cough *. But apparently they understand the feeling of an always naive public: "If it is on a cinema screen, it must be true". <br /> <br /> God gave you a brain: behave as if you knew what you should do with it ...
