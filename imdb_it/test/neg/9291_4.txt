Barricade finds Alice Faye without songs as a refugee trying to escape from China and without a passport. She's in a lot of trouble, I'm not going to say exactly, and even American extraterritoriality won't help her. <br /> <br /> I say this because it is one of the resentments that the Chinese, including the bandits who attack the American mission in this story set in the Chinese interior, was that particular institution in which American citizens who had committed crimes were tried by American courts established by our consulates. We were far from the only country that did it anyway. <br /> <br /> However, the story opens with her on a train to Shanghai trying to use a Russian hockey accent. The accent intrigues Warner Baxter which is rather plastered. <br /> <br /> The bandits, however, interrupt the journey and the two of them seek refuge in the American consulate presided by Charles Winninger. It's the best in the film and I just wish a better story was given because I liked his character. He is a widower and a proud member of the consular service, appointed in 1900 by William McKinley. He requested a transfer ten years later and this was the last one from which he was heard. As rightly said Secretary of State Jonathan Hale, he is the real forgotten man. <br /> <br /> Baxter does everything well in a role that someone like Clark Gable would do in his sleep at MGM. The heroisms would have become more natural for Gable than for Baxter as the mission is barricaded and defended against bandits. <br /> <br /> Alice Faye had a number to sing. Because Alice's song has been cut, only God and Zanuck know it. One thing I'm still trying to understand is when the mission's inhabitants take refuge in the cellar with a trap door, who was left upstairs to pull the carpet over the cellar door? <br /> <br /> Barricade has the potential to be much better than it used to be. But the rough assembly and the loss of confidence in the project have made the realization of an unfinished project. Watching Barricade is like eating a poorly cooked meal.
