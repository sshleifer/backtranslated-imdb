Ugghhh !!! This is exactly the kind of Pre-Code film that could mistakenly convince the viewer that the films of this period are bad - and they are NOT - it's just that this particular film is horrible. Horrid because while the film tries very hard to be "fashionable" and "adult", it's also so old-fashioned, boring and boring that I've been torn between laughing at the movie or just falling asleep !! This is a unique combination, to say the least. <br /> <br /> So why exactly did I hate it so much? Well, the film is incredibly unkempt but has no style and the film is bound to shock but lacks subtlety and requires too many ridiculous curves to be credible. The film begins with a clich√©: a prostitute with a heart of gold. Dorothy Mackaill is a prostitute and seems to accidentally kill a man! Shortly after making his escape, he meets an old boyfriend who insists on marrying her (he doesn't realize his profession). Seeing the innate goodness of this man, he decides to change his life and stop living the wild life. It is difficult when hiding on an imaginary island in the Caribbean. Here, alone and awaiting the return of his man, there is nothing to do and the place is infested with super-cuckold and totally unpleasant men. In reality this part of the film is so boring, that the public might have difficulty staying focused. The men on the island are so inflamed by the presence of Mackaill that they seem perpetually about to rape her - only to be rejected because she is no longer that kind of girl. Frankly, I got very tired of all these salacious scenes - there's simply too much to roll your eyes and wag your tail to make it look like it's not a bad movie. And watching all those ugly horn dogs was just annoying and stupid. <br /> <br /> But wait, ... it gets much worse. The man that FATHER killed appears on this small island (what are the odds?!) And tries to rape her as well. However, he must not be dissuaded and ends up shooting to save his new virtue. While the jury on the island is about to absolve her, she runs back to court and mind - saying that she intended to kill the man and is premeditated (?) Because even if she is acquitted, she knows that the wicked jailer will have his with her when she is sent in prison for a charge of possession of weapons. Since the jailer himself gave her the gun to set her up, her run to court and saying that he was guilty seemed really, really stupid. Why didn't he just tell them the twisted plan of the jailer ?! Presumably he did it to preserve his virtue but to admit to killing someone so people will think you're a virgin ?! So, to avoid a brief sentence to prison (and, again, the threat of rape), he does not consider the court trying to force her into a situation of sexual compromise (the jailer promised to rape her when she is locked up). And, just before being taken to the gallows (to avoid rape), the boyfriend shows up in time for her to send him out and the credits come out. <br /> <br /> Impossible situation and abundant coincidences- -in such frequent presence that the film is simply stupid Combining this with all the sexual allusions, this makes a bad and dirty mess of a film that will appeal only to the most ardent fans Pre-Code films. All the others, be careful, this is very sticky and silly from start to finish!
