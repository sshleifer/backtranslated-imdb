This movie is so bad that I've already spent a lot of time talking about it. So bad ... really ... BAD ... and I'm not even that critical ... .. I'm almost ashamed to admit to having seen him ... Sandra's few minutes show you how far she really is done ... I mean that anything beside this is really Oscar worthy of her ... I suppose the only way for her to look at him is that there is no way, but after this ... I suppose he had to start somewhere ... but really ... so bad ... ... terrible really ... bad is a word too good for this s ** t .... but I don't want to become bad now ... but really how can you not after having wasted 90 minutes ... 90 minutes of my life that I will never come back ... 90 minutes I could have gone on to do something better ... like sitting on my ass and staring into space ... it would have been better to pass the time ... (walks away shaking his head)
