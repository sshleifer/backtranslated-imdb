There are spoilers, but believe me, I'm doing you a favor. <br /> <br /> My friends and I like to watch bad movies every now and then. Inspired by the Mystery Science Theater and our talent for pranks on the spot; Let's start looking for films worth watching, which in reality ... are not worth looking at. However the trouble comes to heaven when these films can only be found if you buy them. And I firmly believe that I don't give a penny to a group of senseless talents. So, as another reviewer said, movies like this are a reason why downloading free movies should be legalized. I prefer the idea of; instead of the right to the VIDEO you have the right to INTERNET. In this way the ass-bags that have made this parody will never have a profit. Which unfortunately you know they do. They hire a group of actors who can't act, special effects from a school classroom, rubber snakes that can be obtained at the dollar shop, constant vomit of green jell-o, and the two main characters that seem to go from being on the border skipping the Mexicans who speak only Spanish, to the Arabs to be 100% fluent in English, casual nudity, a boy shot like 10 times, one of whom is at the side of the head and living and the most delayed ending in the history of the film, book, drawings of caves and bully magazine. The fact that I actually predicted that the stinking snake girl would transform TRANSFORM into a snake halfway terrifies me ... <br /> <br /> However, the movie is nice to tease, but you have to make sure that there are at least 4 of you and that you are spitting out jokes in rapid sequence, because if there is also a second viewing of this movie in which you are not laughing out loud, you will feel physically ill. I'm not kidding. My friends and I were eating chicken wings and now I can't even look at it like that without being reminded of this piece of Sh! T. <br /> <br /> This movie is one above Alien vs. Hunter who is by far the second worst film ever made. And I've seen a lot of bad movies. Incidentally, it is the same production company as this film and that bald guy is in both. I thought you'd like to know that little fun fact. -100 outside 0f 10.
