Othello is set to burn the eyes of the spectators of this film. The bad description of Shakespeare's characters and the terrible interpretation of the love that Desi and John had made, made this film the horrible dirt it is. By far, Othello, directed by Jeffery Saks, is beyond mediocre and atrocious. <br /> <br /> The film Othello is a pitiful drama about the love between John and Desi. Their mutual loyalty will be tested by the man's friend. In the opening scene of the film, it is clearly demonstrated that the love between John and Desdemona is inseparable beyond imagination. Moments later, Ben Jago, John's friend appears on the screen frightening the spectators and immediately showing them how much he is a liar and a power-hungry person. <br /> <br /> By far, this film was far more horrific than the Shakespeare novel itself. Having said that, it has a tiny amount of good parts. For example, the love that was shown between John and Desi was very well represented and it seemed that the couple was so inseparable; just as was explained in the book. Although the love between them was shown exceptionally well, it still did not show the jealousy that Othello had between Cass and Desi as he should have. <br /> <br /> Love, jealousy, deceit, this film is based on all three main topics of Shakespeare's novel. The novel, however, really explains how all this went much better than the film could have done. For example, the conclusion of this story ends up much more differently in the book than in the film. Many other details are also included in the novel. This is why this film is such a disappointment, believe me, those who have read it will find it equally disappointing. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film was by far the most horrible representation of a novel that has ever been published by humanity. Avoiding seeing this film, viewers not only save their lives for an hour, but they also save a pair of eyes with Ben Jago's disgusting face looking out.
