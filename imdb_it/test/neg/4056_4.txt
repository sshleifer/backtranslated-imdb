There is nothing wrong with softcore, but this is quite clinical - a lot of nudity but it's all fake (obviously it's always fake - it's a movie but you know what I mean). There is no sexuality or eroticism, it is all casual nudity and scarce acting of "lust" and sex between them. <br /> <br /> Part of it is obviously your personal preference. These women clearly have some body problems with their piercings, tattoos and silicon - not to mention the overly plastic and leathery one, so if this is your point of view - fantastic, you can see everything here. <br /> <br /> I don I think anyone's expectations are very high when watching a film title like this, but for many people it would be like watching cyborg fembots ... they look almost real but it's really more disturbing.
