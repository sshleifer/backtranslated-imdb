this movie is the worst EVER !!! sorry but this was a total waste of good hours. quasi-psychology and b-actors make a baaaad horror film. you can say that if you like bad movies you'll love this. and the "hot chick" wasn't that hot. there is absolutely no climax for the film, and the worst part is the final song. something home-made with these words "is in very bad condition the world is a disaster when the heads fall of bodies and girls do not remain dressed, the cops are incapable, they eat donuts in their car, the newspaper the next morning: body without head, topless bar. "Jesus! sorry guys, but the milk went wrong with this.
