I was lucky enough to grow up surfing in San Diego (not the biggest waves in the world but it was a childhood of hell, I'll tell you) and I've seen MANY of the so-called surfer films in my life. After seeing NORTH SHORE for the first time right now, all I can say is THANKS TO GOD. I never saw him as a child. If I had seen it and thought mistakenly that it was a realistic representation of the surf scene, I would have sold my board and totally entered, I don't know, accounting or something. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this film has a lot in common with real surfing, as TOP GUN has a real military life. The acting is terrible, the music is worse, the cinematography is uncertain at best and OH MY GOD what did Laird Hanilton think ?! WOW !!! DO NOT SEE THIS FILM !!! SUCK !!! If you want a real surf-surf, see GUIDING THE GIANTS. Hell, look at SURF'S UP instead of this. Seriously. It sucks. It sucks It really REBACTS badly. Brah. ;) <br /> <br /> PS: had to change my summery from "WTF?!" to wtf because, apparently, we should whisper on this site. NO YELLING !!! (Shhhhhh!); D
