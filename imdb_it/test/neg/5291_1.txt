If there were justice in the film universe, director Lewis Schoenbrun would never again be able to set foot on a film set. It would seem inconceivable that anyone who has spent two whole decades in an editing room, where LS started his film career, can be so completely devoid of any sense of rhythm or dramatic staging, but this film is overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Bad as it is, it's so fascinating. From the opening scene, in which a nurse wears a costume suitable only for a porn movie or a skit in a Mexican variety show, the viewer is forced to see how low he can go. The answer is not far away, as in the next scene we move into a funeral home, where the next stunning fashion statement comes in a sexy black dress on the shoulders worn by one of the mourners. <br /> <br /> Aggressively inappropriate costumes are not the only flaw in the film. Dialogue is a pleasure for connoisseurs of bad writing. "Turn my tears into wine", is a champion gem. The actor deserves an Oscar for delivering the one with a straight face. <br /> <br /> The director reinforces every cheeseball scene with what is perhaps the most schmaltzed soundtrack ever recorded, which goes from awkward maudlin in the dialogue scenes to cheesy groovebox wannabe rocknroll in transition scenes. <br /> <br /> The script introduces characters without nursery rhymes or motifs and the beats of the story are distributed as if they were with a broken ladle. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget that this is a "horror" movie, though. Our characters are in a forest where Dr. Chopper and his two "fearful" relatives are hiding, which should be some sort of Frankencreatures but they look exactly like the Valley Girls with fake blood diluted under their Supercut underpants. I honestly saw a scarier trick on an eight-year-old boy, joking or joking about Halloween. <br /> <br /> And once again we are reminded of the smelly costume of the costume designer, like the Valley Ghoul One prances around in a pseudo-Victorian polyblend apron while his friend is wearing an undefined ensemble that could be it was almost fashionable in less fashionable corners of the 80s. <br /> <br /> Dr. Chopper makes the big statement of fashion, however, looks like a Crisco cowboy who got lost in the woods on his big black Harley, dressed from head to toe in black S & M leather with zipper. <br /> <br /> If this seems intriguing, everything means controlling it. There is a lot of cracking and senseless dialogues (like the precious "cemetery of the elephants" scene or the "intellectual" talk about Ginsburg). <br /> <br /> To be honest, cinematography is good, considering what was put in front of the camera, and the actors strive (with wildly extreme results) to get something out of a pile of clich√©s and deceptions. You should ask yourself if they were really stupid or just blindly desperate, not out of the set after catching a glimpse of the ridiculous-looking villains with their 99 Cent Store weapons.
