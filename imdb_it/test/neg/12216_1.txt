I ordered this film on the Internet as it is very difficult to get Turkish films where we live. I heard so much about the TV series of my friends and practically everyone in Turkey, I expected to see a turning point in Turkish cinema. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> My husband and I (who is an admirer of every film with some Turkish scenery and Turkish dialogues in it) I saw it all the way because we had paid $ 20 for DVD. Well, it was a boring way to waste it. <br /> <br /> It was confusing, sometimes overcrowded, while at other times it was understood. The plot wasn't just confusing, but adding a homosexual who walked with his dog on the beach and using some humor in the script to make it "Hollywood" didn't work for me either. <br /> <br /> The American characters were almost too stereotyped that it was neither funny nor realistic and, as mentioned by another user, the Turkish habits and lifestyle were irrelevant. <br /> <br /> The camera movements did not have any meaning. Adding some Dervishes (never seen in them in Kapadokya) and broken plates, the Greek style, made the film even more confusing. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed of this film and all the noise the press has made about it. There are certainly films worthy of Turkish directors who deserve more attention and respect. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 1 out of 10.
