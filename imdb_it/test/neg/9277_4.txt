The problem with this movie is the same problem that the TV series have had and this is the thief Stan and Jack. There is nothing wrong with thieves, but Stan and Jack are played by actors who seem to be in their forties and early 50s! And there is something questionable - not to mention the credibility of credibility - as they rely on young enough girls to be their daughters <br /> <br /> As with the rest of HOLIDAY ON THE BUSES, I found it immediately forgettable. It is practically a 30-minute episode that lasts 90 minutes with all the actions taking place in a holiday camp instead of a bus station <br /> <br /> Surprisingly almost a third of the voters on this site gave a 10 ! Come on guys, this movie doesn't deserve more than a 5
