I was looking forward to spending part of my Independence Day weekend watching a good Jefferson movie. This film was not. It was quite long, pulled out, boring and unbalanced. Too much time has been spent exploring Jefferson's relationship with Cosway and not enough time has been spent on his relationship with Sally Hemmings. The lady who played Sally, Thandie Newton, was absolutely horrible. His acting was so bad that it was like watching an A1 airhead trying to recite Shakespeare. His constant plaintive voice scratched his nerves! Nolte's accent made Jefferson look like an ignorant man rather than a genius. Jefferson's relationship with his daughters and their feelings for slavery was also underdeveloped, yet the eldest daughter's rebellion (Patsy) is a key event in the late film. The film was too long and the script lacked energy and excitement. On the positive side, the costumes were pretty good, and Greta Scacchi played the Cosway part well. If you want to see a film about the revolutionary era and / or Jefferson, then look at 1776, it's much better than Jefferson in Paris.
