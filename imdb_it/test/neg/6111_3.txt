Somehow I failed for a few years to watch this film, even though it was fairly successful and generated much discussion in Israel. I'm sorry I didn't postpone it indefinitely. <br /> <br /> The theme of "Kadosh" is very real and painful for those who know the Jewish religious world - the place of women in the Orthodox family and society. The basic situation that is found on the premises of the film is possible, the problem is that the way in which it is brought to the screen and the "solution" that the conflicts described receive in the film are wrong. Gitai does not seem to have too much sympathy for men in the religious world, but his approach to choosing characters who are either fanatics or unable to express their human feelings makes the whole story simplistic. Nor is it a much better service for her female characters, although here at least she shows more sympathy and also enjoys the participation of two beautiful and gifted actresses in Yael Abecassis and Meital Barda. Overall, Gitai's vision is too one-sided, his cinema means too elementary, focuses on the technical details of Jewish religious life, which may be interesting for people who do not know them but who are not at all relevant in the context of the whole story. Starting from interesting assumptions what we get here is a boring film that seems longer than it is, with a very static way of acting, the obsessive use of music that plays in the same register not only from a musical point of view but also from a musical point of view. from an emotional point of view and very inconclusive if not even ending up confusing. What difference between this film and 'Ha Ushpizin' has inspired and described the same social landscape and that has managed to convey human feelings on the screen. In 'Kadosh' there are too little cinema and too many small human emotions.
