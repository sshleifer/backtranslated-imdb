OK, we were going with the stereotypical experience of bad orphanage and explaining to our son, adopted by Russia, that it was an exaggerated acting and dramatization, so that we could get the dog to play football (since he plays soccer) . But the last scene, in which the dog returns to its original owner, put my son over the limit and cried for 15-20 minutes, "has been replaced !!!!" This from an elementary child. I do NOT recommend this film to any family that has an adopted child; shows the adoption badly, the orphanages and the adults - and in the end, even if they win the game - the dog with which the boy is tied must leave - and this is too much. Please be cautious if you have adopted children and pay attention to families with biological children, because the impression of adopted children is not positive and paints a stereotype that is sick and bad. (The dog is cute, but not enough to save our family's reaction to this film ....)
