Fran√ßois Traffaut's "Mississippi Siren" had an unconvincing storyline. The script required too much flexibility in suspending disbelief. The plot went at a glacial pace. He began in an interesting environment, but soon he slipped on the shoals of melodrama that lacked logic or intelligence. What were the critics thinking? This is also overrated to be described as a loser. Catherine Deneuvue, who enchanted "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" and "Belle Doe Jour", was also simply boring. <br /> <br /> We rented this movie at the same time as we rented another Traffaut movie. We looked at this first, and found it to be so bad that we sent the other one back unseen at the same time.
