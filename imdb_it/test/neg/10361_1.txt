I mean, nothing happens, 5 stupid children go to Oklahoma to find a magical marijuana forest ... this could have been fun, if it wasn't for the 5 worst actors in the world. And the dialogues weren't even half an inch of fun. The only thing I could almost tell myself was when the stupid policemen stopped teenagers in Oklahoma or Kansas ... The plot could have been fun, if it hadn't been for an abysmal interpretation. If you even think about watching this piece of shit, don't do it. How stupid, that the boy leaves the police telling them he is gay, as his friend did (only he wasn't pretending ...) and there is that stupid joke about the various meanings of the word "gay" ". I'm laughing at my hair ....... NOT ....... Anyway ... WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN !!
