At least it's with this episode. Here we have a time traveler, the professor from Gilligan's Island, no less, who goes back in time to 1865. What is done - why try to save Lincoln, of course! There are no very interesting variations on this old theme. As another reviewer stated, this episode is particularly sad and not very elegant, with little to suggest that "the Professor" really came back in the 1860s. The limitations of the budget are easily evident and the direction is stolid. John Wilkes Booth adds a spark but remains a very flat production. Too often we feel on stage, waiting for something smart to happen. There is a small turn at the end, but I emphasize minor.
