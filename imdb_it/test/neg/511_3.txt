Attention, possible spoilers <br /> <br /> This movie is so lousy that it becomes really fun. The director has included all the clichés that have ever plagued the films of the B series. The stupid child (handsome trellis) is captured again and again by the bad guys, the bad boss smiling and revealing his plots before they happen, so that they can be ruined and that, of course, they have teased / killed the hero's father in an unclear past, a side-kick in the person of a policeman - small, bald and whose only preparation for the last battle (another cliché) is bringing back the edge of the baseball cap, etc. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is really at the top. After the criminal leader dies when the Paralised Stoneface Jack hero or whatever he discharges from the roof of a ten-story building, they exit the building. Which, from the exterior, looks only three stories high and very similar to your normal town hall. <br /> <br /> When they leave the building, the side kick cannot walk, as its right leg appears to be injured. How, no one can say: ten minutes before he fell into his shoulder and his feet were fine. There is no other explanation for the inquisitor's mind of the viewer who would be curious to know such trivial things as "Where is the body of the wicked who should lie near the building?" and "Why are there no policemen or curious people gathered around this body?" <br /> <br /> I could go on and on with the list. Why does another villain claim to have invented martial arts when he gets his ass done in no time? Why do the bad guys generally make silly movements when they attack? Why does the hero look so faggy? Does anyone really think "yes, these characters and this plot make this a movie to remember"? And the actors suck. Our hero and savior of the day brings the same expression on his face. The whole movie. That disgusted, trying to be an arrogant smirk, must be his copyrighted feat. <br /> <br /> Also, thinking that up to now 12% of the people who voted for this film have given a 10 fills me with fear inside. They could have been serious and therefore we are doomed.
