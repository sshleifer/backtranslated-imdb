Great. Another foreign film that Fellini thinks is. In addition to this, we must do more propaganda on the murder of disabled people. <br /> <br /> I see no reason why we should be inundated with these subtly disguised euthanasia advertisements. <br /> <br /> I found nothing saving about this movie. What can be redeemed about a man without the courage to go on, despite some adversity. It doesn't take courage to commit suicide. This is the action of a coward. Sharing this "desire" with her woman simply limits her to inflicting the same illness she has. If this had been a film about a man's courage to go on, despite his problems, similar to Jill Kinmont's story, it would have been a fantastic film. <br /> <br /> If you're interested in seeing the real courage, watch movies about Jill Kinmont, the former skier who was turned off after a bad ski accident.
