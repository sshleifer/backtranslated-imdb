Dateline Hollywood's satirical website joked that "Son of the Mask" was a playful star, Jamie Kennedy played on New Line Cinema for his show "The Jamie Kennedy Experiment". If only. And if only the film was fun in the middle of that piece of satire. <br /> <br /> "The Mask" was the ideal vehicle for the shooter face of Jim Carrey on which so many spectators concentrate; he also delighted males over the age of 12 by introducing Cameron Diaz. So having a follow-up minus both wasn't a good idea, and you'd have thought that New Line would learn the lesson after "Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd." But no ... although to be honest, having a completely new cast is in line with the original comic (in which the Mask went from owner to owner). As written by Lance Khazei and directed by Lawrence Guterman, however, there is nothing in return, except a constant stream of explicitly acceptable effects from the usual squadron of houses (Industrial Light and Magic that improves the "Ally McBeal" baby dance and the their "Baby's Day Out", with Tippett Studio, Giant Killer Robots, Digital Dimension and so on in support) and an even greater seconding of cartoon fans making our hero work in an animation company (responsible for gems like "Siamese") Papi "), naming his character after Tex Avery and working not only on references to classic vignettes but on real clips. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the last approach does not really work, partly because most attempts to bring cartoon traps to live the action fall flat (especially the cars that you put in the 'atmosphere of the party) and above all because the tributes to the Flintstones, Woody Woodpecker, "Duck Amuck" and above all "One Froggy Evening" show how weak this film is in comparison. Furthermore, the film adapts to a playful farce and a tense feeling (the main theme of the story is the family, our hero is not ready to have a child, and his nemesis - Alan Cumming as the Nordic god Loki - is far away from the apple of Odin eye ... and what Bob Hoskins is doing here as Odin, even after "Super Mario Bros.", is beyond me), and Kennedy is not in the same league as Carrey in the fantastic stakes - even if it's not like he gets any help from the script. Moreover, unlike Diaz, the very cute Traylor Howard (like the mother of the son of the Mask) does not have much to do; giving HER the Mask may have helped the film. <br /> <br /> Further points are lost for throwing away Cumming, Hoskins, Steven Wright and Magda Szubanski; for a suspiciously shortened execution time (which would explain some holes in the plot and scenes that seem to be missing); and for an incredible attempt at a joke when our hero fails to sell the "green guy" concept as an animated TV series - "The Mask" has become an animated TV series in real life, and it was much better to follow than this sequel . The fact that this was actually opened in Britain before the United States should tell you everything ... with this and "Blade: Trinity", New Line seems intent on grabbing the market in terrible sequels with members of the cast of "Two Guys And A Girl ". "What else," The Butterfly Effect 2 "with Nathan Fillion? <br /> <br /> Someone stops him.
