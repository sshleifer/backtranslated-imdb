I have to go with my boyfriend Allen (who also reviewed this film) ... ZOMBIE GANGBANGERS (as my copy is titled - guess who excluded the part of "NINJA" after realizing that there is no single "ninja" "or a reference to the ninjas in any part of the entire movie!) is a total loss of time. Honestly one of the most boring and delayed "movies" I've ever had the regret of seeing. <br /> <br /> A prostitute is repeatedly raped (not graphically) by two zombies and then by a policeman (again, not graphically) when the policeman does not believe his story. Meet a guy who was beaten by these zombies and the two try to find a way to take revenge on the guilty undead ... <br /> <br /> First of all - there is NO "gangbanging" (or really anything else) banging "on everyone" to have in ZOMBIE NINJA GANGBANGERS. I was hoping to get at least some sort of horror / porn hybrid at PORN OF THE DEAD, or RE-PENETRATOR, or maybe STORIES - but no - there was absolutely no sex in this movie. At least a little old in-out might have redeemed this boring garbage to some extent, but without it, we get a bunch of badly turned scenes of complete boredom with zero gain. I'm all for the "trash" movies and most of the other schlock, gore, porn and exploit material, but this honestly sucks in every way imaginable. Save time, pass this ... 1/10 (and the only one is just for a few short shots of some sub-par tits ...)
