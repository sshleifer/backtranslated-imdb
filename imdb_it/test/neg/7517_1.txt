This film is a shame. How can you take one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time and turn it into a sort of mid-ax love story? The entire beginning of the film was not in the history of H.G. Wells and he didn't need to be. Even the Elois were completely wrong. They did build houses or form any kind of real society. They didn't care about each other at all. This was an important part of the story. The way they had formed a world without difficulties or complex emotions. They were barely aware of the Morlocks. I don't know why this film was made as is, but some stories should be told as they are or left alone.
