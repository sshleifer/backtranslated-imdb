A wonderful semi-humorous homage to the expressionist black and white films of people like FW Murnau, Fritz Lang, Carl Dreyer, Marcel Carn√© and others. Allen plays a character caught in a Kafkaesque nightmare, initially thinking of being part of a vigilante group that tries to capture a murderer and slowly realizes that it could be a suspect. The script is a bit forced (after all, Woody Allen is trying to be a shy Kafka), but the point is made and there is nothing wrong. Cinematography is interesting, about 100 shades of gray, but be sure to look in a very dark room with a good screen, otherwise the details will be swallowed up in the fog. This is a little funny movie with some laughs that are actually a bit of "uh-huh". Acting is fine, considering the odd vehicle, and it's worth a look if you're a big fan of Woody Allen. Also interesting for those who know expressionist films. I would give this to 6.5 out of 10.
