I saw the first two nights before coming to IMDb looking for information on the actors. I saw the 9 + vote which surprised me since I was not so impressed by what I had seen. (As a reference, I think Lonesome Dove was the best western movie ever: I grew up close to MGM in Culver City in the 1950s and I have a certain sense of respect for the Western genre.) <br /> <br /> So I saw the first bright review and decided to read "other". There I found several reviews with 1 or 2 stars that summed up my feelings well about the lack of character development, poor editing, feeling that it was shot on the Universal rear lot (the MGMs are long overdue) and general impression that it wasn't going to come close to changing my feelings for LD. My impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was "less than a 4.0". <br /> <br /> This made me think about the process that produces a score of 9+. If the people who give 10 and 9 do not take the time to justify their vote, were the ballot boxes filled by people with a monetary motivation? I have used IMDb for a long time to show films and thought it was the best available. Now I'm not so sure.
