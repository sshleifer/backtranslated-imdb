First let me tell you that I live in South Africa, where rugby is by far our biggest sport, and our national team, the Springboks, has won the Rugby World Cup twice, so it's a big problem here. I've played my whole life and I'm shocked by the lack of attention to detail in this movie! At first I thought it could be a great movie considering the cast of Neal McDonough, Nick Ferris, Gary Cole and Sean Astin for charity, but it turned out to be a mockery of the sport. Basically they mix it together with your normal everyday American football movie. <br /> <br /> My first problem is that this film presumably captures the values ​​of rugby, but the discipline or should I say that its complete lack during the games is contradictory to this. In the final it looks more like an NFL game with Penning who is faced several times by the ball, in front of the referee ... who would have immediately led to a couple of red cards, because a dirty game like that would never have gone unpunished in an arbitrator , I can assure you of this! Also, you wouldn't be able to find a coach in world rugby who would have so little control over his team. Any coach would make a dump on a player's head if he intentionally turns over the arms of an opposing player or doubles the teams like they did in the last ... red card and some suspensions, period. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is absurd for a coach to take a brand new player, who played his entire life I collect, move him to a prostitute who is a highly specialized position and say he is for the good of the TEAM?! What?! Hooker is a highly specialized front row position where you have to be able to mix very well and preferably be able to throw the ball in line-out time, which Penning NEVER does for a reason or another reason. By moving a wing into a prostitute without lengthy long-term training, this would firstly involve the disappearance of your melee team and, secondly, the poor boy would probably break his neck! How good for the team I ask you? Finally, the overall high emotional level of the film is definitely excessive, because even if rugby is a great sport, and builds great friendships and team spirit, it rarely escapes it and becomes banal. I saw the real football drama with less emotion than this movie and it turned out to be fantastic, but in this film Sean's (Penny) acting skills are dragged too far and the film tries to force too much of an emotional response from the audience, which ends to be boring and difficult to watch at times. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has made some great sports movies over the years, but next time they venture into a sport that has just been retired in the United States, you should try your homework and maybe get some experts in the melee. <br /> <br /> DO IT RIGHT OR DON'T DO IT TO EVERYONE!
