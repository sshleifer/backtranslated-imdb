"Tamara" has just felt like another teen-oriented knock-off of the "I Know What You Did Last Summer" trend and is painfully boring. An outcast of the high school, who is heavily in witchcraft and black magic, is accidentally killed during a cruel joke led by a group of bullies who secretly bury her in the woods, vowing not to tell anyone. The next day, the alleged "dead" Tamara arrives at school with a completely new image and seduces her potential killers and has a little revenge ... This is basically a combination of "Carrie", "The Craft", and every other straight-to-video bopper turkey, a teenager hitting the shelves these days. The actors are absolutely atrocious and seem ten years too old to go to high school. There is a bit of coolness, which in reality is nothing so interesting since the film is so boring and I couldn't wait for it to end. If you like modern garbage of what I insist on, look for this, otherwise don't worry ...
