I can't believe I sat in this total waste of time. I was too fascinated by how unspeakably ugly it was that I couldn't move. It reminded me of the feeling when you can't look away from a horrible car accident or the rotting carcass of a cow. You can't help but look, but then you feel sick and sick. <br /> <br /> Let me elaborate: "Plan 9 from space", for example, is not a bad movie. Not even "Star Wars: Holiday Special" is a bad movie. Both are terrible to look at, of course, but both have SOME qualities and at least leave you the strength to reach the "off" button. <br /> <br /> This "remake" (only in the name) of the science fiction classic let me cry on my couch, desperately trying to come to terms with why such screenplays were filmed, because someone would have tainted the memory of the original classic and if I could have resumed my normal life without me I suddenly became nostalgic for the quiet and peace of death. <br /> <br /> Even though death, I realized, offered no rest from the horrible memories of this pile of shit, since the poor souls of hell are probably forced to look again and again for eternity ... .
