Most of the reviews on this film have been damned accurate. It's an hour and a half wasted of time, following a group of very nice students who whine and cry about life. There are about twenty minutes of magic, and absolutely no scary or electrifying moments. Our actress is treated like a piece of ass and seems perfectly happy with her position. The main characters, these sons of Ipsmith, are walking with posters for any pop culture clothing store. You can't relate to them, fuck, you can barely understand them. The story proceeds on itself and when it finally arrives at the final battle, it is nothing more than a volleyball game that does not last long enough to compensate for this trash script raped by O.C.
