I took La Bandara because he brought together Jean Gabin and Julien Duvivier, whose Pepe le Moko is a noir masterpiece. I'll give some points because Gabin is involved, but the clumsy plot, the cheap sets and the ridiculous Annabella acting like an Arab princess put the movie on my shelf "for sale". If you look at it, you'll find yourself asking, because the idiots didn't build the fort * around * the well, instead of just a few meters away from it. And why use sheet metal roofs in the middle of the desert? But then the absolute perversity of inventiveness that makes up the script should numb you in every further contemplation.
