I have to give Billy Dee credit for trying to get him out. Knowing that this was a blaxploitation film, I started my DVD with a certain expectation. I knew it would be a low budget ... the acting sub-par ... but I was hoping for some gem to be spread everywhere. If there were any diamonds or gems sprinkled in this film, they were successfully buried under tons and tons of coal ... or perhaps because of overwork. As an actor and filmmaker, I've often shuddered when potential touching moments have been ruined by atrocious performances. And yet, I must admit, I could not look away. I don't know if it was like a car accident you can't take your eyes off, or a mysterious power in the movie that kept me there. This film is a good case for an excellent story that has been badly told. If Walter Kronkite were to tell the joke of the "Aristocrats", it would be a total failure, even if the joke itself is hilarious. Let Dave Chappelle tell it, and we're all rolling on the floor laughing. This film needed a "Chapelle". Now, with that said, if you have the opportunity to buy this movie for the dollar I made, do it. It's worth it. Maybe I'll take another dollar, buy the rights to this film and redo it. Who knows ... it may not be better, but it certainly can't be worse.
