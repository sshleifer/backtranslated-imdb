With a cast of mostly low-level stars (Alain Delon, Robert Wagner, Eddie Albert), bad special effects (of course, it was the 70s but "Alien" and "Star Wars" came from the same decade), and one plot that is so ridiculous that you might want to cry, this is a "flight" that should have been PUT. <br /> <br /> Even Oscar-winning winners Cicely Tyson and George Kennedy cannot keep this "bird" in flight. <br /> <br /> The implausibility of the third film - the plane is immersed in the Bermuda Triangle - is much more believable than this turkey. <br /> <br /> Avoid "Il Concorde" at all costs!
