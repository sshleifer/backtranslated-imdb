And I'm afraid I can't imagine why. It's really a really terrible and exceptionally boring movie. In a sense it is reminiscent of science fiction in advance when every set was knocked down on a backside of Hollywood from whatever was around. From the tiny and unconvincing set (the snipers seem to be about ten meters) apparently made of plaster, to the actors who are also apparently made of plaster with "funny" stereotypes painted subtly at the top, to the strangely warm pool in an icy cave, to the survival of the uninjured cast when medium artillery bullets burst just a few meters away on open ground, and finally the horrible script that reads like a training manual more than a movie .... I can't really say how boring it is. Even the opportunity to see if young James Dean survived was not enough to make me watch for more than an hour. This is really to be avoided at ALL costs.
