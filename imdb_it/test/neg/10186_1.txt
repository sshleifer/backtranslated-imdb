I'm warning people out there, this is just a waste of time. I'm honest when I say this is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's just a move on Christian propaganda! Don't throw your life away, don't see it! <br /> <br /> I think they made the film so more people will believe in Jesus or something, but it works the other way. The actors are all newbies, the story is just blurry! <br /> <br /> I think this film is a work of the devil. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth seeing, so please follow my advice and don't do it!
