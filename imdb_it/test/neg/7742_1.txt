Boy, this movie is bad. And not even in a good, fun or funny way. Even the MST3K could not prevent it from becoming boring, and it is also confusing when everyone goes out. But the most annoying part of this boring mess is the horrible high-pitched voice of Ireland, which I was tired of listening in the first five minutes. Not to mention how unattractive his character really is. Even his father ran away and left her! I can understand why, frankly. If he had to listen to her with his little mouse voice for more than a few minutes, he would have been tempted to do her great harm. As I was, at the end of the film. Moreover, it is useless and annoying. When she fell into the long hole of the earth at Alice in Wonderland, she would have ended up in the first ten minutes if that menacingly inexplicably Australian miner had not continued to save her from all the various sufferings that she kept falling into. He should have simply tied it to the Atlantean version of the tracks and finished it. And this underground Atlantis with the strange, confused obsession with bone density, I must ask myself: where was the light that came from over there? Do they have generators that imitate the sun? It does not matter. In any case, there isn't a real plot, just a bunch of strange Goth drunk around trying to catch Kathy (probably so that they can sneak a gag in their mouth). Stupid, useless film. Thanks Golan Globus, for this cinematic abomination. May you burn in the seventh ring of Hell for eternity.
