Want the worst horror movie of the 21st century? It's El Chupacabra. "Manos: The Hands of Fate" is the worst movie of all time, but El Chupacabra is certainly the worst movie of this century. It must also have the distinction of having the absolute absolute worst actor. Eric Alegria, the leading actor, has never made another film besides El Chupacabra, I wonder why. <br /> <br /> Apparently the monster is attacking people, but everyone who is attacked moves very slowly and is really stupid. And there are no policemen in this city, only two detective idiots - Hi! The cops first appear on the scene of the murders, then the detectives arrive! And, apparently, the monster only attacks in a person's yard, and some deserted area next to the pier. Or ... this is the only place filmmakers could have access to the film. <br /> <br /> This "movie" is the reason why IMDb must allow us to give negative stars. This easily deserves -10 stars, or at least 0. They should allow a 0 rating.
