Interferencia starts as unemployed Martin Sanders (Andres Bagg) hears something strange on his phone, he hears a mysterious man who talks to a prostitute named Diana and who is getting organized to meet her. Shortly afterwards Martin reads a local newspaper and sees the front page of a murdered prostitute and thinks back to what he has heard. Martin trusts his friends Laura (Virginia Lustig) and Aaron (Oliver Kolker) but they don't believe him. Then shortly afterwards the same thing happens again, the phone call, the man, the prostitute and his death reported in the newspapers. Martin decides to find the murderer and stop his murderous madness, but who is he? <br /> <br /> This Argentinian production was apparently filmed in just eight days (why so long?) with a budget of around $ 3000 (why so much?) it was written and directed by Sergio Esquenazi and I can't believe some of the enthusiastic comments that Interferencia has on notice. Out of 195 user votes as I write this 113 of them rate this stack of 10 out of 10 crap, I'm sorry but there's no way anyone should give this movie a pretty literally perfect score of 10 out of 10. If a score for a movie on IMDb, so frankly, I don't think that if you show Interferencia 195 people on average, well over 100 of them will find it absolutely perfect, absolutely impossible on Earth. User comments are also surprisingly positive, all from IMDb users who have only written comments for a film, this one. The only user (besides me) who actually wrote more than one comment gave him a 1 in 10 setback that seems right. Everyone has the right to an opinion, but I would bet my life on the fact that most of those positive comments come from false stories only partially established for this piece of shit. Where do I start? How the hell can I adequately describe how serious Interferencia is? The plot is a disaster that basically lives or dies for its terrible twists, while most of the twists and turns twists a plot on its head and alters the perspective of everything that happened in an intelligent and relevant way and are true surprises here in Interferencia the twists destroy the first half of the film and makes it absolutely useless in a "not really happened" in a sense and the turnaround is so poorly managed that it lets you ask more questions than answers. What made Martin mad? Why did you imagine phone calls? Why did you imagine a murderer? Why did you imagine the headlines? No explanation is given for Martin's behavior during the first hour or so of the film, there is only this absurd revelation that was all in his mind and that's it, it's all the exposure there is. Then there's a twist on Martin's missing wife and his lover before Martin for unexplained reasons that start killing his friends for no apparent reason. I'm sorry, but Interferencia is so ugly, it's so boring, it's so badly written and thought that I honestly can't think of a positive thing to say about it. Sorry, but that's how I feel, simply Interferencia is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and it's a complete disaster both conceptually and technically. <br /> <br /> According to the IMDb Interferencia it was hot in just eight days, to be honest, it doesn't look like that at all. No, it looks more like it was shot in five days! The whole film is an eyesore, Interferencia probably has the worst night shots I've ever seen. It is as if no attempt has been made to illuminate the scenes, it is as if the producers had simply gone into a dark room or a basement or whatever and shot onto the scene, regardless of whether something could be seen. The scenes set outside during the day have this horrible unnatural blue-green shade for them without an apparent reason that seems simply silly and becomes increasingly irritating. This strange tint is not repeated on indoor scenes, so they are also quite disconcerting and noteworthy. There is no real horror or fear, on the contrary I would say that Interferencia is more a thriller than a horror. As for blood, there are two heads decapitated in a refrigerator, a knife is stuck in someone's mouth and nothing else. <br /> <br /> According to the IMDb does this have a budget of around $ 3,000 which makes Interferencia one of the lowest budget films ever commercially published? Some people think that just because a movie is cheap, all reasonable viewing standards should go out the window and we should accept any old crap, wrong! To see it on DVD you will still have to pay a good price and personally I think we have the right to expect a sort of good product. If this can be released and praised as a worthy Oscar then we can all release our video camera for the holidays (including embarrassing karaoke movies and scenes of total darkness as we forgot to remove the lens cap) and win prizes at the next film festival of Cannes! The acting is horrible, although the female lead Virginia Lustig is actually pretty sexy and helps relieve the pain of the last twenty odd minutes as she shows quite a bit. <br /> <br /> Interferencia is an absolutely terrible film, seriously I suppose they don't let you deceive by all the false positive comments, there is no way anyone is involved in this or has some sort of agenda that will give them a 9 or 10 out of 10. An amateur casino that's really horrible to sit through. Sorry but that's how I see it, sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind ... you've been warned!
