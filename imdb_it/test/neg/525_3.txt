Some aspects of this production are good, such as the interpretations of Angela Lansbury, George Hearn, Cris Groenendaal and Sal Mistretta. But am I the only one distracted by Betsy Joslyn's horrible performance as Johanna? She is terrible! She slaps the songs with her shrill voice and moves into a role that she clearly doesn't understand. I also think that the choir is not up to par. They drag time and make the worst facial expressions. Overall, I think this production is okay, but Sweeney Todd can be a lot more if done correctly. This production does not come close to the level required by this material. The concert version with George Hearn and Patti LuPone is much better.
