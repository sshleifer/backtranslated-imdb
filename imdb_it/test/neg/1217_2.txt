Zzzzzzzzzzzz. This comes directly from the "Jaws" biscuit mold, with some other bizarre clichés launched for good measure. I was interested in seeing him after finding a catch in a book about Italian horror films, and wow ... I think I got what I deserved! <br /> <br /> Very slow and moving, much of this killer shark movie takes place on the ground, which isn't all that surprising. It seems that the only method they have to show a shark is through the shots of a shark in an aquarium. The shark is never in the same frame as the actors, and this is a shame ... most of the characters are so annoying that they really wish they were eaten. <br /> <br /> The "plot" concerns a group of four children who one day meet with a mysterious Indian on the beach while they roast weenies. The Indian, for some reason, gives them an ancient artifact that will allow them to track down an ancient evil that took the form of a monster shark to attack their tribe ... presumably because they were too good at catching the ocean and god of the ocean was worried that they would take all the fish. Or something like that. <br /> <br /> It is also a good thing, because you wouldn't know ... years later, a monstrous shark appears that begins to devour people in the sleeping community of the sea. When one of the four boys is eaten by the shark, the remaining three are determined to kill it ... especially since (great shocker here) the authorities have killed a shark and think the threat is over. The obligatory death scenes are incredibly boring, and you can see them coming a mile away (my favorite was the girl who argued with her boyfriend while they sat in a van, then jumped out and said "I'm going for a swim ", immediately to be devoured by the waiting shark). They had a lot of nerves to call this movie "Deep Blood" as you can hardly see, just murky water. The actors manage their cliché roles as if they were all thumbs up, and there is also a hilarious parody that involves a bad rocker guy who threatens our heroes of good luck, then eventually turns to help kill him. shark. /> <br /> It took me a long time to find this movie, it's pretty obscure, so I don't think there is a danger that too many people will waste their time on this. However, if you were to be lured into it ... don't say you weren't warned!
