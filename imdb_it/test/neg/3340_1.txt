It is difficult to express how ugly this film is. Even in the 50s, when the intellectual search for the meaning of life was fashionable and the beatnik refusal of physical comfort, clean clothes, haircuts, etc. It was a common reaction to the smug middle-class customs of both the United States and Western Europe, this film would have been a stinker. The plot is a mixture of several ex machina (if this is the correct Latin grammar); recitation consists of impassive looks broken by occasional hysterics (by the male protagonist and by the females); the free view of Catherine Deneuve (or someone's) breast is worthy of a Budweiser commercial; the repeated repetition of the cacaphonaus orchestra in the abandoned building is sure to have meaning in the director's mind, but to me it's just another stupid symbol thrown into this meaningless movie - I'm joking because my time was wasted watching this excuse for an art flic. The scenery is beautiful and the sex scene is hot - but under his clothes, this king has no substance.
