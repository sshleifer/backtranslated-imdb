Sometimes it is difficult to judge how bad a film produced in Italy or Spain is, because everyone seems to use the same stable of ESL 9-10 trained voice actors to provide English voices for release in the United States. And in any case things are always lost in translation - dialect, shtick character and plot elements written for the expectations of the European public may not go too well with our American ideas about what is fun, fashionable or dramatic. I imagine the team responsible for translating the soundtrack of this film in English had about 3 days to do it from start to finish, and probably each of them earned the equivalent of an installment payment on his Fiat used to do so. In other words, pure hacker work, thrown away in one or two takes and never reviewed or redone by someone with a real ear for the American language. <br /> <br /> Looking at "Devil Fish", I can imagine that if you were an Italian looking at this presented in your native language, you might find it a small piece of slightly funny plush. Laugh at the "jokes" and the funny drunk, you gasp in front of the monster and the wickedness of the villains, and you could watch the attractive couple of Peter and not really Daryll Hannah while their couple on the beach without apparent reason in the middle of a search clues to a man-eating monster that has already killed one of their friends. <br /> <br /> But since the tone is out of tune and the open-mouthed dialogue continues to tear us Americans away from the cinematic experience, we cannot help but notice that the editors have a serious Attention Deficit Disorder, that no one on the screen can really act as much as an Attitude project, that the declared motive for creating the monster makes absolutely no sense, that the action sequences have the full impact of a bowl of cereal full of flour cooked oats and that the director, scriptwriters and producers really hate women. <br /> <br /> Don't even think about buying or renting this movie - just watch cable TV on Saturday afternoons with one of the many beers in your hand, or with the help and protection of Mike and the Bots on MST3K.
