This was a character's movie. The plot was not so hot when it was there, but the characters were interesting and very well performed. The story focuses on the Travis family in the wake of the elder son's suicide. I say this roughly, because the story is mainly about the surviving son and the mother, because if the father should have focused the plot on him, they changed the film pretty badly. Acting on all sides was very good, especially Emile Hirsch as a surviving and confused son. The characters were all very interesting and I didn't mind watching them late in the movie, when it seemed to drag them. <br /> <br /> My big complaint, however, was the story. The son who kills himself should have been the center of the plot. However, it really wasn't. It was something that happened at the beginning of the story, but then everything went in every direction. Then they would say that the son killed himself to remind you that this was the common thread. The other thing was that the great twists, of which there were many, were never explained or constructed, but thrown there casually and often from the far field. In all honesty, the ending was very, very beautiful. But it was also clear where the inspiration for the story came from: about half of it (the half that had not been filled) was practically raised from the story of the Pearl Jam Alive song. Which reminds me ... <br /> <br /> There was a "poem" in the film that was supposedly written by someone who killed himself. I could not have been the only one to recognize that the poem had been raised, word for word, from that same song. I don't know, this was a movie I'd hoped for, and they really, really did drop the ball.
