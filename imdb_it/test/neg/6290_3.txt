KK should stick to the song: this whole movie was a big bore. I can't understand the boys' wickedness and the romanticism between Miles and KK - even the sex scenes were not inspired. The ending was terrible - unresolved - there must be a reason to kill. And the whole voyeurism of the boy was strange ... the mother always struggled with the boy - don't you think she would take a little Freudian with her? And why didn't someone teach KK how to talk about inflection instead of dullness? <br /> <br /> I'm glad I paid only $ 1.00 to rent this. <br /> <br />
