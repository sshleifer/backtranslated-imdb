<br /> <br /> I saw this film during a festival here in Munich with a huge crowd of real fantasy fans. About half of the film, a part of the audience was sleeping and the other part was playing. Boring dialogues, poorly choreographed combat sequences, a terribly stupid story and even worse special effects. Well, at least the actors didn't have much to do, except to look worried or (in case they were women) showing their breasts in the right light. GÃ¶tz Otto, who was in the audience, later admitted that he could understand the disappointment of the spectators. Be careful, folks, of the cheapest fantasy film ever ........
