Identifying this film as a vampire movie would be technically correct. Simply because it will suck the life right from you. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is an insult to movie fans around the world. The plot is almost non-existent. The trick is simply awful. And the acting is not there. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Jackie Chan owed someone a great favor for being convinced to appear in this movie. <br /> <br /> My wife collected the film at the rental shop because she had a photo of Jackie Chan on the front (as if she were acting in the first position) and thought that a good JC movie would be fun to watch. This film was interesting to watch in the same way that you can't help but fix the wreckage of the car when you drive. You realize very quickly that the film will not improve, but you continue to look amazed at how bad it can be.
