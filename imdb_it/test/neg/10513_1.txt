A dark but fun story that involves a policeman who has first-hand experience with vampires and decides to quit his job to pursue these evil beings. Most of the film contained questionable acting, plot, props and footage. The fighting scenes were sulky like the surrender of a battle of the Second World War. The pronounced lines were pronounced as if the actors had no motivation to be there. The props were bad because they didn't even seem to work in the least amount. most of the film seemed to have been shot in someone's basement (in some scenes you could see the beams above the head in a scene that should not have resembled that of a cellar). The plot had no motivation to move forward or back, it just seemed to stop sometimes for some character actions. Sometimes I heard that the sound effects were out of place for this genre of horror genre and more for a series of cartoons. It is similar to the movie Blade, in the sense that it is an African American vampire hunter. However, this is where all the similarities end, and the film seems closer to a Saturday Night Live parody.
