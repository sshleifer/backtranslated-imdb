Bad. Bad. Bad. These three lines summarize this little filthy film that can attract only idiotic children and their parents to the cinema. and his ... # 1 movie in America! What does this country think? Mike Myers looks more like Michael Jackson. Some Chinese lady who falls asleep in 3 minutes. A lame plot with dirty jokes. It's grotesque and terrible. When Green-Eggs and Ham comes out in 2005 I'll be so happy! (no) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the Green-Eggs and Ham lost. They will try to chase Sam-I-Am and that bad boy who is leaving. (I hope they don't ruin the classic book.) Don't waste time and money seeing this.
