The last of the "Airport" sequels. This has pilots Alain Delon and George Kennedy (who was in all the airport films); David Warner (!!!) as a radio engineer; Susan Blakely as a newswoman targeted for death; Robert Wagner as a brilliant scientist (stop laughing!); Eddie Albert as president of the airlines; Charo in a horrible "comic" piece; John Davidson as a journalist (he loves how his hair stays in place even after the plane capsizes!); poor Martha Raye is humiliated; Cicely Tyson plays a mother who is beating her heart for her dying son (stop rolling your eyes!); Jimmie Walker as a clarinetist (what did I say not to laugh?); Mercedes McCambridge as Russian gymnastics trainer (OK, you can laugh at that); Bibi Andresson as a prostitute and Sylvia Kristel and Sybil Danning as love interests. <br /> <br /> Simply pathetic. Full of stupid plots and dialogues that will make you roar - watch Davidson get married on the plane towards the end! Concorde is bringing all these people to Russia. They are attacked with missiles, run away, land safely in France and TAKE OFF again the next day !!!! Don't you think the flight would have been canceled or something? Most of the acting is terrible - McCambridge is a sight to behold with a red wig and a horrible fake accent. The only good acting is that of Kennedy and Delon (who look fantastic) who give a very engaging performance. However, it is not enough to get you through this blow. Even too long and bad special effects. This was a mega-bomb and (thankfully) prevented Universal from doing more.
