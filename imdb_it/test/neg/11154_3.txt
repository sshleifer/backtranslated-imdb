What does this film have? Lots of shots and expensive effects. Nothing makes sense at any other level. <br /> <br /> Watching Arnold cry is seeing him act so badly that it's ridiculous. The plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you think the Devil will be hit by a bad actor with a machine gun, well, this movie is for you!
