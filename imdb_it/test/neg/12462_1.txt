As a rule, I try to find as much as possible in the movies to be able to appreciate them. I made no exceptions with "Tart", doing my best to appreciate it for what it was. But no effort, no matter how big, could eventually redeem this pitiful excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> He failed for a variety of reasons. First, cinematography was meaningless and ineffective. Secondly, the script reached depths of "poor" that brought it well and really beyond the "so bad is good" category. Third, the acting leaves something to be desired is incredible - it was terrifying, it really was. Anyone who has seen Mischa Barton (seen here as the extraordinarily terrible Grace, a character so little invented and understood that Ja Ja Binks does not seem so bad) as Devon in John Duigan's "Lawn Dogs" will wonder what went wrong between then and now . Perhaps, if she had been given a character that was worth worrying about, and a minimum of director, she could at least have given this movie a saving characteristic. Alas, this was not the case. Finally, the film seemed to make no sense, to express nothing, to get nothing. Really, I wonder why Christina Wayne bothered. <br /> <br /> "Tart" made a weak attempt to be something, and failed. The result - a film, unfortunately, so bad that it is only very, very bad. Don't worry, it's not worth it.
