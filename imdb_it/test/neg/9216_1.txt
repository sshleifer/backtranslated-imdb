I remember seeing this year ago, he had a reasonably promising start, with an interesting premise, but then he turned into nonsense pretty quickly. Uninteresting characters, failed attempts to add drama and tension, and even a bit of simplistic philosophy, which culminates in a terrible ending. <br /> <br /> It's simply rubbish. <br /> <br /> Before seeing this TV movie, I didn't think I would ever have any movies that I thought was the "worst" I had seen, but after I finished watching it, I knew from that moment on, if anyone he asked me which was the worst movie I've ever seen, I could say without hesitation: "The Second Coming". <br /> <br /> Avoid.
