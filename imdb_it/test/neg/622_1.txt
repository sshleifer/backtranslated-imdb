Leave Ed Wood alone. To call "Plan 9 from Outer Space", the worst film ever made would be to deny this abysmally vulgar pile of Hollywood guano as a legitimate title. This pretentious fusion of whimsical caprice and socio-political "commentary" actually seems to be formed along the lines of "Plan 9", with ill-prepared scenes of poor people on economic clusters interspersed with what appears to be footage of battle scenes and crowds hooded by epics of higher budgets. But while "Plan 9" occasionally manages to be fun when it means being and reasonably fun in general, this cheeky show is terribly lacking in a basic showman, with scenes ranging from dishonest offensive (Groucho Marx's disgusting burlesque that steals Manhattan from the Indians) at the low camp (Hedy Lamarr who tries to impersonate Joan of Arc listening to her "voices") to boring (Dennis Hopper who does absolutely nothing with Napoleon's role) to the unexpectedly pungent performance of Peter Lorre in the role of the psychotic Nero. He gives the worst trophy to Irwin Allen, for turning so much into so little.
