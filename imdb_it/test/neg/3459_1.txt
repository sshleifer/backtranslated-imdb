I also made the mistake of thinking that I was going to see swimming in 2003 with Geoffry Rush. This was worse than many student films I've seen. The script was forced, the acting was poor and the editing annoying. It was so slow that I managed to force myself to stay. But I've always given a movie a chance, so I suffered until the end. Apparently there was a memo about this film, because my friend and I were the only ones in the theater. Why didn't someone send me this memo?!?! That's why I'm posting, as a warning to others who think they shell out money to see it. I just hope you came to this page, and didn't get trapped like I did watching "Swimming Upstream". Post scriptum I'm sorry for the cast and crew if you're reading this. I know you've worked hard to do this. I know what happens in making a movie ... keep trying!
