Al Pacino was once an actor capable of making a role work without resorting to the constant use of swear words. In other words, when he could act, he didn't have to talk like a street junkie. McConaughey must have been impressed by Pacino because he also became a promoter of the word "F". This could be the kind of society they live in, but most of us have the common decency to look at what we say in a mixed society. I don't remember the exact words a professor used to explain the constant use of blasphemies, but it was something like that. "It shows lack of intelligence, poor knowledge of the language and lack of respect for all those who have to listen". Maybe it's time for Al to resume some acting classes to sharpen his talent. Oh yes, the movie ... Probably the worst thing McConaughey played. We hope his next role will be in the company of more talented people. Rene Russo as always was hot.
