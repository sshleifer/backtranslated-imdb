"Don't be greedy" sums up the depth of this film. The rest of the baloney is a great window dresser. The film rotates hiding the ball annoyingly and revealing too much. The potentially interesting tangents of the plot are not developed, but those mince are subjected to hash and excess rehashed. <br /> <br /> The fascination of DD, as others have pointed out, was in the device of schizophrenia, the woven woven humor of the film and, above all, the acting. There is enough wooden acting in The Box to attract a giant mound of Martian termites. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the suspension of disbelief during this mess is the glaring question, "Why does a technologically superior power capable of taking over the government need to do tests? Terrible failure of a movie.
