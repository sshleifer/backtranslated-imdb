if you are a fan of the original ten commandments, this movie will make you cry inside. granted, it's only about 1/2 hour at the moment, but it's so painful, I felt it was my duty to warn the true fans of the ten commandments before they were subjected to this bastardization. I didn't think it was possible to make the special effects worse than they were in the 1950s when the original was shot, but this 2006 remake shows me that I'm wrong. I can forgive some lame special effects, but the craptastic dialogue, the melodramatic lightness of the lifestyle film, and the stylized wax-as-acting figures in life give me hope that they rewrite the plot and drown in the Red Sea.
