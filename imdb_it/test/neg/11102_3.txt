My blurred childhood memories kept the echo of Belphégor's cult series in the French 60s ... so I was eager to see the film adaptation. I should have kept my money and taken a walk in the Louvre. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the scenario is still very apt and interesting (Le Louvre's fantom) but the adaptation is ridiculous. The dialogues permanently hesitate between the French irony and the serious "American business" without obtaining either one or the other without appearing as donkey. <br /> <br /> Acting leaves something to be desired and special effects are slim compared to what one might expect (low budget)? <br /> <br /> What remains of all this. Not much outside of some good Paris shots ... which is rarely a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Belphégor was worth more. <br /> <br />
