The ATTIC starts well. The sad story is greatly helped by the two main actors and there is a semblance of a study on the character going on here, but the film goes downhill when Carrie Snodgress buys a monkey. Not one of those cute little monkeys. Buy a real big chimp !!! <br /> <br /> This sudden plot device practically kills the film. It is not conceivable for a woman like the one who plays Snodgress, who has difficulty doing anything because of her overbearing father, because she suddenly buys a chimpanzee. I mean, come on! Forget about it!
