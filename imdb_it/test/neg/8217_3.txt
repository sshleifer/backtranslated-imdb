The film successfully provides a graphic portrait of the suffering of forced sex work, but nothing more. The most backward agenda behind this film could be seen a mile away and leaves the viewer so embarrassed while watching, if you know it. So, women are kidnapped and sent to the former Yugoslav territory to work as sex slaves because (take a deep breath) the American military institution is corrupt and looks away while their private security contractors sell people abroad. You don't need half a brain to see the importance of the Iraq war and the Black Water Company. <br /> <br /> What a load of excrements from the left! He seems to have been deceived all his life to think that this problem and many others were the direct result of communism taking over this region for 45 years. But no, it was the American war on Iraq, which is also responsible for the earthquakes, tropical storms and constipation I had last week. <br /> <br /> The film ignores the fact that 95% of the sex trade is women willing to sell their bodies for money and entry to the Western bloc. See also such stupid scenes that you want to tear your hair out. We have someone chasing a woman through the streets of London in broad daylight, beating her, then somehow dragging her unconscious body half a mile back to the apartment where she rapes her. No one sees him or calls the police, and the woman who runs does not bother to scream during the chase. Even better, later we will see 4-5 women deployed in central London in a daylight - very popular to be sold, one of them has a broken face and people are shopping in the background as if nothing is happening. You can't make this stupidity. <br /> <br /> I used to think that this garbage was exclusive to Hollywood, but apparently I was wrong.
