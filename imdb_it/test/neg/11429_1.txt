Ah, here it is! A film that people tell to remind me of the epic "Trainspotting". OUCH, I was crazy to believe it, and OUCH, how my buttocks hurt after I forced myself to watch this c ** p from beginning to end. After the first 10-15 minutes I just wanted it to finish, or at least they could put some nudity or action or a nice acid house music to make it worth the time ... But no, when I'm done with it, I put it on my shelf of the CD and I hope I will not have to take it again just to show it to a friend who is so anxious to see him that he doesn't want to hear my warnings.
