I looked at Netflix Instant this month and left a review there. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you, most of the other reviews are very accurate. This film was bad writing, bad acting and bad direction. I too, Russell and Pare liked me "in the old days" and I was very confident for them. In my review on Netflix, I said that I lost interest in the film and proceeded to wash the dishes and make a sandwich, continuing to watch the film from the kitchen. When I returned to the living room, I was very confused as the last 5 minutes of the film took place. I also rewound it to make sure I didn't miss anything. This film has been totally criticized for making a "twist" ending. I suspect the idea sounded good, maybe the script was intriguing, but the budget was so non-existent that the sets were really lacking. And yes, I suppose all those "bad sets" were an effort to give the viewer an idea. Everything I've been told is "reduced budget". <br /> <br /> However, the reason I came here was because over the weekend I saw a review of Shutter Island, and with what the reviewers were saying, or not saying, lead me to believe that Shutter Island is the same deal, only with a budget of 50 to 60 times more! (Actually I have no idea how much Dark World costs, but I hope they haven't spent more than 1 million!) <br /> <br /> So having said that, I thought that if someone reworked the script a little, has a bigger budget for a better "look" (if that meant a better set designer, or better post-coloring, just someone with a vision,) they could redo Dark World into a passable product. Now it looks like Shutter Island is doing it. It looks like they had the right vision, but the scripts could still be turned off. Money can't buy everything, but in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> PS My 2 star rating is for Russell and Pare.
