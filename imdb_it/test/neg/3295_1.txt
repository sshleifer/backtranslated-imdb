WHAT WAS THINKING?!?!?! That sad talented actor like Michael Rapaport - who stole our hearts in "Mighty Aphrodite" and fascinated us in "Ill Town" - sank to this pathetic level. The writing on this sitcom is the crust left on the bottom of the barrel after it has been scraped. Too bad for everyone involved. There is a tendency: the great film actors who are no longer hot products turn to TV - often with disastrous results (they refer to the stinkaroos on CBS and NBC, however, the ABC has a success with "Boston Legal" - writing fashionable and great nostalgic use of Bill Shatner). Wasting Michael Rapaport in this "All In The Family" scam is an insult to viewers and especially to Michael himself.
