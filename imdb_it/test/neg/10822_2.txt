A mixed group of "experts" (explorers, divers and scientists) venture a mile underground and travel another 2.4 miles underwater to an even more remote point, where they find salamanders, giant albinos (??) and some big razor teeth, winged and computer-generated creatures lurking. The cave is isolated by a landslide and then the monsters attack and start killing everyone as they search for an exit. And that's all he wrote with this low-aim effort that he can't even combine action, science fiction and horror on the most basic of levels. Imagine if someone had given the people of the Sci-Fi Channel $ 30 million to make a monster movie. This is exactly what THE CAVE is; almost surprising in its ineptitude, at times, full of clichés and almost entirely dependent on the special effects to be entertained. The only difference is that they had more money to build sets, more money to clean up monsters and more money to hire seemingly professional actors who still give horrible performances. Otherwise, it's as usual. Some of these films are still fun to watch. This is not and there are many reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1.) It takes itself too seriously and has no sense of humor. So you get a completely unoriginal and predictable movie that doesn't even recognize how original and predictable it is. <br /> <br /> 2.) The opening sequence has no purpose other than killing a few minutes and adding to redundancy. <br /> <br /> 3.) The non-original CGI creatures do not impress anyone in this day and age. <br /> <br /> 4.) The use of the shakycam and quick editing for your horror scenes is simply a lazy and unimaginative film production. And why further obscure the action by making things too dark and adding annoying distractions, such as fire and the explosion of bubbles? It makes these scenes not only difficult to see, but also impossible to appreciate even without a level of action. <br /> <br /> 5.) Even if you want to take yourself seriously, the script is full of clichés, the dialogue is horrible and there is no attempt at characterization. The casting of 25-year-old characters in roles as brilliant scientists and veteran explorers could provide some pleasure for the eyes but it completely kills the credibility of a film that would otherwise go completely straight. Sorry, you can't have it both ways. <br /> <br /> 6.) There were two exceptions to the model rule, as they decided to throw an old and a normal-looking Joe. These were the first two characters killed. <br /> <br /> 7.) For a bit of diversity, they also squeezed a black and a Chinese boy. Oddly, neither of them has more voice in this film and practically remains in the background while Whitey discusses what their next move will be. To insult. <br /> <br /> 8.) Also, how many films must be made where a black character sacrifices his life just at the end just to make sure that the warm white head and the warm white cord come together in the end? Ugh. Give me a break already. <br /> <br /> 9.) Much of the acting was HORRIBLE. Cole Hauser's performance was completely ridiculous. The other male protagonist seemed to have just emerged from the set of a Soap Opera and walked away using the patented "smile-does-all-women-fainting" technique, which is the PG-13 kind of switch equivalent to mine - technique of big-breasts-do-all-kids-fainting often used by women in R-rated movies. In any case, his performance was completely quoted. Daniel Dae Kim (from the TV series "Lost") and Piper Perabo also teased the room with their trimmed and monotonous line. <br /> <br /> 10.) the end of a joke? Absolutely terrible. Please, God, we don't need a sequel to this junk. <br /> <br /> So basically I wouldn't worry about it, unless you've ever seen a monster movie before or if you're just desperate and the only other thing is "The Simple Life". The sets were good, the blued photography is OK and some of the actors (Lena Headey, Marcel Iures ...) did their best, so I decided to increase the rating by one level to a "2".
