This film is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life! I waste my time on this. I watched this movie completely as I took a punishment for myself. I wonder how Suneel Darshan could make a film like that? it has no continence. It looks like he just shot the scenes and then joined them in some editing software !!! The music is obviously good but the film doesn't need so many unwanted songs. Kangana Ranaut looks fake and I wonder what role does Celina Jaietly play in the film? Bobby deol is good. at least he can act! Upen Patel needs to take some acting lessons rather than taking off his shirts in almost every scene! The end was the most pathetic! <br /> I saw Shakalaka Boom Boom after seeing "300" (the movie), you guys can really imagine how I felt about this Bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> I really respect Bollywood but please directors and producers, be real, not everything is fantasy!
