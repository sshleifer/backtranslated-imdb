Despite John Travolta's statements in interviews that this was his favorite role in his career, "Be Cool" turns out to be a disappointing sequel to the witty and intelligent "Get Shorty" from 1995. <br /> <br /> Travolta offers quite pleasant performances in this pleasantly amusing film, but in the end the film falls apart due to an underdeveloped plot, unlikely characters and a surprising lack of chemistry between lead Travolta and Uma Thurman. Although there are some laughs, this example of invalid dialogue (which often appeared in trailers) says it all: Thurman: Dance? Travolta: Hey, I'm from Brooklyn. <br /> <br /> The film suggests that anyone in the entertainment world is a gangster or aspires to be, comparing it to organized crime. In "Get Shorty", the premise of a "becoming legitimate" gangster entering the movies was a clever idea of ​​water, but in "Be Cool", it seems that the biz has completely gone wrong since then. /> <br /> The film is interesting and the absolute highlight is a "monolingual" delivered by The Rock, whose character is an aspiring actor as well as a goon, where he reconstructs a scene between Gabrielle Union and Kirsten Dunst from "Take it . " Vince Vaughan's character thinks he is black and often sees himself dressed as a pimp - this was pretty funny in the first scene that introduces him and gets tired and embarrassed almost immediately afterwards. <br /> <br /> In general, "Be Cool" can be worth a rental for John Travolta that dies hard (of which there are only one), but you may want to keep your finger near the fast forward button to pass it without feeling that you have lost too much time. Fans of "Get Shorty" might actually want to avoid it, as the sequel lacks many things that made it a winner. I consider this a very tough 4/10 film.
