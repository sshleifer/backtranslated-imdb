The only reason why this show didn't get a 0 is because one is not available. This show has gone from informative news to sensationalized claptones. I tried to support this show in its decline, because I like stories of human interest and Primetime had some very good ones. Unfortunately, April 21 has forever changed my mind about this show and the unethical journalists who participate in it. ABC actually recorded a brutal case of child abuse and then refused to show it until the limitation period was over and the parents could not be arrested for the charges they faced. What made it worse was the way the ABC swept the whole incident under the carpet; instead of taking charge and seeking real professional help for these disturbed individuals, they had some pop psychologists who sent severe warnings to the AUDIENCE about how not to judge these poor angels too severely. I was really disgusted. I hope this review prevents a person from looking at this investigative junk in the future. If he does, I'll be happy. These days, all that can be expected of Diane Sawyer and the good people of Primetime Live are kissing sessions with A-list celebrities and criminal acts covered and praised by the stars. Don't waste the hour of your life; you'd be better off watching an old sitcom on Nick at Nite.
