A lack of character development proves fatal for this film. The character of Valeria Golino, Grazia, appears as a bipolar personality but quickly degenerates into a caricature and seems unreal. The other characters are thin, probably the writer's fault is not the actors. The only exception is Filippo Pucillo as the younger son Filippo: his energy and bravado are amusing and convincing. I suppose the petty cruelty of children contributes to creating an atmosphere of squalor and emphasizes the pervasive primordial spirits in the city, but for me, gratuitous cruelty is redundant and contributes to the film's general boredom. Some scenes were fun but not necessarily meant that way, for example, when abused dogs turn out to be fat and healthy and seem ready to be shown. The beautiful cast and the setting make for a captivating trailer but they can't bring the whole film.
