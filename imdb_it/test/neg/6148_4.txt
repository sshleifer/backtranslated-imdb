My overall impression of this film is that it was a slow, exhausting, without structure, wandering through some of the truly unpleasant situations of the world with a little redemption and an obvious message. The film is mostly composed of uninteresting video footage of the countries he visits with some bad re-enactments, all slow to the snails' rhythm and superimposed on depressing music. Certainly some of the materials and interviews contain compelling stories, but unlike what the description on the back suggests, it is not so much the story of the victim being told as that of the director, Mr. Ripper, and he doesn't say it well. This film could have included longer and better interviews with the people themselves, allowing them to tell their stories. Instead Mr. Ripper indulgently draws the story towards himself making it a sort of personal journey, and unfortunately it does not end up being one. I never really had the feeling of growth while exploring the subject, and he never said what about the subject involved him in the first place. He drags us from one place to another, lightly touches the situation and the characters, is hung up to show too many slow motion footage of people walking in the streets, and then move on to his next destination. It does it over, and again and again without any real development. I had the feeling that this film could have been reduced to 45 minutes, but was lengthened to close at a tremendously slow 2 hours. We feel morally obligated to worry about the subject, but the self-indulgent, tortuous delivery, without inspiration from his journey by the director makes you become numb after a while.
