This terrifying piece of tripe was (conveniently) freely inspired by a true story involving two family members (played by Jack Thompson and Jacqueline Mackenzie). <br /> <br /> This film is offensive; besides the fact that it was not a good film anyway, it does not capture in any way what it was like to lose such a narrow member of the family and completely omits those who were really affected by the tragedy of real life. <br /> <br /> As for the director; he managed to cash a family's misfortune for the price of a Porsche. <br /> <br /> If I could have given a zero, I'd do it. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
