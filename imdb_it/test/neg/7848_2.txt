This must be one of the worst films of MGM and FRANK SINATRAS. A strange musical comedy that fails in almost every respect. The silly plot has SINATRA trying to carry on the reputation of its fathers as KISS. He is not a bandit and he does not kiss !! He plays the "nerd" character as one might expect given the dialogue he has to speak. The stage thieves are J. CARROLL NASH and MILDRED NATWICK. Too bad they didn't have scenes together anymore. I gave the film two stars because the sets and costumes are superior and one of the songs sung by KATHTREN GRAYSON "Love is Where You Find It" is sensational. He may have had a shot of that. Also, a comic dance number by RIDCARDO MANTALBAN, CYD CHARISSE and ANN MILLER if funny. Therefore, for these reasons and only for these reasons, it is watchable. KISSING BANDIT is part of the collection of the early years of Frank Sinatra.
