OK, just what does all this mean? Halloween 6 (let's call it that, OK?) It is, without a doubt, the most CONFUSED film in the series (and from what I've heard, seeing the original "cut producers" doesn't sound like doing something less baffling than the "official" version) . What a mess. <br /> <br /> This is not a really bad film, as some have said. He has his scary scenes and some pretty intense moments - just DON'T DO SENSE! Don't tell me that Michael was "engineered" from the beginning to be bad, kill and destroy, and bla bla bla. It was bad enough when they turned Michael into Jamie Lee Curtis's brother (just so they had an excuse to keep it in the second movie) - that's too much. <br /> <br /> It would seem that this is another case of the creators of the film trying to be "too intelligent" by presenting a new premise that will amaze and impress all of us. Bad move, guys. We're not looking for an explanation of why Michael kills, so please don't try to feed us this shit. Show me Michael who looks threatening and kills a group of people. Show me Dr. Loomis trying to track him down and, as always, he is getting close. Don't waste (what turned out to be) the last performance of Donald Pleasance telling me (in the most confused way possible) that Michael was "created" by some cult from hell and that his "seed" be passed on to another and ... oh, brother. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 has its moments, don't get me wrong, and we all know that there have been worse sequels than this (Hellraiser, anyone?) so take what you can do (the scene towards the end of the film with Michael charging along a deep red corridor is particularly effective) and tries to ignore the plot. We hope that one day we can all see the "producer cut" and maybe have the chance to give (a little) more meaning to all this. Until then, this will have to do ... <br /> <br /> -FTM
