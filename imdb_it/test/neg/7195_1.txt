This appeared on a DVD bought by a friend of mine. They had listed it as "The Savage Guns" which was a completely different film. Obviously the people who made the DVD never bothered to see what they were burning on the disc. <br /> <br /> However, this film is worse than it is. The soundtrack is a combination of Batman TV / Early James Bond / Spaghetti western. A lot of gallop around this music. It seems that the boy has to gallop between the scenes to burn some time and give the people of the sound something to do. <br /> <br /> English is nicknamed on Italian and really shows. I wish it had been just a little worse and then he would have had some of the campy feeling of Ed Wood's movies. As it is, it's just awful.
