I'm in a movie club in my school and I was forced to sit down and watch this film, which was absolutely sad. The film's story is not sad, but the whole film is extremely sad. The acting was absolutely terrible. The children were overly plaintive. A metal pole could have done a better job. I wanted desperately to sleep, but since the television was so loud, I was kept away from peace. The monkeys are neither nice nor funny. The drama is ridiculous. I can't remember when I saw a more terrible movie. The story is weak, subtle, predictable and completely false. Adults try to be good actors, but fail to overcome stereotypes. The girl even seems to want to leave the film falling from a hill during the movie to leave it, I don't blame her. Michael Anderson should apologize publicly for this film. Not just for me, but for everyone else who was forced to sit in this horrible movie. In fact, I apologize to you. Although I have nothing to do with this project, I apologize for this film, because this means that at least someone will do it. This film surpasses even the sadness of the Rob Schneider and Cheetah Girls films. I would even say that it is even worse than the Hilary Duff film collection, but that is pushing it. Please do not watch this movie, otherwise you will be prompted to write a review similar to this one about how horrible this movie is. I'm so sorry.
