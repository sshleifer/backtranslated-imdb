It is hard to believe that Oprah Winfrey produced this piece of junk, the show could not even hold a candle for cooking programs of the past, including emeril lagasse, rachael ray is the most annoying talk show and kitchen host in history of TV, not since ainsley harriott had a terrible show cooking host that I saw, at least ainsley harriott has good times and a certain style, this has no style, it's terrible as a guest, the kitchen looks atrocious, the writing is horrible, the teleplay is exaggerated and the opening credits are so bad that it makes me sick. Now I like cooking shows that have a strong sense of style, but this has absolutely nothing like that <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst TV shows of the year.
