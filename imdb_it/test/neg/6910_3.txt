This series does not present the British vision of the revolutionary war, as well as an anti-American vision of it. The common thread of the series is that the silent majority of the settlers enjoyed British rule; that the founding fathers were manipulative intrigues whose sole purpose was to drag Britain into a violent civil war; that the American supporters of the revolution and the militia were violent racists, deceived in the struggle. Clearly, the author's intent, Richard Holmes, is that the viewer extrapolates these characteristics, in a straight line, from the American population of 1775 to the present. <br /> <br /> For example, in the episode "The Shot Heard Around the World" Holmes drags a dark print of the Boston massacre, in which he claims that the skin of Crispus Attucks, a black man and the first man killed in the revolution, was deliberately "crushed". Holmes claims that portraying Attucks as a black man would have been bad propaganda for the revolutionary cause. Holmes never reveals how he knows it. And there's more. Holmes dwells on working in a single, unsupported atrocity: the desecration of the body of a British soldier. He compares the American militia to the Viet Cong and the Mujahadeen - without mentioning any difference in the objectives of these groups. The list goes on. <br /> <br /> Presumably, this series was made in response to "The Patriot" by Mel Gibson. He says a lot when an academic feels the need to respond to Mel Gibson on any topic. Instead of presenting the British point of view, it seems that Holmes really wanted to give a sensationalist and anti-American vision and, in the process, he became the Roger Corman of historians - strictly third class.
