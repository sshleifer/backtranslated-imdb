Similar plot, made many times before, and this was not an improvement. <br /> <br /> 15 minutes in this, and you should be able to turn it off - the ending was deja vu all over again. <br /> <br /> The only moral I could see from this is: - stupidity + criminals do not equal success - if he cheated you before, he will do it again
