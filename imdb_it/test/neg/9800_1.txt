Once upon a time, in the 1940s, an actress named Veronica Lake. A beautiful and talented young woman who was once in great demand for many big-budget Hollywood photos. Fast forward towards the end of the 60s, age, alcoholism and all-round misfortune clouded everyone's favorite actress. Now that it's happened, Miss Lake decides it's time to follow in the footsteps of her peers (?), Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, and resort to good old Horror. But Flesh Feast? Really? It couldn't have been so washed. To put it mildly, Flesh Feast is a pile of lifeless garbage, perhaps one of the first 5 worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen them all. Lake plays a scientist, who is plotting, with the Nazis, to bring Hitler back to life, with youthful restoration experiments involving worms, exactly, worms. Unless you're a huge Heather Hughes fan, run away and never look back !! <br /> <br /> I know very little about this person from Veronica Lake, as well as the films of the 1940s, but to think that such a successful career has become so sad is actually quite sad. Flesh Feast is almost impossible to overcome and, almost, I mean absolutely. Directed by Brad Grinter, director of Nudist Camp films, and the man who, by coincidence, gave us the biggest B-movie ever made, Blood Freak, just a couple of years later. One must ask, is this what Blood Freak would have been if Grinter had not co-directed with Steve Hawkes? If so, then God bless Steve Hawkes. You would not think that a religious woman, thirsty for drug blood, the Monster of Turkey could be THAT much better than the experiments involving Maggots and Hitler, but it really is, really. So forget that you have never heard of this and are looking for Blood Freak, it's just waiting to entertain you. Fast forward a couple of years later, Veronica Lake dies of Hepititas, breaks and forgets. The end. I hate you, Flesh Feast. 1/10
