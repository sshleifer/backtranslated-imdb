I saw him last night at Sundance. Altman must be the most struck or missed note manager ever. This show, despite its "stellar power" is absolutely unconvincing, and its political insights - which I as a proud liberal do not disagree at all - are superficial and clumsy, and seem to be torn from USA Today titles despite the that is coming out of the mouth of someone as esteemed as Mario Cuomo. The drama, as such, is not very dramatic, and the play is not funny. The only points of interest, in reality, are to see how the New Yorkers live and the loyalty of a cast and crew to put together a show that continues to insist, has had a cult following since 1988. Sometimes it seems that Altman's only contribution to the cinema was the art of making all your actors talk simultaneously, whose effect is depressing as if they were strangers to a marriage.
