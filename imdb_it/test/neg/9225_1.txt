If there's anything worse than this movie, I don't want to see it. I remember so many incredible things - a nun abandoned by a coffin to make a raft for a blond boy; the little blond boy himself worshiped as a god; lots of Peru repertoire material as an ideal vacation spot. Shining Path and Alberto Fujimori should sweep away any idea that Peru is a vacation paradise. The whole thing is so terrible that Plan 9 or even Robot Monster is an aesthetic treatment in comparison. This film should be bombed, bombed and bombed again.
