I know it's not original, but which one? What else can you say about it? I feel hopelessly stupid not to pay any attention to "From Hell It Came". The film makes important the political and social topic of the repercussions of atmospheric atomic tests for jokes and dismissals, not for the concern and the alarm raised by scientists around the world at that time.
