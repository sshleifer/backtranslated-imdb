"The Racketeer" plays Carol (private of the "and" which usually appears at the end of his name) Lombard as a woman thrown out of society because he left her husband for a violinist (Roland Drew) who has since become a run-down alcoholic and torn between his love for him and the interest of New York crime boss Robert Armstrong (top-billed). It is practically a compendium of what was wrong with the first talkies: the rigid direction, the motionless cameras, the untimely acting and the ridiculously slow delivery of the lines. At the time the sound crew were telling the directors to make their actors talk every s-l-o-w-l-y line and not to start talking their own line until the previous actor had finished their line. Done about five years later, this may have been an interesting film, but director Howard Higgin faithfully follows the dictates of his tape recorder and systematically subtracts the talents that Lombard and Armstrong learned from watching their subsequent films. "The Racketeer" was created in 1929, a year that despite the problems of transition from silence to sound gave us anyway some legitimate masterpieces ?? Vidor "Hallelujah!", "Applause" by Mamoulian, "The infernal heroes of Wyler", "Ladies of Leisure" by Capra ?? all from filmmakers with strong enough wills to tell dictators of the soundboard to be piling up and let their actors speak and act naturally. Too bad that Howard Higgin was not so strong; as it is, looking at a natural-paced actor like Armstrong beating the part in the ridiculous way he was told to speak, you can't help but wonder where that 50-foot gorilla is when Armstrong needs him.
