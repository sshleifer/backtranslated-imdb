Simply put, I was incredibly disappointed. I'm a big fan of Asian Horror, and I can observe non-originality (I myself liked "The Red Shoes" and "Phone"), but this was just scarce. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of very high quality elements: the photography is captivating, the images are beautiful, the direction is inspired, the acting is pretty good, the music is easy to the ears and the CGI is incredible. But since it's a horror movie, it's expected to be scared, which won't happen with this movie. As with most of the horrors of South Korea, this is hardly original from beginning to end: there is the trademark of vengeful long-haired ghosts, menacing clumps of black hair and water wells, and near in the end, a twist that * almost *, but not quite makes sense out of the whole (the turning point is easily one of the best qualities). And because of the viewer's irritation, when the film is not recycling (sometimes, so exactly that it can be easily plagiarized) the images of other films, it is making you jump. A lot. And with the jumps, I don't mean that things jump out or something, only VERY loud noises and shrieks in the soundtrack used to blow the audience to a height of two meters (there are also some "skipped" moments that are simply exasperating) . And when you don't tear away other films, it's boring and hard to seduce. <br /> <br /> And it is a pity, because "Ryeong" could easily have been really good, and it has everything to do is good, but it is the annoying excessive use of loud and predictable noises and sudden discharges that eventually ruin the film. A perfect example of what would have been beautiful: there is a moment when one of the characters outside is looking at a corpse, and without a sound, the corpse looks back. It's completely predictable, but the use of silence in that scene is brilliant. And unfortunately, it's as scary as the movie was for me. <br /> <br /> Of course, "Ryeong" has some good features, and even a couple of jumps that are not predictable and work. There is a very good and sad background used to explain the events, and the turning point is rather unpredictable. Those are the only things that separate the movie from any other Asian ghost / horror movie. But the problem with these is, even if they work, they have been used before (J-Horror fans will easily realize that the great revelation was inspired by "A tale of two sisters"), and brings back a good fifty minutes to go on. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, "Ryong" really looks like a really wasted opportunity. Tae-kyeong Kim hoped that the twist and other good features acted as diversions, so the public won't notice the huge flaws. But he failed, and well ... We noticed everything. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10.
