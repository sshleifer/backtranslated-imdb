Cates is insipid and unconvincing, Kline behaves as always, as does Lithgow while slaughtering an English accent (at least, I assume that's what he's trying), and the tone wobbles uncomfortably between farce and corny. As with most pet projects that show a couple of celebrities, it's a relief when this shoddy piece stops at its forced and jarring conclusion.
