A friend of mine showed me this movie yesterday, and I was really surprised that someone could make such a terrible movie! <br /> <br /> Mix the most horrible and obvious dialect, with the most wooden acting you've ever seen, with the most cheerful special effects I know for man, and get this magnificent beast! <br /> <br /> 'Vampire Assassins' is more fun than most of the comedies I've seen, it's really horrible! <br /> <br /> I was in points during the scene where the former murderer cop / vampire has a coffee with the internet journalist. Watch it and see what I mean! <br /> <br /> I honestly cannot believe that anyone has done this with serious intentions. <br /> <br /> Tragic, but a good laugh. It must be seen to be believed.
