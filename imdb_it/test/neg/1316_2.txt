At first glance this film looked like it was really beautiful - it is not. <br /> <br /> The cast is pretty good, but most of them seem embarrassed by the whole thing. The real disaster in this film is not the flood, but the script. Try to include all the clich√©s in the book, all incredibly bad. The finish is very abrupt, but this is a blessing in disguise. Congratulations if you do it so far. <br /> <br /> All three major male players (Carlyle, Courtney and Suchet) would surely agree that this is the low point of their career. I hope a lot of money was paid, because none of their reputations came out with tact. <br /> <br /> The special effects are pretty good, but the same thing was done with a much better effect on The Day After Tomorrow. <br /> <br /> In short, a useless exercise. Do not waste time.
