I felt I had to add a comment after seeing the breath of the other comment. I was led to watch this film as a child by my unwitting parents, expecting a normal Norman Wisdom comedy. Instead, what you get is this insipid English sex comedy of the worst kind in which Norman (Norman!) Plays a player who aims to come down with as many "birds" as possible. Absolutely typical of the genre - poorly filmed and played, no semblance of a screenplay beyond the worst kind of double meaning, and very vague hints of "nastiness". And all apparently in that special grainy film that is reserved for British low budget films of the 60s and 70s. The only memorable thing is the annoyingly catchy theme tune, which still comes to my mind after 30 years. <br /> <br /> Finally, in the last scene, see also naked Norman - run through the sand and look frozen. I think anyway - at that point my mother dragged me out of the cinema. I saw it again, many years later, and guess what, it was still terrible. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan or are interested in the little man and his career, you will apply the '10 foot rule based on bargepole to this. Believe me, you don't need to see the back side of Norman Wisdom.
