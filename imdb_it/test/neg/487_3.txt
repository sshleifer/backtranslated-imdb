I didn't expect a classic, but at least a funny movie. There were only a few scenes that make you laugh but nothing more. It doesn't scare you it is full of clich√©s from an American teenager and you can guess what will happen easily. <br /> <br /> But it tells a lot about a senior student in a Turkish high school. Pressure of the Student Selection Exam (OSS) that the 3 hour exam determines which university you will be thinking about the exam when a ghost is after you are not exaggerated. The film is bad. Don't waste time looking at it.
