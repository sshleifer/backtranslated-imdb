what a bad movie, it took me 3 times to finish it. The thing I didn't like most was the sense of childish humor. jokes made by a 10-year-old child. not funny. actually quite annoying, for example when the detective can't find a place at the bar he screams "she's taking it all away" and then everyone runs "fast bow". so stupid. and also a guy sitting at the bar smashing fruit to solve his post traumatic stress disorder. the bar! and the bartender is giving him more and more fresh fruit. should this be fun? and I mean ... I love the good gore movies of exploitation and I've seen a lot of terrible movies, but his is just plain ugly. and even the "gore" is not so exciting. don't worry I wouldn't recommend it
