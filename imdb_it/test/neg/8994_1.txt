Ram Gopal Verma usually makes such a sharp formula, raised by a Hollywood movie. Every film of hers after Shiva is in the cookie genre. Occasionally, it makes a really horrible film like this. <br /> <br /> For the first 55 minutes, we are introduced to the only 2 characters, a struggling gymnast who masquerades as a good dancer (go figure!) and an aspiring actor who tries to get rich in Bollywood. They fall in love, zero becomes a hero, dancer / gymnast does not break, gymnastics, anguish, the usual heartbreak, more gymnastics, anguish, singing, dancing, anxiety, a bit of gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it, you are fast asleep. And this despite the HOT SEXY HOT SEXY HOT HOT of the most important dancer lady-cum-gymnast. <br /> <br /> But hey, you're not alone !! The editor, director, photographer, in fact the entire cast and crew are asleep throughout the production. The only difference is that they were paid to doze while you paid the money for this shit, so you lose. Ah, the joke is on you. Don't feel sorry for yourself, but our poor brother broke up every day in his luxury penthouse in the sexiest of leotards and gym clothes. Puh-leese, when the poor get a break, is she STARR-VINNNG?! <br /> <br /> Antara Mali cannot act. RGV has lost its marbles. Abhishek tried, but failed. No plot No story Nothing. He must have generously paid RGV to make this nonsense stuff in addition to the free gym classes on his launch couch. What a super deal. No need for an acting career. <br /> <br /> Such absolute garbage can only be "Made in Bollywood", of course!
