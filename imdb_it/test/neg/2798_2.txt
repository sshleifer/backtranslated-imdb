Dark Harvest is about a group of friends going to a farm (it belongs to one of their friends' relatives or something) for a vacation. But there are assassin scarecrows lurking there (there was also something about a curse in there but I forgot what it was. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is horrible, I don't know what the director I was thinking when he chose actors and actresses The script is the same story as the "horrible" acting (this coming statement is very obvious but ..) if there was a better acting and a better script this could have been "okay" . <br /> <br /> Even the directing brat, I don't see any potential in the future of this guy. After all these negative aspects, this movie still maintains a "funny" factor that leads him to two. is that they don't use CGI! My general thought about this movie is that it's ugly, really bad, but so bad it's "funny", so it gets a 2/10
