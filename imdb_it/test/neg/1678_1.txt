Ok, I can watch almost all the movies, and I tend to give my best to Sci Fi Originals, but in this movie there was a big flaw that forced me to turn it off for half an hour. <Br /> <br /> After serving in the US Army, there are some expectations in a film including the military one. At least some semblance of attention to the right military rank, uniform and terminology is necessary if a spectator is expected to actually enjoy the experience. "Bats: Human Harvest" had characters who wore the rank that was in the wrong direction on the lapel and, later in the movie, the time was listed as 11:00 am, but it was full dark outside. Although the script was perfectly executed, and the dialogue spectacular, and the acting worthy of an Oscar, if the people who make the film don't care enough about the film to even worry about finding the right way to show military time, why should anyone Does he bother trying to watch it?
