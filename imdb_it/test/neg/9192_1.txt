One of the worst movies ever made. Let's start with the superficial: Joaquin Phoenix is, first of all, too fat to be a novice firefighter. The NYFD does not recruit Pillsbury pastries. John Travolta has a bad dyeing job, and the strange glow in his eyes throughout the film made me think he was on some kind of extended Scientology bender. The plot hits all the clichés and clichés of what the average Joe believes a firefighter's life is really like: they all get drunk, they fight, they have difficulty expressing their emotions, their wives stay at home crying, everyone has problems with his father, everyone has a Boston accent, et cetera. A execrable piece of schwarmerei that plays our permanent cultural hero of the firemen after September 11th - which was, among other things, a valid cultural cult of the heroes. Unfortunately, this film has no credible heroes to worship.
