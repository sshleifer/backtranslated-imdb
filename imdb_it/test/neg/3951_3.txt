After the mysterious death of an old friend, a group of teenagers find themselves in possession of Stay Alive, a horror survival video game based on the gruesome story of Erzebet Bathory known as The Blood Countess. The group starts playing the gruesome game and soon they are killed one by one in the same way as the character they played in the game. As the line between the game world and reality disappears, our heroes must find a way to defeat the vicious bloody countess. "Stay Alive" is an incredibly poor teen slash movie, with no shred of suspense. Director and screenwriter William Brent Bell has no damn idea of ​​how to make a watchable horror film. The frightening leaps are irritating, the blood / blood level is almost non-existent and the story makes no sense. The dialogue is absolutely negative and the acting of all the parties involved is embarrassing. "Stay Alive" is easily one of the worst horror films of 2006. Stay away from this smelly asshole.
