Friend, it's so lousy. He does not deserve much in terms of comments, so to make it short, Rebecca DeMornay is a very disciplined police psychiatrist who falls in love with the Latin lover Antonio Banderas in a wine shop, he with a ponytail and prison tattoos. When it gets loose, it really loosens. Besides this torrid story he is having (and we must admit that the deal has its speed bumps) is a rather cold fish. His sick, ailing father shows up for the first time in years and she tires him. He's also adept at keeping his horny neighbor at bay upstairs (Dennis Miller). And there is the prisoner Harry Dean Stanton who is trying to maneuver her to give him a diagnosis of multiple personality disorder so that he won't have his family nailed to the wall for the serial murders he committed. <br /> <br /> All these people and perhaps more, are immediately suspicious when strange things start happening to you. Someone sends his dead flowers. Someone does unspeakable things to his domestic cat. (The next time I see a pet appear in a package or tied up in the closet or boiled in a pot, I'll vomit.) So, who does it? Guess. No power on earth could force me to reveal the end, but perhaps a suggestion will help: child abuse. <br /> <br /> The excuse of abuse is in itself an interesting, much more interesting affair than the film. What does "child abuse" mean? Do we mean sexual abuse? Physical? Both? How about banging a baby on your back with a wooden kitchen spoon, strong enough to break it? This is what happened to me and my brother when we were kids, just like things like all the other kids in the neighborhood. Sexual abuse? It never happened to any of us, as far as I know, although I'm not sure it would have been rejected with any degree of animation. In the Samoan village I studied for two years, there was a case of a teenage boy found playing sexually with a much younger girl. The girl's family beat him to hell. The boy's own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village, an exile that lasted two years. When he returned, the incident was forgotten by everyone, including the child. (By the way, the little girl we see here is less than five years old, so it's unlikely that Dad's night visits will be remembered anyway as long-term memory isn't really established until then.) DeMornay's experience which leads to his mental disorder can be called "the social construction of trauma". It's not there unless we put it there. Enough with the psychiatric lesson. They will be fifteen cents. <br /> <br /> Do you want a trauma? I'll give you a trauma. The film absolutely forces us to identify with the character of Rebecca DeMornay, from the beginning. Then, when he has his first date with Antonio Banderas, and Pio Donnagio's soundtrack pounds eroticism in our heads, the camera gives us a shot from above Antonio's bare-chested shoulder that crawls over us with his hairy chest. Now it's traumatic. Makes any spectator look like a male on the floor of the California Men's Colony laundry in San Luis Obispo. Do not get me wrong. I don't mind Antonio Banderas. It's just that I'm not in love with him. There are not enough naked shots of Rebecca DeMornay's body in the entire universe to compensate for this type of anxiety. <br /> <br /> Here's an engaging way to survive this movie. Instead of sitting there, try to choose the scenes shot in Toronto and separate them from those shot in Budapest. It's a challenge, really, and could, as far as we know, preserve your sanity.
