After seeing Stop-Loss, I find myself disappointed in Hollywood for making such a stinker. Gone are the glory days of the 1940s films that made them proud to be an American, fighting the wickedness that wants to conquer abroad and death at home. What remains is the dribbling that snaps at the mouth of rabid anti-Bush radicals. The story tells of three young people returning home from the war. He descends into madness out of control, which culminates in his death. The main protagonist deserted his country in a moment of war, and destroys his best relationship with his boyfriend at the same time. The third is really the hero of the story, who decided to continue the fight that was brought to our shores almost eight years ago. What makes this film negative is not acting, but the premise behind it. We are led to believe that decorated soldiers are actually enemies of our country. Desertion is similar to betrayal in wartime, and the main protagonist flirts with it throughout the film. This paradox is designed to weaken the public's reaction to the film's central act. We shouldn't find fault with King, since he wears medals, but his actions deserve not only to deserve them, but shout for it. He is not an antihero. To accept the film, the public must accept the correctness of the desertion because the story depicts King as nothing more than a hero. I cannot accept it, since it is like asking me to call the yellow sky on a clear day. Furthermore, the derision for the true hero is filled, the man who re-enacts and continues to serve his country. I would just like to recommend this stink to someone who needs to convince them of Hollywood's decadence, as it is a clear example. No wonder it went bad at the box office.
