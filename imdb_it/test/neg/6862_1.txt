I remember seeing this movie when I was about 10 years old, one of my friends had it. At the time it was just a movie, since I was about 10 years old and I thought of it as another action movie. <br /> <br /> When I look back like a real cinephile, this is a rather shocking film. I am sure that those who produced this film had a brief Hollywood career. Although the main actor seems to have made some films according to IMDb, even though I haven't seen any and I don't really remember too much. <br /> <br /> However, just to say that this film is really bad, in any way it could be. I'd like to see it again though: oD
