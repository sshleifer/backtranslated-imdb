There is no real story, the film looks more like a fly on the wall, a documentary film than a real movie, so this piece could itself be a spoiler. Teen drama on 3 young Singaporean boys (very similar to UK chav) playing at school, running with bands, fighting, insulting people on the street, tattooing, doing nothing, etc., they generally imagine themselves to be tough and occasionally shout provocative songs at the camera. MTV-style movie, fast cuts, crazy camera angles, close-up shots and animation interludes. The dialogue may have been sharper in the original languages ​​of Mandarin and Hokkien than in the subtitles and I have no doubt that some of the contemporary Singapore references will slip on Western heads as well as on the cultural and political context unless, of course, you are familiar with Singapore. This type of children's film could be the first in Singapore, but it has been done before and done better in other Western countries, La Haine (1995) for example.
