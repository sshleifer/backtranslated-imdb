The untold origin of the Lone Ranger. Show who he was and how and why he became the Ranger. <br /> <br /> Legendary bomb. The idea was not negative: to reinvent and present the Lone Ranger for the public of the 80s. Very well, there were problems. The study ordered Clayton Moore (the original Ranger) to stop appearing anywhere like the Lone Ranger. It led to a bad little battle that made headlines. I know people who refused to see the movie because of how Moore was treated. They also hired the clamorously inexperienced Klinton Spilsbury to play the Ranger. Spilsbury was very handsome and muscular but he had absolutely no charisma and could not act. Actually all his vocal performance was renamed by another actor! Even his off-screen antics (public drunkenness and beating people) didn't help things. Apart from acting, the script is boring and slow. Even the Ranger himself does not show up for an hour! There were some complaints at the time that the film was too violent for a PC. I don't think it was that bad, though. <br /> <br /> There are some (very few) things done right here - the photography was really beautiful; Michael Horse was excellent as Tonto; Christopher Lloyd is very funny as the villain and when the Lone Ranger finally shows up (with William Tell Overture booming from the soundtrack) it's really fun. But all in all, this is a boring and terrible attempt to bring back the Lone Ranger. It is easy to understand why this bombed. A 4 - mainly for photography.
