This is the sad story of the relationship between two unlikely people, one of whom is married to another person. It ranks first on my list of the most boring movies ever, and I'm a romantic fan. My husband gave up after the first hour of his three, a time when little had happened. The desert scenery is spectacular, with endless sand and the sun on Katharine's golden hair. However, cinematography does not make a brilliant film, unless it is a National Geographic travel journal. The magnificent Saharan scenery in this ill-conceived story is like putting a perfume on a pig. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a cursed and burned pilot named Conte Laszlo de Almasy, who is left in the care of a Canadian army nurse, Hana, during the Second World War in Italy. It seems that he remembers little of his life but through a book in his possession, his story is revealed VERY SLOWLY, with the help of a man of his past named Caravaggio, who mysteriously appears in his deathbed. Almasy was a Hungarian cartographer employed by the Royal Geographical Society to trace the Sahara desert. He entered into a relationship with his wife, Katherine, of another explorer who turned out to be a British spy. Meanwhile, the Laszlo nurse has a relationship with a Sikh surnamed Kip, who is involved in the dangerous job of disarming mines. <br /> <br /> My arguments with this film are many, long and tedious for beginners. I don't blame acting in particular, it's just not a good story. Caravaggio seems pointless, his connection with Almasy is flawed. It provides a scene of torture, but seems to serve no essential purpose in the film. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the two parts of this story, Almasy and Katharine, are sadly nasty, superficial and boring characters. They are simply not very nice, so there is no one to cheer for. Almasy is cold, aloof, haughty and ultimately disgustingly possessive of another man's wife. Likewise, Katharine is detached and wicked, not to mention the deplorable lack of guilt or any feelings for her imperfect but loving husband ... besides managing a tiny tear of the corner of her eye when she dies. <br /> <br /> This is a story of LUST rather than love, with pearls like "I can still taste you". Almasy ridiculously ridicules a colleague of his erotic obsession with the indentation in the neck of his beloved, certainly more indicative of a focus on Katharine's body. The victim of this unrepentant adulterer is the unfortunate husband, Geoffrey, who is treated as little more than an unpleasant nuisance. It's all rather sordid and disgusting, Katharine's feeling charade faint so that these lovers can devote themselves to their much vaunted unbridled passion, all as Silent Night is sung in the background. I'm not sure if the intent was to counteract the purity of the song with their selfish lust, but I was certainly not affected by the sacrilegious tone. We have a complete frontal nudity with Katharine, but their sex scenes are cold, selfish, lustful and sometimes even hateful ... not hot, loving, generous or even really passionate. If one of these two feels an emotion for the other, he is totally selfish and certainly NOT love, as I define the word. <br /> <br /> The return of Almasy to the Cave of Swimmers to recover the body of his beloved is artificial rather than moving. Katharine must have expired only moments before while showing excellent colors and she looks like she has just fallen asleep, not at all like a corpse. Of course this is all for a dramatic effect, since the romantics who watch this story (normally I would be one of them) would not appreciate a putrefied and rotten corpse. To recover the body of his adulterous lover, he betrayed his companions and allies by giving his maps to the Nazis, the British who were cast as the villains of the piece. Regardless of whether or not he keeps his final promise to Katharine, his treacherous act is not something I greatly admire. <br /> <br /> Kip looks like a nice guy and Hana is generally nice, but their love story is not at all appealing, but only a brief adventure in time of war with the parts that indicate a small trauma to the time of separation. Moving back and forth between the two scenarios (past in the Sahara desert and in present Italy) turned out to be distracted and unpleasant, but in reality both stories were as boring as rainwater. The only spark of interest in the entire film was the disarming scene of my Kip mine. <br /> <br /> Not being totally heartless, I had some sympathy for the current state of Almasy badly burned and dying. However, perhaps my biggest complaint with this film is euthanasia in the end, when Hana obliges her patient by giving him an overdose of morphine. We should think that this is justified and morally acceptable because obviously he has affection for Almasy, he cries as he prepares the deadly syringe and reads aloud his alleged book of Herodotus to console him while he is dying. <br /> <br /> The fantastic masterpieces of director David Lean should not be insulted with respect to this pathetic and immoral story. Yes, Lawrence of Arabia also has a desert, but in the Lean movies (Dr. Zhivago, Brief Encounter), those involved in business are sympathetic characters who exhibit admirable restraint, guilt and some consideration for the betrayed spouse, in as opposed to the total self-absorption of this couple. In Ryan's Daughter, the cuckold husband shows moving loyalty and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> This film is an allegedly vastly overrated, somewhat boring and disgusting intellectual, who unfortunately passes himself off as a great love story. His Oscar for best film does not speak well for the Academy. For those who wonder why people are so tough in this film, the answer is simple. It's horrible.
