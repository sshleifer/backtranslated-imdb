Ok, your hippies are probably wondering what I have against an "educational" and "informative" show like "Barney"? Well, I have a lot of hatred against it for these reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. It teaches that having a personality and an individualism is immoral. No one on the show has a personality. They all dress the same way, talk the same way, behave the same way and dance the same way. Even in the episode called "Being an individual", children try to tell Barney what they want and EVERYONE on the planet should do what I like. Do you want to teach your child that being an individual is wrong? <br /> <br /> 2. Episode "A stranger is a friend, you have not met". Although apparently harmless, the producers of the show soon realized that it could also be extremely dangerous for small children. In fact, many young Barney lovers from all over the United States have been victims of pedophiles, who used the friendly message of the show to lure children away from their parents. The episode has been pulled since then, but the damage had been done. The so-called "innocent" programming mistakes, like this one, clearly show why parents have to watch television with their children. <br /> <br /> 3. IF you are not happy all the time, you are a bad person. No one seems to show other emotions than happiness, regardless of the situation in which they find themselves. If the child's parents go crazy or sad for some reason, the child might think of mom or dad differently. It is not a good message at all. <br /> <br /> 4. Magic solves everything! It seems that every problem is solved with magic. At least in shows like "Fraggle Rock", it teaches us that magic can backfire on it is better to solve problems on your own. Does Barney teach it? No of course not. There must be magic in there. And the problem is that many two-year-olds cannot tell their fantasy from reality, and may think that their parents, siblings or relatives can use magic to solve everything, but become confused when they CANNOT use magic and think they are strange. Another boner pulled again. <br /> <br /> 5. Barney makes no distinction between stealing and sharing. He also explicitly said that "stealing is fine if the person you steal is not important". Children can learn that if you really want something, stealing is a perfectly acceptable way to get it. This is not something that preschool children need authority figures to tell them. <br /> <br /> 6. "If I only have the right thing, I can solve all my problems." Whenever children have a problem, Barney gives them everything they need to solve it. The message that is sent here is "Don't try to think about solving this! It's too much work, and the solution probably wouldn't work anyway. Just use this." For this reason, children could stop thinking through things (Barney said it was too much work) and become dependent on the "right" object. (The right shoes, the right food, the right computer, the right exercise machine ...) This is obviously a good message for Barney's marketers, but it's not good for preschoolers. <br /> <br /> 7. The message that cheating is ok. In another episode the children are involved in a race to bring a peanut on a spoon without dropping it. A child puts peanut butter on the spoon and wins easily. The child is then rewarded for his creative thinking, when the child actually folded the rules and changed the game so that he could win. This teaches that deception is good, you win and people think you are creative, when in real life you will often be disqualified, or worse, and severely unwelcome by other competitors who have played by the rules. <br /> <br /> 8. Do the children in this show eat anything other than cakes, biscuits and candy? This teaches that it's okay to eat tons of junk food and avoid healthy food, despite Barney's so-called "Healthy Food" song. Besides that, EVERYONE in the show eats junk food. No wonder there are so many obese children in America and Europe. <br /> <br /> And finally .... <br /> <br /> Most other children's TV shows teach creative problem solving well, without having to resort to "magic". Even Barney could have done it, but instead decided to use the method that was A) better for marketers and B) took less time and money for scripts. It's a resounding sell-out that shows how little the Lyons group really cares about children. <br /> <br /> This is my rant for all of you.
