I was struck by the terrible acting and script of this film. All the characters seem to be rendered immobile by personal problems - rather like deer in the headlights. They wander around complaining and complaining about their emotions when decisive actions need to be taken. I found myself screaming at the TV screen trying to wake them up and let them do SOMETHING! The plot is implausible. Whenever a key decision is made by a main character, one of the other characters must raise all the problems with the obvious decision, as if to make the decision even more difficult - it is a proven melodramatic ploy and just wants to make you moan. Clearly the import of the decision is obvious: it is not necessary to treat the public like an idiot. Overall, there's just too much emotional melody in the whole movie.
