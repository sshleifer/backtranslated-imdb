Tediously long and boring cinematic waffle. I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. I only watched it for the many people who were enthusiastic about this site. Was I watching the same movie? The whole episode is one-dimensional. Nothing about Garps's past has influenced his (or anyone else's) future and no one has been influenced by their past. I think it was Socrates who said of the plays that if a scene can be removed from a work without having any effect, then it shouldn't be there. Obviously, the director did not know this rule and, therefore, he filled his "work" with one dramatic scene after another. Even the plane crashing into the house was unexpected, it wasn't a surprise, but it was unexpected! <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that at the time of this writing (December 1, 2002), although many people say that it is one of their favorite films, no one has bothered to add a quote memorable. The reason is that there simply are none. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time looking at this, instead look at a bridge plank.
