This film was obviously made on a very low budget, but did they have to make it so obvious? It seemed that no effort was made to make the "future" look less futuristic. For example, the first scene takes place in an office building from the 1980s and all cars that are blown up date back to the late 1970s (I assume they didn't want to blow up cars that cost more than $ 500). Furthermore, it is quite obvious that Don "the Dragon" is driving his personal car during the film (after all, he partially financed the film). Finally, they stress at the beginning of the film that all types of drugs are now legal in this new "cyberpunk" society. Not only does this never become important in the film, but later, when don needs surgery without anesthesia, why doesn't he go out just to get some legal heroin or morphine? The whole film is sloppy like this and completely anticlimatic because Don blows a "unstoppable" Cybertracker easily for about 25 minutes in the film. However, if you find this cheap or free movie I would watch it, the last scene is almost worth enduring this whole movie.
