I cannot BELIEVE that someone is giving a good grade to this film. Besides the terrible acting, the thin (non-existent?) Plot and the slooooooooow rhythm, this would be the movie to watch if you were really TRYING to sleep. The brains of the writer and director must be fried eggs for having invented something so abominable. Based on the plot summary on the DVD case, the premise seemed really promising. But within the first ten minutes I knew it was a lost cause. If you want to see a real creep on the idea of ​​Area 51, look at the remake of "The Hills Have Eyes". Dreamland will soon vanish like all pathetic films of this type. THE NEXT!!!
