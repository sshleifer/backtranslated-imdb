What the hell was this? I admit that there were some scenes that caught my attention, like the 23 bullshit in which the protagonist sees or calculates the number 23 wherever he goes, but that was practically the film in a nutshell ?! To shout out loud this was supposed to be a suspense film and to be labeled as a psychological thriller I would have expected had at least some catastrophic effect on the mind, but instead what did we get? We've just gotten something as disgusting as an animal control guy in the midst of a mid-life crisis and his journey to redemption. Kind of like an old movie if you ask me. I probably should have rented Wild Hogs, it wouldn't have made a difference. I mean, who are we kidding, they should have made someone else's killer of that girl. Contrasting Sparrow with the protagonist of that book, the number 23, they were practically giving the film to the spectators suggesting that he was the killer since ever. How would he shake his head? Shame on all of you voters who have chosen to show some generosity towards this unfortunate piece of work that you call a film and compliments to most of the critics who have adhered to my reaction.
