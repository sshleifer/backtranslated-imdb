This film was a disappointment. The story is essentially The Shining with a castle (or a very cheap set disguised as a castle, to be precise) that replaces the hotel and a monster instead of ghosts. The budget is the same as seen in a softcore porno by Cinemax, as well as photography, sets, lighting and the video on which it was shot. The story is a failed attempt at sincerity: there is no easier way to make the audience feel sympathetic towards your characters than to show them an emotional trauma. And the trauma of this film is rather trivial. Want an example? A blind girl who listens to a language band that teaches Italian words for colors begins to cry to what she will never see. <br /> <br /> This film has had some things going on, however: the monster is actually quite handsome, rather scary. And there is a fair amount of nudity on the part of Raffaella Offidani, herself a star of Italian "erotic" films. The gore, however, leaves much to be desired, as is acting, even from the expert Jeffrey Combs. Apart from that I only saw two other Stuart Gordon films: Re-Animator and From Oltre, both of which were exceptional. But I will not let this little note of his career prevent me from watching many of his other films.
