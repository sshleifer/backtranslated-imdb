There are films that are leaders and films that are followers. <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" was a leader. And here is one of his followers. <br /> <br /> "Party Camp" is as interchangeable as any of his brothers who probed the depths that "Meatballs" (the original) had successfully extracted. Of course, that was Bill Murray. So what does "Party Camp" have? <br /> <br /> I'm glad you asked that question. <br /> <br /> Jewel Sheperd has made these films his bread and butter, and what flat side SHE provides! Even as an innocent (winking, winking) engaged to a rich twerp (Cribbio), she supplies the sultry vapor that she gives to all her parts. And yes, guys, she shows (if you know what I mean and I think you do). My God, that smile of his could melt through titanium. <br /> <br /> What? Oh yes, the movie. Nothing special like I said; every economic joke is targeted and hit (at horse level). And the eternal teenager Jayne is good for a laugh or two. But instead of the sense of humor there are only nudity, limping sex jokes, other, nudity, a sequence of soft-core dreams, a nurse with a sex symbol simply for purposes (masked!) Mischievous, even more nudity .. .. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... Maybe it's a good idea Bill Murray WAS NOT in this. <br /> <br /> Two stars. For Jewel, of course. A lot of "camp", but not much of a "party".
