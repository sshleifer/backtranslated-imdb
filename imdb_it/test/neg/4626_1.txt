I saw it on the Sci-Fi channel, so I knew it would be bad to start, but I was surprised how much worse it was than expected. The CG effects on the dragon were terrible, even for the Sci-Fi channel and the writing was pathetic. I couldn't tell if this had to be so stupid as a joke or if it had come out that way. The only redeeming quality of this film is that it's so terrible that it's almost funny, especially the part where Patrick Swayze's character comes home to Knight's father who retired after losing his legs and is now in bed in his armor for the sole purpose of letting the public know that he was a knight. Most of the film focuses on a huge dragon egg that opens up into a not-too-huge dragon with some of the worst CGIs I've ever seen. This was simply horrible.
