What a misunderstanding of cinema injustice - a 2.1 on the IMDb scale as I write this. Folks, this is much closer to a 3.0, I'll even go to a limb and say 4.0 where I put it. Come on, how do you get a movie on a static electricity network surrounding earth and alien amorphous cell structures, and not giving it at least a 4.0 for creativity? Then you have all that nice dialogue like - "Dave, look at the composition of this mud". You know, I don't think they ever got back on that mud. It doesn't matter, this is the kind of movie in which the hard films of "Z" live, and now I can rest peacefully. In fact, I saw it several years ago without the right appreciation for it, along with Corman's titles like "Attack of the Giant Leeches" and "The Wasp Woman". I don't know what the charm may be, but to quote a character from the film - "Whatever it is, it works fast!" <br /> <br /> Return to that strange amorphous cellular structure - I liked the idea of ​​a third element competing with your standard red and white blood cells. When astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) returned from the dead, I had visions of a scene that may have been a forerunner of "Alien" in 1979, but it wasn't. Instead, budget restrictions limit the image to a decrepit Big Bird, even if that concept was still almost a decade away. Who knows where an idea leaves and collects with another? <br /> <br /> Look, it's not so bad. Not so good, but not so bad. Whenever you manage to catch the astronauts landing with alien beings trying to conquer the Earth, you have a winning combination. Throw the monster's monstrous factor and you're on your way. Just remember: "A wounded animal so big is not good".
