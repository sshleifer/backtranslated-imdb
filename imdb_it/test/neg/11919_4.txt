Having no idea what this film was, but based on the fact that John Leguizamo was appearing to us, we decided to watch it. Well, it turned out to be not the wisest decision. In fact, as another comment in this forum says, we felt embarrassed for the actors who participated in this film. <br /> <br /> Although the film is not at all horrible, it makes no sense. William Baldwin's top performance doesn't even help the situation. John Leguizamo is a multifaceted actor who deserves better. The basic problem that seems to be the film was a project started with good intentions in making a small comedy and the people in charge have run out of ideas along the way. The result is a non-uniform film.
