When you watch a Seagal movie, you expect a good action. You expect to fight, not just a lot of footage like this movie. And: you expect a rather simple story. OK, I can live with a more complex story even if it's a Seagal movie. But this, this is, I don't know what to say. He is really very, very confused. At the end of the film, I had big problems understanding what had happened. And I know I'm not the only one. The story lacks so much information and is so full of holes in the plot that it is almost impossible to keep track of what is happening in the film. There are a lot of people in the film, people change parts all the time, and change position too often. Terrible. I just don't understand why it seems that Seagal is doing some sort of sequel to this.
