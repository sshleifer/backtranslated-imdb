This film is actually so poor in its desperate attempts to "feel good" and randomly it really embarrassed me to look at it. I can't imagine how the Norwegian celebrity and press circle should have tried to pretend to like him at the star-studded premiere. His fantastic media reviews are a disgusting example of how ridiculously small and innate the Norwegian media landscape is. If a foreign film of this quality had reached the silver screen, it would have gotten the rain of rotten tomatoes that it really deserves. <br /> <br /> The combination of literally amateur actors, homemade style visual effects, embarrassing dialogues, painfully useless attempts at working-class humor and overly welcoming and meaningless plot, really makes this a quality film lower than rock. Stay away.
