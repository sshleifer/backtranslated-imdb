The fun that was present in the other "movies" has almost disappeared with this third effort, which means that garbage production values ​​are more evident than ever. Another 2-parter ('The Chinese Web') is cobbled together, this one suffers from too much padding, not to mention the weak Spidey action that takes place in uninspired places like a parking lot, an apartment and a printing press. Nicholas Hammond is as captivating as ever, fighting bravely against the gray production and poor performance of the rest of the cast. The plot, in which Peter and Spidey help an official defeat of China for corruption during World War II by identifying three marines that could testify about his innocence, doesn't exactly scream "an animated comic book to life", right?
