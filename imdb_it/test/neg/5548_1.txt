Well, this took my nerves away, they got it right. I first rented this movie in the 80s, when my friend opened a video store that carried every rare film he could find. He also brought all the shock, horror and exploitative films he managed to dig, and almost all of them went through them. I had previously seen Blood Feast and 2000 Maniacs and the Wizard of Gore. They were creepy (especially over the period of time), and the Wizard of Gore became quite mean. The Gore-Gore Girls, however, was the one I remember being the most disgustingly bloody. I rented it on DVD a little while ago because I wanted to hear the comment and thought it might have some nice clothes and dances. I forgot that it was created in the early 70s, so fashion had gone down at that time. I also realized that it was a film that I didn't really need to see more than once. It had fun parts, but gaaaah! It was much more disgusting than I remembered. I am very tired of film gore but a couple of times I just got pissed off and had to look away. This was not a good choice of films to put on DVD all crunchy and cleaned with better sound quality and images. The comment is partly amusing, and interesting (I think HG said the budget was $ 6100.00) Maybe HG Lewis didn't feel good that day, but he looked tired in general and even had the courage to feel offended when he Something Wild interviewer likened him to Ed Wood Jr. I'm sorry, friend, but you're not really Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> The extremely thin plot concerns a series of murders of topless go-go dancers in strip clubs. A nice reporter and a very unattractive private detective come together (kind of ... doesn't seem to be able to stand it) to try to solve the crimes. Henny Youngman owns a strip club. A lot of really bad murders happen. <br /> <br /> I will apologize in advance because I don't want to sound like I need to lighten, but this film was so misogynistic it freed me more than "Company of Men". Above all because the extreme antipathy of the protagonist and the director for women - and for the public - only oozes from every frame. It's not just the murders. The very attractive detective does everything he can to treat the reporter like the filth of the dog on every occasion, for no apparent reason, (not exactly a threat to George Clooney, as I said) and still follows him like a puppy. She yawns seeing a horribly mutilated body and looks at her in disgust, then pours a cold soda from a can onto her face to wake her up. Later he calls the police to report the crime: "No ... there is no hurry ... it seems he has ... lost face." This guy is THE HERO. You can imagine how other characters feel about women. I could go on, but you have the idea. Note that I'm making this movie look a lot more politically correct (and a lot more fun) than it actually is. <br /> <br /> Much of the cast is the kind of actors you pray they will never take off their clothes not too easy on the eyes, so don't watch the movie just to see the nudity unless you're too picky . All the go-go dancers seem to desperately want the scene to end so that they can get their $ 10 or whatever the price HG paid them and get the fix for their drug. OK, it's not so bad, there was a dancer who seemed to have been a professional and also another dancer with a huge afro who didn't seem as unhappy as the rest, but still not too enthusiastic. The only slightly funny things were a couple of moments of brief involuntary humor, like when a policeman in charge of a murder scene screams in rage "get out of here before he gets you all arrested!" not to a group of journalists, but to some other policeman who quietly goes to work (they mutter and leave, anyway). Henny Youngman is pretty funny, as Lewis says, he said his jokes are so fast that they almost need subtitles (I'm sure he was trying to get all day fast so he could get paid and go out of there, too if it does not seem to have in mind to look at some naked chicks. <br /> <br /> It might be worthwhile to see it only out of morbid curiosity - for the time the film was made, it was probably the most gruesome thing at the cinema at the time - or if you're a big fan of HG Lewis and you find it or low-budget filmography by anyone it is fascinating. If not, if you saw it once, you saw it and you can switch to other disgusting movies much more fun at low cost in the early 1970s ... this movie doesn't even come close, for example, "Pink Flamingos" when it comes to the skip-the-popcorn factor, if you've never seen an HG Lewis movie, I suggest you try "Blood Festival" first, instead you you will have a lot of fun. <br /> <br />
