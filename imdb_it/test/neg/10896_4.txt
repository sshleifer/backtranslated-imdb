There is something in this film directed by X-Files scribe John Shiban who eluded me. You have the feeling that while the film is moving, that everything is not what it seems, yet I feel that the film fails to give you enough to continue to really interest me later. It's about perception. There are characters that the heroine Nicole (Jaimie Alexander) encounters in the film that speaks and disappears. This may seem like a spoiler, but it is something that actually only inherits a very small focus on the part of the filmmakers. They seem to be kidding us as we watch curious to know if we have to trust what Nicole is seeing or not. He never gets a correct answer and I was a bit incapable at first. There comes a time in a film where the ambiguity can be frustrating because the viewer is guided in a wild goose hunt that ends in a blind alley with little explanation of what we have just seen. In the end it seems a grueling exercise instead of an electrifying psychodrama. Now there is nothing wrong with the ambiguity itself, but you give us something to attack or you will escape us. That's how I felt while watching "Rest Stop". This film is supposed to be about a young woman named Nicole who decides to run off to California with her lover Jesse (Joey Mendicino) to make him big in Hollywood. They do what should be a slight detour at a staging point so that Nicole can pee, but falls in terror for her when she discovers that her Jesse has completely disappeared. Someone in a crusty and dusty yellow truck is a fool who seems to be causing a lot of trouble for Nicole and we soon realize that she is behind Jesse's disappearance when things start to happen, the signs that are provided to her if you want her will have to find a way out of a very difficult situation. Nicole is far from any existing city and with limited resources to defend herself from a maniac who provides her with strong proof of how evil he can be. <br /> <br /> This is the easy part. When a female character comes into play, the film makes a truly bizarre leap from logic since we're not sure where it ever came from, how it got there and, more importantly, where it goes once Nicole tries to free her from her supposed prison in the bathroom of the utilities of the bathroom. He meets another, a police officer in the area (Joey Lawrence), who may seem like his savior, but when he too is a victim of the trucker, things start again from those questions, if he were really there to begin with. The truck driver commits acts of torture to Nicole (as when he has her locked up in the bathroom and while trying to untie a thread that the killer has wrapped around the door lock, he receives an unpleasant bite from him). Then set the bathroom on fire leaving it without a place of lasting refuge from the beast. <br /> <br /> It's time for the trucker attacks that makes me faint. Maybe he just likes to torment her, but he appears appropriately in certain situations where Nicole has time to run away or get ready. It doesn't make much sense, its motivations, which push the film into an illogical idea. Why does it become so obvious? Why does she allow her to get ready? It seems, I'm going out on a branch here, that he likes his prey to believe he can find a way to escape just to trample that hope when he gets to his next macabre attack. And yet, why does Shiban decide to play with the viewer by having strange encounters with people who don't exist? What are Shiban and the writing group trying to say? And, to cover the strangeness of the film is a family in a camper van. They play a small part in the scheme of things as religious bigots, but the film doesn't do enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in this movie.
