During the summer, the cue line for this attraction is really long, since it is a water ride. It is very themed, but many of the artifacts of the race seem to be out of order. Overall, the ride is not worth it if you have to wait for almost 2 hours. on line. The drop in the end is exciting, but the whole run itself could have been better. The creators of Indiana Jones may have prob. helped these Hollywood designers. Moreover, many times the race breaks down and causes even longer waiting periods for others. It is also very unpleasant when they only have a raft that starts from the open dock and not the two, as they should. During Halloween Horror Nights, go dark, and it's exciting if it's your first time, but if it's not, then don't worry about waiting in a four-hour line.
