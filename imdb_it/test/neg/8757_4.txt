Well, I didn't know what to expect from 555. In fact, I had never heard of it until a few months ago. But, being a collector of almost all types of horror, I thought about going ahead and grabbing this dark 80s slasher. Basically the plot has to do with a killer who kills every 5 years for 5 nights in a row. What the third 5 in the title means ... nobody knows. However, the killings begin as the murderer searches for young teenagers who enjoy themselves in dark places. He beheads men and brutally wounds the woman to death. After this, he proceeds to rape the dead body. The police think they have an advantage over the killings but have no idea what is happening. How will they find the killer? Does anyone care? <br /> <br /> This film is full of some of the worst actors I've ever seen. No wonder that none of these actors did anything else, literally. The three protagonists are two detectives and a "sexy" journalist. I'm sarcastic when I say sexy, she's as sexy as she gets. The two detectives are like watching tweedle goddesses and tweedle dum. One of them underestimates his part and the other could have gone to the Shatner drama school. The acting is so bad that it almost forces you to lose interest in the film, thus putting you to sleep. <br /> <br /> The only thing that holds this terrible film together are some good blood scenes. For a film on this budget, the producers must have put all the money there into the special effects, which are still not great. <br /> <br /> Unless you are like me and have to own every single horror movie there, I would suggest avoiding this movie. 4/10
