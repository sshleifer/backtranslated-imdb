COC has had its moments. I liked the action sequences, but I despised the script and the plot. I hate this movie so much, I'll just write about the stupidest part. First of all, the plot would never have happened. Secondly, the sadness of the Chinese president has not been recalled. It would never happen. Finally the dialogue. Employing non-Chinese actors to play Chinese roles is understandable, but writing a dialogue for them is TOTALLY AVAILABLE! For those of you who have understood the Chinese in the film, you know what I mean.
