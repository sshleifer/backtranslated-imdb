The original Road House was a classic 1980s film, which despite not having an award worthy of writing or acting, was a very funny and popular film, largely due to the presence of star Patrick Swayze and the great supporting cast. along with some excellent fighting scenes and sweet eyes. <br /> <br /> 16 years later, and MGM / Sony tries to recreate the magic that left us all by quoting a liner and reciting the three rules of rebound ... with a film that cites all the best linings of the original and recites the three rules. <br /> <br /> If it was an amateur fan movie, it would be seen as a loving homage to one of Swayze's most popular films. Like a professionally made film, it falls face down in the DVD Bargin Bin, with its continuous reuse of lines and plot from the original film that becomes more of an annoying sign of lack of originality rather than interesting references to the original. br /> <br /> That said, with new jokes like "I'll kill you just like I killed your father" it's no wonder the writers decided to shoot most of the original script. <br /> <br /> I knew it would never be anything special, being a Straight to DVD sequel, but I had at least hoped there could be a couple of new ideas and new things included to live up to the Road House name , but what to get is simply a 2006 remake of the same film, with some added narcotics. <br /> <br /> If I were the director, I would have removed all references to the first film so as not to obscure the original and it's characters. As it stands, the character of Patrick Swayze should now be dead (limp out of view by Jake Busey) and his brother and son now the main characters, who strangely have completely different last names. <br /> <br My favorite part was that Dalton's "son" drove his father's same car, a genuinely cold homage, even though it was later ruined by having made the car exactly at the same end as his predecessor . This is a good example of how this film goes too far in understanding the sequences and ideas of the 1989 film. <br /> <br /> Of course who can forget the legendary moment when Wild Bill promises to kill Shane "just like me killed your father" and then proceeds to try to disperse it in a completely different way. Wonderful writing there. I see that Schaech is listed as a co-writer. Stick to acting, or preferably, nothing. <br /> <br /> Overall, though, this is an OK movie if there is nothing else to look at and you want to turn off your brain for an hour and a half, or if you haven't, I've seen the first Road House, but the most ardent fans of the classic Swayze will be disappointed almost to the point of being offended by how much a rip off of the film was. As someone suggested as an alternative subtitle for this film, "Even Jeff Healy is glad he won't see this!" Stay true to the original Road House and relive the good old days of Swayze!
