How any of you gave this more than 2 stars amazes me. I made an account on IMDb just to comment on this movie cr @ p. The acting is cr @ p and the plot is cr @ p. It would definitely not deserve stars if it weren't for the soundtrack of descent (and yet there are still some outrageously clownish tracks, even those with the oboe and sound like a comedy of black and white comics and adapted to the desired mood of the persecuting scenes) and quality cinematography. Dialogue and plot are as complex as those of a book by Dr. Sues. These actors are horrible. Right now I'm watching this movie and, in every word, I'm amazed that you swallowed all this. The only reason I didn't turn the movie off is because I got involved in creating an account on IMDb and publishing this review. I dig mainstream movies, dig stupid stupid movies, write indie retro movies and almost any other type / genre if performed well. My brother convinced me to rent this because he said he heard it was good and that he generally has a great taste in movies; from the moment he told me the title I looked at him as if he were crazy. I am going through a difficult time to end it because there is so much malice to talk about. The only way I can rationalize the good grades here is that you guys have been paid to give this movie high marks. It is so badly made and not very close to dramatic, artistic, complex, well written, well preformed or even bearable. If this was the end product of my hard work as a director, I would be embarrassed to release it to the public, so I don't even mind for the director if he reads this - what the hell were you thinking boy?
