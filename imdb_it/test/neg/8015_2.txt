I rented it because I couldn't give up the chance to see Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones pre-Hollywood fame together, but it certainly wasn't worth it. The only reason I give them two stars instead of one is the novelty of seeing them before they get big across the pond. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones, who is usually fun to watch even though the biggest thesp in the world is not, is horrible. Owen looks really uncomfortable being in a turkey like that, plus he wears a ridiculously well-suited wig on his chin (at least I hope it's a wig and not his real hair). And the scene where you dance a country jig with Zeta Jones embarrasses you just for him. Joan Plowright wanders all over the film - probably wondering how she turned into such a mess. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays Clive Owen's wife is not terrible, but almost everyone else. Oh, and the writing also stinks.
