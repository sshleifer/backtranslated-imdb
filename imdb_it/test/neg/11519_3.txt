Being one of the founding fathers of my monkey club (which also includes monkeys / chimpanzees and orangutans), I am reviewing this film from the perspective of an ape film. After all, it's a whole summer of monkeys, 100+ days for monkeys who do what they do best, cause malice, cheating, hyjinx, solve human problems, and teach us about ourselves. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple. In short, the poor boy needs money for the things he wants. Fortunately, there are some monkeys (chimpanzees) that have a size on their head that could make Boba Fett's or Dog's (Duane Chapman) blood flow. While the boy tries to catch the monkeys he learns about himself, his family, his grandfather, the weird local, hang out with a girl who is twice his age and learns the best way to deal with bullies is to point a gun at of them. br /> <br /> Here is the problem. The boy concentrates so much on the fact that chimpanzees don't get the screen time they deserve. Chimpanzees do not have the same talent as chimpanzees playing Jack in the M_P trilogy or legendary orangutans playing Dunstin or Clyde (1 or 2). So don't watch this movie expecting to find the next big thing in the Chimp genre. Chimpanzees have hit some sweet jumps, which the film most needs. There is an epic scene of chimpanzees breaking into the homes of poor families and destroying all the things they worked so hard for. Serious monkey movie fans will want to rent the movie for this scene alone. <br /> <br /> So in closing this film is not for the serious fan of monkey films. I would not recommend this film to families as it encourages a child's rebellion against their parents. I can only recommend this movie as a rental for adult hardcore monkey lovers and well-supervised children.
