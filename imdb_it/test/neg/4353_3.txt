The Big Knife, a film on the dark side of the Hollywood film industry, is ironically much more like a movie than a movie. Apart from some very short exhibit scenes, all the action takes place in the living room of the film's hero, played by Jack Palance. He is a film actor who wants to get out of his contract with his studio due to the lack of quality of redemption in the films he has published. Even his wife, on duty again (Ida Lupino), is fed up with her study, not to mention her husband's womanly ways. Unfortunately for both of them, the studio head (Rod Steiger) is a real bastard. He blackmailed material to force the increasingly tortured actor to sign a new contract. But it's only a matter of time before he pushes the man too far. <br /> <br /> This film is NOT, I repeat, NOT a film noir. Rather, it is an exceptionally theatrical melodrama. The plot proceeds at a snail's pace, and is so intricate and confusing that it finds itself in violent disharmony with the static setting and carefully designed block of real scenes. The acting is exasperated to the extreme, and fluctuates sharply between the histrionic and the softer, but no less subtle, soliloquy that is obviously destined to be moving, but which appears as a pretentious slander, especially in the hands of the miserable mixture of Palance. Aldrich was obviously going all out for a stylized "something" here, but I doubt he also knew what it was, and certainly the public will never do it. <br /> <br /> I think the main lesson here is that movies and plays are very different media. What could have worked in a comedy didn't even seem remotely natural or plausible about the film. The result? A big waste of time. There is little to enjoy here.
