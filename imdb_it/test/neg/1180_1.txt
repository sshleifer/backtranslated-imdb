What a waste of time to watch this movie. Poor image quality, poor sound, poor acting and certainly not based on real facts. The deputy's "fianc√©e" behaved in such an exaggerated manner as the sheriff, who was more comedy than horror. The deputy tries to make an emergency call by dialing 911 ... PROBLEM ... in 1957 that emergency number did not exist. This is just one example of obvious inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> The "scary" aspect was decidedly insufficient. It just didn't seem horrible to me. <br /> <br /> I thought that the actor who plays Gein did the most admirable acting job in the whole movie. I could see mental disorders in his interpretation of the character. <br /> <br /> Sorry ... this does NOT understand it !!
