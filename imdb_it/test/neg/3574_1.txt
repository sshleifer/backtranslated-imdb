I recently rented this movie on DVD and thought it would be an interesting choice as they are both from the north of England (Bradford), and also interested in cinema. However, it soon became apparent that this film seemed to lack a decent level of development as far as scripts are concerned. The characters were weak and often stereotyped and the story lacked substance. The topic could be an interesting basis for a film. However, the delivery of this appeared naive and unfocused. <br /> <br /> The ending seemed to want to express an opinion on the characters, punishing and rewarding where the filmmakers felt necessary. This seemed a bit embarrassing and silly, and seemed in contrast to the "realism" used in the shooting style. For me, the film dealt with characters and subjects in a rather heavy and clumsy way. It seemed that the writer had already decided how he wanted to close the story and set the crow, excluding anything else to adapt it. <br /> <br /> Another point I feel strongly about is the watered-down Ken Loach feels the film has had. I get angry enough that British film financiers cannot see that there is more to British films than "gritty realism". It has become almost a safe option. The film is an infinitely wonderful playground for imaginative ideas and is not exploited by UK film producers. There is a lot of talent here in the UK. It is unfortunate that most of these individuals end up making music videos and commercials 100% of the time or going to America. <br /> <br /> Love + Hate would have worked better if it had been reduced to 30 or 60 minutes and appeared as a unique television drama.
