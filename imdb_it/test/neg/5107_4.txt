When I first heard that there would be The World is not Enough video game for Nintendo 64, I was so excited. When it finally came out, I was one of the first to rent it. I rented it for 7 days and I passed the whole game !!! The game was easy and gave too many suggestions. A disappointing sequel to GoldenEye. Take my advice and DON'T RENT THIS GAME. <br /> <br /> Of course the guns and gadgets are fantastic, but you get tired of a wristwatch that seems to have been taken directly from GoldenEye except for being a red color instead of a blue color, a poor excuse for a dart gun, a horrible stunner and a stupid hook that can only be attached to things that are yellow and black. <br /> <br /> I think RARE should be made this game instead of EA, which should stick to games that are good to do, like sports games, and should get rid of first person shooters and let the masters do work.
