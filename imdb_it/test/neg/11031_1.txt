This film is an example of a limited budget, ineffective cast, weak storyline and poor entertainment. These types of films are made for commercial breaks and not for the entertainment of hard fans of Bollywood films. I went to this movie because I thought the first gangster was tolerable, so this is too. The only thing I appreciate is the way the new actress has entered the film in a very audacious way, very much like the Bollywood actress Nandita Das. she is good, sexy and good acting. she will definitely go up in her career. our mithunda was always good for his work, but he has something good in the film. I did not like imraan for his role he must advise him to improve himself as he did many films as a new actor and was seen as an established actor.
