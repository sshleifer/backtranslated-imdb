I don't want to sound too dirty, but if the accidental death of a butterfly by a time traveler caused such a huge change in the chronology, how could it be because the butterfly would have been incinerated by the pyroclastic burst of the erupting volcano? And how could time travelers continue to return at the same time and not continue to meet their previous and subsequent selves that were also in those same few minutes in the timeline? It seems that there would have been a large crowd in front of that charge of dinosaurs. While I can accept the idea of ​​a wave of time, I seriously doubt that the wave would have caused only a few changes. As the wave passed, all the changes that would have happened would have happened immediately during the passage of that wave. So, scratch the idea of ​​the city starting to get invaded by the jungle. And why the jungle? The position of the city would still have been at the latitude and longitude of before and would have had adequate vegetation in its geographical place on Earth. <br /> <br /> And an endless list of other illogical inanities. <Br /> <br /> Bwahahaha! This film is a strange combination of some fairly decent production values ​​and totally ridiculous plot holes and concrete errors. <br /> <br /> Too bad. A fantastic idea of ​​history that has been developed with scientific nonsense. <br /> <br /> Sigh ... why, why, why, why? Why spend all that money on production and not even bother to correct the script to see if it has produced a kind of real sense?
