Every time I have seen this film I have the same impression: some parts of it are so incredibly stupid / bad that they suck me, they are not intentional and there are many; the rest is simply ugly, stupid and / or irrelevant. A film like Evil Dead has the merit of being bad at his own expense because it is the desired result - he is "stupid and mischievous because Sam Raimi succeeded in what he was trying to do. This film has no excuse, it is stupid and mischievous because The directors have failed so miserably, the lousy result is piled on top of shitty scripts and disgusting interpretations, so it's a shame that the lowest rating a film can give is one for "terrible." Watching this movie has the same effect. listening to an essay by Billy Madison: "Everyone in this room is now more stupid for listening to it." I should be able to give this movie something around -5.
