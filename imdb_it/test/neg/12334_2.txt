It could be that the film I saw was completely different from what the others saw, however, since the actors are the same, I can only think that the cut I saw in Europe is different from the one that circulates in the United States. <br /> <br /> However, this was the worst movie I saw in the last five years. (Closely followed by The Waterboy ...) <br /> <br /> Why: because I think this director took elements from every thriller before this, mixed them, inserted the wrong order with the wrong music and published it. <br /> <br /> (Examples: nothing happens, the music becomes scary, and in any case nothing is satisfied. The "grumpy" officer rude us in a way that would leave the actor rejected in any acting class. moment that comes out of nowhere at the end: there is an unavoidable scene and in the next scene all the problems are over.) <br /> <br /> If you want to see an intelligent film: see Memento. If you want to see a better thriller: watch the thriller that comes to mind. If you want to see Patrick Swayze: see Dirty Dancing.
