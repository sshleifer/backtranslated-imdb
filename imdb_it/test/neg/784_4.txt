First of all. Should Cameron Diaz ever be allowed to act again? Define that a bad performance would be an insult to bad performances. It was a historically horrible performance. Any small chance that Diaz had to be a serious actress is now completely done later. Laughably horrible. <br /> <br /> Two, the film was extremely boring, and not very inspiring. I can sit around and meditate on human nature without having to watch terrible actors, recite a terrible story. <br /> <br /> Third, there wasn't a single nice character, and worse, it looked like it was made by design. You didn't have to like or like any character. It was quite effective. I wanted everyone to die to be honest. Aliens included. Child included. Everyone was just a big mouse in this movie. Everyone literally went around and called it a movie. You could hardly distinguish the "employees" of the zombies, with normal people, because they all looked like zombies. <br /> <br /> Finally, nothing really makes sense. From the reactions and emotions of the characters to the literal plot, everything seems random. This is just a really bad film, disguised and conceived as a "movie about thinking man", which is destined to be confused. Give me a break. A bad movie is a bad movie. And this movie was bad.
