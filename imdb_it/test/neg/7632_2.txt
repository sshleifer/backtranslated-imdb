I'm sorry I can't be more expressive in my summary, but those two words seemed to perfectly describe the film. This is not just a bad movie, but a bad movie with bad acting and a plot that will be irrelevant to most observers. <br /> <br /> See only for a naked Rebecca De Mornay tied to a chain link fence and complains with ecstasy; presumably "erotic", but actually hilarious. <br /> <br />
