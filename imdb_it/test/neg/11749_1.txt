I would like to start by saying that this re-made version of one of the greatest films ever created "Psycho" (1960) was nothing but a fine example of bad direction, poor acting and poor cast. The best way to describe this film is to compare it step by step, acting for acting and process by process up to the original. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock, one of the greatest film directors who ever lived, was planning to shoot the original in black and white despite the availability of color at that time. All right, people in 1960 may not have been as used to bloodshed or terrifying scenes as we are today, but that didn't stop people from enjoying it and being nominated for 4 Oscars. Gus Van Sant had absolutely no reason to release it in color except that the year was 1998. What should have looked realistic in color no. After the shower scene, Norman washes his hands, it's easy to understand that anything used for blood looks like a kind of red wax. Once he washes the blood away, his hand is red. <br /> <br /> Speaking of acting, maybe there couldn't have been a better cast than Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins in the original. Perkins fit well with Norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiled and talked to the stranger. Hitch wanted a handsome and good actor and it worked well. In this version, I personally think that Vince Vaughn was perfect, handsome and strong to play the role of Norman, unfortunately his acting was no less than terrible. In the motel office where Norman and Marion have a long conversation, he had a zero expression on his face and his voice and face never change. In the original in the same scene in which the asylum is described, we can clearly see the sudden change in expression on Perkins' face and seem frighteningly angry though not aggressively. Vince Vaughn here works out the entire conversation as if he had just had his lines by heart. Again, terrible acting. The same is with Anne Heche. In the opening scene of the original, we can see how tense and nervous Marion (Janet) is when she drives to Phoenix. He was happy in getting the money but at the same time he was afraid of life. This is what I call acting. In the remake, Heche has no sign of fear and smiles periodically to get the money. I don't think anyone would be "happy and smiling" when they just stole $ 400000 and the entire state police are behind them. In the shower scene, Janet in the original handle grabs the curtain, turns around and dies after being stabbed. In the remake, Heche is stabbed, turns, then swings to the other side, has a silly expression on her face and manages to die with great effort. Once again, terrible acting. <br /> <br /> There are also some changes introduced in this film from the original that seem to have nothing to do with the plot and the current situation. In the scene where Arbogast is murdered, two scenes flash between the stabs. One with a naked woman and the other with a sheep. Many people, including myself, are not exactly sure that the second scene showed a sheep or a cow or whatever it was. What the hell does a beast or a naked woman have to do with the murder of an investigator! The changes were simply inappropriate and unnecessary. There are also a couple of changes in the final scene. <br /> <br /> Allow me to add some (and only) positive points along with this. I felt that Julianne Moore did her job well and played a good Lila character. And William Macy did it well, that was almost exactly how the Arbogast character should have been interpreted. <br /> <br /> It is known that the purpose and intention of a cinematic remake is to make the current generation aware of a film has a good classical plot, and tries to make it look better than the original. And if something happened here according to what I just said, it's exactly the opposite. Unfortunately, many people like me have not been impressed after seeing this movie unless we learn of the existence of an unforgettable original version. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this film, it is not close to the original and the original will always remain one of the best films ever created if not the best.
