This is a surprisingly bad action movie. I would say that its main flaw is that it is BORING. Arghh! Funky closets, retro and elegant design and decent cinematography cannot prevent this film from being a snoozer. The second (major) flaw of Mod Squad is the lack of character development - underlined by the actors' lack of talent. I tend to like the work of Claire Danes, so I was quite surprised by her non-existent performance in this film. Giovanni Ribisi is sadly disconcerting: how is it possible that his style of forked acting in cotton fits into an action movie? As for Omar Epps, well, he needs to take some acting lessons to learn how to emulate. The man had the same facial expression for the whole movie! My suggestion is to save some money and wait to see this turkey on the wire.
