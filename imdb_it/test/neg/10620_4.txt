Sometimes you get exactly what you expect. A film produced by and as a vehicle for a rock band in the midst of a comeback is not to be expected of high level in artistic merit - and in this case it certainly is not. In fact, as expected, the soundtrack is a much better investment than the film itself, which, like the rock and roll lifestyle of the 70s that it tries to portray, is characterized by excesses, drugs and exaggerated antics, but unfortunately it is not almost as much fun. Using a script by Carl Dupre horrible enough to make a fellow writer shudder and waste the talents of Edward Furlong, the only highlight of this piece of rock and roll gone wrong is the music, in particular the elaborate recreating a KISS concert of 1978.
