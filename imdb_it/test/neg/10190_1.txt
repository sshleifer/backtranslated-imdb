I thought I saw a UFO movie. Instead, I saw a film that was trying to make the audience (me) make the decision to accept Christ in my life, or risk going to hell. The whole UFO affair was a big red herring !!! The acting in it was rather pathetic. In fact, it seemed that some people in an evangelical church would come together and decide they wanted to make a movie. All the characters spoke as if they were in church conversing with other church members. It was not a real dialogue at all. I wish I had read some reviews before seeing this movie, so I wouldn't have wasted my money. If, on the other hand, you are in the whole church scene in style, and you want to see a demonstration of how to push your opinions (no matter how limiting) on ​​other people, then by all means, go see it.
