I could make a better film. This is a waste of time and money. it disgusts me that films like these are actually made and the people who actually make them think they are good. I like teenage comedies when they're done right. This film, however, takes this genre to a new minimum. With films like this, people think it's really fair to make this filth and ask unsuspecting people to pay to sit down. It is a sadism.
