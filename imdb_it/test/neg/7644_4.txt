SILVER CITY (2+ outta 5 stars) As a big fan of John Sayles' work for many years, I feel safe in saying that this is the worst movie I've ever made. That said, the film is not exactly * terrible * ... just very uninspired. Sayles throws familiar elements from his previous films (corrupt politics, illegal immigration, selling youth ideals) but fails to bring them together in any new or significant way. Also the dialogue (usually the strength of Sayles) is disappointing this time .. it seems cliché and forced in almost every scene. The film looks like an episode of a TV series that did not pass the third episode. There are a lot of great stars at hand ... and they do their best to make their parts live in bits ... but this time the material is not present. During the filming of an election campaign, a confident governor (a sober and obvious supporter of George W. Bush) draws a corpse from a lake. An investigator is hired to try to warn people who may have deliberately set this to discredit the candidate ... but he soon discovers that there are deeper and darker (and more cliché) secrets to discover. Sayles has made similar themed films much better in the past ("Lone Star", "Matewan", "The Return of the Secaucus Seven", "Men With Guns"). It is a pity that he went to the well once in too many and had contaminated water. A good line, delivered by Richard Dreyfuss: "Danny, you're a loser, it's already been established beyond doubt, so try to be good, okay?"
