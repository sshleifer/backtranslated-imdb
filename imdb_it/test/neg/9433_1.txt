Meet Cosmo (Jason Priestley), a young and cheerful bookmaker content with his boring life making numbers for the crowd and living in a basement apartment at a senior center. His only recreation is to watch TV and occasionally try his eccentric prostitute, Honey (Janeane Garofalo). But one day all this changes, when the mafia boss is killed and the well-considered Cosmo is selected by the new and quiet persuasive leader, Gordon (Robert Loggia), to become a killer in all respects. It is an offer that the reluctant Cosmo cannot repeat, cannot refuse, and quickly exchanges in his worldly and solitary existence for a course of revenge under the tutelage of the mafia veteran Steve (Peter Riegert), a relaxed and suburban bon vivant who savor the maximum pay and minimum hours of work. In no time, Cosmo surprises both himself and mentor Steve by showing an absolutely perverse attitude to the job. Although he never touched a gun before, Cosmo proves to be both a marksman and, after an initial wave of moral hesitation, a cold and detached killer. Soon, Cosmo will send deadbeat customers with speed and style and his natural talent with a gun quickly makes it an invaluable added value to the Gordon crowd. <br /> <br /> But the reality intrudes, when one night, while being massaged by Honey, Cosmo admits he feels a bit nervous and recommends trying yoga to relax. Cosmo takes his advice and joins a nearby yoga class taught by a beautiful young woman named Jasmine (Kimberly Williams). Cosmo is immediately captured by the kind and gentle Jasmine, who soon becomes attracted to Cosmo. Now, if he can get rid of his annoying and violent boyfriend, Randy (Josh Charles), maybe she and Cosmo can actually start something. Cosmo, using some of the "skills" of his new trade, eventually convinces Randy to disappear and his relationship with Jasmine takes flight. <br /> <br /> Writer / director M. Wallace Wolodarksy, a two-time Emmy Award-winner for his work on "The Tracy Ullman Show" and "The Simpsons", created a script that blends his three genres of love: "I like comedies, gangster movies and love stories," Wolodarsky explained, "so I pretty much destroyed all three to create this movie." But what he invented is such a bumpy movie and unlikely that it looks like a very long sketch on Saturday Night Live. The monotonous tone does not match so much with his sense of humor, as he underlines the fact that a lot of money was spent on a vehicle for Jason Priestly to happily send to smash his good boy image, which does not even have a full success because he plays his character not like a nerd, but like a laconic zombie. A nerd can be naive, but a nerd has passion. Passion for things directed inwardly. But Priestly interprets his character as mentally deficient, almost anti-Forrest Gump. Unfortunately, "Coldblooded" has no sense of purpose to actually be the anti-Forrest Gump. <br /> <br /> Peter Riegert (Local Hero, Animal House) behaves normally as usual, and Kimberly Williams does his best with what he has to work with, but Janeane Garofalo (HBO's Larry Sanders Show) is pretty much wasted in her role as a friend of Cosmo. Probably not for long though. Garofalo has all the enthusiasm and charm of an apple waiting to be selected and it is only a matter of time before it is given a meat role, hoping to make a tag team with Marisa Tomei. <br /> <br />
