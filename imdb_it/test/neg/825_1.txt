My God, how bad this is. Who is this impostor who pretends to be Ali G? Avoid this at all costs. He replaces the satire and the multilayered humor of his show with humor down and down. <br /> <br /> This was obviously an attempt to make it known in the United States before publishing its show there on HBO. <br /> <br /> A commentator here claims that we do not judge the film on the merits of the show due to the difference in media. While it is true that the standard format of the show could never be transferred to the big screen, Mr. Sacha Baron Cohen could have ensured the intelligent use of his comic style in a more conventional film plot. Instead we have this mess, which in all honesty has nothing to do with Ali G except for the packaging. <br /> <br /> Terribly disappointing. Go find the DVDs of Innit, Aiiii or Bling Bling for some real Ali G.
