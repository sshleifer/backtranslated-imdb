This catastrophic film is a remake of a 1973 film of the same title, based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu. Japan is right next to the Pacific ring of fire (active volcanoes) and also along the edges of plate tectonics, whose displacement will cause earthquakes and tsunamis (a Japanese term in itself for the tidal wave). Of course, this is a natural prerequisite for a catastrophic film, with Hollywood having a field day with films like Armageddon, Deep Impact and, more recently, The Day After Tomorrow, which addresses the problem of global warming as a catalyst for natural disasters the world . <br /> <br /> But I'll have to say this: The Sinking of Japan makes all the films mentioned before, they look like classics. This catastrophic film is a disaster, and a large one. Having to watch my watch every 10-15 minutes is a signal that the film does not engage, and feels that it has exceeded its execution time. <br /> <br /> The special effects are great to look at. From the satellite images of outer space, to the vivid recreation of every conceivable natural disaster that can hit the land of the rising sun, the effects are the star of the show. However, having a spectacular computer-generated graphic does not in itself make a pleasant film, since it is only good for simple bori. <br /> <br /> If I had seen the trailer in which you are attracted by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and chaos, then yes, indeed those scenes are just that. There are no details and everything is seen from afar, in a way similar to God. Things happen right on the screen, with an attempt to try to dig deeper to examine the problems closely. It is similar to Godzilla which ruins buildings, and it is as if there were no human beings or loss of life through that single act. Strange as it may seem, show us the victims! A populated nation like Japan does not simply suffer disasters after the disaster with extremely low numbers of deaths, not when filmmakers wreak havoc on such an epic scale. <br /> <br /> Trying to weave a love story into the film, it stood out like a sore thumb. There are many characters in the film, but each of them lacks real characteristics, or humanity, and looks like a wandering zombie, without expression, without emotion, and definitely very rigid and unconvincing. Heroes get stuck in generic control rooms by issuing statements, instructions and form policies, and react to incidents as if it were a computer game, all solved with the push of a button. These are characters of which nothing is known. <br /> <br /> If I can simply use The Day After Tomorrow as a comparison, while there are terrifying effects, there is at least an attempt to provide a microscopic view of the whole disaster from the point of view of a different individual. And infused inside there are a lot of action sequences, as big as the disasters themselves, and small with the focus on the triumph of the human spirit, which makes it relatively compelling. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for The Sinking of Japan, this film should preferably be one to sink and tank, and it is hoped to suffer a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better things.
