Now, I love bad guys, old skifee movies as much as most people. And I understand that a budget is a budget. That being said, Planet of the Dinosaurs is as bad as a bad movie. The thing has no actors, and only an attractive woman who kills two minutes after swimming on the shore. There are literally no saving qualities to be found in this wasted celluloid stack. The only thing that was not wasted was the paper ... the script should not have lasted more than four pages. Surely no one has actually WRITTEN this meaningless dialogue. I am constantly amazed that such films have ever been made, much less published. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this waste of time. It is 75 minutes of my life that I will never return.
