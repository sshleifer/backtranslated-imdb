I really wanted to see this movie - I thought the plot was really unique and intriguing. A policeman (Andy Garcia) has a son who is dying and needs bone marrow replacement in order to live. The only game is a convicted serial killer who escapes from prison. To save his son, he must track down the killer. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton plays the condemned in one of the many disappointing aspects of the film. Keaton is a great actor sometimes, but here he is rather boring. It's exaggerated to the point where you stop worrying. <br /> <br /> Garcia is better, but he tries too hard for a film that is not up to par. Barbet Schroeder (once a promising director with films like "Barfly" that amounted to nothing in the American market) directs pretty well - I honestly thought the script was the culprit here ... it's just a big mess. br /> <br /> The film eventually wastes a lot of good material, good actors and a good director - all because of a bad script. What should have been a tense and inspiring film is just a Hollywood disaster.
