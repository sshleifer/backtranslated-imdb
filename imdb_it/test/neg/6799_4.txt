Bizarre. This film should be based on a famous photographer, but all that happens in this film is fiction. I imagine you try to explain why Diane Arbus had a fascination with oddities and made it her primary lens of photography. In the film, wolfman moves into the apartment above his. Apparently he becomes obsessed with him and falls for him. She puts her children and her husband in the background compared to the werewolf, and even tries to incorporate it into her family reunions. Some of the wolfman monster maniacs come to visit and she mixes with them. Everything is very bizarre. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Nothing memorable. There's just something weird about a woman getting her jollies from wolf shaving. I think you can find better movies out there.
