I would not have given this film such a low score (2) if its average had not been too high, but someone had to reduce it to something more reasonable. I sat for most of this movie, watching scenes after tagging and shoplifting scenes. No dialog box, just tagging and shoplifting. Finally the two taggers kissed. Something happened. But back to labeling and shoplifting. I left the screening. I recommend this film only to those who are impressed by pretentious film production. I didn't like the previous film by the directors (a hypocritical defense of man-boy love) but at least that film had a story, interesting characters, dialogues. The Graffiti Artist only had scenes after tagging and shoplifting scenes. I want more from a movie than this.
