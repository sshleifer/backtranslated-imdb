I took the North American premiere at the Chicago International Film Festival. I was over disappointed. From the mood of the public, I was not the only one. <br /> <br /> The film takes a long time to reach the conflict, and then refuses to solve it, opting instead to tell us that the story is "Continue". Is it a spoiler to reveal that a movie has no end? I consider it more a warning. This is, at best, only half the film - and not the good half.
