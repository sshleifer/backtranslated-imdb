In the last 5 years I have rented some bad movies ... completely on purpose. I see that I aspire to be a film critic and, as we all know, horrible films are released every year. However, about 3 months ago I rented this. I watched him all the way ... and I cried profusely. This is one of those movies that is so scary it makes you want to throw up. He actually put a sick feeling in his stomach. I've seen a lot of bad movies (Mystery Science Theater 3000 anyone?) But this takes the cake. The plot was difficult to follow, the lighting was horrible and the sound almost inaudible. If there was a negative rating on the scale here this film would be at -11 for me. This may sound strange, but I highly recommend it. It's something you have to see for yourself ... but don't say I didn't warn you. I don't think this review could be more precise, so I'm done now. <br /> <br />
