I imagine that after Leonard Nimoy succeeded in directing "Search for Spock" and "The Voyage Home", William Shatner thought he could direct too. Although he is a competent actor, he shows here that he is not a good director. <br /> <br /> Actually, this film is concrete proof in support of Trekkies' arguments that say that William Shatner is an arrogant self-centered. Although his character, Captain James Kirk, has probably always been the most important role in the original "Star Trek", it seems in this film that he is the heart of the film, the other two most important characters, Captain Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy, I'm just there to support him, and the other characters are there just to add comic relief. <br /> <br /> The plot is that some marginalized outcast of Vulcano named Sybok combines the mind with people and releasing the pain bottled up in that traumatic event at the beginning of life that changed them forever. Grateful, they join him in his quest to make the whole world free from pain and therefore in peace. Sybok and his followers requisition the building where a peace conference is held between a human diplomat, Klingon and Romulan. This attracts the still immobile Enterprise, as none of the other Starfleet ships have "experienced commanders" (honestly, with Starfleet management, the Klingons and Romulans should have conquered them years ago). Sybok adds the crew of the Enterprise, save Spock (who turns out to be secret brothers with Sybok), McCoy and Kirk. Sybok orders that the Enterprise decide to "reach the center of the universe" to meet "God", which apparently every race has a word for. However, it turns out that this is only a minor entity when it requires the use of the Enterprise and Kirk asks, "What does God need with a spaceship". The entity is destroyed, but not before Sybok, realizing he has been lying for years, sacrifices his life and earns Spock's respect in death after the Enterprise photon torpedoes destroy the entity and inexplicably Sybok as well. <br /> <br /> OK sci-fi movies are not known for realism, but at some point, rationality must be applied. Why do people follow Sybok just for releasing their pain? Why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event? I have certainly led a life without trauma. Why doesn't Kirk test his crew for mutiny and treason after joining Sybok? What was Sybok's point of sacrifice when torpedos were going to kill the entity anyway? <br /> <br /> So the plot is weak. Another problem is that Sybok, although played well by Lawrence Luckinbill, is portrayed badly. Just because he is an emotional volcanic does not mean he should behave exactly like a human religious fanatic. Shatner (who was a co-author and also the director) could at least develop a dialogue suitable for an emotional Vulcan. I guess he feels that any emotional being speaks like us. Damn, I guess that means the Klingons should say "it's not" and "not" more often than "not being" and "not doing it". And the Cardassians should not prolong their sentences because they like to talk (yes, I know it's sad that they know). Please ... every ST race uses a unique dialogue. Because Sybok is the exception. <br /> <br /> The only thing not to complain about is acting. I've always known "Star Trek" to have great actors, and this movie is no exception. Even the Cudos go to Leonard Nimoy, because it must have been difficult to interpret the casual Spock in his old age. <br /> <br /> Other things I didn't like: <br /> <br /> Shatner and the late DeForrest Kelly twice showed the bad singers singing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" in this movie. I imagine that Shatner wanted to silence his detractors of his singing ability. What he did was show their point of view. <br /> <br /> Uhura dances a fan wearing only tree bark to lure some men into an explosive trap. After all, the dreams of all of us men are full of images of chubby middle-aged women dancing naked. <br /> <br /> Comedy is good and good as long as it does not affect the nature of "Star Trek" too much, but when Scotty encounters an object on the Enterprise and KO itself, it is a bit exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Kirk is the only member of the crew who can refuse Sybok's offer to release his inner pain and see through the deception of God the impostor. Can not even Spock handle one of these? Perhaps these scenes were valantine by Shatner to his character, like many suspects. <br /> <br /> The concept of an entity posing as God had been used in "Star Trek" before this film more than once. Be creative, Shatner. <br /> <br /> Speaking of incivility, I didn't specifically care about the tearing of the music of "Star Trek: the Next Generation". <br /> <br /> All in all, rather ugly "Trek" movie. If you're a Trekkie, watch it once because it's "Star Trek". Otherwise, look at "Star Trek II: the wrath of Khan". It is much better.
