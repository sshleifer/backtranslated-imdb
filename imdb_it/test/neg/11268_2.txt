If you're in the mood for a really nasty porn without good porn combined with a really bad horror movie, this movie is perfect for you. However, if you breathe air, make sure you spend your time watching anything but this. Acting is disgusting. The "plot" is disgusting. They try too hard, and all the time I was waiting for the only saving scene that could make the movie worth seeing. No. Attack with the encrypted cable.
