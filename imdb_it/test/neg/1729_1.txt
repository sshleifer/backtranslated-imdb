This is a catastrophic film, in both meanings. Every character, every role, every conversation, every touch, everything in this movie sucks. It's a shame to see Dennis Hopper's talent wasted in this terrible movie. I can give you hundreds of examples but see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Or rather: don't do it.
