What on earth? Like watching an episode of Neighbors after drinking two bottles of cough medicine, for the nightmare and without any sense. I was waiting for the smart part where everything fits and saves the film. Maybe he was there and I missed him, or I was lost. <br /> <br /> My strongest suspicion is that it is a veiled attempt to market a new drug that is about to hit the streets. I wouldn't say "don't look at it", but I'll say it's pretty sparse at all levels, as are high-definition drams. Whack. Unless you drink two bottles of cough syrup. So it's just dandy.
