Let's face it, a really terrible movie, no ... I mean a "really" horrible movie, it's a rare thing, strange and beautiful to watch. I admit there's a special place in my heart for films like Plan 9 From Outer Space, Half Caste, Species, etc. And even though I'm giving this movie a 1, I strongly urge anyone who loves a bad movie for what it is is really (a bad movie) finding a friend, snacks, something to drink and making the special occasion it deserves: Aussie Park Boyz . <br /> <br /> From the very first moments of the performance as a protagonist at the side of the eyes, while trying to inject the intensity directly into the film without ever looking at a camera (a slice of ham with silent images - keep your heart out Rudolph Valentino) hey-we are at the end of the film, you ... don't ... stop ... laughing. <br /> <br /> To summarize the film, the Warriors of a poor man below, complete - and that description alone should be sufficient, but then come the wonders of "the scene of eating spaghetti", "the" We they have their tickets, they will not leave the city now "scene", "They are Asians! Run !!" and more. The only really questionable part is a rape filmed for free. Outside of this, I challenge you to watch this movie. And I challenge you to find evidence of acting, jokes, direction, or those other boring and superfluous elements that the so-called critics say a film needs to be judged good. <br /> <br /> If this film does not cause uncontrollable laughter before it ends, all I can do is roll my eyes threateningly from side to side and shout: "You dog, dog, dog!"
