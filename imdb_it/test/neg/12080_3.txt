<br /> <br /> This film was produced and published as a successor to a frightening California beach comedy called Hardbodies, but has little or no connection to the previous film and is best rated completely in its own right film. It is certainly better than Hardbodies I, and is more closely related to films like Venus and Summer Lovers which were also filmed during the summer in the Greek islands. The combination of beautiful beaches on blue bays with beautiful bare breasts makes the vision seductive, but (except for travel journals designed to help you plan your next vacation) these films also require an appropriate plot if they want to attract the attention of spectators for more than a few minutes. Venus was supported by the legend of the reincarnation of the goddess, and Summer Lovers had as its theme the validity of a "menage a trois". In my opinion both these films have been much more successful than Hardbodies II, which has a very tenuous plot and is too dependent on the simplistic semi-slapstick comedy. The use of slapstick quickly becomes boring, usually leading to a series of autonomous cameo sequences that are difficult to integrate into a continuous plot. Mel Brooks achieved this brilliantly with Silent Movie, but few other films have succeeded in the same way, and Hardbodies II unfortunately not. There is also the problem that the slapstick sequences do not coexist happily with the idyllic and peaceful scenario in which the film is set. The airport's final sequences were no doubt destined to provide a hilarious ending for this film, but in my opinion they are an example of the worst kind of exaggerated slapstick pseudo-comedy. They too are too long, so I left the cinema with a bad taste left in my mouth. This is a film that could have been much more successful with a stronger plot and most of its very heavily pruned slapstick sequences. Since it was released, it certainly does not guarantee a score of spectators greater than 3. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of memorable in the acting, but the cast does its best within the limits imposed by a line poor plot and bad direction - It is in these latter areas that failure occurs. <br /> <br />
