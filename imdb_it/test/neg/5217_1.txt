Boring, resentful story, one of the worst directions I've ever met, a dull acting and a horrible clich√©. The film ends with one of the main characters waking up from a dream. WHAT IS WITH THAT? Even JR of Dallas failed to survive that strange twist. <br /> <br /> You have what can only be described as an inappropriate relationship that develops between a main character and a girl, who is apparently destined to be paternal, but who turns out to be perverse. You have special effects for the student community's film school with Kimberly Hole-sized faults. This is how Children of the Corn meets the Passion of Christ imposed on an endless cycle of government administration training videos - in the end, if you're not thinking of finishing it, you have no brain. <br /> <br /> Don't worry.
