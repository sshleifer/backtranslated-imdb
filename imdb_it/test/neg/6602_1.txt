Usually when a biographical film is published on a celebrity, it is at least campy (ie Cybill Shepherd as Martha Stewart, Lauren BaCall as Doris Duke), this is the most horrendous, economic and BORING television movie ever made. If VH-1 is going to make a movie for television, they have to spend a little more money on them. Flex Alexander - although endowed with the voice of Michael - is not a great dancer, does not look a little like Michael, and does not even have his mannerisms. VH-1 would have done better by hiring a real imitator, that way when they see Michael getting into plastic surgery, he actually doesn't come out looking EXACTLY the same. Why should we be taken aback by the narrowing of Michael's nose when he is exactly the same size as at the beginning of the film? The woman who plays Elizabeth Taylor can't act and doesn't look like her, and she doesn't even let me start the woman like Janet Jackson. A terrible script and a serious case of miscasting must prevent VH-1 from producing other films. Flex Alexander would have made a much better JERMAINE JACKSON than Michael. Costumes? Cheating scams. Neverland? Spliced ​​together movies from news documents. Don't worry about it .... it's not worth it even remotely. The only beautiful piece of casting - the actor who plays Joseph Jackson and MAYBE the actress as Lisa Marie Presley, although it should have been more masculine than a girl.
