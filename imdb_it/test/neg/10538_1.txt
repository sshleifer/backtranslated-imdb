My opinion: Steven Seagal is obviously too boring to star in an action thriller, albeit a totally boring one. <br /> <br /> Remember Steven Seagal? You do not do it? Don't worry, there's not much to recover. After having acted in films that are pleasantly pleasing to the crowd as UNDER SIEGE and EXECUTIVE DECISION, Seagal hits the shallow depths of the abyss of the bad movie. Now, he's the star of B's ​​low-level action vehicles, some of which are "Movies of the Week" titles made for TV that have lost their way to the big screen. HALF PAST DEAD is among these, let's say, dead action films. A noisy and bad action film, badly directed and written lazily (and worse, badly agitated). This is one of those bad movies that I don't need to look to the end to know it's ugly. I didn't have the courage to kill all my brains while I was wasting my time with this. It's this kind of bad movie you realize, those other movies you hate aren't that bad. <br /> <br /> The plot (and venue) is completely relieved of a similar image, THE ROCK by Michael Bay, although similar may not be the word to describe it. Both films are summer films and are not meant to be taken so seriously. But in comparison, THE ROCK (which is not so much in the writing department as in the lights and sounds) also has better characters, a more compelling storyline, better action sequences and, overall, a more fun atmosphere. Even if there are action scenes in PAST, none of them is exciting. This is sometimes boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> Although predictability seemed to be a welcome asset in summer action movies, predictability has never tasted harsher in those that are not fun, and HALF PAST DEED is never really fun , a lot of times it's just a pain in the head (hearing bad music repeating over and over again during this movie makes me want an aspirin every second I hear them). The acting is horrendously mediocre, the plot is derived, without any appealing or appealing characters. The character of Seagal, an undercover agent sent to Alcatraz to stop a criminal mind (Morris Chestnut), a very boring villain, is nothing to be excited about. Seagal's character also has a sidekick (played by rap star Ja Rule) and a group of amigo inmates, and there's no chemistry here. <br /> <br /> If you starred in a series of other forgotten action vehicles (what were those films again?) killed forever by Seagal's career, HALF PAST DEAD is excessive. And the public must be warned: you are invited to feel pain. Tip: avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 5.
