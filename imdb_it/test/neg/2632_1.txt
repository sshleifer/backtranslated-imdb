This film made me sick, I couldn't even see the ending. Milo's voice was too low and I couldn't understand what he was saying, as well as some of Kendra's lines. Also, where did he get all these wedding dresses; it was very impractical. The film failed to describe Milo's drowning and how he made people ridicule Dr. Jeter and his practice. Overall, I was disappointed that I wasn't able to give this film a zero rating because by classifying this film as one, I felt I was giving him an undeserved eulogy.
