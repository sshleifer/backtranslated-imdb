I'm not surprised to find user comments for this film full of nonsense, like that this film "[shows] that when it's predestined, love will find a way". I begin this way, not to criticize a specific reviewer, but because this quotation characterizes the hyperbolic and uncritical molasses that has been poured on this film, even before it hit the theaters. Even the best films do not "prove" anything, nor are they intended to do so. The best films entertain and move the viewer, and "The English Patient" fails on both criteria. <br /> <br /> I remember very clearly the promotion of "The English Patient" studio: "From the producers of 'Amadeus' and" Someone flew over the cuckoo's nest, "he announced in style. An ignorant or negligent listener could lose the crucial word, "producers", in this elusive statement and mistakenly associate the director of "The English Patient", so inopportune, with the true great director, Milos Forman. Such a confrontation is offensive to Mr. Forman's memory. br /> <br /> While Michael Ondaatje's novel on which the film was based is good, it is a pity that the film failed to capture any quality of the book in any way, apart from the plot elements that seem to be just randomly similar, the film bears little resemblance to the novel, despite the doubts that began when I heard that promotion shamelessly misleading, I went to see this film in the theater. As it began to unfold, I realized that rendering ing of the particular magic of the novel had failed, that the actors knew their words but not their characters, and that their characters were flat, boring and not engaging. The film was a complete parody of Ondaatje's novel and a cinematic artifact born in the worst description. <br /> <br /> Those who flow into this film are very likely to speak with adjectives such as "sweeping" and "grandiose" and "hypnotic". Well, it's none of those. In fact, not even Ondaatje's beautiful novel could be described as "radical" or "grandiose". It could be described as "magical" and "hypnotic" - but these are exactly the qualities that the film failed to provide. It is almost as if Minghella had, as a reader, completely lost what was precious in the novel and could have depicted only a pale and skeletal version on celluloid, a version that not only lacked the spirit of history, but focused on the wrong characters. He produced a filmic transliteration that not only had no respect for the metaphors of history, but no apparent knowledge of them. <br /> <br /> Minghella has diverted attention from Hana and Kip and put it on the Patient and on Katherine Clifton, thus missing the narrative trail of the novel and its "essence". <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas put on shows that are not engaging, not exciting, not engaging, without emotions that were obviously intended to convey a great, passionate, passionate love affair with the viewer, but that of fact only provided an inexplicable, superficial connection between two flat, superficial and uninteresting adulterers. Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and not very exciting, and none of the performances provided the viewer with a great emotional response, obviously intended by Minghella's grandiose and exaggerated presentation. <br /> <br /> The "great, radical, David-Lean-like" qualities to which the many indiscriminate reviewers of this goofy movie like to refer are simply not there. The comparison with David Lean ("Dr. Zhivago") is decidedly offensive to yet another great director. Take, for example, the sandstorm scene of the "Patient", which is undoubtedly one in which these "grandiose" qualities are believed to have resided (or should have resided): the sandstorm is not great - it is not not even convincing. The subsequent burial of the characters in the car and their appearance after the storm, which undoubtedly should have dramatically and emotionally influenced the viewer, lacked drama or emotion completely - in fact, because he was so obviously weak, he had an air of comedy in this regard, in which the play was clearly out of place. <br /> <br /> This film has failed. He failed as a rendering of the novel and failed as a film. It seems to have been the "vehicle of the anointed Oscars" of the year (joining a movie like "Kramer vs. Kramer" or "Terms of tenderness"). One cannot but thank God that even the acclaimed Acadamy had the good sense to present the award for best actress to Frances McDormand for her truly deserving performance in the truly excellent film, "Fargo". There was not a single performance in the execrable "English patient" which was neither an awkward awful effect (Willem Dafoe), nor a mediocre and truly forgettable acting (Fiennes and Scott Thomas). <br /> <br /> Because this does not - The content of a film preserves a coven of fanatical devotees (and clearly insipid) will remain a mystery. Fortunately, the sands of time will definitely bury this mediocrity of a film, and fortunately it will not have the strength to dig.
