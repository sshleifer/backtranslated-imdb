WOW! What a horrible, horrible waste of time this celluloid atrocity turned out to be. I remember seeing it years ago and thinking it was fun but now ... it's just silly. Not to mention the fact that it's a blatant rip-off of "The Exorcist" to the point where it was republished at one point with the title "The Sex-orcist". The only real difference is that the producers have the courage to further discredit themselves by slapping on the claim that the events in the film are REAL! Who, in their right mind, would ever have believed such a bold lie? To make matters worse, there was a video in circulation with covers that brazenly tried to cash in on the "Rocky Horror Picture Show" by throwing a couple of lips on the cover! How low could it ever sink? Do not be fooled by false statements, brazen lies or theft of the title, because you will be SORLY disappointed if you do!
