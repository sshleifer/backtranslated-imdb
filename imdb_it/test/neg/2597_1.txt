It is literally the three marmittoni again, without the charm. This show is nothing but the worst slapstick. I'm surprised they actually have writers. The so-called jokes are completely random, and "controversial" for anything other than trying very (very) difficult to be controversial. And people think this is 'sharp' ?? Get a clue: this show requires absolutely no thought, time, effort, money or creativity / originality to produce. Any present reference is addressed to anyone between the ages of 6 and 16 who occasionally browse through People magazine. But I suppose this is what all the children want, they need today.
