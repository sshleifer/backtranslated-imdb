Before I throw this film away, I just want to say that I loved it. <br /> <br /> First of all, how many times in the film did the characters use the phrase "You're right"? I'm sure I was counting in hundreds before giving up and started watching the movie again. <br /> <br /> Secondly, what the hell is with those blue monkey things? OK, so the Dansen family led a very private life and had a brown eye with a blue eye, but since when does it turn people into carnivorous creatures of underground and carnivorous zombies? <br /> <br /> and finally, "The old faithful here will protect me 'hahaha :)
