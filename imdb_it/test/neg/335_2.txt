I made great efforts to get this film after reading the comments on this site. I don't really have time to write reviews, but I felt that this was my duty as a sci-fi horror fan. This is only the second review I wrote. The other was for Dracula 3000. Now to the point. This movie sucked. Clear and simple. I kept wondering if I was watching the same movie as someone who wrote all those "adorable" comments. I've seen movies with bad effects, bad acting, bad sound, you call it and I've seen it. But this really sucked. I don't care how much it costs or does not cost, movies like this and Dracula 3000 should be banned and the entire cast and crew arrested and jailed for time murder. By the way, I said this movie sucked. I mean really sucked. The plot didn't exist and the acting was weak. It seems that the writer saw Pitch Black and got angry because he didn't think of a story like that before, so he decided to create his ripped version. But instead, the sucking factor took over and possessed him. DO NOT LOOK AT THIS. You will have more fun if you pull your pants down and sit on hot coals.
