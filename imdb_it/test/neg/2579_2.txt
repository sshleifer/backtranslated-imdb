Steven Seagal's intent is to be praised, and his acting in this film is the same as in many of his others, if you ignore the fact that he is supposed to portray a brilliant scientist. The problem I had was with two elements of the plot, which extended my suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking point. <br /> <br /> First of all, how is it that a carefully engineered variation on a bad germ, whose antidote must be equally carefully researched and designed by a large laboratory, is cured by drinking tea from a flower that grows high in the mountains? and that grandfather's family seems to be the only person who knows anything about this? <br /> <br /> Second, and this really takes the cake: Having collected enough of the care to fix an entire city, you would expect the army to land the helicopter and start running with bags of flowers at all the houses in this small town? No, they decide instead to sprinkle flowers all over the city and force the sick to go out and reunite them again. Simply silly, unless, according to the Native belief, the power in the drug depends in some way on the fact that someone came out and picked the flowers. <br /> <br /> Add the cardboard nature of the villains and the inadequacy of the title, and you might think that my vote on this film is really high.
