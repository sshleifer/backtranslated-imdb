I was so excited to finally see "Pulse" after receiving it from Amazon, and I must say that I was totally disappointed. Maybe I think I was too publicized. I had expectations set by his fans that simply could not be met. After loving other Asian horrors, I thought I knew this would find a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The story was slow, so painfully. I'm a varied horror fan. I love the brutal and bloody madness of "The Devil's Rejects" and I love the constant and growing macabre of "A Tale of Two Sisters" in the same way. "Pulse" offered little to both ghosts, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Along with the slowness of the plot, he was also very confused. I had no idea why the characters were doing what they were doing and how what they were doing would help their problem. It seemed that the director made the plot in one or two sentences and the rest was impropted by our actors. Unlike "A Tale of Two Sisters", which also has a rather difficult plot to follow, "Pulse" detaches very little at the end and makes me feel frustrated, confused and uninterested in the efforts of the characters. My final statement on the plot was its inconsistency. At first it seemed that the story concerned the overflowing ghost world and their means of escape was the Internet. It's a damn original idea. I like it. But while the plot continues to buzz, the holes in the plot and the inexplicable events that stand tall, it seems that the director has switched to an apocalyptic story (evident from the ending) that it was not clear enough to be performed. <br /> <br /> I realize the squalor of the shots and the setting was intended to make the viewer sad and isolated, but the film's obtuseness was only intensified by the large, shady surroundings. I have to admit that there was a certain feeling of surrealism with the film, but that might have been just my attention falling in and out. <br /> <br /> Even the actions of some characters are a bit ridiculous, and perhaps if I were more fascinated by the story I would have been able to suspend disbelief but also myself being unmotivated, so too some of the characters. As mentioned above, the logic behind what some characters did was absent and contributed to the inconsistency of the plot. Perhaps it was the result of the inconsistency of the plot that the characters do questionable things. To be honest I don't really care. <br /> <br /> The acting was decent. Definitely nothing exceptional but nothing terrible. No anomalous elements to mention on both sides of the brilliant or horrible normal. <br /> <br /> Now I'll stop looking so sharp and say there were a handful of gruesome moments. One towards the end, especially if there was something more in everything, I would have liked this film (almost) entirely. I thought that whenever the website was shown it was quite disturbing, as well as some of the ghostly encounters that our two protagonists face. The things that happened between these horrible run-ins were just too dull, baffling and "WTF" for me to really appreciate. <br /> <br /> Now for something about the DVD itself ... The "Pulse" release of Magnolia comes with subtitles, yes, but the subtitles are disabled. They are not told at the right time in the character's speech. It may seem fussy, but it bothered me a little and could annoy others. I think this is the only movie release in North America, so whether you have to treat or watch dubbing (NEVER LOOK AT DUBBING !!!) I tried to enjoy the movie, I really did. I wanted this film to live up to the hype ... but unfortunately, it fell for me. If you're looking for another creepy Asian cinema, I can recommend "Audition", "Shutter", "A tale of two sisters", "Strange Circus" and "Marebito": these are all things I like best.
