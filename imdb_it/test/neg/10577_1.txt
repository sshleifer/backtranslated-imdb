This film was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was a total waste of money. If I had not been to the cinema it was my two young cousins ​​(who thought it was disappointing, but not as terrible as I thought), I would have left the cinema. There were two points in the film that I almost laughed at, but the rest was boring, ridiculous or painful. I thought it would be a parody of all superhero movies (which I love), but it was actually based primarily on Spiderman, with some oblique references to other superhero films like Fantastic Four and Batman. I really can't think of a good thing to say about this movie. Don't waste your money with this movie - there are many other better movies out there!
