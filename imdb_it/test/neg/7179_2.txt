This is undoubtedly the worst film in the Hamilton saga and the worst actor to do Carl Hamilton. Peter Stormare can't do it, with his psychotic and unstyled appearance. It might be nice to do murderers and psychotic maniacs like in "Fargo" or "8mm", but in this kind of roles, it's just useless. <br /> <br /> The presence of Lena Olin did not serve this film. He couldn't save him from being what he is: an Americanized copy of big-budget action films like "Goldeneye", "Die Hard 3", "Broken Arrow" etc. This film has nothing Swedish about it, but the actors. It is clear that some Norweagians have just created the director with McTiernan as a director. <br /> <br /> The presence of Mark Hamill is just ridiculous. 2 out of 10
