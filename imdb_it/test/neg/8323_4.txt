An atrocious offense to the memory and genius of Welles, this senseless assemblage of self-indulgent improvisation on a great theme should have been locked up in the warehouse along with other unfinished projects by Welles that no one had ever seen. Now we know why! To add further insult to the previous prejudice, the dreadful dubbing in English of American amateur dubbing actors and even the great man in person does nothing but accentuate all the sloppy errors in narration and construction. It is as if every weekend a good-hearted Spanish soul gave Orson some weights, a 35mm camera and some short films of negative film left by some other production and told Welles to go to the country and continue to shoot anything and everything until the film's storage expires. It is true that if Orson had really shaped this film himself, the infamous Jesus Franco, he could have thrown away 85% of what he shot, but we'll never know. Since Welles has never had time to change his work here, and somewhere along the road where he or his heirs have authorized someone else to do it, he is not entirely blameless for the debacle. Those who wish to prove that in his early days Welles was the luckiest of the young because he surrounded himself with artists such as John Houseman, Herman Mankewiecz, Greg Toland, Bernard Hermann and Robert Wise did not need better proof than his adult inadequacies of this mess of a movie. In his sad old age, Welles was able to do anything when he needed some money or pesos, including the sale of his artistic soul. The devil certainly got his debt with this!
