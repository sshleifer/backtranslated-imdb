I've been in a bad film series. This is a clinker on an arson plot and a psychopath. Tom Skerrit, who I really like, was very young here. He is a builder with a passion, but he has a partner whose profit motive includes insurance and excessive use. In the mix comes an agent, who is drowned, his daughter, and her dizzying boyfriend. James Mason plays the insurance investigator. Any idiot, given a little warning, would know that there was something rotten in the Australian nation. Still, they mumble their way. The most interesting thing for me is that the huge hotel that was going to be built never went beyond being a bunch of sticks. Low budget, I guess. The plot could have been interesting. Maybe they should have hired a film editor (the fact?). Half of the time we don't know where the characters are, but I guarantee that a compensation of five million dollars would probably have made strict supervision of the structure mandatory. Does not work Although there is a lot of clean fire.
