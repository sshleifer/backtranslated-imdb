Seriously, all these Satan films on Earth always involve Catholics. Because Lucifer never messes with other names. <br /> <br /> The plot is that Asmodeus (played by former Jason Vorhees Kane Hodder) has a plot to become human (but he wasn't always a demon) by getting this girl who is his pregnant sister to his son. Except maybe she's not his sister. The plot is not clear on this, and they connect these scenes in which he is seeing a shrink on his problem. <br /> <br /> The main character gets pregnant while still a virgin, with an incredibly disturbing scene from her father who did a gynecological exam to show that her hymen is still intact .... Eeeewwwwww. His sister (played by a lavender and much worse looking to wear Denise Crosby) concludes that this is a sign from heaven. Be praised! <br /> <br /> Well, the demon child takes the mother's body for a joyful ride and picks up, in order, a truck driver, her friend's boyfriend and her friend, all guarded by a former military priest whose mission is to kill the child when he was born. We find out that Asmodeus is actually a Catholic cardinal who is handling the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The ending is practically incomprehensible, and if you could make it all the way through, you have a stronger stomach than me. (I paused the movie a couple of times, it was so terrible.)
