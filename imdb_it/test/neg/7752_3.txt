Albert Pyun presents his vision of the lost city of Atlantis - and it is a vision so cluttered with claustrophobic settings, strange costumes and noisy, "eccentric" secondary characters that one thing is certain: you want to get out of there as soon as possible (unfortunately it will take about 80 minutes). The story of "Alice in Wonderland" is sinuous and uninteresting, and there was probably no actress in the world who could have turned it into a good movie, even though Kathy Ireland made a captivating attempt (boring voice and all) .
