I mistakenly thought this was the 70s art movie on the bed that people eat, which seemed interesting. It is not. Interesting, I mean let alone on a man-eating bed. <br /> <br /> I assume that Stuart Gordon put his name on this in the same spirit that Lloyd Kaufman puts "Troma" on practically everything that was shot with a video camera, in the interest of building a library in franchising. Little else can be said of this opus different from the execution time is less than 90 minutes. This is obviously a bed infested with the spirit of a man or something that once killed a woman with a wig and long false eyelashes. Along the way we get ** a five-minute opening sequence of credits (is that for "Lawrence Of Arabia" even if long?) ** a murderer with contacts of Marylin Manson who kills using the same troll technique in "Cat's Eye "** demonstrations of a sexual practice Michael Hutchence may have employed ** a preview of what Emilio Estevez will soon appear and act like ** soft core porn even though Cinemax would switch to ** manbutt and a topless ** scene to wacky (or is it "whack" -ee?) that ended involving involuntarily exhilarating hammer blows and remaining strawberry cake (well, it seemed so for me) ** and a rudimentary surprise that ended with nothing. It is as if the writer had fallen asleep on the "bed of death" before finishing the last draft. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not sexy, it's shot on high definition video and it doesn't look bad, but it doesn't even look good enough to not be bad enough to be funny and so is it all the rest. Probably no one would have ever seen or heard of it unless it was on a record with another film, the "double feature" of our day. I wasn't paying attention to parts of it so I might have lost something. But for some reason I doubt it. Evaluation: PASS
