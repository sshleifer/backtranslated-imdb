Being the science fiction fan I am, I was always curious about this movie. So I was excited to finally see Journey to the Far Side of the Sun released on a cheap DVD (the previous press had raised $ 100 on eBay - I'm sure those people would like to have their money back - but more in a second). <br /> <br /> However, the premise of this film (just like "The Parallel" of Twilight Zone) is that there is an unknown planet that looks like Earth on the other side of the sun. This planet is exactly like ours, except that it is inverted. This basically means that their letters are reversed and people drive on the wrong side of the road. <br /> <br /> Does it look intriguing? Well, that's pretty much everything in this movie. The first hour or so is dedicated to the preparations for the journey to this other planet. They are just boring scenes of interruptions that are pressed, banal dialogues, etc. It does not make sense. Gerry Anderson has managed to find the most boring British actors in film history to play most of the roles. I mean they are so boring that I'm surprised the crew was able to stay awake to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> However, once the crew FINALLY lands on the planet (after an interminable sequence of astronauts sitting and literally sleeping in the cockpit), Roy Thinnes notes that the copy is all back in a bottle of cologne and jump on another ship to tell people about what he discovered. Oops never gets to do it while he lands and dies. The end! Oh wait, there's a bonus scene of one of the space executives rushing towards a mirror in his wheelchair at the end. I guess he wanted to get out of this movie too. I'm really surprised that a film like this can also be made in the 1960s. Rent if necessary. DO NOT BUY.
