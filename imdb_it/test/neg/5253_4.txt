I've heard a lot about Beowulf, maybe because I'm Romanian and a lot of the film was shot here in my country. And I expected a lot from this movie. In the end, I was disappointed. It's not as horrible as other users have said, but it's definitely negative. It is a monster that kills people in a sixth century castle and Lambert the one who comes to kill him. Lambert is good, as he is in all his roles, but the rest of the characters sucks, and the action isn't too good either. Also maybe the only thing that could have saved this movie, the special effects, are also bad, the monster looks horrible (not scary, but terrible). Oh and another bad thing: music. The film seeks and manages to create the atmosphere of the sixth century. But all the action sequences are presented on rock music, which is very bad. I mean rock action works perfectly on a movie like Charlie's Angels - where it's the perfect way to shoot your action. But here, it was a bad idea. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10.
