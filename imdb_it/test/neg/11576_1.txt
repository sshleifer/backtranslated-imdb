I was watching the science fiction channel when this pile of steaming shit came out. Although not as bad as Wynorski's "Curse of the Komodo", this still sucks ... BAD. Wynorski uses the same island as "Komodo Curse", as do the actors themselves and the house itself. The effects are top notch (surprising) but that's all ........ I don't know what else to say about this movie ....... oh yes! As in "Curse of Komodo", the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island! Also .... when I saw this part I laughed hysterically ... A KOMANBRA !!! (part man, komodo AND cobra!). Overall this film is a real pity even for bad movie standards. Just remember if Jim Wynorski had something to do with a movie ... keep it clear .... to avoid falling asleep keep repeating "It's almost over. It's almost over ...". 0 out of 5.
