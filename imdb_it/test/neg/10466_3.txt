Another Indian legend you have never heard of before is unleashed. As the name suggests, this is a vindictive wraith that loves to absorb people's skeletons while they are still using them. As usual, the ancient cemeteries (one can say "Poltergeist?") Have been disturbed by the greedy land developers who build stuff. <br /> <br /> The CGI, if it had been better, could have made the effect more treacherous, but they skimped on the budget, and shows - for comic effect. Probably the unleashed creature should have been kept off stage during his first numerous murders - which could have added some mystery or imminent atmosphere of destruction - but the inept director decided to show us in the first five minutes as it seems, it wasn't impressive. The deaths are just bad, again with a poor CGI. I imagine that ancient spirits always kill using low-cost special effects. As for the "victims", they watch as they laugh at all times while doing nonsense. It is always obvious who will take it: a character with only a few lines shows up, strange noises are heard, CGI points fly, the characters come out. Repeat (several times). <br /> <br /> However, there are some hunting scenes that show the monster that made this thing visible. Unfortunately, the director seems to use them as a device to use (so it's used too often) when he can't think of anything else his characters can do. Overall, it's pretty silly, but I've seen worse. This movie is cheap, but it's strangely fun to watch.
