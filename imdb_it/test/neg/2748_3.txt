Before seeing this film, I had heard some negative comments about it. However, observing it I found myself thinking "ok, it's a bit slow, but it's quite interesting". While it was built towards the end, it created a complex moral dilemma, leading to a shocking but, in the context of the film, an entirely credible decision with extremely powerful dramatic consequences. If this had been followed, it would have been a tremendously powerful ending and would have given me a very positive impression of the film. <br /> <br /> However, due to an ending that not only faces emotionally, turning on a useless happy ending without real emotional credibility, but also in the context of the film, it makes absolutely no sense for you to clearly see one of the characters take action that should end his life, but inexplicably not. Incidentally, please tell me if I missed something here and there is a reason why it survives because I just couldn't as logically as it could have and that ruined my entire movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that, all three leads give life to powerful performances, although the transformation of Kevin McKidd's characters eventually goes a little further than is fully convincing and creates an ethical triangle very powerful. <br /> <br /> This film is recommended if you prepare to go out when the mother and sister are lying on the bed. But look no further than this unless you have only a pinch, but several mountains of salt.
