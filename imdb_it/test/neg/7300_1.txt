A post-apocalyptic warrior leaves to save a kind of nun and on the way he meets some cyber-punks on skates that want to kick his ass. This is one of the most difficult movies to watch ever. There are scenes with silence that seem to last hours before someone comes out with the next sentence poorly written and misinterpreted. There are action sequences that continue to repeat themselves - and we are not talking about the repetition of 1-2-3 rapid-fire action on a particularly good kick made popular by Eastern directors, we are talking about many, many repetitions of long combat sequences and bad. At first this is incredibly confusing, but then it becomes annoying as you watch a 30 second sequence for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time. Every kind of plot or vision is lost in the confused continuity, the only thing that keeps this film in the videoplayer (apart from the bet of a friend that I couldn't watch it all the way without asking for it to be turned off and safely disposed that can hurt anyone else) is the fact that, although painful, this film is unintentionally exhilarating, I'm not at all a fan of those films "so bad that it's funny" but in parts i was in tears. Other points to note are the quality of the sound and the image, but this is forgivable as it is obvious that money was a big problem in the making of this film. Final judgment - The king of the genre "so bad is funny", anyone who has that kind of genre video night should get a copy. Also, let's not forget that it's actually the worst movie I've ever seen.
