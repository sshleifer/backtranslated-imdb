The only reason for me to watch this little-known Irish film was the question that Mike Myers would play a normal and dramatic character. Well, he could and his acting was pretty good, but unfortunately that was probably the only good thing I can say about this movie. At the beginning the film follows the life of the twelve year old orphan Mickey who lives with his brother and his sister with their somewhat eccentric grandmother. Despite a strong language it seems like a family film, but after a while it becomes clear that Pete's Meteor is not suitable for the drama of the young audience. And the worst is that it is a drama with a plot so ridiculous and even totally unlikely. An absurd plot turns into another and there is always not much sense in the events on the screen. I suppose when a life drama needs a meteor or something that looks like an even more ridiculous spiritual content, this is really a bad sign. The characters are not much better than a story. Despite all his problems, the young Mickey is not at all a nice character, but it is clear that somehow we had to worry about him and feel a strong liking for him. It doesn't work The same thing with other characters. They are mostly ridiculous like the story itself with the title character (even if it wasn't the main character) as the only bright spot. Towards the end of the film I still had a strong hope that behind all this there was that improbability and an absurdity. Unfortunately, even if the writer of the story had such intentions (and I'm sure it was) in the film, they are hidden and practically imperceptible under such a strange script. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10. Those of you who are interested in seeing Mike Myers as a stage actor can watch Pete's Meteor for that reason, but the rest of the spectators will most likely be bitterly disappointed.
