Why? Why? Why on earth no one tells the truth about this horrible film HORRIBLE? I wake up again in the morning and ask God why he didn't stop me from seeing this revolting "comedy". I can't believe I paid to see this crime to my cinematic taste. I'm starting to think that the 5 stars he has are because of the nakedness of Martha Higareda and all the men who can't buy a porn movie and avoid seeing it ... I'll call it "what" because calling it a movie is an insult to Mexican film industry. The characters are a big clich√©, the acting provokes an involuntary laugh and the script is ... well, I can't believe that a human being wrote this. And just when you thought you were tortured enough ... the last half hour is so painful that I wanted to tear out my eyes. The only good thing I can say about this abomination is that it only lasts 90 minutes (which would seem like centuries, but still). Really, AVOID PAIN !!!
