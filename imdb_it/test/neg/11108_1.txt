This is another original film from the Sci-Fi channel that stares Rhys Davies where it is difficult to decide which are the worst things, acting or writing / directing / production (John Sheppherd stamps all three.) Basic story: the an obsessed exobiologist captures the Chubacabra monster, smuggles a cargo container aboard a cruise ship, and flees and starts a bloodbath. Cliched science fiction of the robust captain with his beautiful daughter, a handsome hero and a mad scientist. Captian calls a terrorist alert for the ship (since he obviously won't believe a monster story). No dramatic helicopter launch of the Navy Seals here. The budget is allowed only for the entire force of the force of eight seals to arrive in a fiberglass fishing boat and ride a ship on board. Puleeze. Even the computerized animation of the ship that you could do better on your computer. I also liked when the seal commander who watched through standard binoculars ten miles away was able to see three people jumping off the ship. If the Sci-Fi channel continues the original films, I hope they realize that the audience is not at the kindergarten level and buys better screenplays and directors. If this were direct to the video you will find it in the 99 cent basket.
