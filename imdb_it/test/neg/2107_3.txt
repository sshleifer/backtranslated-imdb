For their merit, this is one of their most competent pieces of junk, and this is due to the fact that there is a sizable gore and an interesting interpretation of "Snakes on a Plane". But, if there is another example of inconsistency behind the new Asylum scam, they are the two characters at the beginning who are illegal immigrants and cannot understand or speak English with a Texas man who is stealing them across the border, yet when they arrive on a train and meet a friend, they begin to understand and speak perfect English. <br /> <br /> Besides being a rather ugly representation of a Hollywood formula, "Snakes on a Train" is absolutely boring. At least, with "Snakes on a Plane" we were given the opportunity to look at ceremonious actors and try to be remotely interesting. The episode of Mallachi Brothers includes some of the most boring characters I've ever seen, from an electrical engineer (hi, I wonder how it will be useful later), to some stoner surfers, to our two main characters trying to fight from the curse of the snake that lurks in the husband's wife. <br /> <br /> "Snakes" is never fun, and even when it's very gory, it's never as nice as it has the chance to be, because "Snakes" may have been a fun short film, and instead it takes too seriously and never sets off at any moment. Instead of taking their small budget and making original films that can create a precedent, they instead force their small budget to work against them in these knock-offs. While the Mallachi brothers seem to be trying, the train seems incredibly artificial. <br /> <br /> It almost seems like a theatrical game with these fickle and terribly insignificant pieces that desperately try to look like real railway cars, while every now and then it shakes, the background of the windows is blurred and the sound effects go out every now let us know that I'm actually on a train; not to mention the fact that there are about ten passengers in such an extensive train. And beyond the train fighting and a grueling sex scene, we are forced to suffer a plot that makes no sense. Nor can the filmmakers circumvent the fact that the "deadly" snakes that move on this train seem far from poisonous or dangerous. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film focuses only on a minute of snake-like carnage and a bad sub-plot of a former drug agent trying to harass a passenger. All this boring exposition ends with a really ridiculous climax in which a badly generated computer snake (I saw a better animation on the Super Nintendo) completely swallows the whole train, and is therefore dispensed in a method that should have been exercised from the beginning . The asylum marks again. <br /> <br /> The kindergarten marks again with a banal, lazy, horribly direct and boring scam of another better film. "Snakes on a Train" takes itself too seriously, which is why it is never fun or memorable.
