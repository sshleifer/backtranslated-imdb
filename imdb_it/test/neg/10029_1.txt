I rented 3 bad movies to watch with my friends in my dorm room. <br /> <br /> Leprechaun 4, Jack Frost and The Prey. <br /> <br /> I took Jack and Lep 4 because they are well known bad films that I have never seen. <br /> <br /> I chose this film because it corresponded to the guide "How to find a bad movie" on badmovies.org, no real description, no photos of the film on the back, and I had never heard of it, it had to be a winner :) <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS, but this movie is so terrible that it doesn't matter: P) <br /> <br /> This is a real bad movie, Lep 4 and Jack Frost are stupid on purpose , this is stupid despite the best efforts of the cast and crew. <br /> <br /> This "movie" starts a lot like Evil Dead, even the actors look similar and have the same style of dress. Unlike the Evil Dead, it never gains any speed. For a "slasher" movie it is rather bland, in 80 minutes 6 people are killed, but these are scattered until it quickly becomes boring. <br /> <br /> The director has launched a lot of boring shots on animals hunting, obviously to get along with the whole "Prey" theme but they do nothing to advance the story and are rather boring. Blood is horrible. All these extra shots had to make up for the lack of a script and a story. <br /> <br /> The last 5 minutes of the film are shot mainly in slow motion, another way to add more length to this. The "climax" is such a total joke, it's hard to laugh because it's so ugly. The back of the box says "The ending will shock you and haunt you." Yes, it will surprise him that someone could put such an ugly "twist" on the movie and "haunt you" because you won't believe you paid to see this shit. <br /> <br /> Even the tagline is "It's not human, and it has an ax!" A person is killed with an ax in the entire movie and is off the screen. <br /> <br /> A real 1 out of 10. I LOVE laughing at bad movies, but this is so bad that it even lacks campy quality. No bad night at the cinema is competing without a real movie of character: P
