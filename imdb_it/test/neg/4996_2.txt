Don't be deceived. This is NOT a zombie movie. Take it from a guy who loves zombie movies and who rents them all: the good and the horrible. Yes, this film has an extensive zombie sequence, but it's basically an aesthetic-farcical exercise in existentialist terror, which is a long way to say it's boring. If you've worked hard all day and want to spend a couple of hours having fun, rent something else. <br /> <br /> "Rise of the Undead" has cheap special effects, mediocre acting and poor dialogues. This is understandable in a low budget independent film, and I can forgive those flaws until a movie has a fun story to tell. Unfortunately, "Rise of the Undead" has almost no history. Moreover, acting is not ridiculously bad as non-existent. All the actors seem to have studied at the Buster Keaton School of Wooden Faces. Would he kill them to show some emotion? (And no, screaming is not the same as emoting). The only character who actually had a bit of pizazz was killed before. Of course, there was another character who briefly kept my interest. He looked and acted like Kyle McLachlan channeling Norman Bates, but it was too little, too late. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers seemed to have forgotten a small detail: the film is a VISUAL medium. That means lighting up your scenes well enough to allow the viewer to really see what's going on. And all those artistic leaps and close-ups could seem tempting at the time, but all they did was make the movie look baffling and confusing. There is nothing wrong with telling a story simply and clearly - just look at the "Night of the Living Dead" by George Romero to see how it is done superbly. And I know these people had a limited budget, but if you can't rent the equipment and technicians you need to actually make the dialogue audible, just go ahead and make a silent film (so those wooden faces from Buster Keaton might actually work) . <br /> <br /> I will say this for the film: the zombies were disturbing. Unlike most of the zombie movies in which the undead are shown in all their decaying glory, the coarser they are the better, the zombies here were only shuffling and bloody-faced people. It actually worked to make them more like us and, therefore, scarier. This is the reason why I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1. <br /> <br /> The sad part of all this is that despite all its flaws, "Rise of the Undead" does not offend your intelligence . The filmmakers seemed to have really wanted to create an original, scary and original film, and it's a shame that they failed so miserably. If they could simply renounce too extravagant editing, buy a few more light bulbs, raise the dialogue and find a real story that really goes somewhere, so I think they have the talent to do something really good. > <br /> Trust me: don't waste time on "Rise of the Undead".
