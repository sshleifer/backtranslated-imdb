A paranoid scientist creates a werewolf by transmuting wolf blood into a gentle, silent, but very large gardener, to prove a hypothesis. So the gardener begins the nightly furies and the scientist tries to use it to claim his credentials, but is rejected by his former colleagues for tampering with nature. The island of Dr. Moreau, Frankenstein and various wolfman films merge together into a terribly dated, stupid theatrical work. <br /> <br /> Although the subject is pedantic and not very original, the film is not badly made, and interesting to see as a representative of the horror film production of its time. Like most mad scientist films, this is a weak warning against joking with Mother Nature. It does not have the intellectual power or challenges of Frankenstein, but it never extends its reach anyway. Acting is acceptable, as is cinematography, and the film moves along a funny clip. Some of the dialogues are absolutely ridiculous, but hey ... it's just a movie - and a B minus that. There are also some nice wolf shots and a smattering of humor to keep the movie from looking too serious - always a plus for this genre.
