A long awaited remake of a beloved musical classic and a pill so bitter that you have to take it. Very, very difficult to digest ... everything. He didn't have an ounce of credibility anywhere. And when you don't have a rose, you don't have a show. <br /> <br /> Bette Midler was born to play this part. Yet all he could produce was a nice, funny, gleaming, Bette Midler trademark ... weighed down by all the infamous Midlerisms. Roz Russell has nothing to worry about. She can rest in her grave knowing that it is still the definitive Mama Rose (of the film, anyway). I thought that Midler would really face this moment ... to throw himself into what is one of the greatest musical roles of all time ... as he did in "The Rose". But no, she played it safe. She played herself. He made Rose a dining room cartoon. Even his songs weren't inspired. It was crazy to watch, knowing that Midler has the talent to overcome his crap of making money. He showed promises only once in this "Gypsy" and that he was with "Rose's Turn". But now it was too little, too late. A sincere Cynthia Gibb as the titular heroine gave the film its only spark and when the role of Gypsy exceeds Rose's, you know there are problems in River City. <br /> <br /> A huge, huge disappointment.
