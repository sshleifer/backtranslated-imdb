Another film that makes The Beach Boys story worse than it is. I especially remember the scene where Brian says he has to leave the tour and the other Boys call him a traitor. It didn't happen that way, and as the film indicates in the beginning, some scenes have an overreaction. A film on The Beach Boys doesn't have to be like this because a lot of things have happened anyway. The sad thing is that this film gives a wrong image of the boys to those who are not so familiar with the group. Hard-core fans like me knew that this isn't the whole true story and that's why I gave it a low rating 3. However, it's the best film on The Beach Boys I've seen so far, which says quite a lot the other films. If you want the truth, I recommend the documentary Endless Harmony.
