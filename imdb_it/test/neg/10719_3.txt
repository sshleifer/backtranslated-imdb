This film was, perhaps, one of the most original and little funny movies I've seen in a long, long time. To be honest, I didn't expect a revolutionary comic formula, but I expected to be at least entertained. With such low expectations, how could I be disappointed? <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey, perhaps my favorite actor (not sarcasm), did little more than beat the water in this film. He seems to have temporarily returned to his funny-looking roots and created a character not unlike his Liar Liar Fletcher Reede. This new character, Dick Harper (a.k.a. Fletcher 2.0) is a poorly rendered and miserably written puppy. If you find yourself smiling as you watch this pitiful and essentially boring character, it's very likely that Carrey is trying so hard to bring him a third dimension. Carrey's extravagant pose becomes humorously embarrassing - and, in the end, sad. <br /> <br /> Tea Leoni as Jane does little more than supply the Abbott to the Costello of Carrey. I usually find Leoni tea refreshing and underused, but not in this case. Jane Harper could have been easily interpreted by any actress from thirty to forty-five, and it is in that non-specificity that Jane's character becomes uninteresting to watch. It simply has no distinctive trait other than the following of the general theme of the film, which seems to be that ... Wait, no, this movie has no theme. Unless you consider "Big Business Is Evil" as a theme. I thought it was more than a given. <br /> <br /> Richard Jenkins and Alec Baldwin both have credible supporting performances (even if tired), but neither of them seems to be invested in the role they are playing. It is clear that Alec Baldwin was doing so much in the role of the sinister C.E.O. how to eat a sandwich (which seems to have done a lot lately). <br /> <br /> Slightly tangent, but did Alec Baldwin play any role in the last few years that didn't require him to be a powerful idiot in a suit? <br /> <br /> Anyway, follow my advice if you haven't already witnessed the horror for yourself: save your money. This is the one to capture on HBO in a few months. Dick and Jane are present, but there is no fun to have.
