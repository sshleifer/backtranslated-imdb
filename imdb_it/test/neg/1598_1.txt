I can usually tolerate twisted films, but this is really an obsessive and self-obsessed movie! <br /> <br /> First of all, the writer / director is totally a guy full of sick jokes that aren't all fun. Secondly, he is also a sick pervert who manipulates and poisons the mind of children! I can't believe my ears when I heard the sick and perverted monologues uttered by children! <br /> <br /> I'm really sorry for Zane Adlum and Devon Matthews. They are both very talented, but have fallen prey to the dirty and little-known film by Eric Schaeffer! <br /> <br /> And what the hell happened to Eric Mabius's pretty face? I mean, he met this girl who should get married, but he wasn't in the marriage! In fact there is this bald guy in his place! Has time really flown so fast? <br /> <br /> However, don't waste time watching this movie, unless you want to be poisoned and manipulated by a sick Eric Schaeffer!
