Poor Jane Austen should be glad she's not around to see this scary wreckage of an adaptation. Recently, so many beautiful Jane Austen films have come out that this deserves to be permanently buried along with two other films that scorn: The man in the gray flannel suit and the 1969 version of David Copperfield. My main meat with the film is that the point of the book is completely missing. Jane Austen was mocking the Gothic craze in her society, and much of the novel has an ironic tone. The film, however, is serious and looks terribly melodramatic. The carefree and fun taste of Austen's writing is completely and conspicuously absent from this ponderous incursion in which horror meets vintage drama. The scenes of Catherine's imagination are both free and uninteresting. Furthermore, Henry Tilney is terribly unattractive. Why, I ask, would someone fall in love with him? If you're looking for a fun Jane Austen evening, look at Emma instead!
