Completely overlooking the film adaptation of a video game, this is another terrible film by Mr. Boll. How he continues to be hired to make films is a constant surprise for me and obviously most of the film community. <br /> <br /> Overall I will say that this attempt was slightly better than many of his previous attempts. Some of the dialogues were pretty decent at Far Cry even if he still uses some phrases and in some cases he doesn't even use sentences correctly. <br /> <br /> Now besides the fact that Jack Carver should be American and not German, Til was still fun in this role. An exception are the ridiculously lame lines he uses to sleep with the girl. And should we believe that she is ready to have sex with him so easily after such a minimal dialogue? Emile? Simply there for the comic relief I am sure and still lame. The character of Jack looks old and tired, but he is still capable of the extreme stunts necessary to avoid one of the super soldiers modified in the laboratory. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this for the Far Cry adaptation. But you could waste an hour and a half looking at it if you have nothing better to do.
