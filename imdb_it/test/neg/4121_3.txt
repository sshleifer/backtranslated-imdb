This film has promised a lot, many beautiful and well executed actors but with a plot that had practically nothing to say. So many potentially promising conflicts among family members that could have been developed and worked out, but it was all abandoned and untreated. There was no story to tell, just a show of acting, technique, beautiful scenes - all of which were EMPTY. But again, the acting was excellent, so many individual scenes were fun, but as you became more and more aware of the lack of supporting ideas, even acting lost its meaning. So from the promising start you became more and more disappointed when the non-story went on.
