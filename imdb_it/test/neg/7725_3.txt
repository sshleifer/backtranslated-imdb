I saw the first House of the Dead and I expected a root channel to be more enjoyable to hang out with, so when it wasn't so bad, I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I got my hopes that the second one could go well ... and I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Apparently I'm one of the few people who have seen this movie that they think was bad. <br /> <br /> I don't know whether to look at it again and force me to see whatever the people who gave the positive reviews have seen, or I wonder if I saw the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> Ed Quinn as Ellis and Emmanuelle Vaugier as Alexandra "Nightingale" Morgan did a great job in roles that were far below them. They deserve to be in better films. <br /> <br /> The special effects were in place and some of the characters were funny / hateful and this made for a tolerable watch, but for the most part, this movie was just a useless waste of time. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I have to ask because I found myself asking aloud EVERYTHING the way the movie ... someone didn't know how to close the doors behind so that the zombies don't just wander around rooms? Only once it happened (zombies wandering inside) and I found it a little comfortable ... soldiers enter a room, leave the door wide open, pay little or no attention to the same door, so zombies can simply enter if they feel like it (with the unlucky "alive" who are cornered without the possibility of escape) yet only once did the zombies follow them. <br /> <br /> Nitpicky? Perhaps, but honestly ... if I had to fight for my life, the last thing I would do would be to go into a room and leave the door wide open so that the zombies can come in and eat me. <br /> <br /> This is really the only thing * it bothered me * throughout the film, and the film, for the most part, was a bad sequel to an original that was not entirely abominable.
