Hopper has never been worse as if he felt like this movie was worthy of only a grade B performance and offered a rather good one. Outside Madsen and Hopper the acting is hideous; you have seen better in your local high school. The sound and sometimes the editing and shooting of the camera are low-end of the B movies. The scene with the peeping tom is the biggest movies scenes of free nudity I've ever seen (it doesn't even come close to editing in the film ). The script was probably a large 10-page outline, but when it comes out in a full-length movie there are more holes in it, then the corpses left by Madsen. I have to say that Hopper dressed in a nice dress driving Hummer, he made me laugh out loud, but I don't think that was the intent. Yes, there is a small style and Hopper can always attract my interest. However, the interesting storyline never pays and you wonder why you lost time looking at it.
