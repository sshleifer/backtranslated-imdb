John Light (John Elias), computer expert, goes from lowering Stanford to the successful young tycoon Dotcom. But Mr. Light's mocking success may be short-lived, with partners like the ambitious Jeffrey Donovan (like Robert Jennings). Mr. Donovan used to sleep with Light's girlfriend, Megan Dodds (as Lisa Forrester). Donovan wants Light to know that binge drinking and casual sex don't have to end in college. After reading a sexy sex session on the Internet, Mrs. Dodds lights up the light. You may also lose the "Digital Dreams" Internet empire! Veterans who unsuccessfully attempt to lend their drama include the red lollipop Mia Farrow (as Anna Simmons) and Hal Holbrook (as Tom Walker) who hate computers. Mrs. Farrow looks sweet with her lollipops. <br /> <br /> *** Purpose (2/21/02) Alan Lazar ~ John Light, Jeffrey Donovan, Mia Farrow
