I like to think I can enjoy a movie that is a little out of the ordinary, and I certainly love a good movie that makes me think. <br /> <br /> If you like ordinary movies that make you think, then look elsewhere. This movie is so ugly and so bumpy that the only thing you'll think about after it's over is how is it that you've lost 90 minutes of your life watching this. <br /> <br /> A film of this type needs a driver film to get the purchase from the viewer. Why are we interested in the main characters? What motivates these characters through their existence? Why do they make the decisions they make? This film makes a very weak attempt to do these and fails in the process. There is no chemistry between these two actors, both very good in their ability to feel comfortable in any role. So why did they fail here? I feel strongly that they didn't even know what their motivations were, and when an actor doesn't know, their audience can't follow. <br /> <br /> In summary, I saw macromedia flash videos that offered more in the way of provoking thought, at least I have more interest in the transformed hamster who likes the moon because this married family man would risk everything for a violation of "Code 46".
