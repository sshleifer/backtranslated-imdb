This film should be titled: Sex in the 70s In a part of New York City called Greenwich Village and Chelsea. <br /> <br /> This film does little to talk about sex in the 1970s, except that it focuses on hypersexual audiences and private sex spaces in New York City. I doubt that Manhole's bar was the symbol of real sex in the 1970s and that the sex genre is much more widespread in the film. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, the time period seems like an explosion. And it is quite important to document the scene to which the film refers. But with regards to the definition of this film Sex in the 70s, the title is a bit misleading. Technically it is not named to the Oscar, but its crudeness seems appropriate for the subject. <br /> <br /> In general, an "eh".
