This movie is bad, yes, but the producers used a REAL KANGAROO, it would have killed the actor he was boxing with. I am an Australian and I saw two male Roos seven feet tall fighting each other, it is not a pretty sight because the object is one or the other to kill the opponent, (this is the way to make sure the herd of females) and there are incidents in which someone has boxed a kangaroo and injured or killed, so when you see a kangaroo on TV or Film it is likely to be a female, or Animato, since it is a good idea not to hurt the actors (they be bothered to lose the ability to breathe). There is a strange idea that Australian animals are cute and cuddly, which is false, many are dangerous (10 of the 12 most deadly snakes live here) and most are simply ugly (koalas are as soft as wool stealing). So if you come to Australia, be careful !!!
