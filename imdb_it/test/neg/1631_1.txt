Like almost everyone, I became aware of this turkey in the Mystery Science Theater 3000. It easily ranks as one of my favorite MST3K episodes of all time. I couldn't really imagine trying to watch this movie alone ......... it's really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really bad. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keeffe is the protagonist of Ator, an aspiring Fabio of muscles who lives during the time of the cavemen. We ask the viewer to suspend our disbelief as he knows alchemy and chemistry and may be able to build a complete hang glider in about 5 minutes. Yeah, for sure! There is also a pretty attractive actress (I don't remember her name) wearing a hubcap as a chest shield. Oh, and I can't forget that strange Thong Asian sideways. He had the easiest role in the film since he didn't say a word of dialogue during the whole movie. He had to figure out how to make his character interesting without speaking ..... and he failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The film cannot be watched in any way and should only be viewed in its proper MST3K format. If you look at that version, you'll laugh foolishly! <br /> <br /> "I HUGE !!!!" <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
