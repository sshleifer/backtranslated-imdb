I found my tape of this "show" long forgotten. In addition to the musical theme "DISCO BEAVER FROM OUTER SPACE". This show is barely watchable. You'll be flipping through the channels, just like the couple browsing TV channels. This is a parody of TV. <br /> <br /> Beaver is beautiful. The homosexual Dracula, the chick who discusses his experiences with Peria and the lady with too large lips who talk about homosexuality, show us all that is wrong on TV. It's all BAD. Just like the beaver of outer space that seems to be lost in this new world, so will you. *** outside *****
