Butter Battle is a fun story of two imaginary cities and their arms race. It is also a misleading allegory about the cold war and about arms races in general. Yes, it's a book for children, but like many works by Theodor Seuss Geisel strikes people with his morality. <br /> <br /> And what is the moral, exactly? It is certainly commendable to encourage us to focus more on what unites us than what divides us. It is also a good thing to encourage international cooperation. But to compare the differences between the Warsaw Pact nations and the Western NATO to a difference in the application of butter is simply wrong. To emphasize the obvious, many Warsaw Pact nations enjoyed intermittent shortages of butter and bread - they would have been happy to eat it sideways if it was available. At a less literal level, and whatever your political inclination, Soviet socialism against Western democracy (especially Anglo-American) is not a mere matter of preference and habit. <br /> <br /> To make the point even clearer, nuclear weapons were not developed in a cold war with the Soviets, but in a hot war with Axis powers. There is no doubt that Germany was developing nuclear capabilities during the war. Should the United States refrain from nuclear weapons research by placing their trust in their (less than inevitable) victory in conventional warfare? Once the weapons were developed, they were used against the enemy that attacked us at Pearl Harbor. What does a nation do at this point when genius is out of the bottle? Furthermore, the hindsight is 20-20, which means that there was no way to ensure that another half-crazy dictator would not develop his own eyes on developing nuclear weapons. The second Gulf War showed the incredible difficulty in verifying credible threats and neutralizing them. <br /> <br /> In any case, the comic is little more than a simplistic propaganda that does little to explore the nuances of the ethical issues behind nuclear weapons and instead tries to inculcate in children the fear of weapons technology.
