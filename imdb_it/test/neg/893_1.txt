I've never seen the first three, but I know they're all better than this ... trash. It is a child who organizes a party. Wow. It seems incredible (sarcasm). IS? NOOO! Start with a child who lies down in bed and is woken up by his mother. So the child pretends to be sick, so he doesn't have to go to school. He goes to his uncle's house and gathers some people and organizes a party. I didn't laugh at all while watching this garbage. I can't imagine anyone sitting down and writing this dialogue thinking "Man, dis! @ # $ Ãˆ gunna be big, yo!" I wonder if they even had a script for this movie. I saw this knowing it would be bad, but usually watching a bad movie makes me feel good because it gives me something to tease. This just disgusted me. TWO INCHES DOWN!
