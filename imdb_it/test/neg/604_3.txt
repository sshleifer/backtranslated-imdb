To sum up, this film was disappointing and could have been reduced by twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> The acting was sub-par, the only decent actors in the group are Trisha, the killer and Molly. The music was slightly lame but suitable and the special effects were too much abused. The story / screenplay was poor, unnecessary torture / romantic scenes were dragged on too long and a disappointing ending. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the film was quite slow, the fake-looking gore wasn't much of an interest. Trisha arrived home, and there was a premise for a good plot. <br /> <br /> Trisha began receiving threatening phone calls, which increased the suspense. This momentary suspense, the best feature of the film, began to build, but then friends crashed into the place, destroying any potential suspense / horror in the film. <br /> <br /> The plot then becomes dull from here on out. Chemical spark between the two couples, and then the killer picks up Frank and the other girl. This scene was dragged and useless. <br /> <br /> The killer makes his way to Trisha and the league. There is a scene of excessive torture that lasts for at least ten minutes too long. Since the gore is bad, this is not fun at all, and bores more than shocks. <br /> <br /> In summary, the first thirty minutes of this film look promising, but then badly written dialogues and a lack of general plot ruins this film. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
