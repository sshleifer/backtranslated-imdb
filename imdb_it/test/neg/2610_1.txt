This son of a son of a sequel was nothing short of terrible. You would think that the production would have been better 10 years after the original was published, however Retro Puppet Master was not directed or written by the original authors and contained poor stories, lack of any connection with any character, and dragged out of scene slowly by scene . No build-up of strong texture, very weak climax, you will find yourself slowly becoming irritable throughout the film, if you can sit across the entire roll. I never understood why a horror film continues to make sequels after the release of their "final chapter". I barely recommend watching this movie, but if I really shouldn't recommend anyone else to make it.
