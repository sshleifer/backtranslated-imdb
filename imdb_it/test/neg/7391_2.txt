This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Can anyone explain the plot to this movie? Yes, I know the bus ran out of gas in the middle of the desert, after the driver never noticed that his compass wasn't working, but then? And how did it end? Maybe I'm stupid to understand this film, but for me it was a real waste of time. <br /> <br /> My recommendation? Don't worry, there are far better films to see. This film is in line with the other low basses of all time (Going overboard - Adam Sandler and Fire on the Amazon - Sandra Bullock)
