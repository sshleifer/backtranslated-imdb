What a production, what a waste of time and money for the screen. Here's what a European producer thinks, a scifi movie. Get the former model, Alexandra Kamp, match her with an American c-class actor and get one of the most famous film producers Harry A. Towers. Towers then finds some obscure products based on munich. home, Tandem communication, Rola Bauer, and then mix everything without any script and you'll get "Sumuru" - a priceless gem among the worst movies ever! Take a live person and do something else, whatever you do, no movie please !! On top of everything, the producers went to South Africa for the shoot, what you see on the screen is a giant sand pit, where "action" takes place, between extremely bad actors and a very bad fx that every film student would do better.
