Even though I saw Sal√≤, I don't know if the droppings have a sour taste. If it does, this "film" is carefully titled. So much of bran, so little substance, this is the equivalent of celery celluloid - just that it doesn't cleanse the palate. Leave the taste of time wasted in the mouth of the mind, and if I could throw up this movie and resume that expansion / expense I would do it. The detention was more exciting. The director should be forced to wear a hat, and the spirit of Ed Wood Jr. could not save this semi-professional projection from a certain failure. A waste of time, a waste of mind. ** Don't be fooled by the biting Dominique Swain: good goose puppet she was in the Lolita remake, less tragic and more savvy than Sue Lyon, even if it's not any better. However, a previously competent crackdown does not make them an expert craftsman. You need a job for that, not a shit, which is what this movie is. The rollers belong to the girls' bathroom, flushed until the pipes burst, while the director / direct Christina Wayne should do 5-10 in the study room. Look at everything else and pass this lesson, (hello), forever!
