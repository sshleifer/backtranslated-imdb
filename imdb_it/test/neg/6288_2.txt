The funniest thing about Fortunes is that one of the main characters, Lewis (Urbaniak) has the writer's block and apparently also the scriptwriter of the film. This is also sad, as I imagine in full, this should be a comedy, or a comedy, but it's the funniest thing I can remember watching this. <br /> <br /> Three friends go to drink one night. On the way home, two decide to have their fortune told by a "gypsy", as they call it. Those two lives fall apart while the third friend is standing. So nothing happens. <br /> <br /> I hope I didn't ruin the film there, but in reality, this low budget, low quality movie had some sort of an idea when it started, but it quickly made a leap deep within the hell. Yes, I'm strict. Honestly, it wasn't so bad, it was just blah. <br /> <br /> The aforementioned writer was annoying to look at, even if he delivered perhaps one or two of the only two funny lines. The cliché "sir", the only one whose fortune was not told, was just annoying. The only bright spot, was the remaining friend, the married dad whose fortune had been said that something big had to happen to his son and he needed to be prepared. He was funny, genuine and clearly the best actor in the film. Unfortunately, it's not saying much. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too cruel. Heck, they had the ambition to make a film, they went and got funding and accomplished something. Unfortunately, however, I can't recommend the film based on it at all, there are hundreds of thousands of other independent films that have hundreds of thousands of ideas and better performances. This was literally 10 minutes of a stretched idea of ​​another 81 boring minutes.
