I'm sure I'm in the minority (I know I'm among my friends), but I found this film long, boring and free. The fact that the role played by DENIS LEARY is the nicest character (the only other time I liked it at all in "A Bug's Life"!) He talks a lot. The character of Rene Russo was irritating beyond imagination and the Thomas Crowne itself was flat and stereotyped. To say that it was two-dimensional could be a little generous. (No, the scenes with his psychiatrist did NOT help make it real.) <br /> <br /> With the exception of two wonderful scenes (both involving the museum captain and NOT involving Rene Russo), this film has me made wish they were at home watching television golf.
