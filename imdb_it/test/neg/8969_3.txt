Any chance to see Katharine Hepburn in something I haven't seen or her film career is a real treat, and at that level the movie is fun, but it's as horrible as a Hill Billy. His famous enunciation of New England slips through, making lines like: "I'll do better to rake some Vittles" rather ridiculous. Is she so cute and so young? almost overcomes this great defect. The story is an old-fashioned melodrama, and therefore, a younger generation might think of this exquisite stuff, but this was the basis of American high society in the 1940s. It has its moments, but you may need to be a fan of film buffs to appreciate it.
