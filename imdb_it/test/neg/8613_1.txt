Well, I watch a lot of movies and this really made me sick ... GREAT TIME. I'm sure we're all tired of the low-budget strategy to make vampire movies using a "actor" type of "Martial Arts Teacher". I'm also so tired of the guy who knows some form of fighting technique and then manages to make his way through a slightly boring movie. I forced myself to watch it and one of the main reasons was that the lead actress is pretty pretty (Ha-Ha) Well, I hope this helped a little and if you have time and want to give your brain a break, watch it !! ! We hope that one day this type of film will not be published but then where all the Low Budget actors will go :-) <br /> <br /> The film also contains many Bloops but I will leave it for you to find because it adds some fun while you watch and even if you are a little perfectionist it will bother you ;-) Greetings !!
