The film was pretty ugly. It's not so much a script problem. It's just that the film is really boring in terms of rhythm. The film seems to struggle at a slow and agonizing pace. The story of San Franpsycho is that there is a serial killer on the loose who is killing morally corrupt individuals (I may have read too much in it, but hey, it is apparently my nature) after the San Franpsycho kills a couple of people under the Golden Gate Bridge is presented to us as one of the main characters in the film: Joe Estevez (brother of Martin Sheen) as an inveterate policeman named Bill Culp. Bill is currently trying to hunt down the killer (seriously he doesn't have a name, he's just The Killer), and he's trying to force a local journalist named Rita to help him in his investigations, Bill is the tough stereotype- bearded cop and threatens Rita to put her in prison for obstruction of justice. However some scenes pass and suddenly Rita finds a letter left by the psychopath (he is a cold-blooded psychopath!) And he has a change of heart and tells Bill and his partner Joe to help him in the investigation. <Br /> <br /> The film tries to be a homicidal thriller, but in a sense it fails. It's very similar to the movie The Black Dahlia trying to be tense, but it's incredible in terms of this. The film tries to be serious everywhere, but has scenes like the one in which he masturbates The Killer (obviously a fan of porn gore with phrases like: "ooh blood on her" or something like that) and Joe Estevez hitting the table: " He's a cold-blooded killer! "I admit I chuckled more than once at the movie, though I'm sure it was destined to be a deadly serious film. <br /> <br /> One of the only positive points of the film is the fact that I didn't pay to see it (huzzah netflix). And it's sad because I saw some good guys in their movies after watching The Damned. Of course, the film had a fair amount of flaws, but it was pleasant. Unfortunately, San Franpsycho has nothing to do. Assuming it has a valid script, it's nothing too big, but it could have been interesting. Instead what you get is a murder thriller that fails to thrill or even has vaguely pleasant deaths. The other reviews also claim that the film has "a fantastic ending that is shocking", apparently I was watching a different movie because for about an hour I realized what would happen. The ending didn't shock me at all. I would continue to insult this wreck of a movie, but I don't think I will. In short, this film is a boring, uninspired thriller (I use this term freely) that fails to have the "thrill of Hitchcockian" that another reviewer claims to have a predictable ending, insignificant deaths, acting with all the excitement of a wooden board, and a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I am sure that others will try to defend it with the usual: it was a low budget film, they did the best they could with such a low budget, and all that other nonsense. But when it was reduced to a minimum, there was very little that could have really spent that budget, there were very few special effects, the soundtrack seemed to have been recycled by Hood of the Living Dead or The Damned and it's the same damn thing crew of those two films. This film reminds me a lot of another low budget movie that didn't go well, and was called Mr. Jingles, the two have about the same quality, they can't deliver anything close to enjoyment and they should quickly fade into darkness.
