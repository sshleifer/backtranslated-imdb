There are so few movies where only the title tells you everything you need to know about the movie. One such film is I Was A Comunist For The FBI. Another example could be I Married A Monster From Outer Space. <br /> <br /> The really interesting thing about this film is how in the sky was nominated for an Oscar in the documentary category? It is not a documentary in any sense of the word, nor is it in that hybrid docudrama category. It's just a pretty wild movie about the work of an undercover FBI agent named Matt Cvetic who infiltrated the Communist Party in Pittsburgh and took action trying to win the Union of Steelworkers for the Communists and report on those to its FBI managers. <br /> <br /> A documentary of that work could have been interesting, but what we got was a film suitable for those paranoid times. I found it fascinating that when Cvetic eventually broke his cover he was on the House's Anti-American Activities Committee rather than the New York Party trial of Communist leaders. There was a moment in the film in which the communist leader James Millican told his followers to start spreading the news that the Chamber's American Activities Commission was composed of a group of right-wing Yahoos trying to make their names appear in front of the camera. Now what could give him that idea? In any case it is enough to connect the dots and without a doubt the word came from J. Edgar Hoover who tries to give a little credibility to the HUAC by ensuring that a real undercover comes out rather than in a real process. The small thing is called cross-examination. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers who produced I Was A Comunist For The FBI then produced Big Jim McLain with John Wayne on a HUAC detective in Hawaii. The HUAC grabbed the credit for the work done by the Honolulu PD in breaking a communist spy there among port workers. But at least in the John Wayne film no one claimed it was a documentary. <br /> <br /> Frank Lovejoy is in the role of the Cvetic title and his FBI handlers are Richard Webb and Philip Carey. Dorothy Hart plays a Pittsburgh school teacher who says there are about 30 in this school system that indoctrinates the young man among whom is Ron Hagerthy, the son of Lovejoy. He has a change of opinion about the communists and Lovejoy has to save her from a murderous fate planned by her superiors. Ironically, Hart left the cinema and worked for all places, the United Nations which, as we know, has often been accused of being a communist nest in the United States. <br /> <br /> Over half a century later and we have very few objective works on film or in print about the Communist Party of the United States. They were in fact a very active group in the labor movement. The real heroes in stopping them were labor organizers like Walter Reuther in the UAW or David Dubinsky in ILGWU. But since they were leftists, they have no right to be suitable propaganda material. <br /> <br /> However I was a communist for the FBI is an exploitative work based on a real life character and a testimony of those paranoid times.
