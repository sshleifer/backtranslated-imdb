While many decades have passed since I last read "War of the Worlds" by Mr. Wells, or "The Time Machine", or any of his other works, I think they were all set in London, or at least, in England . This "B" level film ("C"?) Is set in the eastern part of the United States, like the radio adaptation of Orson Welles 67 years ago. However, this film does not exhibit the quality of the narrative style of the Mercury Playhouse program. Thomas Howell's emulation would not be acceptable in most school acting clubs. I was actually embarrassed for him. His wandering on the grass on the hill crying "My family, my family" was almost ridiculous, as was his reaction to his brother's death. Of the three film versions of the story I saw, this was by far the worst, with the 1950s version of Gene Barry the best. Also, this was the first time I saw a "machine monster" that climbed sticky saliva, like that of "Aliena".
