OK, if I were in the rental shop and someone asked me if the movie was worth the three dollars for the rental, I should say no. The plot was unlikely. I have come to the conclusion that Keanu Reeves cannot act. It can sometimes be painful to watch (even if my wife thinks it's cute). Dan Aykroyd (who is usually exceptional) was also a bit disappointing as the corrupt cop. The positive side, the plot (because it is unlikely) is unpredictable. Cameron Diaz was good.
