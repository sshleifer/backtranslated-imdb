** SPOILERS ** The killer of the film does not wait a second while we see him sneaking into a girls shower and killing her with his arm cut and bloodied while making his escape. We therefore obtained this official-looking prologue, as if we were looking at a true story, stating that a number of gruesome murders were committed in the late autumn of 1985 in a small collage of the center-west. <br /> <br /> Grandfather, and the deaf, Sheriff Ron Delboys is baffled by this murder and later when the murders of local collage students, all women, continue his run for the state senator is in danger with him muttering the investigations at every turn. There are at least two times that Delboys says they will never be another murder as long as it's on the case and in a few minutes another murder happens. <br /> <br /> Finding a gold amulet at the scene of every murder of the sheriff's daughter, the collage librarian, Tina finds this reference book on Withcraft which indicates that the amulet is a symbol of a witch cult which originated in the early 1700s immediately after the Salem Witch Trials. This cult was intended to avenge the 19 accused witches hung on the inhabitants of the place in 1692 and they went out at night killing men and women of authority and starting with a part of the body. When the parts of the body would form a complete person, they would be burned in a midnight occult bonfire ritual. <br /> <br /> It is never possible to understand exactly what is happening in the movie "Blood Cult", not only because it is completely disjointed history but it is increasingly outrageous and school-level, especially by Charles Ellis who plays the sheriff Ron Delboys. Getting into more trouble, even the loose killer could have let him in. Sheriff Sheriff Delboys ends up with his head butchered with spiked coffee and almost burned alive after being dismembered. The only reason he wasn't is that he seemed to have dreamed everything while he was under the influence of some strong, nameless drug. <br /> <br /> There is a strange sequence of dreams in the film that suggests that a number of respected members of the community are members of the Witch Cult that is responsible for the sorority murders. The film does not bother to explain if the dream, which the drug sheriff Delboys had, was a dream or a real experience on his part, dropping the whole thing as if it were cut off from the movie! > <br /> Leaving the hospital and distributing the house of the sorority collage, while munching on a bag full of McDonald's cheeseburgers, Sheriff Delboys finally finds himself face to face with the murderer. Shefiff Delboys discovers with amazement and amazement that he not only knows who he is, or she, but is also willing to let the murderer escape! <br /> <br /> The first film in video and shows. Not only should nobody have the madness of being crazy enough to pay for admission, at least with the video that can be recorded on it Thank God, to see this disaster but no movie house owner would dare play it on their screen without the danger of indignant customers, in a justifiable show of right indignation, they tear the place to pieces!
