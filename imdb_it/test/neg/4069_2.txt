The idea that anyone can invent such a banal, banal, but indeliberately comic film is shocking. The last 20 minutes of this film are comic glory; with six men digging enough trenches in 10 minutes to light the runway with gasoline for a 747, while a supposed 'major' lands the 747 perfectly in a wind in the 110-mile wind - bringing one to question the wrong name of call this film CRASH LANDING ... <br /> <br /> Some dialogues were equivalent to rubbing the sandpaper in my ears, while the only aspect that saved this film for a 1 was the plethora of attractive women who filled the screen most of the time. Not exactly a consolidation for this pathetic excuse of a movie, but my silent button has finally received a workout. <br /> <br /> View at your own risk! 2 out of 10
