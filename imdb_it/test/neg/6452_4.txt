The head of the battered and verbally abusive film studio directs his male assistant torn by exasperating demands, keeping the young man firmly under his thumb with constant threats of unemployment; after a year of office terror, the hard work finally breaks. Writer and director George Huang may have bitten more than he can chew here. His "Swimming with the sharks" is not a diatribe against Hollywood, nor is it a tribute to the hard work underground ... instead, it is the stunt film-making with a breakthrough, a one-trick pony with tunnel vision. The surroundings do not look like Tinsel Town (perhaps due to a limited budget), and we never had the feeling of this stressful environment as a cinema entity (it could be the office of a real estate agent in the Valley, for all of us to know) . Lead Kevin Spacey, who was also one of the film's producers, offers a controlled and focused performance like the powerful magician with power whose ego is out of control; does a good job, yet the character doesn't sound real. We learn so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and high status status fail to jibe with what we see; to whom does this man answer? what drives him beyond the humiliation of others to the sport? What projects are you doing aside the script that we see passed around? The film is so exhausted from an emotional and underpopulated point of view, that it begins to look like a theater show filled for the big screen - yet one without enough characters or motivations in it. Perhaps Huang wanted to keep things simple, but instead his film looks like a fiery project that needed much more introspection, humor and atmosphere. ** from ****
