Being a fan of Harrison Ford, I'm probably kind. It was predictable, mushy ... my husband made a lot of noise while we were watching him. What a disappointing movie. Our local newspaper (San Jose Mercury News) actually gave this 4 stars out of 4 stars !!! Hard to believe that the reviewer saw the same movie we did.
