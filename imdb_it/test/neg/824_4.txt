If you compare two films with Sacha Cohen, Borat and Ali G, then Ali G is immeasurably better. I'm not a masterpiece, but at least it's a movie. Borat is complete garbage and I don't understand how it is better evaluated than Ali G. <br /> <br /> I can't put a finger on it, there is something wrong with Ali G's script: half of the lines are as written by a 15 year old, not from an adult screenwriter. And a series of jokes including Mr. Cohen's lower body are quite insipid. <br /> <br /> But the movie actually looks like a comedy and there are also some good jokes that are fun: like Ali G becomes a member of the government to do something scandalous and stupid in the audience (sadly true in Today's Western society: people get a career to do stupid things in public), even Ali's advice on immigrant politics and some others. <br /> <br /> Ali G in general remains a sympathetic character, albeit a sort of mentally underdeveloped for his age. But it's OK to watch, it's pretty funny. <br /> <br /> But never looking at Borat, it's horrible and makes every intelligent movement move sick.
