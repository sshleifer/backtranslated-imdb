The beautiful blonde Natasha Henstridge is the young sorrowful widow in the villa on the hill, which tells her story to a television journalist in Monroeville, Virginia. And among the wealthy horses in the community, she is suspected of being involved in the death of her old husband. That is James Brolin, trusting as a child in arms. Flashback teledrama made in Canada, based on an article published in Vanity Fair magazine. It must be true! In any case, it is much more romantic than mystery, and a very familiar story. Is the Leggy Species star Henstridge a hospitable nurse who earns gold? It could happen, I guess. And it's nice to see Brolin in an important role after his heroine turn in Antwone Fisher, even if he doesn't make it to the end of the photo. The end of the image? It does not even arrive at the beginning of the photo. That's why the flashbacks were invented, of course.
