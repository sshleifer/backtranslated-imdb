I could have done it with the seven gunslingers who simply stayed away. This sequel should never have been done, the former did everything better. The plot was a turkey, the acting was turkey, the direction, the production, the camera work ... the whole turkey. Anyone who puts out this garbage should be tartrate and feathered. Let them not come back again!
