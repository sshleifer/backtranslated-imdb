I can't see how anyone could say that this was a real fun movie. With some famous actors I found it hard to believe that this was only done in 2005. It's crap! Acting is equivalent to amateur dramas, poor amateur dramas. Unless you want to laugh out loud with incredible 100 minutes of pure corn, don't worry about downloading it or renting it, the worst I've seen in years. He has been acting in the past, where cowboys are shooting 8 bullets from the six shooters. The most notorious the actor, the worse they were, Drury was just sad. Was I extremely disappointed with Lee Majors, did he actually lean over this sort of garbage? It was bad enough when he played the six million dollar man.
