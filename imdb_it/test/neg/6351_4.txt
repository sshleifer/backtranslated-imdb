I rented this movie from my local library and thought it could be fine considering I like this kind of movie and considering who was in it but the guy was wrong. The acting brat, the fight scenes were just as bad and they had a couple of people known to be there, but didn't they cast anyone with acting skills to play the lead role? I noticed that some people gave a 10. Why would you ever consider giving this pile of horses **** to 10. You can say that it's worth 10 for pure comedy, but when you vote on a movie that shouldn't be a comedy you can't give a 10 for comedy. You have to evaluate it on what it really should have been and not for something the director didn't mean. Maybe some of you voted 10 because you thought it would be fun to have this lousy movie have a high score so people could go out and rent it or buy it because you think it's fun to fool people. You are playing with people of time and money that you have no right to do. If the film was sucked, give it a bad rating if it was nice to give it a good grade but not lie. I gave this film a 4 and I'm glad I was able to check it out for free from my library because this movie was sucked in and it's actually not worth paying a penny to see it.
