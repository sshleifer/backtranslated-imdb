He starts with a couple of disgusting sex-comedy gags, but soon reveals his true colors: he wants to be a clone of the "Death of Death". I say "wants" because the script becomes so more and more ridiculous at the minute that it ends up looking like an absurd parody of "Death of Death"! From a love scene in a room inexplicably full of candles, to "heroes" who dress up as commando and shake their machine guns because they don't want to draw attention to them (!) a black van long after it has been recognized as their vehicle, this movie has too many ridiculous points to fit on a list. The other big problem is that you can't distinguish most of the characters; of course, you know who Borgnine and Roundtree are and even James Van Patten, but all the other roles may have been played by different actors in various scenes, and you wouldn't know the difference.
