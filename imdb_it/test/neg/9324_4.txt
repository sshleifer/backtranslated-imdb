I found Dominion as a bad attempt to continue the success of history. The original film was a story about evil, and how it can infiltrate our lives. <br /> <br /> Schrader's version is lacking in evil. Spectators do not have an overwhelming sense of terror, fear or even omen. Harlin's version offers obvious wickedness, shows violations of church sanctity and builds a convincing story that is plausible, given Father Merrin's background. Schrader's story leaves one wondering exactly what happened. Dominion does not evoke the emotions of the spectators to empathize with Father Merrin, and leaves the viewer wondering exactly why he was upset in the first place. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in seeing a sequel that is up to the original should see Exorcist: the beginning.
