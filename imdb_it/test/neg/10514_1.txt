I spent a year in Iraq, and among the hundreds of films I saw here was this little gem called Vampire Assassin. Judging by the cover (African-American with rows of corn with a curved blade, leather coat and the behavior of a prick), I was expecting a Blade rip-off. All right. <br /> <br /> So I entered it and observed a borderline African American overweight with no blade, no perches and, well, absolutely nothing except ... I don't know. If you've read one of these other reviews, get the juice of the movie. It sucks. Bad. Really bad. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it was the Highlander lightning who killed an immortal vampire, or the sound effects of karate football for photographic zooms, or the budget of twenty dollars on props, or " ok, we have 90 minutes to film this before we get caught in a Johnson & Johnson parking lot, "or martial arts that are as exciting and hectic as two older people having sex, or acting 7th grade talent, or the eccentric Asian master who is either senial or sour, or what, but the film manages to force you to question your existence. And this is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Not many movies can be so bad that your head will explode as a Scanner. If you call (or MST3K) with your friends, this is the movie for you. I've seen it three times already and I think it could have caused permanent damage to my psyche. If you STILL don't have the slightest idea of ​​the quality of the film, people would try to give it away for free and nobody would take it. Not even by force. <br /> <br /> Long story short, look at it. Or as a masochistic pleasure or punishment. It will shake the skull (and for the most part, for all the wrong reasons).
