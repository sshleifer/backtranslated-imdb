I saw this movie for the sexy guy - and he sucked too! It was the worst - well, okay, I have to support that bizarre cop rap, it was even worse. The boy was not so nice in the end, he had the most terrible accent, and it was the most defined definition of Hicksville's idiot who could not stand his mother for what he "loved" there never was. Overall, and if this makes sense to you, when I go to pick up movies in the video store, I think of myself as I read the back of a movie that looks so / so, "Well, at least it can't be worse than Carolina Moon. "The most terrible film and the most terrible script, acting, plot - everything that made my throat reflexes made me go back. It was the most horrible film I've ever seen, with Gabriela there too. I hated it and I trust myself, if there were any number less than 1 IMDb for evaluation, I would choose it in the blink of an eye.
