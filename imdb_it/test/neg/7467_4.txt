It's not a terrible movie - my 10-year-old boy loved it, and he would be the demographic target, so I guess they got it right. Pretty boring for an adult though. <br /> <br /> Difficult to relate to animated legos, even high-tech mods. <br /> <br /> I thought the choice of the three great virtues of the Bionicle the world was a bit strange: unity, duty and destiny. Am I the only one to think that those sounds are just a little fascist? Above all destiny. What about freedom, equality, justice, etc.? <br /> <br /> Oh well, it will sell Lego. A bit boring for a movie, but not bad for a 74-minute announcement. It could be much worse.
