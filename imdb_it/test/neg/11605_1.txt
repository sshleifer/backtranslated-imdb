I am amazed that so many people find this film even close to good. Let me make it clear that I am a HUGE Hitchcock fan and have done everything to own as many of his films on video, but what I heard was below not only for Hitch's movies - aw heck, I too good here This picture is really sucked. I don't care that Hitch did a favor to the talented Carole Lombard, but I saw the 50s sitcoms with more intelligence and style than this boring turkey. Chemistry between Lombard and Robert Montgomery? Listne I like mashed potatoes and ice cream but I would not like to taste them together. I've seen better chemical spillage on the highway than here. <br /> <br /> If you really love Hitchcock, avoid this movie and see one of his best. For shouting out loud, the pieces that Hitch did on the old television program were more fun than anything this movie failed miserably.
