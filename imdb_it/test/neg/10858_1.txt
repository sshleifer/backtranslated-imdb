Larry Bishop, the writer / actor / director, focuses too much on the camera, music and images. The film makes use of insignificant digressions and vulgar monologues, which seem to have no other purpose than to be boring and irritating to the public. The actors experience a rough journey, from the beginning to the end of the film, and are captured by a terrible smoke bomb. Hell with the ride. The film is a bomb. <br /> <br /> Victors are presented as seasoned vigilantes, who seek their form of justice for what they see as illegality. They are motorcyclists, antiheroes and protagonists. Pistolero, played by Larry Bishop, is the vengeful leader of the pack. Gent (Michael Madsen) is trapped in his crossfire of chaos and psychosis. <br /> <br /> Comanche (Eric Balfour) is loyal but mysterious. Deuce, played by David Carradine, should be passed on tour, and so should ticket buyers (if you decide to watch the movie, you'll be sorry, but you'll find out why). Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) is an obscene and poisonous character, completely full of contempt. <br /> <br /> What perplexes me is how this film, with all its constant ramblings and vulgarity, has ever led anyone to invest in a race that is absolutely nowhere to be found. Ticket buyers, follow my advice: don't pay for the trip. Please do not make the same mistake as investors. <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes or so of the film are confused and incomprehensible. Dialogue, which quickly turns into meaningless monologues, makes no sense. The whole film is determined not to go anywhere. Poor Dennis Hopper is caught in the middle of a real mess. He too should have spent the trip. There are decapitated heads, torn throats and struggling naked women. It is clear that Bishop does not know where he will go with the film. You lose completely. But, at the end of the race, you don't care. Mamma Mia! Stay home. And, at all costs, don't go around. I consider this film a 1 in 10, but this film is so terrible that it deserves a zero.
