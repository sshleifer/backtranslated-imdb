^^ contains spoilers ^^ <br /> <br /> This movie is shit. Do not look. <br /> <br /> There is no one in this movie to cheer on, or even just except his wife, and she wins by default. Everyone is selfish and many things happen that make no sense. <br /> <br /> Acting is mediocre and everyone breathes too heavily on everything. No one can even cry credibly. <br /> <br /> If you leave the room for even a second, then something totally out of the field on the left will happen, and it will NOT SENSE OF EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> For example, I left the room for a second, while the character of Jennie Garth was sleeping with her manager. I'll be serious, about 4 minutes later, (I'm also pretty sure there was an advertisement somewhere in there) and she's sleeping with that Berko guy. <br /> <br /> I gave up on this film at a time when Berko was a donkey to his boyfriend in the car, because he didn't want to call the marriage. <br /> <br /> I lost 2 hours of my life. You should not.
