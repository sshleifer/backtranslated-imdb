This must be one of the most annoying, arrogant and poser movies I've ever seen. What a waste of budgets and actors. Angelopoulos has reached new levels of pretentiousness. It is clear that there is practically no plot, although this part of Greek history is material for great films. He simply had some seemingly symbolic (actually fictitious) scenes in his mind and built a whole movie around them. Death is the main theme and is repeated to the point of nausea, along with litanies, processions and the like, which should only be a vehicle for the film, but unfortunately it's the film itself. A totally inconsistent result, which can only let you say "eh?" or "oh dear" every two minutes. <br /> <br /> There is no character development at all, nada, zilch. I usually complain about some films with two-dimensional characters, but oh boy, he managed to create one-dimensional characters. This is irritating to us and degrading to some of the actors. He even managed to make one of my favorite Greek actors, Giorgos Armenis, look like wood. <br /> <br /> Going to the center of Angelopoulos' film: No, we're not idiots. We don't want chewed food. Please someone tell this guy that the symbolism must be subtle. Does Theo really underestimate your audience or are you simply incompetent? Personally, I think he tried to create a Greek "Underground". No matter how you try, you can't reach Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Only a saving grace: photography, costumes and music.
