The previous comments are very generous. This film is a waste of electricity and plastic. On the other hand, I had a great time giving it to friends to watch it and describe it in advance as "beyond belief!" "no word can express what I feel for this" "This film will move you" As expected, friends took these indecent comments as enthusiastic testimonials. They were wrong. The sadistic pleasure I had on these people was worth the $ 5 I paid for the film. On the other hand, a (former) friend says I owe him 90 minutes of his life. I particularly liked the "360 degree view" of some parts of the film. Really fantastic in its absurdity.
