"Black" as the title of the film is in Germany is another attempt to show one of the most interesting Roman emperors, Lucius Domitius Enobarbo, better known as Nero. Although this attempt has at least tried to show a more historic, more accurate Nero than the funny , but completely fictitious, Nero Peter Ustinov played in "Quo Vadis!" it's still a big failure. And to those IMDb commentators who still believe that Sueton and Tacitus propaganda is true, please read a book about Nero that was published less than 20 years ago. Black has NOT burned Rome, this is proven! He didn't kill British. He has not tortured, killed and mutilated for pleasure, he was the first emperor who FORBIDDEN the fights of gladiators. The film still shows many errors, errors and is still made in a really cheap style, especially the sets were cheap and unconvincing, the building looked like a villa, the city itself seemed like an economic set. The acting was between good and sub-par, the music almost insignificant and the film deteriorated soon after Nero became emperor in a hasty mess, badly modified without a clear narrative structure. So there is still the potential for an epic biography of Nero showing the real Nero, who was one of the best emperors who ruled Rome, despite the lies of Sueton et al.
