The films on U.F.O. they are always a nice way to kill some time, so on a rainy Sunday night I took this film, expecting what can be expected from a movie on DVD U.F.O. mystery. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong! About half of the film becomes very evident that the U.F.O. the theme is just a deceptive way to attract viewers unaware of this Christian propaganda. And this is not just a Christan movie from an average Christian. No, this is extremist fundamentalist Christianity. The scary type. <br /> <br /> At the end of this film, the unbelieving protagonist is deceived by their colleagues using a practical joke in thinking that the Rapture has begun (which is considered by Christians to be the event at the end of time where the true believers go to heaven and unbelievers are left behind. <br /> <br /> When the joke is explained, it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer, 'in case we Christians are right'. an excuse for never becoming a Christian if you ask me! <br /> <br /> This film still tries to convert unbelievers using intimidating tactics. "Believe in God or go to hell!" is the message here. , but quite offensive, really. Especially since this film is sold as something completely different. <br /> <br /> Suppose you yourself are a Christian fundamentalist and you probably won't be offended by the themes of this film, it's a good one movie idea? Ho p aura that it is not. No, actually I'm lying: I'm GLAD who isn't! The acting is horrible, the pace is horrible, the plot is horrible, especially the ending is ridiculously bad. As soon as the film starts, you immediately feel that this will be worse than you expected, and you will be right. <br /> <br /> In the first half hour, it seems at least to attempt to set up a passable UFO mystery, but then suddenly they bring into this Count Dracula resembling that he starts babbling the devil. At first you just think this guy is just a crazy maniac, but apparently, he actually represents the true opinions of the creators of this movie. As soon as you begin to realize it, you know how it will end. But it actually ends up getting worse. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
