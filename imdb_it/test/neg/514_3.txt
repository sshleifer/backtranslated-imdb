Pun intended. This low-budget action / horror vehicle for Don Wilson's chance to kick things is the direct video roaming stuff. <br /> <br /> The plot: Wilson is a vampire hunter without humor who is targeted by law enforcement locals after he was forced to slaughter creatures of the night in view of the public. The police chases him, the vampires follow him, he responds by kicking ... a lot. <br /> <br /> There's a little more to the story, but it's so irrelevant that I honestly can't remember it; I think people actually speak in the film, but it's all to be discussed. The plot is nothing but a trim for Wilson to kill as many vampires as possible in the running time, usually hitting them. <br /> <br /> The technical specifications are, in a word, anemic. Little color treatment, amateur lighting use, simplistic use of camera and angle. Blood and blood are noticeably limited, strange for this type of film. The most painful of the shooting scenes is the strident transition to a super-trembling cam during each fight scene. If the camera starts moving like a monkey in speed, then you know that Don is going to start kicking everything in sight. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is the kind of bad movie that can be done well with some friends and a lot of cynical humor. Otherwise, don't look, unless you really like watching things kicked. <br /> <br /> 3/10
