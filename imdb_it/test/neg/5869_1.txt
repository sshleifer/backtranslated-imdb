After reading other reviews on this site, we weren't sure if we would be able to criticize this film because it didn't sound bad enough. However, 2 minutes into the film, we knew we had to do another flop. No summer is complete without ice cream, but this film needed a melted ice cream cone with a broken bottom (you know, the kind that leaves you sticky and dirty and looking for a wet nap). The biggest problem with this film was the plot. What was that? He seemed to be a psychotic ice cream man who was roaming the neighborhood. That's all. Nothing else happens First of all, what are the qualifications to become an ice cream maker in this shitty city? 1. Spend several years in the most ridiculous psychiatric hospital known to man. This hospital was plagued by clowns, graffiti, fake plastic sunflowers and oversized syringes to the head. 2. Have extremely poor hygiene and a mutant face to scare children. 3. Make sure your truck is equipped with severed body parts, cockroaches and don't forget white eyes! <br /> <br /> The actors in this film are pure B-Movie caliber. Mixed with a group of strangers, who is different from ... a trailer-garbage version of Macaulay Culkin !! Even his dancing charm could not save this kick in his pants. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason for any of the murders in this film. The whole concept of the film stank! Who would kill an ice cream maker in a shootout? Gangsters? Fiends? Vanna White? Who? We are still struggling with this question. <br /> <br /> Anyone in charge of the wardrobe for this film should be immediately blacklisted in Hollywood. Did they honestly think that a pillow under a child's shirt would make the public believe he was really fat? Have they forgotten the arms, face, legs and all other parts of the body? Secondly, this film was made in 1995, yet the wardrobe seemed to have been chosen from a limping movie of the 80s, highlighted by the trousers with the tall and white pants of the older brother. <br /> <br /> While we were watching this prodigious production, we both developed serious ADD cases. We ended up leaving the room to walk aimlessly. At many points in the film, we found that fixing a white wall behind the T.V set. it was more fun than the actual movie. We were stunned that this film had not reached the bottom 100. Later, we removed the tape from the VCR and left it on the black top to melt it like a poor ice cream cone.
