Heftig og Begeistret (Intense and enthusiastic) is a documentary story of a male choir in Berlevåg, in the northern part of Norway, where the climate is cold and hostile, the days are dark during the winter and the cities are facing the young they move to the most populated areas in southern Norway, where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful part of this film is the humans themselves. The people in the choir, who are aged between 30 and 95, all have a unique and colorful life and are very pleasant beings. They are characterized by the harsh climate and the northern recession and have adapted to the required way of life. Throughout the film, we learn a bit about many people in the choir and follow them through the songs, some events in a church and the port, and finally, a trip to Murmansk. <br /> <br /> the external environment filmed in the film is very beautiful and characterized by the Norwegian nature. The scenography is also natural and taken directly from the choir and the lives of the people we meet. Their living rooms, the bathroom, the kettle on the oven; there is nothing artificial in this film, not in people, not in the environment, not in their music and not in their feelings. Everything is as real as it can be. <br /> <br /> Everything is lost though when it comes to giving a story. It's very beautiful and real, but why do we see it? Is it because of the songs? Is it because of nature? Or is it just simply to see a story about Berlevåg Mens-Choir, about their lives and some of the trips they have. The message, if any, is that this small company faces life through social events like the choir. The choir has held people together for many years. <br /> <br /> It's all very nice, but being as popular as it was, seen by almost 200,000 in Norway, there's something wrong. There is no beginning or end to it. No one gains or loses anything, no one reveals any message or tries to convince the public that this is good or that life up there is great. Why was this film made? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry. It's a good film about good people, but compared to the average European, Scandinavian or Norwegian film - this doesn't deserve a 9 out of 10. It's closer to 4 out of 10, and that's what I'll give it. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in a theater, you should expect the average age of the audience to be around 55-60. He reported being constantly high in all theaters. Perhaps this is also the reason why he receives such high praise in the news and good grades even on IMDB: it is a film about the elderly, for the elderly. It's a movie of "I don't regret anything in my life", and a story that says that living in a small town like Berlevåg could also be a good life.
