I agree with other comments from users. Hard to believe that this film came out in 1994 because it screams in the mid-80s. I think it's nicknamed because the sound and the image don't always match. If anyone can really say that this is a good movie, they must be locked up. It is so sad how money has so much power over people who will do anything to get it. I feel that I lost the intelligence in looking at this. Before I had observed a little respect for Chuck Norris, but now I feel sick. I bought this as part of a package of 3 films for $ 9.99 and I can honestly say that it would have been better to literally throw away the money. Forgive me Jesus
