Have you ever seen the movie "Marathon Man"? The part with the dentist? I'd rather it happen to me than to sit in "Random Hearts" again. He was not simply disinterested, or quiet ... He was terribly, painfully and painfully. At one point, I momentarily lost consciousness. For an average layman, I might seem to be sleeping, but the other patrons of the film consciously realized that I was actually BLACK OUT from the edge. I thought I'd die. At the end of the film (I think twelve hours have passed, but I'm not sure), I launched an exasperated "Thanks Jesus, it's over !!", to which all the other spectators cheered. If I had to listen to Harrison Ford's drone one more second in that monotonous lament, I would have been forced to look for something sharp in my eyes to divert my attention. They are 136 minutes of my life, I will never come back.
