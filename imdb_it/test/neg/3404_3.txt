I saw it AFTER having seen "Tunnel of death" (without doubt, the worst film I've ever seen in my life), so you can see that I rolled my eyes a little to see the directors and producers of that cinematic jewel be responsible for this. First of all, I thought the director and producer were the same guy. Both are Kid Rock meets Dawg the Bounty Hunter. I looked at the TAPS survey, and I'm not a skeptic, I think TAPS is the closest to a scientific method in the field. It was beautiful and credible - I think they are haunted. <br /> <br /> But this, like the reviewer mentioned above, is like a tour. Okay, a tour, okay, but the "investigators" and the "team leaders" seemed to be making a good penny and having a financial investment for their obsessed or not, so when they have fable stories, I have to take it with a heaping spoon of salt. <br /> <br /> As someone else mentioned, I could understand everything they wanted me to see in the picture about 50% of the time. The rest of the time, I couldn't understand anything. Moreover, without any context for the photos, the time of day, the type of camera, the humidity in the room, the dust particles (which account for 75% of the spheres), the weather and a ga-gillion other factors , I can't accept them. I can't even help thinking that some could be judged. <br /> <br /> Why should this band keep the numbers on the door? Vandalism? Even during the TAPS investigation, they tried to recover the death certificates of those nurses - and found only one that was deemed "accidental" (people didn't want to officially proclaim suicide). Yet when one of the guides mentioned this, he said "yes, and his marked suicide". I really felt like the witch-haunted house guides here in October. <br /> <br /> I still enjoyed the interviews with the patients and staff of the old hospital (i), which gave them much perspective and a personal touch. I am also glad that they mentioned the fact that the staff had the best intentions and were not macabre guardians. They weren't the best methods, but it was all they had. They wanted desperately to stop the disease.
