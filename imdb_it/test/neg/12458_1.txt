Why do people make bad movies? Didn't anyone who worked on the photo know that what they were doing made no sense? There is something in this image that threw me off, besides the fact that I found this "film" unrealistic, pathetic and PURELY SHAKE. I admire them for the attempt, but the "actors" of the film sometimes seem to try hard and no single character has substance or says something slightly intelligent. This film deserves zero stars. But I didn't have this option, so I get a 1.
