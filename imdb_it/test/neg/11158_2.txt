End of Days is one of the worst high-budget action movies I've ever seen. Muddling direction, script meander loaded with lame dialogues and gaping story holes, rapid-fire MTV-style editing and poor acting all the way. <br /> <br /> This does not mean End of Days is not watchable. The film kept me interested because I found Ah-nuld's latest action movie ridiculously stupid for being so inept and foolish when it comes to logic. Without the sense of logic the film dies faster, which is why End of Days deserved a huge drop in box office receipts in its second week after opening in the US <br /> <br /> I won't go into details Explain because End of Days violates the law of logic of the film, but here there are several problems with this film: <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) <br /> <br /> After the Devil has left, the restaurant explodes without any trace of how he did it. No finger breaking, no gas of energy altered to light the fire, nothing. How could this happen? <br /> <br /> Arnold and his annoying assistant Kevin Pollack somehow magically invent the name "Christine York" after examining the phrase "Christ in New York" carved on a victim's body, manages the database at computer and, purple, Christine York, the only person with the exact name in all of New York City! Beyond my suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> How do the characters who came into contact with Arnold's character turn against him later in the film? I laughed loudly when I recognized that the bad-stepmother-bad-stepmother-stepmother is the same actress who played a nanny in Romeo + Juliet by William Shakespeare. His ironic transition from that film to this was absolutely fun, if you can imagine it. <br /> <br /> All the explosions and the incredibly grandiose explosive shots. What did you expect in the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle? <br /> <br /> The Devil has taken the body of a man that includes flesh and blood, but is invisible to bullets and explosions through healing through that body. Logically, this is impossible. <br /> <br /> While the Devil marks the illusion in the apartment, Arnold's character runs into the solid Christmas tree which is presumably an illusion and * falls on it * physically. <br /> <br /> The Devil is able to split the person's brain and twist the head of a victim 180 degrees, yet he could not kill Arnold's character as he always intends. <br /> <br /> How the parents died of the Devil's desire and why the bad New Yorkers run after Arnold and the object of desire has never been explained at all. <br /> <br /> In the sequence that is a rip-off of Speed, Arnold and the object of desire of the devil manage to escape from the subway train sinking for the short distance in unharmed. This is beyond my comprehension, since strength would be enough to throw Arnold and the object of desire around violently and die from fatal injuries after impact. <br /> <br /> Arnold suffers the brutal beating of the crowd sanctioned by the Devil and placed him on the cross to hang on the wall, but the Devil forgot to take the time and opportunity to kill him for convenience. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, after the Devil took over the body of a man, all of a sudden Arnold is his bodyguard ??? Is it a coincidence or just an example of a bad change? <br /> <br /> Arnold's recital of indescribable dialogues in particularly ridiculous scenes like "YOU ARE A CHOIRBOY COMPARED TO ME!" they are the perfect fodder for MST3K, just like Eraser did with the classic "You're the baggage!" line. <br /> <br /> The whole 666/1999 theory is definitely ridiculous. So are the pseudo-religious rumors about Christian theology that involve the end of the world just at midnight and the fanatical murderers who know the position of the object of the Devil of desire. <br /> <br /> (MAKE SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> It is very ironic that the End of Days uses the scattered bad words that abuse gods as they roam Christian theories. The level of violence in the film is excessive and gruesome, so it is useless to serve the plot. The excess indulgence of the director is a factor here. Surely he does not know how to make a coherent action film from the Air Force One screenwriter who was forced to write the script only for a large sum of money. <br /> <br /> So, End of Days is a worthless film with no redeeming value except for campiness - the worst of Arnold after Hercules in New York. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
