I was aware of the critical pots of Man of the Year and completely insignificant, but I was ready to give the film the benefit of the doubt because I know that good images can fall under the radar during the busy release schedule of the autumn months. <br /> <br /> What I discovered is that the film is surprisingly uninspired. Surprising is a euphemism considering Barry Levinson's gift for political satire (shown in Good Morning Vietnam and Wag the Dog) and the obvious comic gifts of Robin Williams. In fact, Robin Williams is mysteriously underused. On the "Making Of" featurette accompanying the DVD, Barry Levinson talked about how he sometimes let Robin Williams improvise the script, as if it were his bad secret. Um, are you really a jerk, Barry Levinson? Whenever you have Robin Williams in your movie and you want to use it for his comic abilities (basically, every movie he has been in a movie other than Insomnia or One Hour Photo), don't put it in a script. Let him advertise what he wants because it is the most fun of any other person he can write for him and his mindless comics can immediately raise the level of any mediocre movie like RV or Patch Adams. What I found even more disconcerting in not using Robin Williams was in 1987, when Levinson used this exact formula to perfection in Good Morning Vietnam, injecting Robin Williams' comical zanesca explosions into a war framework to do a resounding political piece. <br /> <br /> So the film is not as much as possible regarding laughter and feels awkwardly lost in its tone. If the film had the potential to work like anything, it could have created one of those mid-90s thrillers in the style of The Pelican Brief, The Fugitive or one of those Jack Ryan movies. The plot centered around an employee of a Silicon Valley company who discovers an error in a system that reveals that the country has elected the wrong president and the CEO's efforts to eliminate it before the secret comes out, so if you've replaced Robin Williams with some Harrisons - Fords type actor, or maybe even Harrison Ford himself, added a couple of other explosions, and maybe that's where the movie was trying to go. I will never really know and it's not worth trying to find out.
