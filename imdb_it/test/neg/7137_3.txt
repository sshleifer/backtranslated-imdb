The Hollywood film industry is the laziest in the world. One shot is enough to flood the theaters with the same old shit reinvented over and over again. Take superheroes for example, for every X-Man and Spiderman, there are Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remakes are even worse. It only took The Ring, which was perfect for pitch (mainly because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky), to bring a lot of horrors similar to a creepy woman, eg. The Ring 2, The Eye, Dark Water (which was fine but useless), and grudges. <br /> <br /> The first Grudge was not entirely bad. Most of the way it was scary, which is what one might expect from it. Furthermore, the plot had some brains that mixed narratives. Grudge 2 is exactly like the previous one; this could be a good thing, but hey, what guy Men in Black II? Was the whole script a good thing xerox and just change the bad guy? For The Grudge 2, the critic goes the same way. <br /> <br /> Awesome fears, bad acting (except Amber Tamblyn) and clich√©s everywhere. Three stories take place in different places and times. There's Aubrey (Tamblyn) investigating what pushed her sister Karen to death (Sarah Michelle Gellar); Allison (Arielle Kebbel) who is taken by her colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first film occurred; and finally, an American family that sees strange things happening in the apartment next door. I'm happy to say (and I'm serious) that everything is tied to the end, but we must not rely on the end to make a good impression, when everything else is simply boring and boring. <br /> <br /> the chills are everywhere, a girl alone in the lockers, someone who should not enter a house, others who dig too deep. Meanwhile, the ghosts continue to kill, kill and kill, which seems even more deadly than ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic. Hey, doesn't that sound like another bad Japanese remake, something called Pulse? Yes, day after day it becomes easier to hold a grudge ... against Hollywood bullshit.
