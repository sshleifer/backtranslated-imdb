It says a lot about the UK when TV shows like this are not only made, but also for three series. Unfunny, politically correct to the point of getting sick and badly recited and written. Meera Syal was not fun or smug in everything she was, she keeps telling me I'm wrong, and Jasper Carrott, the funny guy as he is, is well over his eighty prime. It's such a bad comedy that it could have been made by ITV, but even fools like The Upper Hand and the one with James Bolam as a parking warden look like Fawlty Towers over this garbage. I'd like to sit down with the writer / director of this show so that they can indicate the humor in this program. Sure, most of the UK population is made up of poorly educated swarms, but that doesn't tickle their funny bones. This is whether they could break away from Big Brother or their mobile phones, but that's another story. Complete and total dirt!
