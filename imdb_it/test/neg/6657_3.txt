This plot had more holes than an OJ Simpson alibi! <br /> <br /> I noticed two Star Trek references in the film and, again, <br /> <br /> ironically we have a main character played by Andy Garcia <br /> <br /> which is the antithesis of Vulcan philosophy of "The needs of many are greater than the needs of the few or of one". <br /> <br /> Let's just say that while trying to save your child from cancer, he puts most of the rest of San Francisco at an incredible risk. Even the character of Michael Keaton is almost as unrealistic. He neglects to kill on numerous occasions and yet becomes angry when Garcia foils his attempt to kill a group of policemen at the same time. The child's doctor remains responsible for his faculties even after being held hostage several times in a short space of time, but <br /> <br /> has put her on a large 5-story passage and she loses it < br /> <br /> Andy Garcia's son is something of an anathema in this movie <br /> <br />. He is the most likeable and real character, one of the bright points of the film. Furthermore, he utters a joke, which must have been the result of serendipity, concerning the fight against cancer that compares Keaton's motivation to escape. All in all, the film was not a complete waste (see from Dusk to Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money <br /> for that) but disappointing considering the talent available.
