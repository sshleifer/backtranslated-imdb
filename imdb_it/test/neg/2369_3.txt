The film version of "Rising Damp" came out two years after the end of the television series. Like many fans, I went to the cinema when it opened. I came away bitterly disappointed. Eric Chappell could not have spent much time writing the script; most of it is modernized from old episodes. When the film was released, the "Rising Damp" series was still repeated regularly on I.T.V. then the public was asked to pay to see something they had already seen. At least the movie "On the Buses" boasted original screenplays. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Richard Beckinsale had died the year before, so they eliminated the character of "Alan" out of respect, replacing the art student "John ', played by Christopher Strauli in" Only When I Laugh ". It simply wasn't the same. <br /> <br /> As another poster pointed out, Rigsby's board was not like the one used in the series, being bigger and cleaner. <Br /> <br /> Director Joe McGrath was one of the directors who worked on the original 'Casino Royale', a film full of surreal humor. 'Rising Damp' also has its share of 'Walter style' fantasy sequences Mitty ', like the parody' Saturday Night Fever '. Personally, I found them horribly out of place. A case of "over-egging the pudding". <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Leonard Rossiter is magnificent as always the squalid "Rigsby", as well as Frances De La Tour as "Ruth" and Don Warrington as "Philip. It is a pity that the film is not worthy of their talent. <br /> <br /> When Rossiter died in 1984, it was shown by I.T. as a tribute, with its final scene - which shows Rigsby lying prostrate at the foot of the stairs - removed in the interest of good taste.
