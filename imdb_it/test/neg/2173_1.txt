I don't normally write reviews, but this "movie" was special. I couldn't turn it off. I don't think I've ever seen a worse movie, but I sat and watched. It was like a horrible car accident with blood running on the highway. It was disgusting, but I couldn't turn it. Where do I start? The film seems to think it's a sports thriller, but it's so utterly ridiculous, it can only be a comedy, but it's not funny, not even in a stupid / silly way. It's like watching your cousins ​​trying to play a family scene. It's painful to watch, but at least it's only for a minute or two. Second String went on for over an hour. <br /> <br /> Anyone involved in making this film should not work again. Writing, directing and acting was just terrible. The problem is that I can't describe how bad it was; you just have to see it. And I'm sure this will never be shown again, so unless you've seen it, you're unlucky. I mean, it's almost worth seeing just because he gave me some appreciation for every other "bad" movie I've seen in my life. And for every movie I see in the future that I can't stand, I'll think of myself, well, at least it's not as bad as the second string.
