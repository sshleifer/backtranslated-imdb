Human Traffic is purely a state there, what an experience ?? only this time it is rather limp. <br /> <br /> The main themes explored are paranoia, male impotence and jealousy ?? but only slightly and badly. <br /> <br /> Much of the film seems to want to imitate Trainspotting (drug culture / `clubbing ') ?? but fails to include the low / low times that Trainspotting treats (eg: problems with death / addiction, etc.). Do you also try to invent a monologue similar to the classic "Choose Life" speech by Ewan McGreggor? but `Milk bars are on me! Yes!' ?? What is all this ?! <br /> <br /> The characters try to analyze their lifestyle, but when is their lifestyle so shallow? their analysis becomes boring and repetitive. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack (for a film that tries to be cool) is pathetic. Does it include characters like Fat Boy Slim and CJ Bolland ?? are we people? good dance music is better than this! <br /> <br /> The characters become irritating and annoying (especially in the middle of the film) and the lack of attention to the characters soon fades. <br /> <br /> Are there a couple of funny scenes ?? but they are few and far between. The mother who captured her son in the bedroom was quite funny. <br /> <br /> But PLEASE? I'm tired of dying of the Star Wars analog scenes. I thought it was much sharper in a couple of Kevin Smith movies (ex: Clerks and Chasing Amy). According to the characters ?? Yoda is a drug demon so that's why he's low and bald ?? eh?! <br /> <br /> My score ?? 4 out of 10 ?? do yourself a favor and see Trainspotting or Go instead!
