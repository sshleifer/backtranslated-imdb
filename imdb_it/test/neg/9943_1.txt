I saw hundreds of kung fu movies and heard some good things about this movie, so I decided to try it. What I saw was one of the worst cinematic performances I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can't help but think that the director wants to have all the muscle in Hong Kong in this film. Everyone exaggerates to the point of stupidity. Even Conan the Barbarian had a little courtesy. This film has only semi-evolved men screaming in every scene and stupid women who have no respect for themselves. The narrator character should be killed for sucking so much ... he really didn't deserve to live to the end. The whole film was a melodramatic disaster, with horrible acting, bad direction and bad action. They should just rename this movie to "The Stupid One-Armed Caveman with a Blade" Here's a question ... why do some directors use fast cuts for some action movies? Answer: To hide the shortcomings of the actors. each scene was close together and cut quickly without any kind of flow. The film tried so hard to show intensity, but it became almost ridiculous. Please, stay away from this movie. or any taste in the movies.
