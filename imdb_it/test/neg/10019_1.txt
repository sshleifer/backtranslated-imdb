This is really, without exaggeration, one of the worst Slasher films ever made. I know, it came out in the 80s following a trend started by "Friday 13th". "The Prey" copies the film mentioned in many respects. The set woods, the killer, the stupid boys, the cold blood, etc. <br /> <br /> But "The Prey" is as bad as one might expect. I don't even remember if it wasn't coincidence. <br /> <br /> Well, the killer is indeed human so don't expect a supernatural killer like Jason. The situations are rather boring and lacking in tension, blood, violence, etc. It just doesn't work for a slasher movie. <br /> <br /> Acting is simply horrible. The score is horrible! a combination of boring tools with 80's music tracks?! I won't even say the technical aspects of the film, because believe me, it seems to cost only 20 dollars. <br /> <br /> Please avoid this like the plague. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's something to say. Thank God he seems to have vanished from the earth.
