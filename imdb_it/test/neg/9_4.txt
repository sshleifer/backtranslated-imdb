David Bryce's comments in the vicinity are exceptionally well written and informative, almost like saying everything I hear about DARLING LILI. This huge musical is so unique, exaggerated, overproduced and must have caused Paramount breaks in 1970. It cost $ 22 million! This is simply irresponsible. DARLING LILI must have been lit by a board meeting that said "hey, we received that pink panther boy and that music player ... we take him too" and we gave him a blank check. The result is a hybrid of GIGI, ZEPPELIN, HALF A SIXPENCE, some songs from the MGM 40s and dance numbers of a style (daisies and navigators!) So hopelessly antiquated as to seem musical porridge and dramas MATA HARI. The production is colossal, luxuriant, breathtaking to behold, but the rest: the ridiculous love story, Julie seems confused, Hudson already dead, the enchanted comedy and the incredibly boring songs that make this film irritating. LILI is like a mega musical of the 1940 twee with some vulgar bits to make it more spicy. STAR! Released the year before, unfortunately it crashed and now it is finally appreciated for the excellent film is sincerely ... and Andrews seems sublime, mature, especially in the last half hour ...... but LILI is PAPAVONI and DOLLY frilly and I really think we killed the mega musical resonance of the 60s ... and made Andrews Poppins look again ... which I believe was not Edwards' intention. The Paramount must have fainted collectively when it saw this: and with another $ 20 million of festivities in CATCH 22 and $ 12 million in ON A CLEAR DAY and $ 25 million in PAINT YOUR WAGON ... they had a financial abyss of CLEOPATRA proportions with $ 77 million tied in 4 films with a very uncertain future. Perhaps they should have asked the seer Daisy Gamble of ON A CLEAR DAY ...... LILI was very popular at the first release in Australia and ran for 70mm in theaters for months but failed once in submarines and sticks and only ever emerged after one night with ON A CLEAR DAY as a Sunday night double. Thank God, Paramount had her simple $ 1 million movie (yes, ONE MILION DOLLAR) LOVE STORY and that $ 4 million photo THE GODFATHER ready to recover all $ 77 million over the next two years. .. for only $ 5 million. ... unbelievable!
