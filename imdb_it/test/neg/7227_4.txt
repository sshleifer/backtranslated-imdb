If Daphne Du Maurier had set the REBECCA in the 1950s in San Francisco, it might very well look like this very unusual noir by Robert Wise. Valentina Cortese interprets a concentration camp survivor who steals the identity of a dead woman and sneaks into the life of Richard Basehart (who also happens to be the guardian of the dead woman's child) ... it's absurd and over-the- top but also topflight entertainment. Cortese is terrifying, slowly falling to pieces as he realizes the mistake he made. Basehart is fine if a little bland ... even if the lighting towards the end makes it look very threatening. Fay Baker is an excellent guardian of Mrs. Danvers. Wise is a good director and keeps things moving with a rather lively clip. He also staged a classic car crash out of control with Cortese (or at least a Cortese stunt) behind the wheel.
