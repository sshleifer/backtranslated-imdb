Director Delbert Mann was a much better director than what this film indicates. He directed EVERYTHING QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, THAT TOUCH OF MINK and LAST DAYS OF PATTON, among others. This mediocre, made for the television review of Dicken's masterpiece is so ugly, even those not familiar with the often filmed story, will be unsatisfied. <br /> <br /> Besides the fact that the film is available only from two known suppliers (Brentwood and BCI Eclipse LLC) the poor quality of the transfer and the scratchy and confusing audio track makes the task of finding this movie on video not it's worth it. <br /> <br /> I have always believed that if a company was going to put a movie on video and upload public money to buy it, then they should at least have a descent copy of the film and do a good job on the transfer. Unfortunately neither supplier has such a work ethic and the result is only suitable for the local discount basket of business. <br /> <br /> The story is told mainly through flashbacks, making the film episodic and chatty. Much of the rich detail of the novel is lost in this translation. The characters of Martha, Traddles and others have been cut and the relationship between the young David and Steerforth has not been explored enough, so we are wondering why David would go out with the boy. <br /> <br /> The relationship between David the boy and the young Agnes are never developed and it is difficult to understand why she and David eventually get married. Since Martha is excluded, it is a mystery how Dan Peggoty finds his niece. And the absence of Traddles makes David a very lonely type. <br /> <br /> Some have given this film an excellent job in absorbing the long novel. I disagree, this is at best a work of ax on the book. Anyone who has seen George Cukor's 1935 version will agree. <br /> <br /> The performances in that version of Fields as Micawber and Rathbone in the role of Murdstone, are certainly worth watching. And the most recent versions of Masterpiece Theater (April 2000) and Hallmark (2000) are both extraordinary achievements in television adaptations of classic novels. The directors Simon Curtis and Peter Medak who are responsible for those films deserve the highest praise. <br /> <br /> My final comment on David COPPERFIELD 1969 is Don't buy it, there are many much better versions of the film available. If he is on television, he turns the channel into something else. It's a waste of an hour and twenty minutes of your life. Sorry folks, but I can't praise such a frighteningly terrifying film.
