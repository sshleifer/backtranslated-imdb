1st comment of the movie ever! I'll start by saying "Come on! It wasn't that bad ... was it?" ... No, it wasn't so bad. I laughed and chuckled enough times during the movie, so I can't say with my hand over my heart that it was garbage. <br /> <br /> It's completely different, this and Epic Movie (epic movie sucked badly .. doh!). "Why?" people would ask. I'll tell you how This movie is not so useless, not to mention the fact that the stupid (and I say stupid because he is, but being stupid makes it funny) the things that happen around and with the characters are really fun in this movie. Not the best around, but hey ... what do you expect - watch the poster! Some people said it was stupid, I find that when you write a comment you should be more objective (my opinion) but yes, of course it was stupid, it's a "stupid" movie! Look, I'm not telling you to go see the movie now or you've missed the century event. What I'm saying is, if you happen to see the movie somewhere, please don't cut your eyes on the credits. Look what it is - who knows, you might like it a little. <br /> <br /> I give him 4/10 for not being so bad and making me laugh and some unexpectedly good sex-related jokes.
