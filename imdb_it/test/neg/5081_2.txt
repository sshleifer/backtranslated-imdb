Those people, who told me "this movie is good" -shame about them! this film is for an audience that has no problem watching everything (especially when it comes to tough guys, guns, chases and thefts}. movies with "The Inside Man" (the same waste of time). I'm tired of copying and paste films, and I am unhappy, but what can I do? Fans of that kind of film are much more ... if you want to see a good movie like that, I will recommend you "Lucky Number Slevin". , I don't like this film {weak actors, weak script, weak action}. Probably someone else will like it. many people - many tastes. FOR ME "CAOS" IS WITHOUT SALAD FOR ME!
