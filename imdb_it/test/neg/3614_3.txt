A wide variety of snakes stage a revolt on tourists who "invade" their island due to the damage of their captain. The few survivors who have not been caught by snakes will attempt an escape mission, their goal of escaping to the available boats that can safely take them off the island. <br /> <br /> Presented straight with injected doses of visual humor with so many snaking gags, Wayne Crawford's SNAKE ISLAND presents a lot of different breeds of slimy predators, in surprising positions, ready to attack prey. Star William Katt, author of snakes in search of a new novel, enjoys his role together with the writer / director / co-star Wayne Crawford (.. as the captain of the tourist boat) as putative heroes who set one of the most serious crises . Kate Connor is Crawford's interesting love interest, a lawyer on vacation. The other cast members serve as tourists or as crew members, mostly fodder for snakes. <br /> <br /> As in many other films of this type, director Crawford presents live snakes with computer-generated ones, and violence is really docile. Crawford even incorporates the technique of point of view with the camera as the eyes of the snake while facing the potential victim (.. with the actor looking directly into the camera). Never be taken seriously, the ironic approach was probably the best way to shoot SNAKE ISLAND because the premise is too ridiculous to accept it alone. <br /> <br /> Effects and suspense scenes rarely work because Crawford is often unable to successfully organize sequences in which humans are confronted with snakes. Even snakes attack themselves they never occur on the screen (.. one or two at the top), or they are presented so clearly that they leave little impression. This is a no-no for a genre like this. Katt fans will probably want to try it because it provides some facial comedies that establish the general tone of certain scenes in which he must defend himself from snakes. The CGI scenes in which we see a large number of snakes in a general area are not very effective and remove the realism that Crawford could have tried to establish. There are many better horror films that depict snakes as the aggressors of SNAKE ISLAND. Amazing moments of nudity, relegated to a scene in which tourists and crew relax after a long day spent with sparkling wine, without knowing what danger awaits us.
