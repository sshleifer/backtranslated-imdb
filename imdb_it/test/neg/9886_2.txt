The blood and chocolate film is NOTHING like the book. The plot has totally changed and anyone who chose the cast needed to read the book. Before the girl is not introverted, Aden is. Vivian was the one who chased Aden. His mother would survive and be the one after Gabriel. Astrid was the one who did all the murders along with Ralf an ex of Vivian. Gabriel is not old. It's old. And Aden did NOT have Vivian in the end, Gabriel did it. The title came from Vivian comparing the kisses of Aden (sweet as chocolate) and Gabriel (delicious as blood). He picked up blood because he promised more and he understood more. This reminds me that Gabriel is not against humans like in the movie. He only avoids intimacy with them because they hurt him in the past. Really the book is tremendously better than the film. But if you want to see or run, a montage of appointments and lots of jumps. So this is the movie to see.
