And unfortunately, me too. ANY film that relies on a bad wordplay like its slogan or its title should be relegated to the $ 2.00 trash can, but we decided to try a second consecutive bad movie for movie night. We had a winner in "House of the Dead" - go with that if you want a ridiculous shot. <br /> <br /> Some witches jumped into the water after being burned by Mr. Miner. Someone made a dump in the woods. And that same guy grabbed a new girl right in front of the old one. I don't remember much else. The last third of the film was absolutely bland, and we were all waiting in agony until the end.
