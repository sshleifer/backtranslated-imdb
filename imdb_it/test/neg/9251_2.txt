This was shown on a premium channel, so I didn't realize it was made for TV. Even so, I like some of the movies about life (Lifestyle here in the UK), but this was terrible. The family was so fat, "I love you mom" "I love you even more sweetness" Then, after they were violated for the second time, 10 minutes later, there were again, "I love you mom", big cheese smiles etc .. Call your husband and tell him not to disturb the return home. They were dismantled by a boy who wanted them dead, they have a litter that lives in the next room, who needs help? She has a teenage daughter and a cat (not for long) to take care of her. <br /> <br /> However, as a comedy, I would give it a good 7. I could even show it to my friends when I have them around. It could be a lot of fun after a bottle of Vodka or 10!
