What is given to us in this trendy trendy film is a "frat-pack" of college friends, now approaching 30 years (which we all know, of course, their generation thinks like the "new 20"). Composed of four boys and a girl, they pushed the following types: apparently "unemployed" and frequent drug users, along with an individual who is successful at work and one who is trying to be. They are all, in their own way, adrift while trying to find both future and emotional happiness. With one, possibly two exceptions, these are the people to whom this reviewer would never bother to approach modeling later. There is disappointment after the disappointment after the disappointment in almost all of their lives. Except in the case of an individual (who appears on the road to find him), no one seems directed towards emotional satisfaction in his life. And therefore, the only sincere moment in this film is when a knock on the door leads the person to respond in an unexpected way and hear "I love you". <br /> <br /> With only the mentioned exceptions, these people are the kind that hardly deserves or worthy of several hundred thousand dollars that are thrown away in presenting their stories. <br /> <br /> PS - The writer / director, Johnson, seems to have a problem showing gay sex scenes - --- without such problems in presenting the most prolonged and revealing heterosexual ones. Why could it be? <br /> <br /> ****
