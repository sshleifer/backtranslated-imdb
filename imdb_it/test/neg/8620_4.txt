In Thailand, Americans Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and his girlfriend Amanda (Meredith Monroe) fight in a Muay-Thai fight, and Amanda leaves Connor alone. He asks the hotel management to a stranger, or rather the average vampire Niran (Don Hetrakul), and is bitten and kidnapped by his band of evil vampires on motorcycles. Connor joins a clan of "good" vampires led by Sang (Stephanie Chao), trying to save Amanda from Niran's claws. <br /> <br /> I expected "Vampires: The Turning" to be a good movie. The locations and the cinematography are beautiful; the very heavy soundtrack is excellent; Stephanie Chao is beautiful and attractive; but unfortunately, the script and director are terrible and Meredith Monroe's very loose costume doesn't help her fallen breasts. The story is very short, and the unknown Marty Weiss uses long scenes with motorcycle races, boring fights and flashbacks to complete a minimum running time for the film. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vampiros: A Convers√£o" ("Vampires: The Conversion")
