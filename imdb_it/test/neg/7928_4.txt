For a film that was the most watched in its native South Korea for most of 2004, it was a huge disappointment. Show that Hollywood is not the only place where people can make films that are too emotional and melodramatic. The film has a duration of over 130 minutes, but in reality not much has happened and everything that happened was practically what was expected, the plot was transparent. Of course, if one were Korean, perhaps one would go deeper, but for me it didn't do much. Suffice it to say that, as the case tends to be with Korean cinema, the plot revolves around the relationship between the northern and southern parts of the peninsula. South Korea decides to recruit and train a team of elite assassins from prisoners sentenced to death to kill Kim Il-Sung. A boring plot doesn't bother me much if the characters are good but unfortunately this is not the case this time. They are stereotypes and most of the acting is mediocre and too often over the top because it tends to be in Korean cinema. Too much time is spent on the numerous montages and the characters remain distant, cardboard cuts of a size. They should have spent more time establishing the characters and less time showing us how hard and cruel the training and the soldiers are. <br /> <br /> One thing that reminds us, is that a minor of two wrongs is still wrong.
