A guy named Karl Rhamarevich learns to live even after dying through telekinesis. He is buried in a mausoleum. That same night Julie (Meg Tilly) has to spend the night there to join a group called "The Sisters". And Karl's "power" is in full bloom. <br /> <br /> Silly movie. I saw him in a theater when I was 21 and I was generally bored. The PC's rating should have tipped me: this is a horror film for children. A real stupid scene eventually has a corpse that breaks through the cement to hit a young guy! To begin with, the corpses are placed on the head first, making it impossible for the corpse to use its arms and there is no way anyone can break through the cement. When you notice stupid mistakes like this, the film is not doing its job. <br /> <br /> It has two good scenes: two of "The Sisters" are "attacked" by floating bodies that crowd them. At one point one of the sisters hit a corpse in her stomach - her hand enters the body and she can't get it out! That scene has remained with me ever since. And there's something nice that involves a corpse and a toothbrush at the end (which made my audience laugh). But the rest of the film is a dark and boring memory. Only for children - adults will be bored. I give him a 3.
