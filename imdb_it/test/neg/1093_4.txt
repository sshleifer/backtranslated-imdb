I don't know if this exceptionally boring film was intended as an unofficial sequel to "The French Connection", but it has many of the same drawbacks: the script is so confused that the viewer remains uninvolved and feels excluded from the picture and the direction is so cold, so lacking in energy, that even the great chase sequence cannot revive things. (* 1/2)
