This is by far the worst Hemingway adaptation ever. Rock Hudson was terribly ill and absolutely incredible as a soldier / adventurer who was a hard fisherman attracted by the war. Jennifer Jones was too old for her part and Vittorio de Sica seemed to think of acting in some other film. They have tried to achieve a large-scale epic of a low-profile romantic novel and the result is terrible. As if this were not enough, everything is so slow, too long and dated that it is practically unwatchable. Rock must have kicked himself for shooting down "Sayonara" and "Ben Hur" to make this horrible shit. <br /> <br /> 0/10. To avoid.
