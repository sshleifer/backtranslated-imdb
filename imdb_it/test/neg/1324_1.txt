I love Das Boot. I was hoping for something like this: a realistic war movie, which depicts solid and civil on both sides as real people, with the joy and pain of fighting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it appears that Stalingrad was written by a third grader and directed by a fifth grade student. The main parts of the film simply appear to be missing, leaving it completely disconnected. The dialogue in the translation is ridiculous, but does not seem better in the native language; you just have to look at the faces of the actors during the bad moments of dialogue to realize how ugly this movie is.
