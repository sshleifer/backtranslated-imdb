SPOILER - This film gives plot points and discusses the ending. I hated this film - mainly for political reasons, but also for moral and aesthetic reasons. Politically, this film has glorified war and military technology, blasting things really well. We are brought to exult as the music swells and the Afghans use our weapons to blow up the Ruskies. And no American soldier puts their lives in danger - so it's a fun war. Aesthetically, there is not a touch of real human emotion in the film, only smug, privileged people being sarcastic, feeling superior, and doing whatever they want regardless of the consequences. And speaking of consequences, the film makes only a few small strokes on what the Afghan armament has actually brought. I had read an earlier draft of this script, and ended September 11th - with Charlie Wilson realizing that things had gone terribly wrong. But that wouldn't let the public feel good. This is a good film about the killing of the Ruskies. And it hurt me.
