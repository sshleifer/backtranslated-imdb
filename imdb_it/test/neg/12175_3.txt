The attractiveness of this film must be the European artistic style, because there is absolutely no substance. A lot of things happen that seem to go somewhere ... but they never get there. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to find a complete 10-line comment, because this film is a totally empty experience. There are many beautiful photographs of a cemetery, some really lame zombie effects, some flashes of what might pass for surrealist humor, and a weak, existentialist ending. These elements threaten each other. Just when you could enjoy the creepy atmosphere, there's a little bit of stupidity with the bouncing heads or the sex of the zombies. To avoid screaming with boredom, you cling to the minimal plot - and disintegrate into an illogical ridicule. It is as if someone had taken several B-baked films and thrown them into a blender. <br /> <br /> What comes out is mainly a movie * about * nonsense - and * not * good. Clearly, it will impress that category of art-house fans who see emptiness as indistinguishable from depth. Everyone else should be well away from this squalid mess.
