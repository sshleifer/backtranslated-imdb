Now you can really call it a movie. Did I know that some of the movies that the Japanese do are worth nothing if not this bad? I mean how I fell three times to sleep in this movie. No horror, a small comedy percentage (0.2-0.5). Action we only admit he has, but the scenes are poorly filmed, the actors are pathetic. None of the actors did a good job in his role. They were not convincing. Even the script is terrible. I mean this movie can be great, REALLY, but for the 60s (not 100% certain.) I recommend NOT seeing it, unless you want to get so bored as I did. I really can't imagine that this film has its own rating. IT'S OVER, OVER, OVERATED !!!. This is a personal opinion, of course. I don't want to offend anyone, but who could like this shit? So I hope this helps someone not to waste some time "enjoying" this movie. However it is your choice!
