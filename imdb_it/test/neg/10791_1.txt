This story is about a safari in Africa that meets a boy named Trent - who convinces them to look for a tribe of white girls. Of course, they turn out to be Amazonian warriors and capture men. The rest is quite predictable. <br /> <br /> This film has everything you would expect in a basic film about Africa - the substantial use of often irrelevant stock footage, films of animals NOT native to the continent (such as Orangutan, Moose, Coatamundis and Ground Hogs), a white actor with dark makeup who plays a native, bad acting (in particular from Trent - a handsome man with balsa wood personality), a comic relief (similar to Chico Marx), a boy dressed in a gorilla suit and white women dressed in bikinis with permanents who are supposedly fierce jungle warriors - like an angry Tarzan tribe. In my opinion, my assumption is that the film was made for less than $ 49.95 - including the costs of developing and paying for the rental of the gorilla suit! But what I didn't expect was an IMDb score of 4.9. This is poor, but not so poor since it is a production of schlock in all possible ways and there is no plausible reason why the film is rated so high! Now I am NOT saying that the film is not worth seeing - it's campy and stupid enough to make the vision enjoyable - especially with friends. Just don't expect anything that looks like a professionally made or competent film. <br /> <br /> Finally, here is a smattering of the dialogue from this jungle classic: <br /> <br /> "Oolama is a strong white man. Oolama wants a strong white man ..." <br /> <br /> "oonga-bunga" <br /> <br /> "me-te-tonga .... no, .... keeel ('kill') man"
