My mother forced me to watch this movie with her. Apparently he will look at everything with a vampire advice. I was bored in everything. <br /> <br /> In several places, Underworld: Rise Of The Lycans remembers Spartacus, The battle for the planet of the apes, The passion of Christ and Mandingo! What reminds me the most are those Italian images of swords and sandals of the '60s (not good ones) that spend an excessive amount of time showing Greek or Roman despots in robes that talk and plot incessantly while impatiently waiting for the muscular man hero and his lover, usually the daughter of the despots, to do something. <br /> <br /> This film was in desperate need of color and suspense. The characters were rather two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The sets seemed to be made entirely of pewter! I wonder how many sets of Civil War Chess have been merged to make this film. <br /> <br /> All those who wear fishnet stockings on your arms and black lipstick, feel free to click NO.
