Last night I sat down to watch this film being played on Greek television due to the upcoming Olympics hosted by my city. Knowing that it is an American film, I had already expected it to focus more on the history of American athletes. And I was really ready for this. But what I saw was ..., too! I mean, when a film has such a title ("First Olympics: Athens 1896"), even if of American origin, you would not expect it to be so propagandistic and, at the same time, ignorant of athletes and other countries' efforts . American athletes seem to have all the gifts of nature (strength, intelligence, generosity, kindness, courtesy ...), in contrast to their "athletic sinners" in the Games, who seem not even able to ... express their thoughts or expressing feelings. The number of times the American anthem is played during the film must be an absolute record in filmography. Megalomania at its best! He even uses fictional facts that ridicule the Greek nation, like the Greek citizens who serve foreign athletes of the marathon with wine, to help the servants win the race. So much for the Olympic spirit. <br /> <br /> Think about it. and putting a bad grade to a movie whose title is also Greek is something that doesn't make me happy at all. According to what I've seen, I can't give it more than 4 out of 10 (actually it's quite generous).
