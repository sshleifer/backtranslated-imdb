Alfred Hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think of: he set the standards so high that any director who creates a suspense film will be fatally compared to him. <br /> <br /> The main subject of this vehicle Bullock, all the ideas, almost everything was already in the classic Hitchcock "Rope": the two students who commit a free crime, the philosophy of Nietsche and the clues that the boys spread, the Master was the first to transfer them to the screen. And with eighty-minute film that was a compelling technical tour de force. <br /> <br /> "Murder by number" does not take place in a single room, like "the rope", mind you. And, what a supreme originality, he puts two policemen against the bad young men and, you would never guess, these two policemen are very different: in reality, Bullock plays the part of the woman who lives like a man, and his companion (Chaplin) is shy like an incapable girl. The two boys' performances are not really stunning, not as good, as, for example, that of Edward Norton in "primary fear". <br /> <br /> Well, you know, "Corda" was so good ....
