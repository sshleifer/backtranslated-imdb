Another film directed by Disney, which is essentially perfect for children. The problem with Kronk's New Groove that I find is that everything that made the first movie a fun ride has been replaced by a sadder, darker film. In this film, Kronk learns many lessons at the expense of many others. It takes a lot of time to create a more fun movie. <br /> <br /> Kronk's New Groove takes care of two stories: Yzma returns for reimbursement and a Mrs. Birdwell hopes to defeat Kronk's counseling camp. All this leads Kronk to confront his father and his disapproval of his son's leadership in life. <br /> <br /> From the Lord of the Rings to Michael Jackson's thriller, Kronk's New Groove recycles every moment of time that lets people entertain. If you loved the original, or you can't wait for the next TV series about Kuzco, I recommend Kronk to his loyal fans.
