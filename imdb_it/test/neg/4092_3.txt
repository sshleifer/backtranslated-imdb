The biggest problem with this film is that it's nothing like Bruce Allmighty. The first film played on the imagination of every dreamer of the day to be able to control the surrounding environment as it sees fit. But Evan's experience is completely different. He has no control that Jim Carrey has around and instead the story centers on the power of faith. Now this would have been fine, since the first movie was preaching the same message. The problem is that the sequel preaches at the expense of comic relief. And to add insult to injury, he also throws himself into politics in the plot. You have the distinct feeling that there is a clear message with this film, and the main goal is not to make you laugh. To summarize, this film is a failed mix of "The Distinguished Gentleman" by Eddie Murhphy and "The Ten Commandments" by Charlton Heston. I'm not sure if Steve Carrell is at fault here, you have the feeling that his character is limiting his skills as a comedian, the ex-newsletter Evan Baxter shouldn't be funny, he's basically an antagonist turned into a protagonist who in this case only adds to the confusion of what this cinematic message should talk about.
