The chupacabra, according to this mockumentary, is a mysterious creature <br /> that for years kills and eats Hispanic goats in America and Mexico. One crossed the border in southern Texas, and a nice and intrepid cryptozoologist (no, I didn't invent that word) go to an isolated ranch to find one. His uncle <br /> <br /> was killed by the creature, and some grainy images of the monster exist <br /> <br /> exist. He takes a black guy with a gun and two cameramen <br /> (for an easy cover to modify), and they go hunting for chupacabras. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes into the film, they find it. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film sees the team of documentarists attacked by the bloodthirsty monster and a biting dialogue. At one point <br /> <br />, the team comes across a couple of hottie witches who bring them <br /> <br /> to the chupacabra's nest ... for $ 100. If only the FBI knew as <br /> <br/> economically the Tex-Mex witches could be bought as informers. Entire <br /> <br /> decades of mythical beast reports could be clarified with a blank check <br /> <br />. Eventually, after the death of bleeding characters who do not give a patoot to a <br /> goat, a chupacabra is captured, killed, and <br /> <br /> subjected to autopsy. The only point of the autopsy scene is to highlight the efforts of the makeup department in such an inexpensive film. <br /> <br /> The film is shot on video, just like "BWP", yet the characters of the cameraman <br /> <br /> never recharge their tapes or recharge their batteries <br /> < br />. The leading actress here is horrible. The beauty of the "BWP" media was its use of improvisation during production. <br /> <br /> Here, all lines are written and delivered as a villain> <br /> try the Christmas procession. <br /> <br /> Even the film is tinged with racism. The only African-American <br /> <br /> here is a machine gun. At one point, as the crew breaks into an abandoned house, they find a trio of illegal immigrants who comically ask them if they belong to the INS. Chortle, chortle. <br /> <br /> The monster itself is a boy with a rubber suit and nothing else. For <br /> <br /> an awkward and awkward beast, he is able to bypass the cast rather silently, whether they are idiotically stuck <br /> in a giant cage like bait, or can't get their only <br /> <br /> vehicle. <br /> <br /> The blood is macabre, but when surrounded by this kind of <br /> stupidity, it loses all its effectiveness. I don't know if this was <br /> shot before or after "BWP", but I can honestly say that this is the worst movie ever made in southern Texas on a mythical beast. Pray <br /> <br /> there are no sequels, I will start a letter writing campaign for <br /> <br /> Troma. <br /> <br /> This is assessed (R) for strong physical violence, armed violence, strong turmoil and swear words. <br /> <br />
