Like anyone else who bought this, I was tricked by the "20 pieces of extreme gore" and "banned in 20 countries" or by anything they say in the box. I have to admit that I'm a huge gore fan and I'm always amazed when movies can often make it look and seem convincing. Tom Savini, Rick Baker and Greg Cannom are among the best in the industry. The effects of make-up revolutionized in the 80s. Today you don't need it because everything is done on the computer. But computers can't compare to the visual magic that these three men could conjure up. But I digress. <br /> <br /> Watching incredibly bloody movies like Fulci's Gates to Hell or even Savini's success, on Friday 13th final chapter, you can appreciate everything you need to make a terribly bloody movie. The difference between reality and magic cannot be understood. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine another reason why someone would see Cannibal Ferox but the blood that is apparently all-powerful in this movie. If this is why you are looking for this movie, then you are wasting your money. As many other reviewers have noted here, most of the blood is a consequence. You don't see the torture, or the bloodshed that happens, you see anything that looks like the words after. <br /> <br /> The blood? Well, it's here, but not as much as one could hope for, or expect. A man is castrated and a woman is hanged from her breast, but others then those two scenes and one that involves scalping; there's really not much else in this film. The gore scenes also in these three mentioned, are still rather tamed compared to what you were hoping for. Maybe it's just me and my sick and distorted experience in the horror and gore genre, but I was expecting a little more. Call me sick or twisted, but isn't that the only reason people watch this movie in the first place? Honestly I found myself bored in many places. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Ferox is just another film that seeks to capitalize on the craze of a superior film. While Cannibal Holocaust is not exactly a great movie, it is much better than this tripe. If you go out of your way to buy it for $ 20.00, you will feel cheated. <br /> <br /> 3/10
