I'm a lover of bad movies. I own "R.O.T.O.R." and "Boa vs. Python" and I'm working to build my collection with titles like "Troll 2" and "What's up Superdoc?" But "Storm Trooper" isn't bad enough to get to the list of wonderfully terrible movies. It's just lame. The guy who said he has a better dialogue with his potted plants is right. Everything about this movie is stupid. When the robot enters the machine it almost seems that he knew it would explode, there was no reason why he would ever run in that direction. "Judge, jury and executioner", "The perfect cop ... but they went too far", I mean, come on, why do people care about making these films? ROTOR. makes it because it's hysterically awful, but Storm Trooper is just a waste of cinema because it's not bad enough to be so bad that it's worth watching. This belongs to someone's home movie collection, something they can be proud of, but that's all. I was excluded from an HBO channel (with only 1 star, which is why I saw it) because it didn't belong to this. Even if you love bad movies, don't watch this movie. It's shameful.
