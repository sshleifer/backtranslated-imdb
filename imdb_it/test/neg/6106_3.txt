My mother told me not to go see "Kadosh" - but who ever listens to her mother? <br /> <br /> I was so upset by this as I was watching that I thought I had lost my feminist credentials on the road to theater, so I checked the feminists who brought the papers the next day. No, they also thought it was much more of an anti-Orthodox testament than a feminist declaration, portraying the Orthodox as being equal to the Taliban. <br /> <br /> While this Israeli film is careful to show that the cult story is about the last ultra-Orthodox messianists, it is so terrible that it is unbelievable (more than the non-fanatic rock-'n'-roller orthodox (!) of which one of the sisters is in love is incredibly sexy - even in Israel it must be fantastic). <br /> <br /> The theater was quite crowded, so there is a repressed curiosity in Israeli films; pity that this vicious film is the one that gets a wide distribution. That was enough to bring me back to a tasteless Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 4/29/2000)
