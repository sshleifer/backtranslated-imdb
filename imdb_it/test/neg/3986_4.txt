Poor Shirley MacLaine struggles to give a little relief to this sloppy, gag-like film, but is trampled by the racing sentimentality of a film that is not in the least rooted in reality. <br /> <br /> This was directed by Curtis Hanson? Had he had a lobotomy since we last heard him? Hanson can make an effective drama sprinkled with comedy, as evidenced by "Wonder Boys". So I don't know what happened to him here. This is the kind of film that does not want to accept that life is messy and fussy, and that neat and clean endings (however implausible they may be) could be a nice final blow, but appear completely false if people watch film went through anything remotely similar to what the characters in the film go through. <br /> <br /> My wife and I made a game to recall the plot points before they happened - eg. "the old man will teach her to read and then die." Bingo! This is one of those films in which the characters give small speeches that summarize their emotional problems, making you wonder why they still have emotional problems if they are aware of what is causing them. Toni Collette (a good actress, by the way, and one of my favorites if she didn't give much work here), makes a speech about why you buy so many shoes and never wears them, explaining in flashing neon the connection uncomfortable of the film. At that moment, I knew what was waiting for me, and the film was a downward spiral from there. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
