The film is visually stunning: from the dusty interior of the church with the stove on, through the rainy street and the dilapidated garage until the fire that is the climax of the film. It also has a wonderful sense of time, both in the 1950s (the opening of the film) and in the 1960s. All the performances are of the highest level, in particular Mathew MacFadyen as the psychotic preacher and Gerard McSorley as the father who finds his intolerance magnificently magnified by his son. What a shame, therefore, that the story is so ridiculous. To begin with, focusing on the relationship between Gabriel (McFadyen) and his family, he absolutely cannot show how he managed to have so much influence on the community. In the church, we see five or six of the main characters in the front, and two or three in the back, but the rest of the congregation could also be mannequins: they show no sign of listening to him, listening to him or dissenting from him; in cockfighting, nobody says yes or no when he interrupts the procedure, but nobody applauds him or condemns him when Caroline throws him a pint; a situation that results in a stone thrown through the window of the pub is mysteriously resolved by the onset of labor pains. Secondly, Middletown (which in reality is not a city, but a small village) seems to lack some essential services, such as police and firefighters: the murder can only be dealt with by a family member with a crowbar ; the residents look at a hell that threatens to swallow the entire city as if they were in the cinema. Moreover, everyday things like telephones and newspapers are absent, the rural community is strangely devoid of farm animals or wheat fields, and the strangest thing of all for a typical Northern Irish setting, there is only one community Christian - Not even a couple of Anglicans to dress the mix. Even if you are willing to suspend disbelief, the story itself is rather worn, a pale imitation of an A.J. Cronin melodrama. And the music? Well, it's nice for the first two minutes, but when the same four chords are repeated continuously for 90 minutes, it becomes more than irritating. My advice: look at this with the sound turned off.
