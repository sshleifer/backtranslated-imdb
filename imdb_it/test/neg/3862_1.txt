Imagine Diane by Cheers, the self-centered intellectualist character, now imagine that she is trying to make a film at the cinema. This would be. If you only look at some of the shots without sound, you would think of Hmmm ... this could be a good movie. <br /> <br /> Now, if you turn on the sound and listen at any time, you quickly realize that the person who made the film knows nothing about movies other than what they read in a book. I used to think that this thing was a foreign film, it was so bad. <br /> <br /> If you don't remember Cheers, then think of Mr. Beans Holiday ... remember the DeFoe character who made the horrible film ... well, imagine that horrible film without Mr. Bean saving it. This is what this film is. I'm not saying anything about what the film is different from what is an attempt to make a dark moody movie about a successful man who comes home .... at least that's all I could get from it.
