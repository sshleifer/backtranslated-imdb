too predictable for spoilers, but I won't be cautious below, so don't read it if you're interested. <br /> <br /> some boring scriptwriters together for mid-afternoon, and even then I'm out of ideas. so let's start with a wanted criminal from all over France ... no matter what he did, we'll think about it later (they don't). a few seconds of suspense, but not too much, nothing unexpected, because this requires Art. half an hour to finish the film; I understand: have them stolen by a jeweler and take a long time to avoid alarms, etc .; everyone robs jewelers in movies just for that, it's meant to work (doesn't). no humor, no character (ok, yves montand kills him a little) and everyone speaks in a quiet and impassive voice that should make one think of noir, but simply makes actors seem depressed. if they are silent, it will make them look uglier - but they also save us by writing their lines. we'd better add something to stay at the home of the women who will watch these things, so let's do something to make them empathize with my husband (we forgot to put all the women in the film). understood: a son on (gasp) marijuana - oh, and make him try to commit suicide for no particular reason (shame? His father is a mafia boss to cry loudly, but the public will hear his paternal care, and if not, he will devour them ). oh, the crooked policeman was a classmate of the boy who finally gets him; heartbreaking, eh? we all die in the end, or we'll never finish this stuff. is it in the jar? right, it's over with then, thank god. Who will we have for the director?
