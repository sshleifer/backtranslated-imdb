Artist Daniel King (Chris John) and his partner Laura Peters (Lara Clancy) are invited to move to an old house in Cornwall, Great Britain, by his rich childhood friend Natasha Carlton (Carol Kentish). Natasha has a crush on Daniel, who is an ambiguous man about his love life. While alone at home, strange things happen and Laura is scared and scared. When Laura meets the old crazy priest Gabriel Norton (Brian Blessed) on the road, she is advised to leave the house immediately, since the evil lived there. But the couple remains and must face tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> What a messy script and horrible and poor movie this "Devil's Harvest" is! Cinematography and camera work are not entirely negative, but Chris John and Carol Kentish's amateur performances and James Shanks directing, along with the terrible story, ridiculous situations and dialogues make this film one of the worst I've ever seen in the genre. From time to time I saw a couple of college film shorts on YouTube that are better and better than the useless and terrible "Devil's Harvest". In the end, it's not a horror movie but a horror movie. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Colheita do Diabo" ("The Devil's Harvest")
