No one expects Star Trek movies to be high art, but fans expect a movie to be as good as some of the best episodes. Unfortunately, this film has had a confusing and implausible plot that has let me collapse - this is by far the worst of the nine (so far) films. Even the chance to see the famous characters interact in another film cannot save this film - including the full scenes of Kirk, Spock and McCoy in Yosemite. <br /> <br /> I would say that this film is not worth a rent film, and it's hardly worth looking at, however for the real fan who needs to see all the movies, renting this movie is the only way you will see - even the cable channels avoid this movie.
