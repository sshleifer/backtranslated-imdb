I hate to admit it, but they were right to fire Schrader. The opportunity is here to build an atmosphere, to attract an audience in a film. It was not done. The characters are weak. The story was weak. The direction was very poor. Schrader was out of his depth and show. I have looked at it several times now in the hope that there is at least one saving characteristic. But no, nothing. The next step will probably be a remake of the original or, hopefully, will be left very well. Anyone wishing to know the best sequel to The Exorcist should read "Legion", written by Blatty, must be the best sequel to an original piece to print. Unfortunately, it didn't translate very well on the screen and I doubt it could ever be. As for Dominion, Beginning. Avoid at all costs.
