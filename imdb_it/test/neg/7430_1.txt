I really wanted to like this movie. The second film in the series sounded silly and funny, of course (I was also drunk). I watched this movie with the highest expectation of a similar experience of cinematic hilarity, a-la-Mystery Science Theater 3000. THEY WERE WRONG !!!!! This film is a terrible waste of movies, and I like the latter !!!! From the wicked effeminate with David Bowie's wig, to the nasty, hateful female criminals with laughter who could remove the paint from the garage door, this whole thing was just a painful mess. Actually I felt bad for Sue Price, because the material was under an actress of her size (which basically says it all). A horrible and terrible film (not a recommendation).
