With such a promising cast and a director I heard a lot about, I was deeply disappointed with this film. It started with the signs of a great epic gangster tale and turned into a completely confused mess with many unanswered questions and some completely ridiculous and unnecessary scenes (and yes, I looked at the full version). I adore Robert DeNiro and as usual he did a great job of acting, but in all his other gangster movies, no matter how many people he kills, I always had respect for his character, but in this film he was an evil drug addict, rapist without caring for anyone but himself. Also, James Woods, another good actor, has made some completely ridiculous scenes for him. I thought the parts where Robert DeNiro called him crazy and that came out of the field completely left and towards the end the writers threw this casual comment about how his father died in a crazy house and that's why James Woods not like being called crazy. So much has been left undeveloped in this film. Also, we never find out who the men in the beginning are trying to kill Noodles and we'll never find out more about the character of Joe Pesci. It seems that the writers have brought together about five different stories and have never fully explained any of them. The only redeeming quality of the film was the story in which the characters were young. The story flowed smoothly in this part of the film and the boys did a great job of acting. Overall, I was deeply disappointed with this film and I don't see how anyone can compare it to Godfather 1 and 2, or even good guys. I'm sad that I wasted four hours of my life watching this movie
