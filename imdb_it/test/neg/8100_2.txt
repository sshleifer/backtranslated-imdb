Bela Lugosi is a true enigma. In the early 1930s, he was on top of the world after appearing in Dracula. Yet, again and again, he made very bad decisions about his career. Maybe he had a bad agent, maybe his consumption of alcohol and drugs played a role in it or maybe he was just crazy. Regardless, he ruined his reputation by appearing in almost every movie, from excellent horror films (like THE RAVEN) to big-budget movies (like NINOTCHKA) to Z-quality movies for less expensive and shoddy studios. Interestingly enough, although he agreed to make this terrible film, he actually rejected the role that later went to Boris Karloff in FRANKENSTEIN! As for this film, it is a very rude second world war propaganda film that presented a stupid plot and a miserable montage. Lugosi spends most of the film killing the saboteurs - it's not a bad thing at all. But in the end, we find out that he himself is a Nazi plastic surgeon and that all the American-looking men he killed were actually Japanese !!!! The most fun part of this is during a flashback. You see Lugosi talking to a group of Japanese men before he changes them to men like the Americans. When the camera scans them, men are clearly Asian. But, on all the other non-close shots, they are all VERY Western - many with bald heads !! They looked absolutely NOTHING like Japanese men. I suspect that the plot must have been rewritten and this could explain the obvious error. Or, they could only be poor production and modification values. In fact, at the beginning of the film, they show a street scene in the city and all the machines (around 1942) are old Model T Fords - obviously from archive material !!! The bottom line is that the film is bad, but also very boring. Unlike PLAN 9 FROM THE EXTERIOR SPACE, it is difficult to laugh at ineptitude - just fall asleep.
