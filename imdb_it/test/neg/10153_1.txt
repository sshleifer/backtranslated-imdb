I took it on a double DVD called "Scream Theater" and it is without doubt one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. And I've seen some really bad ones. The school is over, and three girls (who would eat the hat if they were teenagers) are talking about "non-stop party", so obviously they all go to the house of the girl whose parents are the strictest for a slumber party. , a psychotic has escaped from the house of local insects where a girl's father works and is at liberty with sharp objects and wearing a green coat, and with his eyes wide open ... I imagine this shows that he is a fanatic. Of course, since he has a bone to choose from with that particular doctor, he goes to his home, whose place is apparently of common knowledge. Meanwhile, some types of stupid athletes are beating down beers and out to scare the girls, and of course the fool also shows up and starts cutting his throat. And that's all, while heavy metal music shines in the background. Or maybe it's not, but in reality it's all you need to know. Unless you spend your time getting drunk or perpetually, here you will find little interest, and even if you are lost most of the time, you will probably find your insulted intelligence. 1 in 10.
