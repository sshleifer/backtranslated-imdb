I bought the video for Â£ 13 at HMV (we pay more in the UK) as a friend told me it was very appreciated and the reviews on this site were generally impressive. <br /> <br /> I must say that the opening credits were a disappointment ... not very powerful dance / music. <br /> <br /> The car ride and the unexpected accident just as the lady's passenger was going to be damaged was a nice touch, .. something unexpected ... even if the way she walked away from the car with perfectly manicured hair and still with a purse it seemed a little trivial to most administrators ... but for Lynch there was something else. <br /> <br /> His daze that walked after such the shock was accentuated by a regular regular noise similar to the fingers scraping along a blackboard; I thought another Lynch master could touch the portraits of the demons huddling in his shocked and traumatized self-consciousness. After a while this noise became a bit annoying and after further investigation I discovered that the new videotape squeaked. <br /> <br /> I don't know if this squeak took away much of my fun but this film has become a waste of time. (and money) <br /> <br /> The two female characters had a certain presence and the lesbian scenes were quite right, even if predictable. There were no male characters of any value and, apart from some vaguely good scenes (lighting and ignition control), there were too many terrible scenes that were simply weak and ridiculous. For example, coffee is spat into the napkin from the threatening lunatic and the stupid monster face at the back of the diner. Oh and what about the paint in his wife's jewels ... just enough. <br /> <br /> This whole movie gives you the feeling of failed genius ... you know when you listen to Dylan's worst song ever and think my God that it was embarrassing .... was it really Bob? <br /> <br /> The whole feeling is that of a failed TV movie, put together badly with a few (not many) extra bits to give it a 15 rating. <br /> <br /> I hissed it during the last 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> I give him another chance and look again. If I want to be baffled and work hard to understand a film, I will look at the Frank Woods Guide to Consolidated Accounting. <br /> <br /> Lynch made a classic .. Blue Velvet and Straight Story was beautiful. <br /> <This, like Wild at Heart, was a disappointment; its strangeness is now predictable and stale. Does anyone want to buy a second-hand video? <br /> <br /> Give way to some original young talent, David. <br /> <br /> Four out of ten (and no more). Sorry.
