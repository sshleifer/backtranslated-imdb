If you have trouble sleeping or you just want to take a nap in the afternoon, but you can't break away, get into this movie. The only nice thing about this movie is the electric planes. Apart from that, prepare yourself for some sweet zzzzz. It makes the mind go crazy about how big movie stars like those in this movie can be part of one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll finish my nap.
