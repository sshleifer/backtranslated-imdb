There are places for political comments in the film, but "Masters of Horror" is not one of them. I've had enough of this stuff from Newsweek and every other editorial in the newspaper. Now do I have to watch it in horror movies? Come on, come on! All I wanted was a good movie about zombie schlock, not another "Bush is bad!" rant. If Joe Dante wants to express his policy, let him go to Air America. And if you have to insist on making a "message" movie, be a little smarter. This had all the insinuations of being slapped in the face with a dead fish. <br /> <br /> By the way, Joe, do you really want the left-wing voting block to be associated with brain zombies? It may take us to think before making another political horror film (God help us).
