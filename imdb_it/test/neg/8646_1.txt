I saw this movie on the Blockbuster shelf and thought it was nice. The DVD case has touted so many great actors and I asked myself: "Why have I never heard of this movie?" Then I turned the case over and saw the director, Lee Tamahori, and then the answer began to unfold. <br /> <br /> First of all I want to defeat the idea that a great cast is the same as a great film, but above all, I think I should explain why this film is so terrible. Okay, the script is horrible and full of one-dimensional characters. This is the worst role I've ever seen playing Chazz Palminteri and I'm surprised he'd do something ridiculous. However, the undervalued but talented actors must earn their money. Palminteri plays a one-dimensional police detective who looks as stupid as a C-movie henchman. He, along with the main detective (the little direct Nolte), the great but simple Michael Madsen, and the late Chris Penn (whose role along with Madsen was completely thrown away) constitute an elite team of Los Angeles investigators in charge to free the city of mafiosi in the late 1930s and 40s. The film introduces this team as policemen who break every law to make sure that those who think they are above the law do not operate in their city. At the beginning of the film, the policemen rotate a local restaurant, capture an alleged mobster (William Peterson) and take him to a place they call Mulholland Falls. They knock him off one of the cliffs on Mullholland Drive and this should show how serious these guys are to rid the city of crime. Everything. This was nothing but a cheap excuse to use a lousy title designed to make you think of Los Angeles and its famous sites. Somewhere on, they find the body of Jennifer Connelly and the plot begins. <br /> <br /> Towards the direction that was nothing short of amateur and WEAK! Regardless of whether the characters were of B-movie quality, the exaggerated from those like Treat Williams, the guy who plays the police chief, and the horrible Daniel Baldwin are just a few highlights that made this movie look like if it was Lee Tamhori's first film. There is not a good performance in the film except perhaps Melanie Griffith, which some might argue was the worst in the film (she won a Razzie for this film). In the end, it was his character that wasn't so great and he didn't have much to work with. <br /> <br /> As in every bad movie, everything starts with writing, and this script was not a jewel. The plot is formulated simply on the basis of the creation of the next scene and never takes into consideration the motivations of the characters. The way the characters behaved was incredible. The cops who take the law in their hands are credible under the right circumstances (see THE CONFIDENTIALITY), but in this case it seems that these guys can get away with anything, including murder, and they never have to worry about cleaning anything. I imagine that we as spectators should assume that no one has seen anything and that people will not ask questions. Everything about the story is predictable and is fed a teaspoon so well that we understand everything that will happen long before the characters do it. However, it doesn't make us feel smart, but rather it makes us angry about how stupid the hero is, despite the fact that there are no heroes in this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, the best part of the film was the soundtrack by David Grusin. From the beginning, he invoked a theme from CHINATOWN, which quickly faded when I realized how incredible everything was in the film. I was not surprised to learn that he made a huge eleven thousand at the box office. What I'm going to say is that it's worth watching this movie for a few laughs. Nick Nolte's acting is like a junkyard dog unsuccessfully domesticated and I laughed every time he tried to be serious. I also almost fell to the ground at each of the slow motion shots used in the movie (I think there are three with one during a key fight scene). When you have to use slow movement in the heat of a dramatic moment, you clearly have problems. So, even with my negative criticisms, I will recommend this film solely for the purpose of seducing laughter, that is, if you will appreciate good films like LA RISERVATISSIMO.
