Even Mel Gibson failed to save this movie slop. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why would Mel Gibson make a movie that I'm sure I can't sit and watch? what was this? A total billiard ball on some hard drugs that haunt a schizophrenic lady, who was also a street dope. For all the spectators out there with hard drugs; you will love this movie.
