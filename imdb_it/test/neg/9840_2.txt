"Nicodemus" is almost a copy of "Red" in the strange sense of behavior, but this episode focuses on other people in the unpredictable life of Clark Kent. When a poisonous flower finds its way into Smallville, Jonathan Kent is the first to be affected. the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it affects Jonathan, it becomes irascible and violent, yet Clark manages to stop him from doing something rash until his father faints. all right. So far, so good. the next is Lana. the episode was good until then, because the flower causes her to try to seduce Clark. at the last moment, he refuses it but the damage has already been done. this episode causes wrong impressions and is not suitable for people under the age of twenty, due to its adult content. the first part was good, the last part (focusing on the effect the flower has on Pete) was good, but the central part of the whole personality of Lana was not the most provocative, and this ruined that that could have been a brilliant episode. I give this episode two.
