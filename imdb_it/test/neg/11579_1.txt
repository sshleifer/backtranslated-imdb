**** SPOILER ALERT **** My boyfriend, some friends, and I rented this film as part of a marathon of really bad movies. We knew somehow what we were going to. But the lack of plot, direction and special effects actually left us hoping for a fantastic (or passable) fight scene between the two main characters ... the poorly rendered swimming cobra and the super violent giant komodo (who ate people as scooping ice cream) ... in the end we get there, but we had to be cut due to possible budget or time limits? Its only redeeming quality is that it is ridiculously bad, with many salient details highlighted by other readers. I recommend this movie if you want to cut onions to make you cry.
