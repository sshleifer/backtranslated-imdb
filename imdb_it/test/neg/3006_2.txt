If this film was right, I never found out. A very depressing film that is supposed to be for the final evacuation of residents living in an area of ​​a dam site on the Northfork River in Montana. The problem is that there is no real Northfork river in Montana. There are several forks in the north but they are branches of other rivers that are divided into north and south forks. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of the film is a coffin floating on the surface of the lake but the scene is never tied in history and the viewer is left to speculate on its meaning. But much is left to the spectator's speculation in the film. Another example is when a group of employees of the dam responsible for evacuating the residents arrives at the dam's central, another group of people is leaving. Some observations that are almost imperceptible are made about these people which makes no sense and there is no following in the film to explain it. <br /> <br /> The film is slaughtered in several stories and the film continues to go back and between stories that are quite disconcerting. And the stories are strange. In one of them the occupants of a property refuse to be evacuated because they live in a house built like Noah's Ark. <br /> <br /> Another meaningless story focuses on a sick orphan who is dying and somehow is sharing his presence with a house full of ghosts and an orphanage with a priest at the same time. If anyone can understand what the ghost story was, the author must have explained it to them. <br /> <br /> The scenery was desolate and the sun never shone. There are snow-capped mountains in the distance. I guess the purpose was to set the mood. The time period is determined by the fact that all the evacuators drove the 1946-48 Ford sedans, although the events would have occurred in 1955. The acting was mediocre. When I saw the billing for this movie, I said that Darryl Hannah was in the picture. If she were, I didn't recognize her, but I suppose she was the ghost lady.
