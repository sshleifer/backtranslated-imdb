I liked Mr. Magoo's cartoons that I saw while growing up. And I like the comic skills of Leslie Nielson. So, I thought, this marriage must produce a funny child. <br /> <br /> I could not have been more wrong. <br /> <br /> This film was simply horrible. I don't remember a single funny moment. This is one of two or three times (in hundreds of films over the years), I wanted my money back. You will leave this film disconsolate because you will never have that time again to use it in a better way. In a comedy, the plot must attract the viewer and act as a frame for the gags. This plot does not do or is just lying there, panting like a beached fish.
