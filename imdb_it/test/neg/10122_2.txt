This is probably the worst of Ava Gardner's main films. Yes, she's beautiful. But this can go lean over time, especially after the film ends unbearably and predictably. <br /> <br /> In this turkey, Robert Walker must pretend to be Eddie Bracken (which surely embarrassed him). Olga San Juan plays the part of Jane Powell (golly, gee). Dick Haymes plays a kind of dark companion (!), Ed Eve Arden plays Helen Broderick (and a host of other popping female semi-comedians). Yes, the film contains an important popular song, "Speak Low". But take a look at the other pieces, completely forgettable. Dick Haymes sings very well, of course, as does the uncredited singer Ava dubbing. <br /> <br /> The sets are cheap, the script is full of clich√©s and failed humor, and Tom Conway looks as if he had fought with liquor (as indeed he was). In short, if you want to see Ava in the midst of his life, buy a photo and stay away from this movie.
