I lived next door to the author in 1980 when he moved to Portland from Downer's Grove, Ill. With two of his high school twins. He seemed a fairly normal boy, although he had many artistic pretensions. Within a few years, he jumped into the Portland post-punk music scene with his friend Phil and a few others, and a band that he definitely didn't direct anywhere, even though it cost him a lot of action, including an adventure with Courtney Love in her Portland groupie days. He seemed to think that his musical perspectives were good enough to move to San Francisco, then to N.Y.C. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to learn that he got a publishing contract in '95 after the band crashed and burned. Courtney Love's name seemed to be the forerunner. I have no idea how the film was born, especially with this cast, but I doubt that Gus Van Sant is involved. However, reviewers here seem to be unsure whether the lack of narrative focus is intentional or not, so I would just like to say that this is the work of a smart enough guy who wants to be a writer, or an artist or something, but it doesn't. I have something to say. Like Kerouac without Benzedrine.
