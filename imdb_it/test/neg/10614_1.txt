I love these terrible movies from the 80s summer camp. The best part of "Party Camp" is the fact that it has literally no storyline. It simply drops a weak group of "characters" into a position and then things happen occasionally. The clichés here are unlimited (SPOILERS): the nerds against athletes, the secret camera in the girls' locker room, the hikers who come across a nudist colony, the contest at the conclusion, the camp administrators secretly horny and the embarrassing madness sexual insinuation spread all over. The only missing cliché is the presence of Corey Feldman. This movie will make you laugh, but never intentionally. I repeat, NEVER. A final note, get ready to tear a gut into pieces by looking at the nonsense that is the "dramatic" scene in which Jerry Riviera and D.A. share a beer late at night, overturning each other. Dialogue does not literally make sense, and acting belongs to a high school stage. It's a classic.
