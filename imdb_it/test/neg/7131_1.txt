That was a waste of $ 9. the film was terrible. all the "scary" parts were useless and sadly repetitive. Apparently all parts of the time could be fully anticipated, and it does not seem to hold the audience's attention. Furthermore, the plot did not progress at all during the whole film, and it was all a great setup for the rancor 3. When it seemed that the movie was going to make a great plot advancement, it turned out to be just a useless scene. these directors must follow the example of Hitchcock: every scene has a point. Porbably 90% of the scenes in this film could have been omitted without any change in the plot. Final opinion: don't waste time, energy or money !!!
