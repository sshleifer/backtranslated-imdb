I'm not sure if this review contains spoilers, but I'm playing it safe indicating that it could be there. Regardless, it is unlikely that anyone will watch this film that is not familiar with the book. <br /> <br /> There is an old joke about working powerfully and pulling out a mouse. "Comanche Moon" is a mouse like that. <br /> <br /> The novel focuses more on Indians than on Americans. Adapting it to TV, McMurtry and Osanna rightly thought that the public would be more interested in whites than in reds. Unfortunately, in the novel there is little we don't already know about Gus, Woodrow and their friends. So the film offers us above all a prehistoric bearing of what will happen in "Lonesome Dove". The Indians - who have their own story to tell - are largely relegated to the background - so much so that someone who hasn't read the novel will rightly wonder why it's called "Comanche Moon". <br /> <br /> The novel does not have a general plot, or much of a "point". This could have been solved in the film, attracting more the contrast between the Indians who lose their lands and their lifestyle for the invading Americans, who bring "civilization". This opportunity has been lost. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Lonesome Dove", "Comanche Moon" has few extended scenes that develop character or relationships - at least among Americans. The large scenes with the Indians have been largely removed or shortened. And for a four-hour film (net), it is extraordinarily episodic and moved. One has the feeling that the script was originally longer and cut to reduce production costs. <br /> <br /> The screenplay mainly includes cliché dialogues, aphorisms and clichés. Coming from the author of "The Last Picture Show", it is a surprisingly bad script. McMurtry and Osanna had the opportunity to solve problems with history and characterizations, but they did not. <br /> <br /> Some of the best dialogues of the novel are missing or altered, for no obvious reason. For example, Clara (Cassie) shows her intense hatred for Woodrow (Jack) by condemning Gus (Ennis) for always running away to be with his "pard". This little jealous revelation of Clara's sexual jealousy is gone. Then there is the scene where the barking Woodrow warns Maggie not to let Jake Spoon "compromise" her. The exchange in the novel is shorter and harder; the film attenuates it, and does not interpret Woodrow as the socially stupid and emotionally frozen stone it is. (When I read that scene in the novel, I wanted to punch Woodrow in the stomach - or worse.) There are other changes, some of them understandable. Inish Scull's eyelids are not cut; doing so would have required expensive CGI. But Buffalo Hump doesn't have a hump! (Perhaps it was not reasonable to ask Wes Studi to go around such a large prosthesis.) And the character of Buffalo Hump is "kinder and kinder." It is never so grotesquely violent as in novels. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this neighbor-turkey is the extraordinary performance of Steve Zahn - not so much like Gus McCrae, but like Robert Duvall playing Gus McCrae. It's disturbing. It perfectly duplicates Duvall's mannerisms and manner of speaking, without ever appearing "intentional" or self-conscious. Like Duvall, he is totally "inside" the character. And it actually shows us Gus who becomes "more Gus" in the third part. <br /> <br /> The best thing about "Comanche Moon" is that it won't spoil our love for "Lonesome Dove", not just a great western, but a great American film. <br /> <br /> PS: for those who think Rachel Griffiths was exaggerated - that's how it was in the book.
