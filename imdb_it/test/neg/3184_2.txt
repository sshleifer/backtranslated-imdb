"It should have good reviews," says the g / f. If so, I can't find them. She falls asleep and I continue to endure. Michael Douglas is a good old boy - now there is a new one. Matt Dillon all fell apart. John Goodman is losing his temper. Paul Reiser running around in BDSM leather. Oh it's a riot all right. <br /> <br /> The hitch is that you're probably going to lose interest very soon. Liv Tyler plays the femme fatale and critics complain that she may not have the register for her part. But it is irrelevant: this film is not about character development. In fact, I would go so far as to say that there is no character at all. What you should appreciate here is the plot. <br /> <br /> No one is "bad" in this movie. Some people wonder why all these "stars" - Reba is even in here for charity - enrolling in such a mangy project. Chances are you think it would be fun. Maybe they had fun. Who knows? Hey, maybe they were well paid. <br /> <br /> But you have to pay the money in one way or another to see this turkey. And it's probably not a good idea.
