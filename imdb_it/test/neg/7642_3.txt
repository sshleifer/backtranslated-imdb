I am surprised by the number of people who rated this item as their favorite "Chan" (have they never seen "... at the Opera" or "... Treasure Island?" --- the second ironically written by John Larkin, who dropped the ball here). This plot is a train disaster and overloaded with useless characters. First, viewers are obliged to remember the sordid details of Steve McBirney (played by the venerable HUAC thug and harrowman Marc Lawrence), the 1929 murder. Let's not forget that he escaped a rap of a capital murder at court with a lone cop on the queue. There is also a victim who was caught by a river 11 years before which no one ever seems worried. Then there is the suspension of the disbelief required when all the characters are apparently trapped in the wax museum (although Inspector O'Matthews manages to wield his rear fat wet inside through a window). Why is Joan Valerie (as Cream's assistant) in this movie? He can't even handle the pliers well --- I realize that Chan suffers the same boo-boo but yeesh, he's 66 here - (and has less than 10 bars --- and his character's motivation is too weak to be never adequately splained (sorry, when I'm on a rant I write as Ricky Ricardo). The character of Mary Bolton (Marguerite Chapman) is written as a moron with eyes wide open, apparently existing only for the horny vapid interest of the lawyer Tom Agnew (played by Ted Osborne with the face of a ferret) Why is Willie Fern a character? Why McBirney's henchman didn't pull the switch at 8:20 am (not a spoiler, ok?!) Lint's IQ who manages to dress alone or because he has never been in front of a bus years ago, Toler himself is given a little more string than usual (a plus) and the real compliments go to production designer Thomas Little and the director of photography Virgil Miller who created an atmosphere It's really spooky ... but this voice has less logic than a Ritz Brothers movie. until it's like using a toothpick like a blow gun.
