If you plan to schedule your film festival program, don't be fooled by what it says in the booklet. This is a complete waste of time and energy. I saw Bunuel, saw Dali and admired them; but this is not surrealism, this should not be at all. Have they never thought about the reputation of the human race while taking this picture? After we have died out of global warming, these will be the remains of our civilization. What happens if the aliens consider it an example of our intellectual capital? With all due respect for the effort put into this, perhaps it would be a good idea to finish all copies of this film - or whatever it is.
