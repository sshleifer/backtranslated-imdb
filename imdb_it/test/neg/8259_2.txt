What a great cast and what a pathetic attempt to make a film. The script is full of holes from beginning to end. Inconsistent, not cohesive ... absolutely ridiculous. One of the most talented / beautiful actresses in the world (and I'm talking about Nastassja Kinski) is without a single memorable line here. Worse still, presumably he dyes his hair halfway through the film, but it's obvious that he only wears a cheap black wig purchased from a drag queen costume designer. The best moments are given to a leading actor and his dog in the condominium where the actor Peter Coyote lives. Fairuza Balk is poorly photographed, to boot. It resembles an overweight freshman who is expelled in too many canteen-table lunches for students. I couldn't wait to see this movie. I wanted to like it, but I think I'd rather watch Nastassja read the agenda, with her OWN hair.
