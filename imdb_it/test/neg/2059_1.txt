This film is a disaster from beginning to end. 75% of the film is composed of scenes from HERCULES & THE HAUNTED WORLD and HERCULES & THE CAPTIVE WOMEN, badly edited together with original scenes that add nothing but a complete rip-off. I'm a big fan of those two films and seeing scenes taken from them, reworked and re-dubbed with meaningless dialogues made my head spin. This kind of economic producer tactics to make more money by tricking the unsuspecting public has practically killed the Sword & Sandal genre in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> There is a memorable scene in the new movie and it is the one in which Hercules fights with the bad Ercole. The fight is still fresh and Giovanni Cianfriglia, who plays Antaius, definitely stands out. He makes a memorable nemesis for Herc. But the rest is embarrassing to the limit that it was probably shot in a day. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs!
