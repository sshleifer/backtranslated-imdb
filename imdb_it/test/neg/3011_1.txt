The keys to the VIP are just another horrible T.V. show that you can see and see on this station. The show is terrible with the guys who claim to be real players competing against each other (there are two of them in each episode) in stupid games in which they try to convince the girls in a bar to talk to them , to get girls numbers and so on. The judges are four other boys who claim to be expert artists in withdrawing but they also seem to be huge d-bags just like the competitors. The show is not at all funny and not even interesting, it's just boring to watch these guys try desperately to convince us that fantastic players are (still talking more than the four judges compared to the competitors). Nothing funny has ever happened in the shows I saw and the shows are obviously rigged. Do you really think you invited all these people to the club, signed them and recorded them while these guys carried on the same stupid games with them? It's not reality at all, it's just stupid, probably even tapes in the day. Someone else here wrote how they met someone on the show and it was all fake, yes, of course, it's a fake show and even with the actors it's still not fun. One of the worst shows I've ever seen.
