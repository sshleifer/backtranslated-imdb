First there are some holes in the plot of this movie. We see at the beginning that a child dies from the game. But who was tied up in the mail truck to deliver the package containing the game? How did the driver arrange the package in the mailbox when it was anchored to the steering wheel? It is not as if he were the fantastic Mr. Wow what in just 15 minutes ... The actors are second level, take the "Bad Guy" starring Patrick Kilpatrick (who?) Exactly he appeared in an episode of everything on TV and some secondary roles in poor films (like this). So most of the acting is like a TV drama, I can live with it, but the graphics or special effects are horrible. The disembodied voice "Game" sounds like a poor Hal clone of "Space Oddessy 2000". What they called Zombi looked more like shadows that moved like monkeys from the "Planet of the Apes". The aliens had transparent bodies like shadow zombies. In most cases, the film was predictable as it had no hidden hook or agenda. History was a good idea, but like most of the good ideas discussed during lunch, it was never developed beyond that good idea phase.
