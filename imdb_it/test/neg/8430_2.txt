I remember seeing this mini series for the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation. After reading the comments on this title, I must agree with those of the Greek people. This was produced to coincide with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and, to me, it seemed nothing more than an exercise in American chauvinist and flag-waving nationalism in which American athletes are glorified at the expense of everyone else. Other nationalities would have every right to feel profoundly insulted in the way they were portrayed in this series. It could, however, help explain the way many American viewers have behaved at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and the television coverage that seemed interested only in the events that the Americans would probably have won.
