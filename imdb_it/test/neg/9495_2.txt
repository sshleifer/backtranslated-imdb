I really don't know much about the Marquis de Sade, not having read any of his books, but I never imagined him as a fiery queen. Carson Kressley of Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, or Jack of Will and Grace would have easily adapted to the role that Nick Mancuso gave us. <br /> <br /> The film itself was rather thin and seemed more like a parody - or an excuse to repeatedly show men and women at the brothel in Paris having fun on the sofas in the living room. What? Can't afford a room? I found it nice that Madame (Irina Malysheva) felt that she was doing her patriotic duty by looking after the soldier's needs. <br /> <br /> The film was just an excuse to show a lot of breasts - and I mean A lot! Gimli fans (John Rhys-Davies) might be interested in seeing him in a different role as Inspector Marais.
