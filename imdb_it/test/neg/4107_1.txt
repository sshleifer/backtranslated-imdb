UN SOUND OF THUNDER. One of the greatest short stories ever written. One of the greatest Masters of Fantasy, Ray Bradbury. What a beautiful story. <br /> <br /> But what a vomit film! <br /> <br /> In the science fiction story of Bradbury, a company called Time Safari offers great game hunters the opportunity to go back in time and kill the dinosaurs. The number one rule is: Stay On The Path, a floating metal gangway that does not guarantee any interaction with the prehistoric environment. During a hunt, a man descends from the path and inadvertently crushes a butterfly. When the hunting team returns to the present, the world as it knows it has changed drastically. Although there are paradoxes in every time-travel story, Bradbury's story was a rapid jugular shot, a parable of the chain effect. <br /> <br /> A Sound of Thunder was published in 1952 (according to Wikipedia, the most republished fiction narrative science of all time) and illustrated Chaos Theory, Darwinism and The Butterfly Effect (which would have been coined only in the 60s by Edward Lorenz). In the history of Bradbury, the marvel of time travel has been overshadowed by the greed of the multinationals, which in turn is overshadowed by the mortal danger of the very existence of humanity. <br /> <br /> While in the film, A SOUND OF THUNDER (directed by the uneven Peter Hyams, CAPRICORNO UNO, 2010: ODYSSEY DUE), a pack of bad actors crosses the time portal again and again to try to correct your mistakes, like a version of BACK TO THE FUTURE droppings. The film has nothing to do with Bradbury's powerful story, except for the initial shock of the time he was traveling to a prehistoric hunting party. Dear Freedom are taken with the history of Bradbury: baboon reptiles, Chicago-surfaced plants, waves of time rippling the city, CGI insectoids - for which Bradbury should sue trousers, underpants and balls from the directors. <br /> <New writers Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier should start a Big Balls Agency, thinking they can add elements to a Ray Bradbury story that could improve it. How do these guys walk in a straight line with such big balls? Ben Kingsley is the business owner of Time Safari, with a hairpiece so bad that it looks like a hairpiece, Edward Burns is his main hunter, Travis and Catherine McCormack (who was Murron MacClannough, in BRAVEHEART) is the scientist with the best breasts. <br /> <br /> I cannot relate the hundreds and thousands of nonsense and donkey dialogues, but here there is only one, spoken by David Oyelowo as a sort of "scientist": it refers to the Pleiades group of stars, "The seven sisters, they look like stars, right?" But each of them is an entire galaxy. "Uh, no, you idiot scientist, I'm actually, uh, the stars. <br /> <br /> Those three idiots who rewrote Bradbury's history have forgotten they didn't know anything about physics or astronomy. Or writing . <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is the chest of Catherine McCormick who is striving against her shirts a little too small and disheveled. <br /> <br /> --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).
