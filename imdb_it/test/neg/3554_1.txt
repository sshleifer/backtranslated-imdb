One of the most boring movies I've ever had is completely formidable. Just a cut-out of a movie on a cookie, you can predict on every scene of the film only by knowing the genre, since this film does not add anything new. Dialogue is never fun, interesting or intelligent. The acting is weak and the soundtrack is annoying - practically everything seems to have been made by an amateur filmmaker. Nothing fresh, memorable or fun in this movie, combined with the fact that it's LONG gives it an easy thumb down. Sorry, fan. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: F
