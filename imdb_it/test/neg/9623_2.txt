Having appreciated Neil Gaiman's script (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in "The Dream Hunters") in the past, I imagined that Mirrormask was a sure thing and I was very disappointed. The beginning, the live-action section of the film was quite intriguing. The relationships between the characters were credible and easily identifiable, and I loved the sets, costumes and works of Helena. The subsequent computer-generated scenes, however, were heartbreaking. The dialogue was embarrassing and pretentious, the interaction between the live actors and the horrifying CGI. The events occurred for the weakest reasons, and most events seemed superfluous to whatever plot might exist. I only watched the first twenty or thirty minutes of the film, so I'm not exactly an authority, but I strongly recommend not looking at any of this and sticking to Gaiman's strong written work.
