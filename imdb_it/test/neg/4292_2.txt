Great actors, good shots, a potentially interesting storyline, and what should have been a good dialogue. Nothing else is good for this movie. Perhaps the writer or director thought they could create a film that would stimulate annoying characters who are as deep as a cup of coffee. <br /> <br /> In 10 minutes I didn't like Kim's portrayal of Caroleen Feeney so much that it became a distraction. While Kim should be a nasty character, I'm not sure I should have committed acts of physical violence on her. The first (of many) oddities that occur is that Wes (David Strathairn) switches from "I miss $ 50.00" to "He stole 50 $" in about 3 seconds. It was quite unbelievable, since she (Kim) had never had access to her wallet and was not a first-rate pickpocket ... there was simply no rational reason to suspect her. Most people have lost / lost their money and take it for granted that ... we lost it. The same goes for Kim later. All very unrealistic behavior in what should be (I think) a look at real people. Kim's character was, at least, affected by a BiPolar disorder. Wes had enormous problems of inadequacy, Nancy was simply boring, and Matt was delusional (particularly with regards to music). Actually I turned it off for about 2/3. However, to write a valid comment, I tried to turn it back on hoping that something could come together in this film. No, I'm sorry, it was still bad. Make a point to miss this.
