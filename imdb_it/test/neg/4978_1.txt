When I heard that Disney had the rights to "Underdog", I thought it would be a great deal for Pixar, and we'd have a great movie for adults and kids like "The Incredibles". Alas ... I forgot how Disney should diminish the classic material for today's youth. What were they thinking? "Underdog" was a product of the 60s, your Prime Fanbase is between 40 and 50 years old, why should you refocus it on 5 year olds? It should be made "Roger Rabbit", a half-real animated medium. Instead we get characters like Riff Raff (a WOLF !!) killed in another dog. "Underdog" cannot have an "energy pill", since we are now so "enlightened" it would obviously be a reference to steroids or drugs. The only nice casting was Patrick Warburton as "Cad" because it actually looks like the cartoon version. Otherwise, fans of the old school "Underdog" should avoid this as the plague it is. What will happen? A live action version of "The Go-Go Gophers" disguised as a retelling history lesson? (My apologies if Disney jumps on this one!)
