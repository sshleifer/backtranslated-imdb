"It may contain spoilers" Lou Costellos' latest film has the honor of being slightly better than Abbott & Costello's last film "Dance With Me Henry". This film is not all that terrible, it is a hilarious shooting. Dorothy Provine is nice to look at and makes the movie a little bearable. You can't blame Lou Costello for this because he was released from an important study which meant that someone had to give him the "green" light. In my opinion, Lou Costello was overcoming the problems of his loss of his son a few years earlier and the unjustified attacks by the IRS. If you watch the last 3-4 films by Abbott & Costello you can see that the magic was gone. Check out "Dance With Me Henry", now it's a painful movie to watch.
