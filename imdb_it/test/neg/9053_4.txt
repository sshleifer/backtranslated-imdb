Eaten Alive is a small film that opens in New York and the Arctic where tribesmen shoot snake venom at a few people, then a woman enters the police district who is trying to find her sister who disappeared after 6 months Sheila Ã¨ of Alabama, but her accent sucks, she is united with an adventurer who seems to want only his money and seems to say a lot for the whole film. They venture through the Amazon only to find a community with people and find their sister, "in front of a madman who has probably seen too many sermons of Jim Jones. He will take them to a better place, it could be heaven but no, Mark and Sheila will find out that later it is actually a suicide cult. <br /> <br /> Why do I call Eaten Alive a "little movie"? I tell you, but when I saw it, I was amazed with everyone the cannibals, Robert Kerman has a different role than his professor at the Cannibal Holocaust.It's a little annoying, once we meet him at a wrestling match that looked like the Russian roulette we know is a tough guy. Strong misogyny only makes you shiver and it seems that you have seen it somewhere, oh the animal scenes kill each other. But the whole film turns on those scenes, it's like they're looking at pictures of nature with parts of a movie But after seeing this movie, I s I realized that most of the scenes in the film are taken from other cannibal films, even the disappearance of 2 characters, well .. but part of the film is. That's why I call this a small film, when I discovered that the scenes were taken on loan it seemed to me to throw the disc across the room, this is not a film, but just a simple editing.
