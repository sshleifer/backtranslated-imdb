1st seen 12/26/2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): Corny comedy mysterious murder with very few laughs. The film appears to be based on an earlier Italian film according to the end credits, but was rewritten by two rather popular American romantic comedy writers. But this by Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers does not cut him from their other efforts. The story is about a pair of inexperienced Americans, played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who run into a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward after seeing an announcement in the newspaper about Dachsund's return. In an attempt to return it, they see a hand sticking out of a garage door of the lady's residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the woman's dead body that should give them the money. They get scared and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth, they come out as fugitives from the scene that they expect to be framed for murder. The other characters in the film meet on a train before this and wander around a Monte Carlo casino doing various things to include in the story. Other cast members include the actors John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. After the police learned of the death, they start questioning the main characters and, of course, they have to work through their stupid lies to understand what really happened. None of the actors mentioned above can bring this film out of mediocre status despite some amusing moments provided mainly by the Belushi / Pastor couple. This is not a horrible movie, it's not that good. There are many average movies out there and this is just another one for the stack. Try it, maybe you'll like it, you probably won't.
