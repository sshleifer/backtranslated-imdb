I saw this movie and I was bored by my mind! I'm a Peanuts fan, but I can't understand why Charles Schultz did this disaster! Spoilers ahead. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that Snoopy would let his friends sleep on the ground outside in a dangerous situation and go out to a bar and sip some cold without being on guard! The story was meaningless, even for comic book characters. It takes too long to arrive in France, and once I arrived in France I had the feeling that the writer (I still can't believe he was Schultz) didn't know what to do once he got there. <br /> <br /> Peanuts is best done in 30-minute episodes, not in 80-minute films. <br /> <br /> Go home Charlie Brown, you're at your best there. <br /> <br />
