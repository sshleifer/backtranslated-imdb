There are a lot of movies, mostly from the 80s, that are so terrible that you can't help but love them. The Last Slumber Party is one of those. I hate this movie so much, but it still remains one of the most viewed films in my collection. I looked at it countless times and got a huge laugh every time. It is the first example of how ANY films could be published in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The name of our killers is Maniac Randles. (Scary, eh?) Randles is a psychopathic killer who escaped by hanging around in a doctor's smock and a doctor's jacket that cuts people off with a scalpel as he walks. He ends up running into a house of girls who are having a sleepover. One of the girls is the daughter of the doctor who tried to operate on Randle, and Randle ended up pulling him down into some sort of sexual position. (lol watches the movie to know what I'm talking about). Now I know what you have to think about at this point: it must be another low-cost crack and a slash like Slumber Party Massacre, or the Valentine's massacre, right? NO! This film is HORRIBLE! First of all, the quality of the film changes and continues throughout the film. Sometimes it will seem that it could have been filmed this year, but at other times it is so grainy and fuzzy that it is not even watchable. The funny thing is that some specific camera angles will be blurred and grainy, and other specific camera angles will be clear and perfect, which is absolutely ridiculous and shows that they didn't care at all. <br /> <br /> The director played the killer (as if it wasn't funny enough) but due to the fact that he didn't have enough talent to act and direct at the same time, he simply filmed his shot walking towards the camera with his scalpel, and then repeated that clip several times every time someone is killed. <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are completely ridiculous and improbable, and these people who suppose they are between the ages of 16 and 18 look more like them 25-45. I know that slasher movies commonly use adults as teenagers, but I've never seen a movie where it was so obvious. My hypothesis is that the reason why none of them is still in the film industry today is because they all died of old age ... Or maybe it was just because this film was so horrible that they never wanted to show their faces again, and this is a good thing because I strongly doubt that they could have entered other films even if they tried. All I can do is hope that one day Tyler will make THE LAST SLUMBER PARTY 2: THE FINAL CONFLICT and bring back all the original actors. I'm sure everyone would love it. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by Stephen Tyler, (No, not the singer) which he never directed, and was published by B & S (which I'm definitely going to be for bull and *** *) Productions. Bull & S only released another film, "Forever Evil", which was pretty horrible, but not as bad as Last Slumber Party. <br /> <br /> A horrible, horrible, horrible film ... Highly recommended.
