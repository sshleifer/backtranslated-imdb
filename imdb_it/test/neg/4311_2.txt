How disgusting! <br /> <br /> MUST have been done for TV or cable. <br /> <br /> Look: forget the script - forget the group of forgettable actors. I'm sorry? Continuity? The NSA / NIA / whatever or whoever (an agent) takes off in an F16 - is shown in a courage-free F18 and, later, the taxiing plane is an F4 Phantom! Oooh, I'd like to be so casual. <br /> <br /> In addition to male actors (!?) Women are WASPS: with blue eyes and long legs and, in the end, crying for the heroes you save them. Even when a solid weld can save most cosmo-astro-nautical cosmos, the blond makes the welding tool fall. Duh! <br /> <br /> As a SF movie one in ten. Like a movie in itself: 1/2 (which is a half point). They should have left the space station and headed for Mars. <br /> <br /> Main raspberries.
