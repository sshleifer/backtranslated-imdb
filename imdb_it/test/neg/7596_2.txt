This was a disappointment in many ways. The filming location in Ireland, although quite beautiful sometimes, cannot save this uninspired film. Greg Evigan and Alexandra Paul, while the married couple tries to get back on track and inherit a haunted house, are not interesting characters. Paul, towards the end of the film, becomes incredibly annoying and would like him to shut up and shut up, as he seems to be screaming as if he had just become an Olympic event! Other problems with this film are strange segments that have nothing to do with the core of the film, such as the opening sequence with two cleaning ladies and the woman in a bed with a severed hand climbing up her naked twisted body . Even if the woman is adequate enough to do this, she does nothing to tell. It has been suggested that the production team was needed to obtain a short execution time and just launched some padding and some T and A. The CGI effects are also cartoonistic and the fiery final rivals the executive co-producer Roger Corman much earlier and far superior film The fall of Usher's house in all its ineffective cheapness. Every attempt at true tension and suspense, and therefore chills, is thrown out of the window into this low-cost bust. If you like the images of Ireland you might find something here but you'd better rent or buy a travelogue. Skip this unless you are indiscriminate and think the plot is secondary. Rent another ghost story at low cost (if you can find it) entitled The Woman In Black and find out how beautiful and scary a movie can be. This was a missed opportunity.
