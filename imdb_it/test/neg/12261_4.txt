the reason I gave this film a 4 was for a couple of reasons, but this film wasn't so bad. first of all, the editing that I sometimes found to be rather poor, the script (or what they had of one) wasn't very good, and if it wasn't for Nunzio La Bianca, the acting would have been crap. but apart from that (ha ha I know it's like the whole movie) it's not so bad for an extremely low ind. , low budget films. If they got more money, a little better actors (but these were intimidating so it was nice) and a bit more detailed script this movie would have been great. Someone has to tell me that this guy was very influenced by the warriors of Walter Hill. I mean, this movie is exactly like this. anyone who has seen both films will agree with me.
