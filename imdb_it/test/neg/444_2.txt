God, he sucked. You can't end a horror movie with a happily everlasting family environment. Yeash. I was a bit ambivalent going to the final act. But, my god. She didn't have to kill the girl, she didn't die, the phantom father appears with a cure (which doesn't make sense, because his spirit would have been freed after the yank boy killed all the werewolves). What a beautiful piece of garbage. This is the worst horror movie I've seen in a long time and I've seen many horror movies. This is a slap in the face for Landis and everyone else involved in the American werewolf in London. Blegh. I hope this has ruined the career of all those of Julie Delphy. AND CGI: a bit new and chic in 1997, but today it seems a bit sad compared to London's artistic prosthesis and make-up work. Anyway, I'm done, I hope I've scared a few people. Take the original instead or fail at The Howling. Or they can't watch American Idol replicas. Just don't look at this mess.
