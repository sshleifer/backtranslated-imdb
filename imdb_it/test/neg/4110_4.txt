(Synopsis) In the year 2055, the rich are able to travel back in time and hunt a live dinosaur at a huge price. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) has developed a machine that can bring people back in time. Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) has adopted this technology and opened an activity like Time Safari. Anyone with the money can travel back millions of years and shoot a dinosaur. Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) leads his team along with the great hunter on a floating walkway to a spot where they can kill the dinosaur. The travel protocol is that they must stay on the catwalk and not disturb the earth or any creature around them. Unfortunately for the human race, a hunter approaches and kills a butterfly. This insignificant act causes important impacts on the earth's climate and creates new species of animal life. The course of evolution as we know it now is modified by waves of time. Travis and Sonia try to stop the process of change before it becomes permanent, and the man dies out. <br /> <br /> (Comment) The film was a bit slow and the concept of going back in time and changing things was a bit exaggerated. The death of a single butterfly that causes tremendous changes in the atmosphere and in the evolution of the world is simply ridiculous. They changed the Chicago skyline to look modern, but the new cars of the future were stupid. You can wait to see this fantasy on DVD. (Warner Brothers Pictures, Run Time 1:43, Rated PG-13) (4/10)
