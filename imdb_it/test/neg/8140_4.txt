It's a story as old as man. Jealousy for his wife and another man's property. There are also commandments against it. <br /> <br /> In this story, Raymond Burr ("Perry Mason", "Ironside") is the manager of a runner plantation who wants the owner's wife and feels he is not being treated with respect. His wife, starlet Barbara Payton, who was trying to make a comeback after a series of sordid affairs, was coveting Burr, who killed her husband, Paul Cavanagh. <br /> <br /> But there was a strange woman lurking, the housekeeper (Gisela Werbisek) who sees everything, and who was capable of some voodoo to avenge the wrong, which included another young woman (Carol Varga) to which Burr also declared himself to be love. <br /> <br /> Burr is poisoned and becomes, or thinks of becoming, a gorilla. Payton will have to mate with Kong if he ever wants his marriage consumed as he enters the jungle every night. <br /> <br /> The end is predictable. But the exciting question of this film is why Payton would have never been afraid. With those sharp missiles sticking out of his chest, no animal could get close to her to hurt.
