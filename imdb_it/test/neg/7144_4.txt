In the end I rented this video after searching for it for many months. Initially I just wanted to see him because I'm a huge fan of Neil Pearson (Patrick, Isobel's boyfriend, the main character). However, the film holds up very well without Neil (although he manages very well in this film, he is overshadowed by the three main female characters). It is a disturbing, intense film, the type that the British do so well - certainly a "film" of the house and is an isolated environment that gives the film an almost "stormy top" aura. The film is full of tension and fine, shocking, yet somehow inevitable. I'm glad I saw it, it was worth it
