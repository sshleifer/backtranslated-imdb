Oh god, I'm really sick of all these generic Japanese horror movies about female ghosts with long hair and spooky babies. "Ghost Train" is no exception. It is clearly influenced by "Ringu", "Ju-On", "Shutter" and "Pulse". Two years ago I was in modern ghost stories, because they usually could give me some goose bumps, unfortunately there is nothing cool or interesting in "Ghost Train". In reality the film is really boring. disappears in a subway tunnel - like an elementary school mate - Nana must investigate a mystery of multiple disappearances, with the help of a young conductor and another "missing" mother. The film offers some slightly disturbing moments, however the CGI effects are ridiculous and the climax is illogical.
