The businessman is kidnapped, forced to wander for miles and miles in a forest for days and days exchanging a dialogue with his captor. And we have to listen to all the nonsense ...... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile his snotty wife and family are at home with the FBI wondering what to do ...... .. ... at no time seems worried about her husband's fate, except when it comes to the ransom ... A love story "Give me a break! <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous. And almost every scene is full of an expectation that something significant will happen but it never will. <br /> <br /> The result of the kidnapping is predictable and stupid, and it becomes even more foolish when we learn the abductor's fate. <br /> <br /> This is garbage: <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
