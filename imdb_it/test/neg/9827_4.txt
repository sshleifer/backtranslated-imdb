"Jefferson in Paris" is a truly shocking film. He presents Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) in the most unflattering light possible, portraying him as a liar, racist and pedophile, yet he doesn't offer a shred of condemnation for those sins. This was the way it was, the film seems to say. End of the sentence, end of the film, the door behind you. <br /> <br /> After arriving in Paris with his daughter Patsy (Gwenyth Paltrow), Jefferson continues to win the heart of Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), the wife of a homosexual English painter (the criminally underutilized Simon Callow) . A turn of events sends Mary to England, however, and Jefferson continues to forget her with surprising speed for a man who, a few minutes from the screen, asked her to live with him in America. <br /> <br /> He was bewitched, see, by Sally Hemmings (Thandie Newton), one of his newly arrived slaves from America. The reason he is bewitched is hard to say - even though Sally is undeniably beautiful, she acts like a simple-minded child facing Jefferson. When she is not telling ghost stories in exaggerated "dark" word patterns, she is running around in her bedroom, practically exuding lust for her distinguished mass. <br /> <br /> If your behavior is an attempt to excuse Jefferson, don't let him work. Jefferson crashes further when Maria, tired of waiting for her letters, travels from England to see him. I have not changed towards you, he insists, offering weak excuses for not writing. To his credit, Maria immediately sees through his blatant lies. When Sally appears, and she and Jefferson flirt openly (and cruelly in my mind) in Maria's presence, the illusion falls apart completely. <br /> <br /> No one today believes that Jefferson, Washington and the rest were completely comparisons of virtue and morality. Still, we should believe that the learned and illustrious Jefferson would be attracted to Sally, a woman whose most intelligent conversation concerns the way "French mass friends fall in love with nothing" and rubs herself against her face as she passes, right in front of Maria's eyes? <br /> <br /> Even if we leave that slide, the horrible revelation followed that Sally was only 15 when this took place (Jefferson was 41). Strangely, this fact only emerges towards the end, when Sally's brother James is understandably furious about his blas√© announcement that he is carrying Jefferson's son. <br /> <br /> Jefferson is equally insipid when he said that Sally is bringing her son and condescendingly tells her that it would be much better under her protection than she frees and that she lives in France with her brother. But, he promises, I will release her when I die and our children (including others who come, says Jefferson, in a chilling statement by Sally as * her *) when they reach 21. Oh thank you, mass, you feel like saying the screen A big problem. <br /> <br /> The worst scene is yet to come, involving Jefferson's daughter, Patsy. She is already angry with him, first for breaking her vow, made to her mother on her deathbed, so as not to marry again. (Obviously the woman was not just talking about marriage.) Jefferson also refused to allow Patsy to become a nun like she wants, despite the previous moralization on freedom of religion (which seems to mean that freedom agrees with him) . > <br /> After promising Sally and his brother their freedom, Jefferson calls Patsy to testify to the pact and promise to do it if something should happen to him. Sally's brother spits the baby's imminent birth, and Jefferson asks, "Do you swear?" Paltrow's performance in this scene is brilliant, although he has almost nothing to say. His face almost writhes in agonizing pain at this revelation, yet he controls his pain and whispers yes. <br /> <br /> If anything, the filmmakers might have had something if they emphasized this point the most, "Jefferson in Paris" is an indication of the status of women in the late 18th century, also considered by men like Jefferson as property attractive, pleasant but without true intellect or soul. We see Jefferson shed some tears on a letter from Maria, which obviously tells him where to get off, but he is soon laughing at a wild dance by Sally, complete with her hair and her panting chest. <br /> <br /> I don't know if this is an accurate portrait of Jefferson or not. I don't care to look at it anyway, just for the sake of looking at it. This Jefferson is not a hero or even an antihero. He is a selfish and liar molester and one who gets along - not the kind of man I want to see a movie of.
