I saw 5% of this movie tonight and you could tell me that I need to see the whole movie to understand it, but frankly I don't think so. <br /> <br /> What the hell is the story in this movie? I saw a lot of people rushing into a factory, shooting at everything around them. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Ok .. <br /> <br /> 1) They walked around the place like it was the Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The whole place is made of metal, but not a single bullet shone on the metal surfaces. <br /> <br /> 2) No rebound. Metal vs metal is bound to cause rebounds, but apparently no one has been hit by a stray bullet. <br /> <br /> 3) Magic points? In one scene a bad boy is standing right in front of a good guy when another good guy comes out behind the villain and pumps him full of metal. You see the bullets coming out of his chest as he explodes in a bloody fog, but the good guy in front of him doesn't get hurt at all! 4) After having just sketched a human on the wall, the two good guys tell each other about their jokes and laugh and they look like teenagers playing with soft guns. <br /> <br /> 5) Sound? At some point the good guys cut a thread and trigger an alarm (who the hell cuts a thread just to trigger an alarm?). The lady screams "Alarm in the blah blah sector" and the bad boss says "Ok .. this .. is .. not .. a .. drill .. blah blah" in a very, very amateur way. Ooh, we are being ambushed by terrorists, this is not a drill, but I will sound like I didn't shit. <br /> <br /> 6) Focus !! First you see that the bad guys are loaded with weapons. For some reason the same guy gets the same Uzi twice. Deja vu or cycle of scenes? You literally see every single villain getting the same kind of weapon and they lock up and charge the same way. The arms dealer appears in the clip and the bad extra guy does not. XX locks and loads. When they started to open fire you had to see the barrel flashing. Boooring !! 7) Actors or dummies? One of the alleged good boys throws down a smoke bomb for some reason and, of course, the bad guys are suddenly inside the smoke because they are smoke bombs or something, so they don't see it coming. They cough and groan as if it were the Anthrax in the grenade. Then a bad semi-boss arrives and doesn't even cough when he gets into the smoke, but pushes the other villains away and suddenly they realize that the smoke isn't anthrax anyway. <br /> <br /> 8) B flick? I think so! A guy who slips down from a metal tube wielding an Uzi in his right hand by shooting someone at eye level apparently. I'd like to see a guy firing an Uzi with one hand and I'd like to see him go get his hand later. A jumble of extra blood in a Blick b in a way. Small * pop * and a red hole with a torn shirt indicate that this guy is dead. Even if the first bullet hit his heart, the good guy who is a super trained green cap still feels the urge to empty his clip into the dead. <br /> <br /> 9) One of these mentioned trained soldiers leap out of his skin with an empty clip! How stupid are you? Always check the clip before facing an unknown amount of enemies! 10) Boring scenes. Like the barrel flash scenes and the block and load scenes, the film is full of wasted time scenes in which people run into an apparently empty building. Switch to action if you are going to a movie B movie, please. <br /> <br /> My two cents on this movie.
