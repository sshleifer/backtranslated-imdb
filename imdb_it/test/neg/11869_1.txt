OK, that would be short. This film was not only ugly, it was very bad, with line4s like "if you're dealing with the devil you expect to put on your shoes" you know your horrible movie territory. After watching this movie, I wanted to kill myself and all my family, it gave me such a profound feeling of hatred for myself that I wanted to kill. don't watch this movie I'll kill you again. but when I do it will be terribly edited with a pathetic soundtrack and stocks to take action sequences and bad shirts. <br /> <br /> fortunately there is a downside, it is the first action movie to feature a three-door ford sierra. <br /> <br /> unfortunately ends up in the basket on the roof :( <br /> <br /> Ps: Worse than the Marksman
