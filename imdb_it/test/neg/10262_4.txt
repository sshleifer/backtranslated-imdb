I saw this last night and being a fan of the early Demons, I had hoped the sequel had the same fun and ghostly spirit as its predecessor. This is unfortunately not the case. The structure is similar to the first, in which a horde of meat-devouring demons breaks into reality as it is released from a horror film being played ... (The first was a cinema, this takes place in a condominium and on TV) . Once the demons are freed, madness and massacres ensue. This is practically the development of the plot. It worked well in the first part due to the macabre FX trick, fast pace and unpredictability. The sequel, however, does not cut it. The first problem seems to be that there are too many characters that we are not really interested in one way or another. If they were boring or idiots, then there would be at least some kind of gratification when they will inevitably be slaughtered / demonized / eaten alive ... but these people are simply there waiting to be slaughtered. Furthermore, the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the apartment building (and outside of it), they are constantly cutting back and forth between them, which has continued to pull me out of history. There are some fun pieces, thanks to the splatter FX and campiness. Like a steady stream of dripping blood that eats through the construction of one floor after another as if it were an alien acid ... The first possession of demons of a puny birthday girl leads to the destruction of his entire party, and a creepy demonic child who claws his way into the room of a tenant who is pregnant with a child. However, that sequence turns into a ridiculous-looking rubber-like puppet-like demon thing that explodes from the chest of the human child who constantly flies across the room towards the intended victim. I had a couple of laughs from that scene, but I don't think it was Bava's intention. Probably the scene would have worked better if they had kept the baby demon around to attack the woman, but hey ... Other little things like the overzealous acting of most characters and the bad dubbing don't help things. In summary, I was able to see the unrated version on DVD, and I can't imagine having to sit all the way to the version with the capital R previously available, because FX and gore make-up were the only thing that I got it. . Also notable is the early role of the future hottie daughter of the producer Argento, Asia. In fact, she probably offers the best performance of the entire cast and she is barely on screen. Fans of Argento / Bava may want to check it out just to see it, but they will probably find themselves looking at their watch, like I did. Gore fans might have fun with a little fx, but they will have fun laughing from their chairs to the stupidest wicked child puppet since Little Selwyn of Dead / Alive. You could do worse, but it certainly isn't up to the original.
