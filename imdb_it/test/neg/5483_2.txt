The comments already left for this show are much more fun than the show itself and are all accurate. I feel exactly the same way, I'm very disappointed with how Rick Mercer fell when he did great things on This Hour has 22 Minutes but now he just clowning, going to places and talking to people. He does some studio pieces about the things that happen in the news, but they are never fun, just really sad and predictable jokes about titles. Most of his show is he who goes somewhere to talk to people, for example this week he will go to a rodeo and the videos are all he making funny faces and acting scared by wild horses, etc. It was fun but it became less fun since he left This Hour has 22 Minutes and that show isn't fun anymore. Now that Air Farce is not on the air (finally thank goodness!) Mercer and This Hour have 22 minutes to be in line with the ax, just an old tired and predictable comedy that hardly anyone finds fun. Really sad that Rick Mercer was the funniest man on Canadian TV!
