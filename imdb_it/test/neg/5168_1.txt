From all the negative comments on this film and I add them I feel the same way. It might seem that the Australians are weak, instead they were brave soldiers. In this film it was very terrible and too graphic. I have not seen enough heroism only more cowardly than it is ashame because it is nothing from what I read. We do not need extreme violence such as we can use our vivid imagination of what they have gone through. It's like saving the private ryan where the Nazi is slowly pushing the knife into the soldier. For example, Mel Gibson is an extreme director for his films not because of violence but because of the level of historical inaccuracy. Iwo Jima's letters were one of the war movies quite close to the story (although I could be wrong), except Flags of our Fathers and Bridge of the River Kwai. It is better to read it as an insult to the victims and the fallen if you do not say it well, and the film dragged for too long there is nothing interesting in the dialogue and not enough remuneration from the Australians to kill the Japanese soldiers. Just read the history on the internet, magazines and books. Movies always kill the sense of accomplishment. What they did to prisoners of war in Singapore and the Philippines was appalling to civilians. It just makes me proud to see the greedy beat the bad guys, but films like this ruin everything.
