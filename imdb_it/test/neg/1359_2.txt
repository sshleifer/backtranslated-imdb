For those of you who have never heard of the film so far (which I assume there are many lucky people who have not), I'll summarize it for you. Ryan Gosling plays the main character of Leland, who also acts as the narrator of the film (a Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, but without the intelligent observations about life). Leland goes to prison for stabbing a retarded child to death, and the film tries to figure out why he did it. He looks like a good guy (if not mentally absent), and is played by Gosling with a total lack of violence, anger or agenda (and if you're waiting for him to reveal his left side later in the movie, wear Do not waste time ... it's not that kind of movie). Once in the juvenile prison, Leland goes to the lectures given by Pearl Madison, cleverly interpreted by Don Cheadle (who is incapable of anything but quality, even in bad films). Pearl attempts to unlock the mystery of Leland in an attempt to understand how a boy can do such a thing, and so he could write a book about it later (besides being a juvenile prison teacher, Pearl is also an aspiring author) . <br /> <br /> The relationship between Leland and Pearl is the guiding plot of the film, while their speeches reveal Leland's past to the public. However, calling it the center of attention would imply that this meandering film had one. It is not so. The United States of Leland boasts an impressive cast, which seems to be at the expense of the film. It seems that the writer / director Matthew Ryan Hodge (don't worry that you haven't heard of him, he never did anything) had to give EVERY character a personal storyline and personality flaw to make the actors play them. Most of these traits and stories are clichés and most of them are underdeveloped and unresolved. I will try to break them here: Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson are the parents of the late retarded boy (I love how the film kept calling the boy "retarded", never "mentally disabled". That part made me laugh inside), apparently they have a cold relationship, because all suburban marriages in contemporary cinema must be cold. The other two children are Michelle Williams, who is apparently an aspiring actress about to go to college, and Jena Malone, who plays the same tormented adolescent archetype she always plays, this time with a heroin addiction. Malone was also Leland's girlfriend, who gave him his connection to his victim. Williams's boyfriend, an orphan and came to live with his family, and is a baseball player who wants to go to the same college as his girlfriend, is played by Chris Klein. He ends up doing more with his character than all the other bit players, managing to steal the movie sometimes. Lena Olin is Leland's mother, who seems to be perpetually sad for some reason. Kevin Spacey (also the executive producer) is the cold and absent father of Leland, who is a famous novelist. In the end, Sherilyn Fenn will show up to put a twist in Leland's story - if you care about that too. Oh yeah, and there's a drugged ex-boyfriend, a couple of mates and a colleague of Pearl's with whom he has an affair with his long-time girlfriend with (played by Kerry Washington). <br /> <br /> Sorry if all that synopsis and the character subdivision took so long. If it seemed meaningless and boring, then you just experienced a little of what I did during the 108 minutes spent watching the movie. But the unprejudiced cast of excessive clichés is the last of this film's crimes. The biggest one is that the whole exercise is completely useless. We are not given a fascinating look in a troubled mind, we are not given an effective explanation, we are not given much of anything. Since he sucked so much, I go ahead and ruin the ending for you so you never have to see it: Leland stabbed the retard because everything Leland could see in the world was sad and wanted to save Corky (or whatever the victim's name ) the sadness in his eyes. It's like the worst emo band in the world had made an album and called it "The world is sad, so I killed a retard." Oh, and Leland eventually dies, in a sequence so dependent on incredible coincidences that it would have ruined the film, if the film hadn't already sucked. Obviously he dies at the end, because this made the film so deep. <br /> <br /> I'm giving the 2-star movie, because the actors themselves did a great job with the garbage they received. The scenes with Cheadle and Gosling were even interesting on some levels. But to paraphrase the film itself, you have to believe that movies are more than the sum of their parts, children.
