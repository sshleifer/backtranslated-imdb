Okay, I'm sorry for the cast and crew for this review, but this movie is by far the worst I've ever seen ... First of all, the acting was fine. It could be better (especially in some parts), but it was "ok". Then, there was the cheapest video camera (which they used). The violence was quite good. If he was stimulated faster, it would be great, but they didn't (* sigh *) ... Scares. The fears were well written (in the script), but not well done. For example ... (SPOILER HERE!) In the loft, a girl is halfway and the other half is in the darkness, at the bottom of the barn house, then she understands. The monster pulls her down and then feels that someone is masturbating. The fears may have been better if the music had not been snatched from a cheap horror movie CD. The effects of the blood were quite good, but the blood was similar to that of "Kill Bill". K.B. pulled out, because it was meant to look like old kung-fu movies, but when the crew can't tell the difference between red and pink .... it's sad. The bodies torn in the film were good, but the scarecrow costumes were something you would have seen for $ 25 in a Halloween store. Don't be fooled by the cover, the costumes suck! My overall grade is 3/10. If you are interested in independent films, are satisfied or have only 3 dollars in your pocket, go to Blockbuster and see the horror of failure.
