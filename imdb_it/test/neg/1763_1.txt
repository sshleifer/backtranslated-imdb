Critics are falling on themselves within Weinstein's sphere of influence to praise this ugly, wrong and repulsive adaptation of the lyric novel on which it is based. Minghella's crazy direction of the excessively bloody and shrill odyssey of episodes is one of the many false steps of this "love story of the civil war". Are they joking? After Ms. Kidman and Mr. Law meet with zero screen chemistry in a small town in North Carolina and steal a kiss before going to war for Jude and her photographic memory of the girl she left, it's a test. two hours to the kidneys if he survives a myriad of near-death experiences to reunite with his soul mate. Who cares? The amateur scene by Philip S. Hoffman who chews a lousy and unpleasant role pales the look of Renee Zelweger like a dynamo fueled by corn that miraculously breaks onto the scene of Kidman's solitary farm to save the day. Rarely has a performance screamed "look at me, I'm acting" smug. His deafening nervousness awakens the longuchi for a couple of minutes until the pout becomes painfully thin. Released by Miramax strategically for the Oscar and Golden Globe (which farce), the Weinsteins apparently owns, along with Dick Clark, the critical community and won 8 Globe nominations for their exaggerated failure. The crime that ensues is that the prizes have become meaningless and small, less powerful and PR-led films have become obscure. Cold Mountain is a conceptual film and an empty, bitter waste of time. Really cold !!!
