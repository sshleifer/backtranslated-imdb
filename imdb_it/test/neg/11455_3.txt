Cimarron was painful to sit. Although Irene Dunn does a good job with the heavy script, Richard Dix's pompous and exaggerated role is brutal. The passage of time has not dealt with the character of Isaiah, as well as other racial and religious notions, well, even if the film is a bit progressive on the role of women and the mistreatment of Native Americans. The assembly is particularly weak. This is, without a doubt, the worst of all "best" images.
