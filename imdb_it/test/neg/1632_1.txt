Because it is none other than Ator interpreted hilariously by Miles O'Keefe. Surprisingly, I had the misfortune to sit in this turkey before the Mystery Science Theater 3000 did it to pieces. I highly recommend taking a look at the MST3K version as it is exhilarating and one of their best episodes ever. <br /> <br /> The film about it is basically the kind of typical B-movie that Italian filmmakers were churning out in the early 1980s. This film has apparently been made to cash in on Conan's mania, but fails miserably on all fronts. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on the scenes in which Ator fights a giant rubber snake and even manages to make a complete hang glider during a split. <br /> <br /> "Thong, the fish is ready!" <br /> <br /> evaluation: the movie itself-1 The MST3K version: 10
