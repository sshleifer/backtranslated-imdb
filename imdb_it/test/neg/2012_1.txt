Oh my God, it's terrible. Stay away, stay away. If you think you've seen bad movies, think again. Never before has my brain hurt like having seen this movie. The acting, if it is allowed to call it that, is sufficient to cause bleeding inside the head. The story is so subtle that it's just there ... without waiting, scratching. There is not a complete story there, but once in a while, there are some fine lines emerging from all the amount of horror, and believe me, those few lines should have been turned. The best way to enjoy this movie is to drop the napalm on it and watch the cozy fire from afar. <br /> <br /> Some may call me sarcastic in this review, but I'm just trying to save some of you from a severe headache. However, if I were to be, what I like to call, a visual masochist (like me), please go ahead and look at this monstrosity.
