A group of 7 gold diggers head towards a mine that was recently reopened after an earthquake. Of course, they don't pay attention to the local legend that something is down there and kills people. This low-budget horror movie ($ 25,000) has a slight cult following and I'm not exactly sure why (unless it's because it's so dark). I admit that the last half hour is quite funny, but the time to get there is pure torture. A lot of walking and talking and our oddity holder does not appear until 45 minutes. Even in the co-writer of extras Chris Huntley he admits that he commits the unforgivable sin of being boring. I would forgive them if they were rigorous amateurs, but this group graduated from USC so I hope they know that an exploit film should be exploited. However, as I said, the last half hour is fantastic, as three survivors fight the stop motion monster and there is a beautiful soundtrack by John Carpenter. I wanted to see more monsters, but it's literally on the screen for 45 seconds. <br /> <br /> Even if the film is not the best, the Code Red DVD has given this great attention. You have interviews and an audio commentary by director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer / actor Mark Sawicki and co-writer Huntley. Tales of how the film was made are quite fascinating and stimulating (like a cave set in a courtyard). Even more interesting are the short films for USC students from Sawicki and Huntley, which are actually all better than feature film production. Huntley was a very talented artist and it's a shame he didn't go anywhere else. Sawicki has worked permanently in Hollywood as an actor for visual effects and filming. The VHS of the film is a little legendary for how dark it was and I'm sure it's much better. However, you still have scenes where the only image is the five helmet lights that bounce in the dark. Sure to say, the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still "a horror champion set in a mine".
