The characters were so unoriginal that they hurt. The crazy little computer lazy, the cute African American with stupid jokes, nice white guy with a pity for the cars and the handsome boss who ends up with the beautiful girl. At best, the actors are mediocre. Norton Ecsept that does a great job as a bad guy. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is also stupid and a complete waste of time. This is a group of spoiled kids who use the world as their playground where every safe in a big house is what keeps them with food on the table. I mean, why work for a living when you can rob people? <br /> <br /> And, .. Who f **** jokes with traffic lights in a big European city?!? And in the middle of the FRIGGIN day !? Think of all the damage and not the deaths of innocent civilians. What about all the ambulances and fire trucks? <br /> <br /> I have created NO compassion for the main characters, and the time that Mr. Wahlberg got his bleeding gold or not, I could not give less than a fart.
