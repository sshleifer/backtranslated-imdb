I know everyone has said that this movie was crap and I agree with them. I spent a few years after seeing him tell other people that it was crap. I told them not to see it. But when he arrived on TV, we saw the announcement. I turned to the family and said, "I know this is sad, but I'm thinking of looking at it." My sister turned to me and said, "Yes, me too." And you know what? It was fun. <br /> <br /> It is definitely not a good movie. It is absolutely a waste of time. But it's a good waste of time. You might still think it's pretty crappy and fair, but I thought it was a really fun slapstick comedy. I didn't like a couple of bits, like when the fish was hit by the car, but other than that I thought it was good. I enjoyed sitting around collecting all the famous Australian faces: Flacco, Elle McFeast, Garry McDonald, etc. <br /> <br /> So, if you like to waste time, watch this movie. Otherwise, you see a drama or something.
