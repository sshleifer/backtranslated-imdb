Somehow, this documentary on Miles manages to include very little music and no complete tracks. Although Miles appears in the film, 95% of the interviews are other people, not Miles. There are huge chronological gaps, many aspects of his life (his child prodigy, his drug addiction) are skipped over or over, and you will learn little about what made man and his contribution to music so revolutionary. Salta.
