Alleged documentary trying to examine the science fiction films of the 1950s and how they influenced America (and the Reflection). Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott and James Cameron are interviewed and Mark Hamill tells. <br /> <br /> Rather terrible. The "insights" that are provided are nothing new - for example - the Cold War and the threat of nuclear war have affected an entire generation of children. Ben duh! They try to cover all the different subgenres of science fiction films of the 1950s - the great bug films, space film invaders, etc. Okay, but they choose the most obvious films and have been analyzed to the death already. It was nice to see clips from "Rocketship XM", "Destination Moon", "Forbidden Planet", "The Thing" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" but everything the directors said was so incredibly obvious for any spectator who is offensive. Even if it's less than an hour, I got bored up to 30 minutes. This is a 2 for some clips but nothing else.
