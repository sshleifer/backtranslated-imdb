After his widowed father dies in a riding accident, young Tom Burlinson (as Jim Craig) is left to run his Australian "Snowy River" farm, with only the withered prospector, with full legs Kirk Douglas (like Spur ) to help. Times are difficult, so Mr. Burlinson goes to work for the wealthy owner of Mr. Douglas, Mr. Harrison, the silver-haired brother (also played by Kirk Douglas). When a big job arrives, the blond (older?) Di Douglas believes that Burlinson is too young and inexperienced to move forward; thus, Burlinson lags behind, and falls in love with the boss's daughter, Sigrid Thornton (like Jessica Harrison). <br /> <br /> The less satisfying aspect of director George Miller "The Man from Snowy River" is a weak plot. Observe, for example, the sequence of events "Jessica is lost". The damsel gets lost in one of those "strange" storms while fleeing. His worried father picks up a group of drunks to find her, having predicted bad weather. "Jessica" damsel rolls on the edge of a seemingly convenient cliff. Father and suddenly sober men do not control Burlinson's farm. Hero Burlinson discovers the maid. After setting the fire, he decides to kiss her. <br /> <br /> The "love story" is interpreted too innocently, for a man and a woman as attractive as Burlinson and Ms. Thornton. To make matters worse, the Douglas brothers have a "dark story" that is revealed before a mystery develops about the issue. The main attraction here is the Australian scenario. <br /> <br /> **** The Man from Snowy River (1982) George Miller ~ Tom Burlinson, Kirk Douglas, Sigrid Thornton
