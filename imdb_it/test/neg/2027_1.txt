I found this DVD in the store and thought, why not support some indy movies and watch a cool horror movie. Please save your time and money and pass this by. The acting, the script, pretty much everything with this film is sub par. There isn't really much of a story, and there's no character development. I found myself not interested in what happened to the people in the movie until something happened. Everyone should be in college, but they all look in their thirties, except the woman who plays a mother who seems to push 40. In fact, the worst part of the film is that every single scene is shown in a main shot. There are no changes, no cuts or close-ups. Do yourself a favor and skip it.
