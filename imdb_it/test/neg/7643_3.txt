Sayles had a very interesting film on his hands with Silver City, but somehow he became very confused as he went from start to finish. Chris Cooper did an exceptional job embodying the essence of his character, a sort of Dubya, but he wasn't given enough time on the screen. Instead, we find ourselves on a rampage with a character who feels less personal, less developed and overall too confused. The path that this Danny Huston leads us inevitably becomes the ruin of the film. Too many characters are presented to us in such a short time. These characters were randomly involved with the progression of the plot, which has become too convoluted with every minute that passes. Sayles knew what he was creating, I feel like it wasn't translated well on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Sayles is a master of his trade. His films continue to inspire and evoke thought even if they are not commercial successes. The trouble with Silver City is that I think he found himself too deep with not enough money or time to explain everything. At the beginning of the film, I had an idea of ​​what was happening, but with the introduction of an increasing number of characters, as more and more twists occurred, I lost the sense of the film until the end. While the ending was very clever and very dark, I needed more explanation. I think part of the reason I lost my mind with this film is due to the casting of Danny Huston as our guide. He was pathetic. He didn't look like a very exciting person to guide us in this adventure. He seemed to go through the movements, but in reality he didn't realize much. This was the first fall of Sayles' important film. <br /> <br /> While admitting that the characters played by Richard Dreyfuss, Miguel Ferrer, James Gammon and Daryl Hannah were interesting, I just needed better guidance to help me understand their roles in this political scandal. Danny Huston didn't cut it for me. Outside of the characters, Sayles needed a stronger script. Sometimes I felt that if I wasn't deeply rooted in the political world, some of the references were far beyond my head. The whole reasoning for Silver City was built and the corruption behind it eluded me. I'm a simpleton who loves advanced films, but that didn't make much sense to me. There were several times when I found myself asking "Why" instead of seeing the whole picture. I felt like the individual stories were as clear as glass, yet the whole image was dusty and turbid at the same time. Sayles needed to focus more on the bigger picture instead of these minor problems, which eventually clouded this film. <br /> <br /> Maybe I went into this movie with the wrong idea. I expected to see another version of Primary Colors, but instead I saw something less felt and more technical. Without giving the end, I thought that the final scene was one of the most beautiful moments in the history of political cinema. The brilliant symbolism has remained in my mind for the last two days after seeing this film, while the rest of the film has moved away from my mind. Maybe a second observation would have worked better for me, but for some strange reason Silver City didn't click on me. There seemed to be too many gaps that were never explained or explained. An overall piece is always good to me, but when the characters are introduced without explanation, they simply lose steam. This was one of those rare occasions. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was very upset with this movie. Being very democratic, I wanted to see one side of politics that I wasn't aware of and another side that would have made you laugh. I wanted to be swallowed up by the world of corporate money and the dufus' who are elected. I wanted intelligent humor framed by the words of George W., but instead all I could find was a very confusing story aimed at an audience I will never be a part of. Sad, this photo has had so many wasted promises. <br /> <br /> Vote: ** on *****
