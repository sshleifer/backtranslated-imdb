Physical Evidence is one of those movies that you would like to enjoy, but in reality it should be much better than it actually is. Developed as a sequel to Jagged Edge for Glenn Close and Robert Loggia, it gives the impression that all the participants did it only while they waited for something better to come. The premise is perfectly functional, it is mostly technically efficient if horribly uninspired with the surprisingly pleasant Henry Mancini soundtrack, but you can't help but think that things would have been better if one of the protagonists turned out to be the killer ( as they say it was originally the case). As the opening scene of his little-seen, personally disastrous Heat (1986) showed, Reynolds has all the features of a big bad bad screen. As it is, there are few surprises and an uninspiring movie feeling by number as he builds a head of intertia while moving selflessly towards a no less great will-doing-so? the final. <br /> <br /> Reynolds is fine, navigating the charisma in what is clearly a stellar vehicle. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Theresa Russell. An imposing and fearless actress in the films of her husband Nic Roeg that allows her to penetrate the darker side of human nature, is trapped in a part that requires star quality rather than depth, and does not have enough. He doesn't fluff his jokes or collide with other actors, but that's all that can be said for his incredibly styled and often amateur performance that drops the movie badly. Apart from Ned Beatty's attorney, the supporting cast adds just a slightly surreal presence to a Boston where everyone seems to have a poorly disguised Canadian accent and the streets bear a striking resemblance to Toronto and Montreal. <br /> <br /> Similarly, director Michael Crichton, who has shown in Westworld, Coma and The First Great Train Robbery to be able to support an audience to the limits of their own places, seems to manage the action in a purely superficial way - indeed, in a brief pursuit the shots they give can also be combined and seem thrown together in an almost arbitrary way. The climax itself has no talent and is completely free of threats or dangers, and many scenes are played for much less than they are worth. It is no great surprise that, apart from the unaccredited filming on The 13th Warrior, Crichton has not held it since. <br /> <br /> It's quite watchable in a TV movie from the 80s, even if it's not up to its promise. If this is a sufficient reason to see it, it's just an individual taste.
