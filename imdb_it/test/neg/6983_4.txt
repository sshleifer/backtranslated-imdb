Yes, I know his character should have been a drunk, and he might just have behaved like an idiot. But something tells this critic that Mr. Pleasence was really drinking a lot and was drunk during his scenes in the film. Basically everything he says is confused and often incomprehensible. Or maybe it was just the poor production values ​​... hard to say. <br /> <br /> However, The Race for the Yankee Zephyr is a movie that just doesn't work. This is also a pity, since the film has an exceptional opening and a generally interesting plot. Lately production values ​​are too low and too little action for this New Zealand adventure to deliver the goods. The story is about an American war plane full of gold, money and medals, which crashes into a lake in New Zealand during World War II. The plane is lost for about forty years or so until it somehow flushes itself to the shore and a drunk (Pleasence) literally stumbles upon it. At the beginning he collects all the purple medals of the heart and tries to sell them in the city, getting $ 75 each for them! Little does he know that once he sells them, the local jeweler arrives on the phone and starts trying to trace the information on the plane. Before you can blink, all the attention in the city brings a rich sack of shit (Peppard) and his henchmen and they quickly try to force the old man to give up the position of the plane because they know there is much more to of it compared to medals only. The old drunk's business partner (Wahl) and his daughter (Warren) run to try to claim their fortune before the bad guys can reach it. The resulting action is not as fun as you hope it would be. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty horrible, except for Pleasence. George Peppard tries to do a sort of (in my opinion) Austraian accent, but it's not at all convincing. Lesley Ann Warren is not bad, but Ken Wahl is really bad. He's basically making his best impression of Michael Pare on his worst day. And this is saying something. I hope he made enough money with this film to fix his front teeth that looked a little crooked. I don't remember if he had them straightened when he was in Wiseguy. The rest of the cast are quite lacking in talent. Probably mostly locals who have never done much else. I guess the biggest problems for me were the lack of action for most of the film and the lack of danger. The bad guys are just too cute and stupid to be taken seriously. And honestly, there are no helicopters in the film that look like the ones on the DVD cover. And none of the boats in the film have teeth painted on them. <br /> <br /> The film has its strengths, though. The beginning that begins as a newsreel and becomes part of the story was a nice touch. The Brian May score sounds a bit too similar to that of Mad Max 2, but it included a nice march in which they play for Pleasence in some scenes. It looks just like the Great Escape! There are some sharp helicopter stunts and a big boat chase that apparently killed three stuntmen during filming. The scenery, despite the grainy appearance of the image, is still quite beautiful. The thing you will remember most are Donald Pleasence's drunken antics, though. It was almost enough to save this movie. Almost. 4 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The hound.
