One wonders how FLYNN could have failed so much as a film version in 1997 with Guy Pearce in the lead role. It's not often that the casting of someone so famous is so exactly right. FLYNN was a stumbling block at the box office and it didn't end up on the cinema screens in Australia ... even after CONFIDENTIAL ...! From a glittering nude scene in the first few minutes (presumably from Guy Pearce) FLYNN starts with a fairly robust and interesting start. Unfortunately, FLYNN runs out after about 35 minutes and with the entry of the Steven Berkoff hamburger in a detour to New Guinea, (watching and acting as if he wanted the role of Klaus Kinski in FITZCARRALDO) the film begins to look like a tele movie rather than a great cinematographic biography. Believe it or not, about 70 minutes ago, it's boring and you're glad to see it. But that promise! Pearce IS Flynn! But the film caused a mutiny at the box office and, unlike The Bounty, collapsed without a trace.
