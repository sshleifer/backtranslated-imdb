A depressed and plump teenager does many bad things to a socially active elderly lady who doesn't like to use shadows or curtains in her windows. She follows the assorted things, peeps them, makes phone jokes and plays unpleasant tricks for her. Strangely, he doesn't hide any of this from her. At first, she doesn't seem to care in one way or another that he annoys her. Then later he seems to start respecting him for his cruel and feverish activities. <br /> <br /> There are some illogical elements to note. One is that the boy peeps out at night from a glass plate on the brightest side. Such a thing would not happen in real life. The more illuminated side of a glass plate acts as a mirror. He would be able to see exactly nothing. Also, everyone outside in the night would be able to look at him in his well-lit room. <br /> <br /> Another illogical element is that the unsettling little girl takes a job as a milkman, and her and the only customer every morning seems to be the lady she is collecting. Easy job, if you can get it. <br /> <br /> I saw A SHORT FILM ON LOVE at a public screening. In the end, there wasn't a single eye open in the house. A SHORT FILM ON LOVE is a foreign language film for those who do not like to read subtitles. Not only are there few words spoken in the film, but much of the film is silent. A certain rest in peace.
