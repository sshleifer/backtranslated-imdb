The acting was horrible. The special effects, while exceptional, dominated the film. The writing was pathetic and the dialogue was incredible. And the stupid love story between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck was out of place. <br /> <br /> But the worst attack of "Armageddon" was the total lack of scientific reality. "The asteroid is the size of Texas," says Billy Bob Thornton. Um, it's 800 miles wide! Nobody in NASA sees the asteroid until a midday meteor shower destroys the chaos in New York? Suuuuure. Does NASA hire a drilling team to join the astronauts and train them in a week? Yeah, for sure. Does anyone carry a weapon on the Space Shuttle? Yes, it's realistic. And Bruce Willis detonates the asteroid with three seconds of reserve. Like Disney-esque! <br /> <br /> How bad was this movie? I rooted for the asteroid!
