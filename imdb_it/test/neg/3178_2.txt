There is no Esperanto in this film <br /> <br /> I saw this film specifically because IMDb lists Esperanto as one of the languages ​​used. But IMDb is wrong about the languages ​​used in this film. There is absolutely no Esperanto. It's almost all English with a couple of Navajo words. Don't watch this movie if you're looking for Esperanto movies. Other options are "Idiot's Delight" (with Clark Gable) who has a bit of Esperanto, "Incubus" is all in Esperanto (though completely misrepresented), and there are some street signs in Esperanto in "The Great Dictator" by Charlie Chaplin. There must also have been some Esperanto spoken in "Gattaca", but I've never heard of any. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the other review is right. This film is a complete mess. <br /> <br /> Spend your time elsewhere.
