The digital effects were made cheap and the action sequences lack suspense. This was essentially done for TV and shows. David Suchet looks bored and Nigel Planer looks down embarrassed! and with regards to the London accent of Dick Van Dyke by Robert Carlyle, no comment! If you want to spend an hour or two when you have nothing, then it will. If you are going to buy the DVD, wait a few weeks and get it in the Asda business basket, that's where it is! If the budget was bigger and the book by Richard Doyle was followed more closely, then it could have been something special, but on the whole it is a bit poor. Watch the trailer instead! Or read the book and see what it could have been.
