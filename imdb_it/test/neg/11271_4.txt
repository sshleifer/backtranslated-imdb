Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps the best known, at least in his homeland, for his Japanese gangster films, a series with which this film shares a number of characteristics. Violence and political intrigue are themes in both the Samurai of Shogun and Battles Without Honor and Humanity, and both have a main character who finds his loyalty challenged by betrayals. Both films also feature a large number of characters that seem to have little purpose but die, and since so little is done to develop them, their deaths have little impact when they arrive. This film also has other flaws. The make-up, costumes and sound design are incredibly poor, and the battle scenes were also below standards, lower than other samurai films of previous years (Seven Samurai comes to mind). <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba plays the character of Sonny Chiba in the Samurai of Shogun, the unscrupulous swordsman who crosses the film, frowning menacingly. What a boy; he even gets to wear an eye patch. If you expected to see the legendary Toshiro Mifune, you may be disappointed; his appearance is little more than a cameo, and just when his character seems to be able to do something interesting, he disappears forever. <br /> <br /> Overall, the strengths of the film are its history, which is infinitely more understandable than those gangster films and the challenges posed to the traditional concepts of good and evil. Two brothers are challenging the throne of their late father, who may have had some help during his release. At the beginning, it seems that we will be faced with a couple of characters that could not be more clearly good and bad; after all, the elder brother stutters and has a desire, the sure sign of a villain. In the end, however, it becomes clear that in a struggle for power takes the winner, there are no heroes and villains, only winners and losers.
