By the time the Hellraiser franchise was reaching its fourth film, the premise was a bit exaggerated. Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) is a scientist in the future, who while the prisoner gives his captor the story of how his ancestors (all played by Ramsey) had first built the evil Lament Configuration puzzle that puts evil about the world and how his bloodline had to do with that box. The film is inundated by the lack of continuity towards other films and the lack of coherence in this. Yes, this could be due to a combination of rewrites, massive cuts in the original version of the film or what you have. But I'm reviewing the film as it is, and not what it was or could have been. And now it's a mess. Surely the franchise will go on indefinitely with direct sequels on DVD, but this has been a real cure for its chances of getting a new theatrical release again. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D-
