Yes, stupid is the word for this actress. I know many have mentioned her beauty, but this viewer found her head empty and boring to look at with her bleached hair, lip gloss and not so perfect body. Look at her as she walks away into those jeans, showing a rather large ass. His ass extends beyond his shoulders. What does that tell you? As for the leading man, played by the splendid Mark Humphrey, he was perfectly chosen. A charmer. However, he and Lancaster were not up to par. He was out of place in front of this good boy. Good acting of Susan Glover as a sister. Angela Galuppo had a small role and was in place. But the film's director, Philippe Gagnon, has wasted too many shots on Lancaster. After a while you got tired of looking at her and watching her dull acting ability. And what a bitch he was. Nose up with your husband, being hateful to him and just a spoiled brat. He was happy to see her hit with the dart. I thought it could be his end. But alas, the script tells us otherwise. After having tortured myself and looked at this loser again, the same criticism came to me again. Lancaster is boring to watch. This time around his hair, people. His hair constantly on his face, constantly turning it backwards, became annoying. I question the writer's reason, Alexandra Komisaruk, for which a wealthy and wealthy man like Philippe would take the trouble of a boy like Allison. When there were so many smart, attractive, classy women to choose from. It doesn't take this nothing. Is this the Rochester / Jane Eyre thing? Oh well, it's all a matter of taste, I guess. This Sarah Lancaster is not my cup of tea, folks.
