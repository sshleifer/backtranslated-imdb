This film contains the worst acting of all time. Spilsbury lacks energy to say the least. Energy is what Clayton Moore gave us on the palate. I never once heard in this film that Spilsbury was anxious about something. Revenge, love, justice? Not in this guy's portrait. <br /> <br /> Furthermore there is no chemistry between Tonto and LR. If the plot didn't force them to be friends, you don't get the impression that they want to meet. Furthermore, the sidekick has the most interesting personality. Ewww. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> The narrative is incredibly bad and if you know the Dukes of Hazzard you can imagine how it is. I can't believe the director would agree. He insulted me as a spectator explaining every story I witnessed. <br /> <br /> Hey, at least the horses and locations looked good, maybe that's what happens when you hire a director of photography as your director. <br /> <br /> RATING-2 You might be able to see it for laughs or to show an alien what a bad movie is.
