It seems to be a common thing in the 90s to play with clichés. Some manage to do it with great talent. Hervé Hadmar no. On paper, the film seemed interesting: the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy, dark humor and a very décalé style. The director Hadmar, unfortunately, kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm. Every joke is embarrassing because nobody reacts in the theater. The film is incredibly slow and the actors seem to wonder what the hell they're doing in this ridiculous mascarade. What could have been an amusing and elegant mindless comedy ends up being a cathedral of boredom.
