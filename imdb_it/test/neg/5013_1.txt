This film was on payment channels today and I had nothing to do so I had it. This must be the worst soccer movie ever made. This must be one of the worst movie periods. The premium service on the cable system has a rating system, and they gave 2 stars out of 4. This movie is not even a half star. Bad acting, Scott Bakula sinks as usual, Larry Miller ?? Sinbad could not act if he tried. Rob Schneider's linings are completely stunk. Fred Thompson should be embarrassed by the fact that he was also in this movie. The only thing he saved for this movie was the hope that you would see Kathy Ireland naked in the shower, not even close. A complete waste of time and movies. If we could give a negative number, minus 9.
