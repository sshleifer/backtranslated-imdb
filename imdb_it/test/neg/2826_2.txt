I wrote an essay in 1981, the year I graduated from high school called "the last American virgin". I also had a friend named Nancy who was a prostitute in this movie. apparently her daughter took over my theme one night when she slept in my house. a year later I wake up one morning and see the commercial for this movie. I was 18 and based the essay on the experiences of my life. the film is a little different from my essay, but certainly taken from it. I had no proof of this except my English teacher Mr. Versace who gave me an A on my subject. I let him go and I never did anything. I understand what's going on around. I would still not take action against anyone involved in this film. I just needed to get it off my chest, like I never told anyone, except my best friend and they agreed to keep it a secret. The same year he came out I saw the fantasy in a market, he really had the courage to ask me if I had any good story or script for her to watch. I guess it's all about Hollywood, getting stories from wherever you can. It was interesting to see parts of my life on the big screen though. <br /> <br /> ghost writer!
