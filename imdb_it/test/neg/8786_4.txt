I rented it when it came out on video in 1995. After reviewing it again, my idea about it hasn't changed much. <br /> <br /> I was an adult then and I'm still an adult now! lol <br /> <br /> The illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers didn't bother me. This is not a documentary, it is a fantasy story in which animals can talk! <br /> <br /> Although I didn't care much for the songs, I liked the one at the end of the photo where it is sung by barry manilow and another person. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to make an excuse for his primitive animation saying that CGI was not often used in animations but let's not forget that THE LION KING was released about a year earlier and that maybe it was maybe more excellent than any other animated film that was there before !! <br /> <br /> But I think it's fair enough to say that THE PEBBLE AND THE PINGOIN was made cheaply while THE LION KING wasn''t .... <br /> <br /> The highlights for me of 1995 and today are the suspense generated by the few dangerous (mostly) scenes of underwater pursuits. <br /> <br /> I also liked the opening scene that takes place on a page of musical notes and a bit of the love story. But most of the time, the story dragged on and was boring. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look if you like animation, but if you are an adult and not a risk taker, go get another Walt Disney production instead of This!
