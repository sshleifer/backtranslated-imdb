From late adolescence to the 20s, Stan Laurel was a solo film. During this time, Laurel was certainly not among the highest levels of talent and her humor is not as good as contemporaries like Lloyd or Keaton. However, for the second-tier short comedies, he created a decent niche. As for the quality of the films, they have changed wildly. Some, like DR. PYCKLE AND MR. The PRYDEs were fantastic, while most were of average quality or below average. <br /> <br /> FROZEN HEARTS is a strange film. Like many of the films he made for Hal Roach and distributed by Path√© during this period, the costumes were absolutely first-rate and the film was very beautiful. However, despite this and having the support of James Finlayson, one thing they forgot to include in this film was humor. None of the lines seem to work and the film seems almost a drama, not a comedy. Only really stupid subtitle cards betray the type of film it should be. <br /> <br /> My advice is to try and watch all of his films by Laurel and Hardy and then see solo films. In addition to DR. PYCKLE, try to see THE SOILERS and MUD AND SAND - two of his most tolerable solo shorts.
