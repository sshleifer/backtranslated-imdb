I didn't have high hopes for this. Before seeing it, the story screamed "stereotype". <br /> <br /> I mean ... let's go! It is so stupid the plot of the innocent android that realizes that the people who created it are immoral, then decides to change everything. <br /> <br /> I had to see it three times. The first two times I fell asleep because I was so incredibly bored by it. It is very rare that films bore me so much that I fall asleep during these films. The third time I forced myself to watch it, simply to be able to warn people. <br /> <br /> I had the distinct impression that the people responsible for this mess had tried to take all the good / clean things from other action and scifi films, and put them together to make an action movie! They took the android / robot, lots of action, a thin story, stereotyped characters and a big fight at the end and they launched it together. Unfortunately, the film sucks. The acting is so wooden that you could build a house, the plot / plot is absolutely ridiculous, the work with the camera and the assembly are horrible, the direction is non-existent, and to complete everything, everything is so cliche and ridiculous that only bothered me. <br /> <br /> I still had the feeling that I could spend time looking at this by doing something much more creative, like cutting my nails or watching the grass grow.
