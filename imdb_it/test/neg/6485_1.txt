I bought this "movie" from a service station in the trash bin of 3.99 for a reason: Billy Drago, who is one of my favorite actors. It's terrifying and creepy, but that's where it stops. The film itself is a reckless attempt, terribly scary for a western of horror, and it does not manage either of the two, no matter a successful fusion of the two genres. Acting as well as Drago's is so bad that I wanted to put the sofa cushions on my ears, the production values ​​are non-existent and the script, I don't even know where to start. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs unless you are an avid Dragon fan like me. <br /> <br /> Terrible, shameful, unforgivable.
