Brought to you among others: <br /> <br /> 1- Yigal Carmon (in Hebrew יגאל כרמון) is the president and founder of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) <br /> <br /> Yigal's Career: <br /> <br /> Colonel, Israeli Army Intelligence from 1968 to 1988 Acting Chief and Consultant for Arab Affairs, Civil Administration in Judea and Samaria, 1977-1982 <br /> <br /> 2- Raphael Shore is an Israeli-Canadian writer, producer and rabbi employed full-time by Aish HaTorah. He is the founder of The Clarion Fund, a non-profit organization that seeks to advance the idea that the United States must face a threat from radical Islam. Shore is also a regular critic of media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a cover he claims to be regularly anti-Israeli. (LMAO) <br /> <br /> 3- Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Funny how ADL supports this hateful propaganda. You can never tell by reading their title "Anti-Defamation". <br /> <br /> Use your mind and see how objective these people are. They have their agenda! <br /> <br /> I think, therefore I am.
