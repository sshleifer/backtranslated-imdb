That this adaptation of the Marvel comic has been realized or not? and set aside ?? so his production company could maintain the copyright of the characters, it doesn't change the fact that it's a real garbage. Dr. Doom and (above all) Thing's costumes are surprisingly good, but everything else suffers from a deficit of money or talent. The director Oley Sassone cannot even point a camera at something without including screams like the POV of a blind woman, the dialogue is absolutely dismal, the team's costumes do not fit properly and the effects are scary: the human torch seems drawn on the film with markers, while Mr. Fantastic's powers come to life using a blue wand with a glove at the end. Joseph Culp compensates for having to wear a mask by wildly waving his arms, Jay Underwood is incredibly annoying, the rest of the cast hit various levels of terrible, and while it's hard not to feel sorry for all these guys who thought this movie would get a liberation, it is equally difficult to imagine that any of them believe that it is actually something good.
