Usually, I start my reviews with an explanation of how and why I saw the movie I'm reviewing. With this, I simply can't explain. I needed to wake up early for work the next day, so the last thing I wanted to do was watch a movie I knew nothing about. But something kept me glued to my comfortable futon while I watched this Heather Graham vehicle. Oh that's true. Boredom. <br /> <br /> Graham plays Joline, a bohemian whore who seems more obsessed with her marriage vows than the boy she married (played by Luke Wilson). When her husband decides to leave in search of better things (work, women and screenplays, presumably), Joline starts a fanatical search to find her husband and free him from his "spiritual wheelchair". It seems that he is inventing it but, unfortunately, they are not. Actually, this is little more than an acting exercise for Graham as he gives hard work to this role of Phoebe-from-Friends. Oh and Goran "ER" Visnjic is also in there, for some reason. <br /> <br /> Television programs had a comedy, but I couldn't find a laugh anywhere. I was struck by the fact that this was a personal journey for Lisa Krueger (the director and writer), in the same style as "Girl interrupted", but even that one had more laughter than this. Graham's character is simply too self-centered for the audience to worry about and I feel sorry for the husband he caught while he bravely fought for his freedom from his clearly mental wife. Very little of this film made sense because the characters simply appeared in the story as if they were standing, waiting for Graham to show up as the extras in "The Truman Show". In fact, the only positive note I can produce from my doodles was "Heather Graham - nice baps". And it wasn't because I was too tired to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's very difficult to think of someone to recommend this film to. Graham's purists (a VERY small number of viewers of the film, I think you will agree) will have to commit to watching this trail and perhaps the hippy students who collect American Indian dream hunters will take something from this. I was stunned by the fact that the average rating (at the time of writing) was 5.0 - which would have made this film as good as "Another day" and "Gothika" in my book and simply isn't right. "Committed" is an eccentric bizarre mess of a movie that neither amuses nor illuminates. It's complicated, useless and simply boring for my tastes and probably for yours too. Don't even think about looking at this.
