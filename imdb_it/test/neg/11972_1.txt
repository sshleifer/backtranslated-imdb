My roommate and I have another friend who works in a local Blockbuster video. Find really horrible movies for us and tell us about them. One of these was a "Christmas Horror" movie starring former professional wrestler Bill Goldberg as a murderer Satna Claus. We didn't look at it immediately, but we didn't think there could be anything worse. Apparently, we were wrong. We were shown this film "starring" Ken Shamrock against a killer scarecrow. At first we thought Ken would be the scarecrow killer, and that's why we wanted to see, but he wasn't, and that made the movie even worse. What totally ruined the film was the adolescent drama. If you want to save your brain cells from trying to escape from your head, NEVER LOOK AT THIS MOVIE.
