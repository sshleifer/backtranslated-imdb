This movie is perfect for the most famous zombie lovers. it's a movie you can laugh from acting to terrible zombie action. having said that, I gave this a 4 outta 10 for the effort that horror is a difficult genre to make. going to the bottom of the list the negative points of this film were the following. <br /> <br /> #Bad make up #music and sound #seriously continuity #content of courtesy #a song played through the entire movie #stein couldn 't act and in my opinion one of the worst I saw #terrible ending the #racist moment and stealing the Simpson character called <br /> <br /> the positive points #good costume #police officers seemed to have the best acting exp # the actors with fewer jokes or small roles seemed to be better #good Attempted blood <br /> <br /> I don't want the movie's bad mouth, it's fun to watch for these negative points and I think what makes this movie OK. if it was better I don't think it would have made any difference, but it wouldn't be interesting to see a remake with the same cast, as I believe they have improved over the last 7 years.
