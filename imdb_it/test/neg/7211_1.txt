"Direct-to-video" is a phrase that never seems promising to the consumer unless it is a direct follow-up to the video of something that went directly to the video in the first place. Despite this, the studios have insisted on releasing numerous direct-to-video sequels over the years to cult hits. I don't think it is necessary to mention that these sequels rank among the worst titles of all time, including THE HITCHER II, STARSHIP TROOPERS 2 and CRUEL INTENTIONS 3. It is right that ROAD HOUSE 2 was directed by Scott Ziehl as it was also the man responsible for the ruin of the Cruel Intentions series. Like its entry into the Cruel Intentions trilogy, Ziehl takes elements that made the first ROAD HOUSE a great film, and redoes them without any success. This is not a sequel, this is a remake to the end. Several lines are repeated from the original, the plot points are cut and pasted and the scenes are replicated almost in a snap from the first. The only thing that could not be duplicated was the stupendous fighting scenes, which made ROAD HOUSE what it was. Here, we get clumsily directed combat sequences that are either too short or too long and seemingly planned and shot in an hour. Compare it to the combat scenes of his predecessor that seem to have taken months and months to prepare. Ziehl is able to direct the action as he did well with the 2001 remake of EARTH VS. THE SPIDER, but none of the talents shown here comes out in this mess. It is not entirely his fault, as the script is written very, very badly and awkwardly. I don't care if something goes straight to the video, a good script is still needed. Someone should keep their minds while continuing to churn out these low-budget films, directed on DVD. Skip it all. 1/10
