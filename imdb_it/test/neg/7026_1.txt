In my opinion, the "Mame" version of Lucille Ball is one of the worst performances ever saved in the cinema. After seeing Lucy in her various sitcoms more than an astronomical number of times, I can tell you that I really love Lucy, however, this film is a fiasco of casting, music and incredibly bad dances. Robert Preston is the only thing that saves you with such a small part that you miss it if you blink. I don't know what he was thinking, and I can't imagine how it was recommended by the studio or the director, but actually I watched this awkward performance. I could be really cruel and I would suggest looking at him for a laugh, but it's too painful to even qualify for that. Don't waste your money or your time.
