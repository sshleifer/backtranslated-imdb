This film probably started with a good idea, but it didn't go that far. When I read the cover of Blockbuster I thought it was a promise, but it was based on the general idea of ​​the film. The film started with a professor who talked about how we will see creatures of other dimensions in the future. There was no explanation as to how it could have happened, but I thought it would be developed in the film. It wasn't. In the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with tubes attached to their heads. Next to each are two attractive women. The men start asking "Do you hear this" or "Do you see them?" We conclude that they think they see ghosts or other creatures that seem invisible or that have hallucinations. Women do not see these creatures. This was fine for the first five minutes, BUT THIS SCENE GOES FOR A COMPLETE HOUR. It is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation with the so-called "plot" of the film. We are also introduced to a man with a lab coat and those who look like Middle East terrorists. What is it about? We will never find out. The flashbacks lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab to carry out diabolical experiments on these young people, but we never understand why. At the end of the film, do terrorists eventually do what terrorists do? they blow up the lab, but why? What's the point? We have no idea. This film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there are too many to list them, but one more remarkable is the fact that the man in shirts and the terrorist enter and leave the room throughout the film and not once do the young men try to escape or even leave the tables they are laying on even if they are not tied! The film's creators also bring in cameo appearances of cockroaches on several occasions, but again we never learn what has to do with the plot. Sorry but this movie was a waste of $ 4 and the time spent driving to the rental store and then watching it. Listen to my advice. Don't rent it.
