At least some of the sitcoms coming out of the United States without end are honestly bad. This garbage, however, portrays a side of the "warming of the heart" in a drying horse. To act ridiculously "learned" with the looks and phrases pronounced in fashion "I am so important, thin and beautiful". In the episode where I simply entertained myself, someone's "job" was at risk simply because a colleague had "placed" a call, throwing his skills ... !! Really, this is the lowest of the bass. What kind of damage does this dangle over the sighting masses, seeing only people who are sparkling from the glam who parade around the "work". Completely sick creation. When the titles rolled, I thought, oh well, he provided jobs for the boys. You know who you are.
