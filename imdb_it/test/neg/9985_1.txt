I found the movie in my local video store and was surprised to see it on DVD. I had heard about explicit sexual scenes, gruesome violence and the infamous debauchery. I sat and looked and started laughing! The decorations of the whole and the artistic direction were cheap and fake; nudity was sardonic and incredibly intoxicating; the story was poorly written and it was just a show of incredibly beautiful and talented actors held hostage to quote the worst dialogue ever written! The incestuous relationship between Caligula (Malcolm McDowell) and his beautiful sister Drusilla (Theresa Ann Savoy, a vulnerable beauty) can't be taken seriously ... it's not even shocking or repulsive! Peter O'Toole and John Geilgud were obviously held hostage during the making of this film, fortunately they die in the first thirty minutes of the film. Cinematography was a joke and I was even more amused when they used a Bible quote! Marco's book no less. If you are looking for a shock value, this movie will disappoint you. If you are looking for the cult value of the field, you will be even more disappointed. I know I was. I saw shocking and this is two hours of your life that you will never have back.
