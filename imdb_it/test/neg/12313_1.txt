Well, I guess I know the answer to this question. For money! We have been so bombarded with advertising and Cat In The Hat products that we almost believe there should be something good about this film. I admit, I thought the trailers were ugly, but I still had to give it a chance. Well, I should have followed my instincts. It was a complete piece of Hollywood trash. Again demonstrating that the average person can be programmed to believe that everything they say is good, must be good. Apart from the insulting fact that the film only lasts 80 minutes, obviously it started with a moth-eaten script. It's full of failed attempts at senseless humor and terrible pastel scenarios. Jump across the universe without destination or direction. This is then compounded with, ............................ yes, I'll say it, BAD! I couldn't help but think that I was watching "Coffee Talk" on SNL whenever Mike Myers opened his mouth. Did the Cat want to be a middle-aged Jewish woman? Even Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were not a prize, but Mr. Myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he is ready to make another Austin Powers movie. F-, without stars, 0 on a scale of 1 to 10. Save your money!
