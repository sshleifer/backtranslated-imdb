Set in the Philippines, Lethal Panther 2 is a sad martial arts action movie of the early 1990s that sees a reckless cop kick out the evil criminals who killed his wife. A rather inexpensive production with almost no artistic merit, this film is based on the quality and quantity of its action. But while there are plenty of fistfights, gunfights and explosions, the quality is not right there. The endless battles are hopelessly devoid of originality or excitement, with little editing and trivial direction that make this film a real task to sit on. <br /> <br /> The usual Yukari Oshima is totally wasted, with his natural athletic ability obscured by some excruciating bad copy. The ballistic action scenes are an insignificant mixture of slow-motion heroism that flies through the air while shooting, crazy vehicle stunts and endless villains that line up to shoot. <br /> <br /> so many best examples of the "girls and guns" genre now available on DVD, I suggest you leave this alone (unless, like me, you can bear almost any old garbage to be a completist).
