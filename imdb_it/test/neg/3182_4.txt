I rented this movie because I like watching things with Lauren Graham in them. Well, she was the best part. All the others seemed completely separated from the photo. You kept looking around at those watching the movie while you go, what? However, he provided some clarity, since he was the only normal character in the picture, who really isn't saying much for the film. Personally it was too far-fetched for me. However, I am happy to have rented it, although I never wanted to own it. I still feel that Lauren Graham proved to be a strong actress and she even thought that she wasn't the main character, she seemed to have stolen the film. My husband and I were happier and we cared more about his character who ended up with the character of Josh than we were on the two main characters.
