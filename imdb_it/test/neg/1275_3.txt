Maybe I didn't understand correctly. I mean the movie. It doesn't make me happy or whatever I should do. Perhaps because of my mood. However this is a simple family film with children for actors. Admit that - all films of that type cannot overcome the 4 out of 10 barrier, no matter who will play the film (for example, Antonio Banderas was playing in that kind of film ... two or three of them can't remember the exact count). I got bored. I almost fell asleep because the subject is so obvious and the actor's game was so predictable. But I'm sure my son will love this movie when he grows up ... Hey, I'm not a monster, I found some hilarious or good moments in the movie. The film's owls were incredibly cute. The trick with the windows of the police car and the blows the child received on his head from a golf ball ...
