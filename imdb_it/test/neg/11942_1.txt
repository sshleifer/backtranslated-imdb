I remember years ago that Michael Douglas wanted his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, to be in a romantic movie because he felt his wife had all the assets. No doubt he does, but NOT in this movie. A colossal waste of time, no history, no character development, no chemistry, nada. This was not the vehicle we all hoped that this film would be boring and a HUGE disappointment. I didn't even watch the whole movie, torture. Catherine Zeta-Jones was obviously trained to work in the kitchen, to move, to present a dish but this was not the food web, nothing was learned here and once her counterpart appeared, presumably a romantic interest, where chemistry was . The poor wretch on the second floor of her building who tries all the tricks to connect and no development of characters there. The loss of his sister was misinterpreted as if he knew there was a closeness. The sister's daughter was simply thrown here and there with something that had to pull you in, NOT. Just a waste of time for the cinema. The promoters have certainly done their job to put this film without clarity on all the networks that tempt you with all kinds of teasers. I'm sorry to say, don't spend a penny.
