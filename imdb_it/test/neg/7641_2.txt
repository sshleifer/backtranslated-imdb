... All I have left is a small choice, but the employment at least once during my Respiro review. By the way, what defines the claim is in my opinion a lack of emotional sincerity on the part of the author. Breath seems made with an intent all artificial and conscious of being artistic, symbolic, spiritual, provocative, metaphorical ... mythical, even. But fortunately for all the true artists out there, there is no formula designed to achieve artistic beauty and depth. Splendid natural locations (yes, these remote parts of Southern Italy seem exotic even for most other Italians), cute actors and some funny, gritty, spontaneous performances by a handful of attractive children won't raise a film without interludes beyond of a beautiful series of images. Yet this insincere and vain film, and in the end empty, lends itself to being art, succeeding only to a very limited extent, perhaps in some cases by chance. I admit that the conceptually pompous ending has some visual poetry. However, I believe this was achieved in a way that had more to do with the beauty of the Lampedusa sea and the strong symbolic power of bathing and water (linking it to what is mythical, mystical, religious, archetypal, etc. .) with the talent of Crialese. <br /> <br /> Valeria Golino is captivating and histrionic in her interpretation of Grazia. For a mentally unstable woman of humble and provincial, she certainly has a fashionable wardrobe. His flattering and fluttering floral dresses and attractive sun-kissed beach hair could have embellished the pages of any Vogue summer edition. The fact that she was a "fool" in a sense could only be a fashion addition to her appearance and her fashion trend - that's how her skin "condition" seemed to me to be deep. Golino's two-dimensional stereotype of the innocent and natural woman-child misunderstood and oppressed by his backward community was tiring and irritating for the worse, while leaving me impassive and indifferent at best. I agree with the London reviewer who wrote that mental illness is very badly served by the cinema - throughout the film we never had the feeling of Grace's illness and we have no idea what's wrong with her (apart from his being a tiring stereotype of a "free spirit"). We don't know why he gave injections and are asked to see a specialist in Milan. This generic way of writing mental illness is one of the main telltale signs of the general superficiality of the film. <br /> <br /> Another rather offensive aspect of Respiro is the quaternity of its position. I struggled to understand if this film should have been set in the present or in the past, as it aimed to make even a clearly backward part of Italy (by comparison) a dozen times thinner and more conveniently primitive than it actually was is. Again, this smacks of superficiality and a complete lack of sincerity on Crialese's part. Some non-Italian viewers will gloat happily the picturesque backwardness, the clich√© of the possessive and macho Italian man as if it were a commonplace, so acute they will be to continue to see my country as a culturally stranded individual in the 50s (the question I would like to asking David Ferguson, the Dallas, Texas auditor, is the following: is your country's mentality blocked in the 1950s? No? OK, then why should I be? Unfortunately for those who still want to see Italy so anachronistically, that aspect of Respiro is actually ridiculous and fake even in the eyes of this Italian spectator. The subtly incestuous tension between Grazia and her eldest son was as boring and predictable as Fabrizio Bentivoglio's sexist-lover-husband routine. In particular, I hated the scene where Grace joined her husband and male friend in a man-to-man joke about a bottle of beer due to her husband's embarrassment and displeasure. According to this film, it is not the place of a woman to take part in a man's conversations. Ah, but our "lovable" "free spirit" is too good for this place and does not include the oppressive and unwritten rules of the Lampedusa patriarchate! Not only does this scene represent something so fake, it should be enough on its own to discredit the credibility of the entire film. Furthermore, he completely gets the wrong part of the culture stick he strives to represent, clearly demonstrating that it was written without a clear understanding of the position or its population. I would like to challenge anyone who knows contemporary Italy to say the opposite. <br /> <br /> For a truly accomplished contemporary Italian filmmaker, one who I think deserves to be included among the greats of the glorious Italian cinematic past (which alas, isn is the shadow of his ex self!), don't look besides Gianni Amelio - in particular Lamerica, Thus they laughed and his last, The Star That Is Not There. Unlike most of the contemporary Italian cinema, sadly derived and stagnant, Amelio is a fresh and independent voice. Despite my pungent review of Respiro, I am now more than willing to believe that the latest Nuovomondo by Crialese, which now appears in Italian cinemas, is worth it. Therefore, I can't wait to enjoy it, even if it won't be too upsetting for me if I don't (considering my feelings for Respiro!).
