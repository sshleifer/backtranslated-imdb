The series does not start because it means going forward. Although it is the first two seasons that are full of incredibly mediocre episodes, as well as numerous episodes, then the rhythm rises and one of the best space works was born. The first episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation is noteworthy for two things: they are extremely entertaining introductions of all the main cast and the particular accent of Marina Sirtis that would later disappear. Seeing how it all started is very satisfying, and I saw the rest of the series in mind, actually quite moving. Otherwise it is a very mediocre episode with Q and some giant jellyfish. Quite right.
