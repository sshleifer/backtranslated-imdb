I imagine this is in the public domain as its release on DVD. First of all, this is a good propaganda film to show to an Australian audience in time of war, so it is not to be considered a serious revisitation of Tobruk. The first half up to 3/4 is set in Australia, I believe that many American war movies in which recruits are reuniting, oh man is really long. Then we come to Africa and Tobruk, pretty bad things, low budget. The battle scenes on the DVD copy I saw were almost completely black. See if it is necessary, but be prepared to use fast forwarding because I doubt you can take it after a few minutes. I really liked the bungled "Battle of El Alamien" in Italian, even Richard Burton made a theatrical African war movie that was good "The Desert Rats", this movie is just a vintage piece and should have stayed in that period, does not hold up well today (I doubt it was much appreciated even then). I say the same thing about my counter-productive American war movies so don't take them personally Aussies (I love Australia, I've been there twice!).
