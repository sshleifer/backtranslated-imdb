OK, it's watchable if you're sick in bed or you have nothing else to do. However, the suspension of disbelief required to overcome this film is significant. Firstly, in today's modern society do you believe that university doctors can engage in someone in a short space of time even if you are a "virtuous" Habitat volunteer who likes autistic children? And the 2-week novel blossoms in an exchange of letters that leads to John's "conflict" on re-enlisting immediately after 9/11/1 ... REALLY? He asks her what to do? Every guy we know would NOT have been sitting on the sidelines after those towers had fallen (my husband was one of them and I love him and I'm proud of him for it). John's character is so flat. It's almost expressionless for the whole movie. He is good-looking but not Spec Ops ... he seems insecure, not sure, calm instead of a hellish raiser, without tattoos, he enters a "fight" with the preppy boys that is nothing but a really outstanding match .. he walks around without a cover on his head almost the whole movie ... and there are military technical flaws everywhere (epaulet upside down?). The war scenes are stupid ... John and another boy go alone ... eh ?, then another guy is shot and John drags him 10 feet and starts helping his mates before making sure area or back-up arrival or even having your back against the cover ... it's a gunfight for God's sake, you don't have to stop fighting until it's finished ... heck, I wanted to shoot to John behind. Back home, when the truth is revealed and she spills the wine ... we hate her for removing the shirt in her presence ... WTH? break his heart and then tease it adultery? It is a real trollop. The best part of the film is when he turns away from her ... at least he had a little respect and honor. In general, the story is incredible and generally we didn't care about these characters or their love. Dismal!
