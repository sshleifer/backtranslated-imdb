Oh dear, oh dear! What were they thinking? Terrible script, terrible acting. I don't even mind for the actors ... they brought their checks to the bank and smiled happily. <br /> <br /> Since when did an air well from Charing Cross come to the bank? Why do vehicles crossing Tower Bridge go to the city when the impact hit? Why is Tower Bridge not crowded when the city is evacuated? How does Carlyle dive into a rushing stream ... and survive? I could go on ... and go. <br /> <br /> There is no real sense of urgency in the control room. They could also expect England's eleven to return to the field after the tea break in Lords. <br /> <br /> It says something when I wait for advertisements to learn more about treating diarrhea with anxious waiting. <br /> <br /> Totally abominable basket!
