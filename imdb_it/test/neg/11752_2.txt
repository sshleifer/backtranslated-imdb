I know the original Psycho was a classic and redoing was a mistake, especially a shot-by-shot remake. I think this was more or less proven by the rest of the comments here. But there is much more wrong with this film than this. <br /> <br /> The first problem is color. The original film was shot in black and white but, what few realize, the original was shot after the color film was invented. The choice of the black and white film was partly a budget problem, but it was also a stylistic choice by Hitchcock. Now, this does not mean that the remake should have been redone in black and white, but the colors of this film are all too wrong. The most predominant colors in the film are orange and green, particularly on Marion who should not be a flashy character. Bright colors make it look like a happy movie and, when horrible events take place in these color combinations, it looks more like a cartoon than anything else and the audience is inclined to laugh rather than scream. <br /> <br /> the second problem is lighting. This is a dark story that should be highlighted by poor lighting, but this remake seemed not only to fail in this, but seemed to go in the OPPOSITE direction. Most of the scenes are very bright, even at times when it is illogical to do so because it is at NIGHT! <br /> <br /> Another obvious problem is Vince Vaughn's performance. Yes, Norman Bate's embarrassment and madness does quite well, I don't deny it. But there is an element in the character that he failed to show: softness. There should be some deceptive friendship with the character, at least at the beginning, which then vanishes when we realize the truth about him. Besides being a character trait of Norman Bates, this is a recognized character trait of ALL PSYCHOPATHS !!!! <br /> <br /> There are some positive aspects to this film. Some of the performances are great. As I said, Vince Vaughn came very close to bringing out a decent portrait of Norman Bates. Viggo Mortensen and Juliane Moore were fantastic together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original, which was a positive change. Anne Heche may have been atrocious but, unlike Janet Leigh who was falsely advertised as one of the film's biggest stars, Anne Heche received the last bill in the opening credits. <br /> <br /> I read on the cover of a copy of the novel Psycho that Gus Van Sant claimed it was not a remake of Hitchcock's film, but rather a new adaptation of the original novel. Now I wish I had bought that book and saved the comment because, after watching this movie, that comment is probably the funniest thing I've ever seen. There has been no attempt in this film to mask the fact that it was a rip off of the original, and it would be much more believable if Van Sant had tried to tell us that he was indeed a three-ton monkey from the planet Zafroomulax. So many shots were copied exactly without any real thought as to why Hitchcock had composed the original shot that way. Like the scene where Sam and Lila are talking while their faces are entirely covered in shadows. Hitchcock covered the faces of these shadowy actors because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so that no one could see their horrible performances, not because of any artistic or stylistic purpose. <br /> <br /> In other words, my review is as useless as the movie itself as it replicates something that has already been said. Like everyone else here, I advise you not to waste time on this film and get the original.
