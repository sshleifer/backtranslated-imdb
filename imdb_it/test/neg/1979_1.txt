Final Fantasy: Advent Children is and will remain a classic example of style on substance gone wrong. Instead of tapping into the memorable characters and captivating mythology of the original game, Square Enix produced a frivolous montage of incomprehensible battle scenes. Yes, I said "incomprehensible". Did you know that Tifa knows incredibly fast Kung Fu techniques that magically cause the camera angle to shift every second? Can that cloud easily hang in midair for a full minute while wildly whizzing with its 2-ton sword? English dubbing is mediocre. Although it is not seriously negative, it is far from well produced. The quality is comparable to that of a normal anime anime. <br /> <br /> Here's what I'd like to say to FFVII fans who can't stop getting excited about this movie: Advent Children is the best fan service you could have hoped for from Square Enix, but also a fleeting film in CG like the Galerians: Rion had a better story. You will be embarrassed by this film and its lack of thought in due time. The days of its novelty are numbered. <br /> <br /> Films like Advent Children make me doubt whether Square Enix recognizes the potential of its franchises. After all (and without offense), it is a Japanese company. Japanese developers can offer fun games, but most of their offers are disappointingly superficial. They are real psychopaths, however, when it comes to the quality of production. Advent Children presents some of the most breathtaking renderings in the history of the CG, but this does not save him from his intricate plot and cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> Every fan who has followed this film knows that Sephiroth returns. Folding the story to accommodate his resurrection was a big mistake. <br /> <br /> NOTE: The only point I give to this "movie" is in honor of the 10,000 enslaved Japanese animators who gave their lives to make any blond hair bleached on Cloud's effeminate Caucasian head.
