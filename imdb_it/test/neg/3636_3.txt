The only time when really laughing while watching this show is when I'm playing with it. Jamie Lynn Spears only got the acting job because of her older sister, and I don't think anyone could argue with me about this. There is no expression on his face EVER (even when he smiles) - watch the show and see what I mean. Now let's talk about the show. Zoey 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows I've ever seen! As many people have already said, Zoey Brooks is absolutely perfect: everyone loves her, is a heterosexual student, and all the boys think she is "sexy". PCA is a boarding school full of rich children that offers all its students flat-screen TVs and laptops, serving sushi for kids from the sushi bar. In one of the most recent episodes, Zoey is completely in the dark and thinks that Chase is not in love with her, and acts as if she doesn't even want Chase to love her. Then, when he stumbles into Chase's dorm room to prove his friends are wrong, he finds Chase kissing this girl named Rebecca. Zoey, of course, is out of her mind, probably because she likes Chase's attention. Anyway, just watch this show if you have nothing else to do and the only thing on television is Zoey 101. You can at least have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is!
