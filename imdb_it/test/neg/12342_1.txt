This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Unless you are in masochism, never see it. It was an unbearably long, useless, offensive, depressing film and will forever be the best on my list of bad movies. Anyone who has written this film is a sadist. I almost cried at the end, that's how bad it was. I'd like to give it zero stars, but since it's not an option, I give one.
