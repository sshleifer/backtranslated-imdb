There is a point in the film where the female head of the "death machines" (a multiethnic trio to please everyone, to be inclusive I think it's called these days) talks about the use of leverage on a businessman. Except that is his delivery that sounds like "leatherage". At that point this spectator perked up thinking that this boring film was turning a corner into a new world of evil. But it was not so. The chief woman had to speak while the "death machines" did not say a single word throughout the film and talk about her. Interminably. There is action in the film but it is not so exciting and the plot staggers from one clich√© to another. The three mute "death machines" live to survive another day at the end of the film. I hope there hasn't been a sequel.
