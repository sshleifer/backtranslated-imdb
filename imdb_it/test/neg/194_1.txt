This film is an insult to the game on which it is based. Claude's character has been deformed beyond recognition, leaving a painful performance that does not even vaguely resemble the original plot. Shame, shame, shame They also cut a good number of the original score of the change in the context in which the songs are sung. This distorts the air of the film and causes the viewer who is aware of how this should be to wince while the writer of this script gives Hud a wife, turns Sheila into a rich spoiled girl, characterizes Claude as a cowboy, and kills Burger by sending him to Vietnam instead. If one is not familiar with the original plot, I assure you that this is not a bad movie to watch, but if you ever want to see the original or are, as I am, a passionate fan of the classic game, you'd better avoid it altogether the film. One must really stick to one or the other.
