True, nobody really expects anything from the sequels. But even for this low level this is a terrible film. <br /> <br /> Essentially an anthology film, this fourth installment of the Hellraiser saga tries to be a story of origins and a final of the whole series on the same level. time. An ambitious idea. But none of the cast members are given enough time on the screen to do anything with their characters, and first-time director Yagher left the film rather than surrender to the studio. The result is a steaming pile of mediocrity that even fans have difficulty defending themselves. Unless you're a fan of "Alan Smithee", avoid this.
