This is one of those movies that you watch because it's bad. A film like that that you only watch to see that it's shitty work. Presumably a horror, I can't imagine how anyone might be afraid of a claymation bug, especially one that is translucent in nature where you can see the actor's legs behind it. <br /> <br /> Even without a budget, a little attention to detail and even an attempt to make this film credible would have sucked the fun, because they would have to replace all the actors and the whole story with it. If I had nothing to joke while playing, I would have stopped it after 10 minutes, and I would have worn some quality shows like Spunge Bob Square Pants (HAR HAR HAR). <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that Brett Piper take Quintin Terrantino and really pump faeces. <br /> <br /> :)
