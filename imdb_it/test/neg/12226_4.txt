In 2002, when Matthew Lawrence did The Hot Chick, I saw Drumline that day too. Drumline wins by default! If the Comebcaks were released in March (as expected) at the same time TMNT was released, TMNT would have won by default! <br /> <br /> Granted, Matthew Lawrence did a great job playing a quarterback. He didn't have to resort to uttering bad words which is an advantage. But when he started playing with his private parts and other football players and touching a girl's breasts, those were the disadvantages. <br /> <br /> But the biggest drawback that struck me is that every football player took part in the fake music video, with the exception of Matthew Lawrence (insert The Losing Horns of The Price Is Right)! Another musical opportunity blown for him, just because he is shy in making music. <br /> <br /> In the past, Matt disappointed me many times (Super Human Samurai Syber Squad) where he came so close to having a musical moment, but ended up failing. <br /> <br /> Sure, Joey had a singing career with two albums on the belt and Andrew started a musical career of his own. But it is very rare to find a musical moment in Matt. The two stand out on Brotherly Love, where he played guitar and sang "Pigeon On Your Car" (Art Atrack), which he wrote about, and that romantic moment of Boy Meets World when he sang "This Dame". weather). <br /> <br /> Matt, you've played too long. Why not make a musical comeback. You have a beautiful voice and I miss your musical side.
