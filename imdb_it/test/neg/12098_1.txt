This is one of the worst anime series I've ever seen. When I saw the review of the manga in a magazine, I thought it might be interesting, but when I got the chapters I realized it was a complete stupidity. <br /> <br /> OK, the first 2 or 3 chapters are OK, and the series has a standard. But as the plot progresses, it becomes totally inconsistent. The series tries to show some mystics based on Christian mythologies, but it is a total stupidity. Presents some demons and scenes of stigmata ... Absurdly absurd. It seems that the series tries to seem profoundly thought, complex or mythologically revisited, but an observer with a bit of brain and cultural references, he will soon realize that all those elements used do not have a real meaning: THEY ONLY PUT THEM TO IMPRINT THE WATNERS IGNORANT !! <br /> <br /> The final chapters are full of elements totally meaningless: battles with cat-eared demons, references to a supposed struggle between demons and demons that control time (for no apparent reason). The ending is totally meaningless; an ignorant observer will see on it a fluctuating ending that gives them a place to meditate; but the truth is this: THE COMPLETE AND COMPLETE SERIES IS AN ABSOLUTE TOTAL INCONGRUENT SENSE.
