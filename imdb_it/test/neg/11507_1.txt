OMG what Disney has been doing lately .. most of their new shows really suck. Zach and Cody's suite life is pretty good, but other shows like Cory at home, Wizards of Waverly Place suck and are unsightly. <br /> <br /> Of course Sadie is just beyond the stupid and the silent. It's about a teenager named Sadie who loves science and grows and lives her everyday life. There are her friends Margaret and Rain and her old and boring brother Hal. We are all boring and stupid. Especially Margaret who thinks she's the most popular girl at school and thinks she's so beautiful ... it's just beyond terrible. I hate all the seasons of this show, it's just terrible in every way (the first season was better though). <br /> <br /> If you appreciate your life, you wouldn't look at this shit, its painful and stupid
