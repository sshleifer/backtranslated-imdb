The 80's Cheesy horror co-star of the favs genre Ken Foree and Rosalind Cash with Brenda Bakke are some of the protagonists of this story of a haunted spa. Pippo's dialogue and some unpleasant effects of violence make this film watchable. Not bad, but nothing exceptional. <br /> <br /> Recommended for bad dialogue and acting. Only fans of the films B. <br /> <br /> B
