**** Possible Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> If you were making a serious film involving a powerful but elderly father with three apparently ungrateful daughters, with top-level actors, with great cinematography and beautiful setting of the Midwest, now where would you like to go? Because, you would like to create a modern tragedy after "King Lear", of course. <br /> <br /> Here's what I expected. This certainly was not what I got. What I got was 105 minutes of feminist tripe - a long plea about man's inhumanity to women. Because, there wasn't a decent male in the whole story. <br /> <br /> You soon see where this film could be directed, but you can't believe that anyone would waste all these good actors and artisans on this banal scenario: you just want them to get along with the King Lear theme. But it never happens; and there is the real tragedy if you ask me. <br /> <br /> In addition to the panorama of the glorious rural heart, the only thing worth seeing in this film was the wonderful chameleon, British actor Colin Firth, who practiced his Midwestern accent. Now there was a gift. <br /> <br /> 3/10
