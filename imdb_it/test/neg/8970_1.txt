I will never, ever, ever forget to see this show around the age of 13. Even at a young age I remember thinking: "This is a Baywatch show without the only thing that makes Baywatch tolerable, girls in bathing suits." Nevertheless I was too young in those days to be the remote control holder in my house. The highest point of Pacific Blue was an episode in which a couple of gangsters pulled out are about to hit someone with submachine guns ... by bike !!! At thirteen I never laughed so much about something that needed to be taken seriously. I also knew that the task of going out and acquiring Uzis (for murder) is a task that should never come before borrowing someone's car for the day. That was the decisive moment of this show. Simple crimes and tailor-made situations made by hack writing so that they can be treated by the unsung hero of the crime world The Bike Cop. It doesn't get much dumber.
