I'm not surprised this movie went well at the Hamptons Film Festival. It is a superficial film that is good for superficial people. Two actors pretending to be actors in a relationship who fight and look for a lost dog. The film is exploring the dynamics of the relationship, however, the relationship is too small to merit such an exploration. This couple has a dimension: it fights, teases, then makes love and fights again. A brief moment of tenderness does not reveal any possible reason why these two would be involved with one another, given their poisonous and unstable relationship. Beautifully shot, excellent score, but with nothing of merit in the script or in the characters, this short is just that.
