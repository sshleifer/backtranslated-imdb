This is a film that was probably made to entertain the middle school, the children of early high school age. Maybe it's fun for them, maybe they could even see something scary. For me, the acting is poor, and the plot is scarce, there is really not much value for the adult spectator. I saw this film as weak and boring. Sometimes there was the possibility that the film could become interesting but it never materialized. The creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds, they don't seem to have any substance other than the look. Sometimes I wasn't sure if the film was trying to make another comedy attempt or just another horror attempt that failed again. This film was not good for me.
