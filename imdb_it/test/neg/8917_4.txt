Today You Die was the 4th Seagal film in a mini marathon that I just held. Wow, I don't know where to start. It seems that he murmurs his lines more and more over time, and the scenes between Seagal and Treach, where they seem to improvise, are embarrassing. And what did his girlfriend's dreams have to do with anything else in the plot? I can't recommend it to anyone except the toughest Seagal fan, and even then you'll be better off with his previous job. Of the 4 films in my marathon (Sommersi, Into the Sun, Foreigner and Today You Die) today was the worst. A previous reviewer mentioned this, but the use of archive material was fairly obvious.
