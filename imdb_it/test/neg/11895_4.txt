I saw it last night at the Tribeca Film Fest and god it was bad .. From the script to the editing to the acting to the cinematography - none of this worked. Not to mention the design / costume sets were so absently absent-minded for the period of time (which covers the years from the late 70s to 2006 or so). Even John Hurt, who is usually an extraordinary actor, was so exaggerated and ridiculous. Of course, Quinten Crisp is an exaggerated type to begin with, but Hurt has not been given anything to work on here. I don't know much else to say except the audience I saw with absolutely loved .. so maybe it's just me. But the public loves everything in film festivals when they are sitting next to the director and all the actors. It is not a very accurate test of how good the film is or how well it will play. Personally, I thought this movie was terrible. On the other hand, it was so terrible that it was fun. Get drunk and give it a shot when it's on HBO in 2 years, if it's ever that far.
