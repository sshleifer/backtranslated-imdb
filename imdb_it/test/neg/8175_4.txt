In a year in which "Singin 'in the Rain" and "High Noon" were published, this stuffed turkey somehow won the Oscar for best film. Half of the film is nothing but circus shows. The other half is the soap opera and melodrama. Heston and Wilde both move, although they are models of moderation with respect to the annoying Hutton. As an egocentric trapeze artist, Hutton behaves like an exaggerated high school student in a poorly produced school play. Grahame is the only cast member to give a decent performance. DeMille has no interest in telling a good story, just by creating a show that is too long, no matter how boring.
