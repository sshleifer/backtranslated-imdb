The film begins in the spring of 2001. A soldier by the name of John Tyree (Channing Tatum) falls in love with college student Savannah Cutis (Amanda Seyfried) while she is on break. In two weeks they fall madly in love with each other (!). But he has to go to war and she has to go to college. They do but keep in touch by writing to each other. Then it happens on 11 September. He wants to reenlist - he wants him to stay home. What will they do? <br /> <br /> Hysterical evil romantic drama. The protagonists ARE attractive: Tatum is certainly a handsome man with beautiful green eyes and a warm body (he showed himself walking bare-chested out of the water after surfing) ... but he can't act. Seyfried is a beautiful woman and she tries ... but the dialogue here is horrible. When I saw it my friend and I were fighting hard to not laugh out loud in some of the "romantic" dialogues in the beginning. It was simply HORRIBLE. For the first time I was bored by the ridiculously predictable drama or amused by the horrendous "love story". Then, after that first hour, the tragedy arrives and, I must admit, I made myself cry. However the filmmakers do everything to make sure you cry with death, funerals and meetings with people who burst into tears. How can you NOT cry? This would have worked if the acting was better. Tatum's face never changes expression - not ONCE! He always had an empty expression. Seyfried was a little better but not much. To make matters worse, Tatum and Seyfried had no sexual problems on the screen at all! They barely seemed to like each other and love each other. There was a beautiful photo of the Carolinas but this is a boring and stupid romantic "drama". A 1 all the way ... and I usually love romantic and silly dramas like this!
