The filmmakers did everything to find ONLY the following demographic data: Palestinians who appear to be peace-loving, seeking solutions, Palestinians (especially elderly women and families with children) who are particularly disturbed by security fence, and Israelis who do not believe in the security fence, heavily sympathize with its alleged effect on the Palestinians, and consider it a useless division and / or a waste of money. Oh yes, they let a member of the Israeli government who supports the fence, but do what they can to portray him as inhuman and indifferent, and ask him very important questions that are really statements (for example "The wall is bad for the environment. .. it's destroying everything "). <br /> <br /> I have no problem with (well, most) of what is presented in the film. Although they may disagree with the people interviewed, their opinions are valid enough for a documentary. HOWEVER: there are at least two sides of the Israeli security barrier issue, and despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of Israelis (and many others) support the construction of the fence and believe that it is having an overall positive influence, this "documentary" "does not present the opinion of even one of these people. They go as far as interviewing an Israeli Jew who claims that" all Israelis support the wall "and that they are so crazy, and then stubbornly refuse to interview even one of these Israeli "crazy" Oh, and finally, they set the tone for the film by interviewing a couple of young Israeli children (really exceptions to the rule - I've been there) who are laughing at their Arab neighbors on the other side of the world. <br /> <br /> A "documentary" is a film that explores a problem and presents a full range of facts, opinions and perspectives. Unfortunately, this is not a documentary. it is a no-frills PROPAGANDA FILM that, very clearly, offers very punctually a support battery for only one side of a very disputed, emotionally and politically charged problem. It is no longer a documentary of, for example, Fahrenheit 9/11.
