story of moralism about a high school boy who is practically the stereotypical nerd. He is intelligent, but has no friends, no social skills and a lazy loser of a father who borrows money from HIM. A pretty girl hits him (he should have known he wanted something - he should have been smart, right?). She manipulates the poor desperate madman by writing his paper on Shakespeare, which the teacher knows immediately that he couldn't write. He loses the girl (not that he ever really does) of the trust of his teacher and his university scholarship, all at once. <br /> <br /> Marv is so foolish and desperate for love that he decides to rob some heroin traffickers who are running stuff through the warehouse where he works. Then maybe the scruffy little bitch will be impressed and want to marry him. Sad, really sad. Marv is such a pathetic drug (and rather mindless, for a seemingly intelligent boy.) I mean, trying to rob drug dealers? Has this kid freed himself?) That you stop feeling sorry for him and you get the horrible desire to kick his ass instead. <br /> <br /> The girl obviously tells her boyfriend about the robbery Marv boasted about her, and talks to him and his cronies about stealing money from Marv and the company. They try to do it, and in the process they can shoot several people. The cops show up at the same time, and the idiot Marv is dragged away, a total disgrace forever. I know this thing was meant to make kids behave by showing them the consequences of misconduct, but all they really illustrated were the consequences of stupid behavior. Which is the premature end of your film career, of course. Goodbye, Marv, we never really knew you. And thank God for that.
