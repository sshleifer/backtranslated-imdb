I have to watch bullshit all the way to see if there are any redeemable qualities to justify inclusion in my clients' video stores. Don't watch this, not even a minute, unless someone has a gun to their head. You, like me, will moan and moan at least 500 times and pray that one of the one-dimensional characters, all played by really bad actors, will turn and kill you. <br /> <br /> Even if you're the biggest Sandra Bullock fan in the world, it's not even worth watching the two or three short scenes in which it appears. <br /> <br /> I want to kick the butt of squalid marketing people who put Sandra in a huge picture on the face of this DVD box and have them thrown in jail for attacking me or something. I would really like to have the chance to read a review of this film before buying it. <br /> <br /> Please call me and I will pay you $ 10 to immediately remove this film from my inventory before it smells all over the place! (I'm kidding - please don't call)
