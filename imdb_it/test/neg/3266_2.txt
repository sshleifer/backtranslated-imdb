Caddyshack Two is a good movie on its own, but compared to the original it cannot accumulate. Robert Stack is a horrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while the funny can't compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is fun, being the only character in the original. Most of the other characters in the film do not have the original punch (for example Henry Wilcoxon) except for the hysterical and funny lawyer Peter Blunt, played by Randy Quaid. Every line that says reminds me of the humor of the originals, especially the scene in his office (I don't go for lawsuits or motions ... I find out where you live and come to your house and take down the door with a ** * baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale, maybe roast that golden retriever (arff arff arff) then eat it. And then I come upstairs junior, and I'm taking you from your brothers brothers pjs, your brand new BMW! comprehension?). However, compensating for his small role, Dan Acroyd, who obviously doesn't replace Bill Murray. His voice is beyond irritation and everything he does is not even funny, it's just stupid. Overall, Caddyshack II is a good movie, but compared to the fantastic original it can't be cut.
