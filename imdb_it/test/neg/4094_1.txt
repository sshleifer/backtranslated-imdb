I hated this movie. In a nutshell, this film is so ugly that I almost don't want to take it any longer to look at it and never mention it again. But on the other hand, I can't resist a good shot. And if there is one thing that Evan Almighty does for the public it is that it brings out the best criticisms. <br /> <br /> The film (sequel to the much more entertaining Bruce Almighty) begins by reintroducing the audience on Evan Baxter, a simple support to the best character in the original film. Quite right. This film does not show Jim Carrey or Jennifer Anisten. Not even a small cameo. You know your movie is bad when the guy who agreed to do Ace Venture: When Nature Calls won't even have a short walk-on role. But somehow they manage to keep Morgan Freeman as God. While I was sitting in the almost empty theater, bored by my mind due to the lack of comedy, I couldn't help but wonder how much money it took to protect Freeman for this movie. Then it hit me an hour ago. It's just a throw-away role that takes up all 20 minutes of the 100 minute movie. God appears between the scenes to tell Evan to build the ark. I know Morgan Freeman won't be watching this movie in a year and thinks it's as good as his roles in The Shawshank Redemption and Million Dollar Baby but it's easy money. <br /> <br /> Where was I? Oh yes, the plot. Sometimes it's so hard to stay focused on the plot when you realize that you've given more thought to thinking about the plot than the scriptwriter did. However Evan (Steve Carell) apparently left his job as an anchorman for a job as a Congressman. Yes ... without transition in between. He never addresses his wife and says "I think I want to be a member of Congress". It only happens in the first five minutes and you are forced to face the great transition. As a member of Congress, he must collaborate on a bill proposed by John Goodman's character when suddenly God seems to tell Evan to build an ark. No "Hey, how's it going? How's the weather?" little. Only "I want you to build an ark". Evidence of bad writing: Evan determines that God is giving him clues to build an ark after noticing a fan raising a sign that says Genesis 6:14 when he passes by his son who is watching a televised baseball game. <br /> <br /> This is basically the plot of Evan Almighty. There are some random support cast members who do their best in creating comedies, but they don't do it very well because they don't get virtually any time on screen. It's just your basic run of the mill family to build an ark film. Oh, there is also that obligatory scene in which a father must cancel his hiking plans with his children and his wife because he is dedicated to work. They go away disappointed but they understand, as it happened to all the other times in the film. Once I would like to see the boy turn to his father and kick him in the chin and tell him "You are a real bastard for having canceled your plans with us. There is also that drama you would expect from his father with his family when they realize (the wife, actually ... the three children have no problem helping dad build an ark) that has gone mad and claims that God wants him to build a big boat, but don't worry, his family decides to stay with him. Oops, I just ruined the drama. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this film is that there is almost no good comedy going on, I know the decision was made to consider this film like a PC to get a bigger reaction than the crowd, but I don't think I'm in the minority when I think family humor is more than just a kick of crapping men and animals, maybe I'm wrong and that's what it is quality family humor , Please take me other adult comedies, so I will not have to go through this shit (no pun intended). <br /> <br /> The finish is extra. All of a sudden the film takes a dramatic turn in CGI that makes me shudder to think about how terrible a waste of CGI is. I bet it was too expensive. Finally, after all that waiting, we are told why God wanted Evan to build an ark. And boy oh boy I hated why. I will spare the details but it was like watching or reading a mystery of murder and making the killer turn out to be the person who walked behind the main character for a second and had no lines. <br /> <br /> Oh and then there's a nice touch at the end. The song "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" plays the credits and we are then subjected to the "dance" of the cast. I don't understand They spend 100 minutes without success making a comedy and then wrapping it up with a thriller. I swear I wasn't so scared of watching Steve Carell dance from ... well, never. You have people there. Evan Almighty is the scariest movie of all time. <br /> <br /> All in all I thought it was a wasted experience. I'm baffled by all the talented actors (Carell, Freeman and Goodman) who appear at this dark party with Lauren Graham, the Gilmore Girls woman who has yet to prove she can act out of a paper bag. But above all, I am surprised by my willpower to sit throughout the film without going out. <br /> <br /> Rating: * out of ****
