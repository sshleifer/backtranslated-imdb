It seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of his time hiding in the shadow of his rather successful brother who appears in really bad movies. Joe spends most of his time walking around dressed in black and looking rather moody. He takes orders from an angel of death with a swollen face, which you could recognize as the swelling of Tango & Cash and as the cyborg from the Future War. Well, Joe and Puffy have a job to do and involve some souls of some children in a big machine driven by a stupid galloot who interrogates the Led Zeppelins. Well, the car crashes and the chase is on. The lucky kids who escape Joe look like Tonya Harding and Rick Springfield. They are chased around the city, breaking things and Tonya is stunned by her mother as she strips for the bathroom. The action ends in a hospital where we learn that paradise is an elevator ride. Eventually, some green lights flash, Joe screams and Puffy fades without a trace. I wish I could say the same for this movie. Look at the relative safety of the MST.
