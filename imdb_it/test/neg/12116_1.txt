TV Award Shows that half of the time it is looking for nominations, Comic Relief, chat shows, show quizzes, game shows, charity shows, Brighton. Just when you're at your end and you think you can find salvation in the wireless good flattering twitt of good old JR Hits you like a freight train that never stops from Texas to central New York that has lost an hour and is trying to recover . <br /> <br /> About this show (FNWJR). <br /> <br /> It's a normal chat show format with JR As host and a house band that is composed of four gays (ha ha ha, ow my aching hips.) and the first season had Andy Davis, but if he left or was fired to make way for Ross's Ego. <br /> <br /> Ross will use his guests more like props and you really don't hear them speak because of his "My ball and I'll take it home" attitude, you also see that the bigger the 'guest, the more he is willing to lie and suck, to get in with the big ones (like the weak child in school who hangs around with the bully). <br /> <br /> However, when a small reality star arrives, it will reassure them happily, asking personal questions about the past and telling them of their lack of stories to get laughter. Sometimes he will underestimate the popularity of a guest, he will say something to belittle them and then, when the audience acts foolishly, it will turn quickly and start to take the self-timer, the best example of this was when "Life On Mars" played John Simm he approached and said that someone like you has a job, your appearance OK but not Hollywood of good looks (Bare in the mind of Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry was in the green room, he was just trying to suck it before they were even on the couch ). When the audience behaved in a disconcerting way, Ross quickly said "What, I'm a little light to wear that corset, I don't know what I'm saying." If he does not have a low form of television life, he will simply probe the four homosexuals of the piano with older beats than his fashion. <br /> <br /> His story is very different when a Hollywood A-lister or a big TV star arrives on the show, he will tell them stories to humor them. When an actor explains he is in a support band, Jonathon Ross will say something like "Wow, well, if I ever go to see a band, I would try to get interested in the support band, to make them feel like they were wanted" with a message from underline "please like me, I was probably one of the people who cheered you up when you were in your band". Complete it all with an audience of Ross fans so attached to all the old jokes and bulls, but it's really a bad show. <br /> <br /> You are better off watching chat shows in the United States, but they are more scripted but not anywhere near as difficult to watch.
