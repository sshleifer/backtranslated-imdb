Geesh, I never ever thought of writing the four previous words. But, in reality, she is the highlight of this little movie. <br /> <br /> Given that the film was made when I rented it, it is supposed to be a comedy about a girl who is kidnapped but does not have her medication, which keeps her stable. It seemed like a nice concept. For years, all we saw of Spelling was like Donna Martin in 90210 and an endless parade of boring and lifeless TV movies. It seemed like a chance for her to stretch a bit, and considering that with her television success and her rich dad, she couldn't have any financial reason to make this movie, I thought she would take the part because this must be a low budget error. <br /> <br /> Wrong. <br /> <br /> Instead, the Spelling part is small, and the part about the mentally unbalanced kidnapping victim is just one of many plots. When it's not on the screen, the film creeps so badly that I could have sworn it was longer than the 85 minutes that were listed on the tape. This would have worked much better if the Spelling storyline had dominated, and had been turned into a romantic comedy with her and Phil, the less annoying kidnapper.
