This film is so bad that it's unbelievable. Even for a low budget independent film ... it's just, well, it sucks. I can't even believe that even Troma would have put out such crap. I've been a fan of some Troma movies for years (Toxic Avenger, Squeeze Play, Rockabilly Vampire to name a few). But LLoyd, come on, goes far beyond the boundaries of every taste. Presents some of the worst imaginable recitations. I think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who could have been just as good ... oh, wait, that's what they did. I mean, these characters have a negative charisma. With a little luck, the producer and director of this film will have a huge karmic debt because of this atrocity. Like the special effects people. But beyond the terrible acting and the horrendous special effects, the dialogue is absolutely traumatic for the ears. The script is full of holes the size of Alaska and there are serious problems with continuity. The worst part, however, is that it's not funny even in the smallest way. And this is the most unforgivable sin in the film making. But don't take my word for it. Now go out and waste four dollars on it. Don't say I didn't warn you.
