Horrendous! I'm a teenager and I don't care about teenage movies, but it's horrible! Aaron Carter plays this pop star named JD McQueen and to keep his grades high or something, he works with the "nerd", Jane whatever the nickname. But the "bad girls" are too predictable and such that the clothing that most girls wear in the film is not realistic. How would one of those girls not wear a bra, a tube top and a belly shirt? TO THE SUPERIORS? At my school, we would be sent home for something like this. <br /> <br /> And a part of the movie in which JD writes Jane, says "Do you sleep well? You must think I'm an idiot! I didn't know that sending messages was so stressful!" How is the SMS stressful? how obsessed Jane is with JD and how he "falls in love" with her is very stupid. The dialogue is mischievous and stupid, the acting is terrible, the music is quite pleasant and the plot is scarce or non-existent. <br /> <br /> For tweeny-boppers who still love Aaron Carter, you'll like it If you're a casual observer like me, this is NOT the movie for you
