This "Smile" is a reversed example of those good intentions that pave the way to hell. It is not to be confused with the bad parody of Michael Ritchie of 1975. <br /> <br /> The film is parallel to two stories: an impoverished Chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise a deformed orphan named Ling (Yi Ding), and a TV-generated Malibu family reads "Gidget Get Birth Control". Katie (Mika Booram, Olsen's third twin) plays a high school student, spoiled and self-absorbed, detached from reality. His teacher (Sean Astin) paves the way for a school trip to China to show students how to work with deformed children. <br /> <br /> The film uses deformity as a means of suspense by treating Ling as the Frankenstein monster. Kramer continuously masks its deformity through hats, hoods and camera positioning. This approach takes advantage of the extravagant quality of the show inherent in the material. She may be uncomfortable with the way society sees her and Kramer's answer is to cover her up to the great revelation. Why bother your audience with such unpleasantness? We see her face briefly at the end and only a few minutes before closing, her postoperative credit snapshots reveal a swan under the hazelnut. It is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live; the imperative is that Ling is just as warm and popular as Katie. <br /> <br /> Funding for the film came from a trust founded by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. They imagined a wealth of quality family films. Give me "Son of Paleface" every day.
