I must admit that I was deceived by the title and the summary on the back of the box. So I opened it in the VCR and kept waiting ... and waiting ... and waiting for something nice to happen. Of course, he never does. The creators of this film should be tied to a chair and show "Save Private Ryan". Maybe they would learn something.
