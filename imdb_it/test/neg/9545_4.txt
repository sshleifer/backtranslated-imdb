I'm the only person who thinks that the entire Forensics and Scenes Of Crime community in the United States should detest this all-powerful slap on their faces. A policeman is the first at a crime scene where his backup is so slow to respond that he has time to send the child who found the body in the local shop to buy a disposable camera. When she returns (still no senior policeman, SOCO or other assistance for the beautiful Jolie - this is New York, isn't it?) It started to rain and she sets to work photographing the tests, only after she got up in walk in front of an Amtrak to stop disturbing the scene. <br /> <br /> I want to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zoom distorted the images !! The horror continues: - not in the film itself (rather ordinary I fear) but in the character of Lincoln Rhyme played by Mr. Washington. This man is a highly specialized forensic scene researcher with years of experience who, instead of the trained but invisible local Crime Scene Examiners, entrusts the work to an inexperienced policeman, a newbie cop, who proceeds to find the clearly placed clues move them before photographing them, so as to contaminate every object and make it virtually impossible to trace DNA. This was a brilliant idea eh? I know you should be able to suspend disbelief, but those who say this film is smart must have completely disengaged their ability to think to find this credible movie. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 4/10 for the superb acting of Denzel Washington and for Miss Jolie's lips which are the only objects that require my disbelief to be suspended!
