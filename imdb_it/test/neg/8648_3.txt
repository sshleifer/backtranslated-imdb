A special unit of four police officers is dispensing justice in their own unique way in Los Angeles in the 1950s. Nick Nolte plays Max Hoover, the unit's chief officer and his partners are played by Michael Madsen, Chazz Palminteri and Chris Penn. The protagonists are also Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly and John Malkovich. Pretty impressive list of names. Unfortunately this is the only thing even remotely awesome about this movie. <br /> <br /> Our story begins when the young Allison Pond, played by Connelly, is killed in a remote area of ​​the city currently under development. Our four-detective band is called and it is immediately apparent that Nolte's Max Hoover will take a very personal interest in this case. We will soon discover that Allison, in addition to knowing Hoover fairly well, has also been involved in some fairly important military and government types that may have had reason to want her dead. But who exactly was involved and why exactly would they have wanted this apparently harmless woman to have died? Hoover and the crew decided to find out. It sounds like an interesting premise but unfortunately it doesn't go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Despite the impressive variety of names, acting leaves much to be desired. Nolte is shaking, Madsen looks incredibly bored, Palminteri and Malkovich come out as caricatures, Penn has almost nothing to do and Griffith is as boring as can be. By far the best performance is Connelly in all flashbacks too fleeting. The dialogue in the film is forced and in wood. The sense of the drama that one would expect from such a mystery is completely lacking. Nothing dramatic really happens. In reality, nothing seems to happen for most of the picture. Instead, we are moving towards a rather ridiculous and incredibly disappointing climax. When the "mystery" is solved, you could find yourself saying "Oh, come on now, is that all there is?" But it gets worse because after the mystery has been solved, we get a completely ridiculous and absolutely incredible action sequence. And even then we are forced to suffer further when in the end another terrible, poorly managed, completely useless scene ends. And then luckily it's over. And not a moment too soon.
