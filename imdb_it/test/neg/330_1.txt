Friend, this movie sucked. There seemed to be seven different plots going on and they didn't make much sense. The special effects, costumes and all that stuff were beyond all limits. The acting was particularly negative. Everything seemed so forced, especially the woman's jokes with huge eyes and the small child (her "Noooooo" while being burried is so unenthusiastic that it's ridiculous). A good part of this film is still quite funny. The death of the woman in which she sticks a knife in a toaster is burnt out and magically becomes the most bloody skeleton mannequin in the world, while my friends and I laugh for a good ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: If you're watching really horrible movies, search this out. If not, run for your life.
