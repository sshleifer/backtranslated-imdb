The first 4 episodes of season 6 are just to vomit, predictable and the worst scenario I've seen. I will not and hopefully will not buy it. Also seen in the previous seasons those space episodes they did, they suck even more. All I want to say to the people who do it is: don't make a whole episode about space, because they suck. The point is that season 6 sucks even more than the previous seasons. It gets worse from season to season. I was so disappointed and frustrated watching the first 4 episodes of season 6 that I just had to write this. Only people who wash their brains can watch this shit. It seems that the people who write the scenario have been losing ideas for a long time. Do you think my 2-year-old nephew had a better idea of ​​the episode than these people do.
