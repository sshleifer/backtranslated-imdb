First of all, I'm a horror fan. But this production of "Tobe Hooper" (come on, the Texas Chainsaw man and the original Poltergeist !!) was below standards, even for a fan. The acting was not bad at all, some characters were incredible, but the protagonists were OK. History was something we have already seen hundreds of times, without tricks or anything like that. Never exciting or intense, and don't count on special effects other than splashes of blood. The scary children of zombies are pale faces with dark eyes and that's it ... It may have worked in the early 1970s, but not now. Director J.S. Cardone has not done a good job in maintaining the suspense, halfway there is the risk that you fall asleep. My vote is based mainly on the main acting, but this could easily have been called Children Of The Corn 8: From the Corn Fields to the Mines ... Just say ...
