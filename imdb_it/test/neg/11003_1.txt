This film is terrible - honestly. The acting is terrible, the script made me shudder, the effects are completely bad (which I usually don't mind for older films, but this was done only two years ago), and it bothers me. Some friends go out to Halloween in the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son. Of course, before I have the clich√© "Do you really believe it? Ha ha ha, it's just a story" routine dragged on for a while. The witch's cannibal son was delayed (I don't know if it was for the comedy or to make it disturbing, but this film failed in both). It has a minimum of gore and no nudity, which has made the negative film even worse. Heck, the only good thing about this movie is the lego-eating scene, and even that could be better. <br /> <br /> Honestly, don't even waste your time looking at it on the cable, and certainly don't do it considering buying or renting this, otherwise you'll kick yourself for wasting time that could be spent doing something more constructive or of entertainment.
