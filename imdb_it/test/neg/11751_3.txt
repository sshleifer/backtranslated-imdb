Well, I have to agree with the critics on this, that everyone said "let it go". Because they had to do this re-creation of the 1960's "Psycho", I don't know. My hypothesis is that they wanted to reach a new audience and the color and modern actors were the answer, since those were the main changes. The dialogue was the same and the story was the same. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I applaud them for not having done it with bad words and nudity and to make it an unpleasant film. Still, if they were going to keep everything the same, why worry when you wouldn't have improved Tony Perkins, Janet Leigh and the original cast? <br /> <br /> Did they honestly think that Vince Vaughn was going to be good or better than Perkins? Are you kidding? Will Ann Heche, with her short men's haircut, be better than Leigh? I don't think so! <br /> <br /> Yes, the colors were nice here, but it's black and white photography that helped make the 1960 version so scary. It's perfect for the story, not a bunch of greens and pinks! Once again, I imagine the filmmakers rely on an audience that has never seen the original. <br /> <br /> This was just a stupid project that should never have taken off.
