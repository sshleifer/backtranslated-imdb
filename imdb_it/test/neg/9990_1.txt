I saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends. His reputation had preceded him, and although all my friends also had legal age, only I had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it. We gathered in a house where the parents had left the city for the weekend. Although we sat in close proximity to each other, we didn't talk or recognize each other otherwise. As it turned out, the film deserved both and did not deserve the anticipatory shame we felt. He did not disappoint in terms of pure free content, but is disappointed in any other way. <br /> <br /> Caligula attempts to transcend genres by combining a historical epic with a cheeky porn movie. He fails miserably in his ambition, subjecting the public to the worst of both worlds. The evident strength of the film is its pornographic aspect, and in fact it provides much more than its share of real sex and graphics. But in staging this sex in the context of the depraved Caligula kingdom, it ennobles the act even less than the average adult film. Sex without context could be at least physically pleasing to the consenting adults involved, but pleasure and perhaps even consent are largely absent from the world of Caligula. In it, sex at best serves as an idle pastime and at worst as an instrument of sadistic domination. Nowadays, it is quite common to hear words like "sin" and "depravity" used in a playful way to describe acts that are enjoyable but considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives. Caligula takes the viewer beyond the business by describing the true depravity and demonstrating that neither joy nor pleasure comes from it. <br /> <br /> Historical portions not only fail to contextualize sex significantly, they fail to entertain, enlighten, intrigue or in any way affect the viewer. They only provide long stretches of incessant boredom. A film has rarely been so boring. Sex, after the initial shock and bewilderment, vanishes, contributing only to the general monotony of the image. <br /> <br /> Discussions about this film rarely involve its violence. While many more violent films have been made by Caligula, few can compete in terms of the shock value of his violence. Apparently, inexorable barbarism and depraved sexuality described the emperor of Caligula. Violence is even less for the faint of heart than for sex. <br /> <br /> A review like this will probably arouse the same curiosity as those. I understand why someone would like to see this movie; after all, I myself succumbed to the same curiosity. I simply hope that my review, by clearly describing its lack of redeeming value, can at least give potential viewers the knowledge they need to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not. My high school criminal justice teacher described police work as "hours of boredom punctuated by moments of pure terror". This statement perfectly describes Caligula. You have been warned.
