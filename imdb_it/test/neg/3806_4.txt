A drama starring Pat O'Brien as a washed-out journalist who shows up at his former boss's house to ask for money to finance his son's operation, only to find him dead on the floor. Since O'Brien knows the identity of the culprit, he offers to take the rap in exchange for the money he needs. A decent premise is wasted in a film that pretends to surprise, twists, even if in reality it is not. The shows are all along the line, the film dresses like a hard American noir, but the mix of shady accents doesn't work, and the story is not at all compelling. And it contains perhaps the least attractive screen kiss of all time.
