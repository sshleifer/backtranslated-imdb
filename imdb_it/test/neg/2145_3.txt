His significant charisma and his imposing presence are all that keeps him afloat, but Fred Williamson has made far better urban action films, including many of his latest films, published with the vid.

The clumsy action, the little violence and the evaluation of PG are not at all questionable. It's worth taking a look at the Hammer completers anyway.
