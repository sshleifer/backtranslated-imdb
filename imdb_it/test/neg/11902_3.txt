This is a bad movie, since its central message is very confusing and the plot seems to be the result of the union of several disparate scripts. As a result, it often makes absolutely no sense and certainly not a movie that Miss Dunne or Mr. Huston should have been proud to do. However, it is worth watching the movie if you are a fan of "Pre-Code" films because it presents an incredibly bleak storyline that strongly tells that nice DO girls emit - even if they are not married and even if their partner is !! <br /> <br /> The film begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker assisting troops in Europe for the First World War. In the process, he meets a climber (Bruce Cabot) who eventually convinces her to sleep with him. She gets pregnant and then moves on to the next unsuspecting woman. However, Miss Dunne does NOT want it back, since she realizes that it is not worth it, but later her baby dies at the birth of a child. While all these controversial plot elements are used, they are always mentioned - almost as they wanted the adults of the public to know, but they hoped that if they expressed it or filmed it in the right way, the children of the audience would be clueless (after all, the movies are not been evaluated and children could attend any movie right now). <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the whole plot involving a stillborn baby and Cabot ends about 1/4 of the way through the film and is never mentioned or mentioned again. It was as if they were filming part of a movie and leaving it - sticking it to another movie. In this second phase of the film, Miss Dunne unexpectedly starts working in a women's prison (although in reality we never really see her doing anything). What we see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate. And, as a result of all this violence, Miss Dunne takes a crusade to clean up the prison and become a famous reformer and writer. <br /> <br /> But then, out of the blue, another type of film emerges and women's prison reform activity goes the way. Dunne meets a judge (Walter Huston) who is married, but desperately wants her. Throughout the film, Dunne is portrayed as a good girl, even though she had unmarried sex with Cabot (she was more or less deceived). But now, the single Irene, who is a tireless reformer and good lady, starts sleeping with a married man. He tells her that he and his wife are separated and married only by name, but she never thinks to investigate if this is true, and with her safety, she takes off her clothes and they are in the business world! MA, while pregnant with her love, is accused of being a crooked judge. He assures her that he is innocent, but he is doomed and surely sounds like a scoundrel - using insider information from people who came before his bench to make a fortune. Then, in the last moments of the film, Miss Dunne tries in vain to get him released and swears to wait with the baby until Huston is released. The film then ends. <br /> <br /> So, we basically have three separate films and a bizarre idea from the early 1930s of what a pretty girl should look like. I understand that you should be a strong-minded working girl who immediately becomes an idiot in her personal relationships! This really ruins all the good sides of Dunne's character and it's really hard to imagine that someone likes the movie. A strong defender of women's rights could easily be offended by the way she was weak and needy and religious people could view her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect! With a fair rewrite, this could have been a good movie or at least as interesting as an obscene and salacious film, but he couldn't decide what he wanted to be and it was just another boring Pre-Code movie.
