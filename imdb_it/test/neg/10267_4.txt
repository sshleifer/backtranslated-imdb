When the word "presents" creeps into a title, preceded by a famous name, the work can usually be immediately eliminated. For some reason, people who are able to create good art don't seem to be able to see it in others. However, I have always been willing to try the second part of the Demon trilogy. First of all, the soundtracks are absolutely to die for. Most American filmmakers would have sacrificed small animals to align the kind of talent on the soundtrack of Demons 2. For another, well, two words: Asia Argento. (Obviously, he was eleven years old when this film was made, and a number of years away from his apparent decision that would shape his acting after Helen Mirren: fluffy eyes and small clothes.) Furthermore, Lamberto Bava comes from one of the Le best Italian dynasties in that horror subtype known as Giallo (he is the son of Mario Bava, who could have invented the genre in the sixties). And the original Demons are absolutely not to be missed for fans of horror films of the 1980s. So how bad can it be, right? Good, bad. The demons continue their assault on the Italian media, as the film opens in a modern Italian skyscraper where many people who live their lives have their televisions in the background. They are all looking at a kind of news / video combination of some types of investigative journalists trying to get proof of the events of the first movie (which would seem to put the time frame of this no more than a few days after the first movie). Through the usual inability of the horror film to concentrate, journalists manage to bring a demon back to life, and come across the TV screen to restart the plague. <br /> <br /> Yes. It's so bad. The only good thing that can be said about the film is that the soundtrack (when you're not teased by characters like The Smiths, The Cult, Gene Loves Jezebel, etc.) is amazing. It comes from the keyboard of Simon Boswell, who started his career as a member of the Silver Dynasty and has since continued to make films like Lord of Illusions and Hackers. <br /> <br /> Makes a half decent free rental if you're going to drink a lot, but it's certainly not anywhere near the fun of the original. Cronenberg's incredibly fun thrill is a thrill that makes you shiver, Shivers (aka They Came From Within), is much better.
