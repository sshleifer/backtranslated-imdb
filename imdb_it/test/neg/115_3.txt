I watched this film for the first time in the mid / late 80s, when I was a child. We could not reach it all the way. The dialogue, the acting, all that concerned him went beyond disgust. <br /> <br /> Here are some examples ... imagine these dramatically real dialogues, too explicit: "Oreegon? Are you going to Oreegon?" Why would anyone want to go to Oreegon? "<br /> <br />" survivalist? No one has ever told us about any survivalist! "<br /> <br /> This movie was so bad, my sister and I rented again for her 16th birthday party, just so our friends could sit around and laugh at how awful it was. I don't think we were able to finish it then!
