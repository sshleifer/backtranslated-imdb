May or may not contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> Inuyasha is not a good anime. It is actually very overrated. Why? There is absolutely no plot, plot, and the show drags on ... and on ... and on ... This is because there are more secondary stories and fills than episodes that advance the plot. And the fillers are just the same stories that repeat themselves ad infinitum. The same episodes seem to go with the same plot: Kagome senses a fragment of a jewel, a thing of a worm / mud / tentacle demon opens, Inuyasha says "Wind-Scar", "Iron Reaver Soul Stealer", etc. And it kills the demon, they get the jewel fragment, and then we repeat this scene 160 or more times. <br /> <br /> In addition to repeating episodes, there is the repetition of comic devices, and they are no longer fun. Wait, they never were. Sexual harassment is NOT fun. Viz rated the Older Teens series, 16+. I have no idea why they evaluated it. There is nothing wrong with it except for the so-called amusing sexual harassment, which is rather allusive and which could get you arrested these days. <br /> <br /> Now, this is how we know that Inuyasha is overrated. Video games. They all sucked. Especially the Mask game. I played it at my friends' house. It was nothing interesting. The game was slow, boring and had Nintendo 64 graphics. In a magazine, it got a score of 4/10, saying "... this role-playing game is slower than the milkshake that goes on a cocktail straw." Then, there are all these stupid Inuyasha toys, action figures, figurines, stickers and coloring books. COLORING BOOKS! We thought Inuyasha was 16! Maybe not ... But after being a member of the Inuyasha groups on MSN, about half the people there were from 10 to 13. I guess Inuyasha is a small film for children. (I think only a little editing done at this show could be shown on Toonami.) There are over 40 manga volumes. I can only help but I wonder how many kilometers of forest have been cut to make them. Sad ... <br /> <br /> Then there's the music. The music is so annoying. We hear the same 5 songs each episode. After 10 episodes, the music becomes really annoying. In other souls, they have music that fits the mood and we don't hear many songs very often. There are about 15 different Inuyasha soundtracks. Don't waste your money on that garbage! <br /> <br /> And how do you think you know all this? Because I was a fan of Inuyasha. I'm ashamed of myself. I'd rather watch Kim Possible or Pokemon instead. Unfortunately, these two shows have more romance among the two main protagonists that Inuyasha will ever have ...
