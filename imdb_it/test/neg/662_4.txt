I had no idea that this film was produced by "WWE". Wrestling is pretty lame. Why did they have to dirty their name further by making a film as disgusting as this? I found a complete disappointment. If I had known that this movie would have been so stupid, I would have stayed at home and done something more fun. Of course, I will give them credit for the fantastic effects; but the killer didn't look as scary as it could have been. He lacked a certain number of things. But I'll let you point them out yourself. The plot was a great idea, it could have been done in a much better way. Perhaps in the future, WWE will stick to its fight for morality and stay out of the film industry ...
