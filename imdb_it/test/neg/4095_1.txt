"A comedy of biblical proportions!" Those hyperbole masters, the film's tag-line writers, back on it; the 2003 sequel to Bruce Almighty just raises a chuckle. The only thing that raises my interest in this film over total indifference is its Christian dogmatic nuances. Sorry, express the nuances. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrel, ignoring Jim Carrey's common sense of refusing retaliation, plays Evan Baxter, Bruce Almighty's news reporter, who has just been elected to the congress. With a new life in Virginia and the stress of moving into a house the size of the Acropolis, the pressure of all the changes has repercussions on his family. His wife (Lauren Graham), evidently flying from Stepford, and three children (Jimmy Bennett, Graham Phillips and Johnny Simmons), who do a rigged job of looking sad to a piano accompanist, pray for the family to get close and almost out of guilt, so does Evan. <br /> <br /> In what must be the biggest shock of all time, God (Morgan Freeman) shows himself in reality, but it makes everything annoying 'working in mysterious ways' around the place telling Evan to build a Noah-esquire ark in preparation for a big flood instead of giving him a pool table or an X-box or something. And in the style of a true divinity of divinity, he also forces Evan to grow his beard, his long hair and wear shabby and shabby clothes. Now, in the past, I'm sure razors were hard to find, so the beard was somehow inevitable for Noah, but I'm pretty sure it had nothing to do with spirituality. The same with the clothes; massive construction work is certainly made even more difficult by such impractical clothing. Couldn't God have conjured up a pair of steel spiked boots and a hard hat for the poor boy? Apparently not. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase Bill Hicks, I find the idea that God somehow embarrasses us, and so does Evan who fights him every step of the way. And who wouldn't? God essentially fires him, drives out loved ones, makes him laugh and at some point really threatens him. Of course God is right, and the man of a rational family, who works hard and is doing well on his own, is forced to eat a large slice of moist and sweet-and-sour cake. It's almost like being left alone by God, Evan had to tolerate and humor him. What kind of message is that? <br /> <br /> Evan Almighty has a very commendable environmental point of view, with the basic theme that the federal government is blind to the damage done to the world around us. It is also the first film ever to offset carbon dioxide emissions and this should certainly be considered a fundamental achievement of a Hollywood studio. Were it not for the banal, condescending flag of American Christianity that flew above it, Evan Almighty could have been a harmless family film, with a laudable environmental record. But with his confused religious dogma and his implacable message of "blind faith", he is considered one of the most repugnant films of all time.
