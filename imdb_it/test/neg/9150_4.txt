Yes, it's true that it was Jessica Alba who led me to this film, because without her I should never have taken it. <br /> <br /> But I find it long, boring and, above all, not original. All together, I thought the story was full of clich√©s and the direction was very boring. So it was a surprise to see that the director and the writer are the same person. I acknowledge that I remember to avoid all his upcoming films. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because all the good things were at hand: Malaysia is a beautiful jungle, it was the British Empire and the cast is wonderful: Jessica knows how to open her soul and for once, he found an appropriate film for this. Bob Hoskins shows great experience and should have won a prize for this role. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing is that it makes me open a map of the world to locate this island because if you think South Asia happens, you don't know exactly where! Ah, the little plane flying with red lines in the Indiana Jones movie !!!
