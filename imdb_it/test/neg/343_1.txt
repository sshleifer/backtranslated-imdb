It's an OK movie if it would be done by high school kids for their friends. It is much lower than the limits to be called "professional". There is no plot, there is no play of the actors and the visual aspect is as if I saw it through the plastic film. I was so happy to have the FF button on my remote, 32x worked really well. I understand that everyone should start somewhere, but it should not be a reason to bring it to the public. If you have doubts about quality and budget, "Open water" was made for $ 60,000 and more than half went to the boy who provided security in the ocean and trained sharks. And that movie looks 100 times more professional and was an event in the independent film.
