Why did the Italians make the best films in the 50s and 60s, and then during the 70s and 80s, they did nothing but zombie and cannibal movies? Probably because art films have not made money. , The Cannibal Movie, unlike the Zombie Movie, which was created by the Americans and "exploited" by the Italians, is a purely Italian creation, designed as a showcase for exploiting the world, and to make as much money as possible (no artistic integrity upon entering in the way here). Eaten Alive arrived during the golden age of the Cannibal film. The director, Umberto Lenzi, had not yet touched his pace; his genre classic, Cannibal Ferox, was still a year away. <br /> <br /> In the plotting similar to (read: torn away) the classic cannibal by Ruggero Deodato, Cannibal Holocaust, a woman (Janet Agren) receives word from the police who received an 8mm film from her sister. It has disappeared in Africa, and it is suspected that the tribal ritual depicted in the film may have something to do with it. Mel Ferrer, as a professor at Somethingoranother, tells her that a man named Jonas (Ivan Rassimov) started a cult similar to Jonestown in New Guinea, and that's where his sister is. The woman hires a guide (Robert Kerman) to take her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister. And you wouldn't know, the jungle is full of cannibals. <br /> <br /> A sentence should sum it up: if you've seen on Cannibal Movie, you've seen them all, especially since these films steal shamelessly from each other (Lenzi copied the Cannibal Holocaust to make this film, and reorganized this to create Cannibal Ferox, Deodato copied parts of this for Hit and Run). And since they all share the same material, they all have the same traits: terrible photography, boring scenery, terrible dubbing, overcoming and exploitation, exploitation, exploitation. Fans of the genre will have a ball since everyone in it is a veteran of the genre. Rassimov and Kerman have a set design competition. Agren exists only to be naked, raped or in danger. Abundance for all the sick out there. The cannibals, who actually seem to be native cannibals, eat lunch disguised as human flesh. And, in the great tradition of cannibal movies, any live animal shown on the screen is usually killed shortly afterwards. Overall, it's not really a good experience, but I'm sure there are psychopaths out there who find these droppings funny. I know I did it.
