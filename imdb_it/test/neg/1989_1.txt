This film is worse than "paradise" or "plan 9 from space". I don't know why he had only one Oscar, he should have gotten a million raspberries, just like the audience that came out or didn't show up in the first place. The hospital was a financial failure of the first order, but I am sure that the elite classes of left-wing intellectuals, with their mouths open, dissuaded that the American public was too plebeian to appreciate the biting comments on social media when they saw it, ee away. George C Scott, in one of the most reckless and embarrassing roles, along with the aging of sex, Diana Rigg, spends most of the film trying to swear in an increasingly blas√© way as they push along a silly plot. Poor George is powerless and is simply crushed by the event, but after a lot of dirty language between him and Rigg, he violates her several times in the beautiful night in a grubby and crumbling hospital in New York that looks so disgusting that I wouldn't want a a dying company rat treated us. There is also a sacrilegious dialogue-garbage thrown up here and there, also tied with a lot of curses. It ends by interpreting the wrong notion that unusual stress without physical effort always leads to cardiac arrest. I don't want to see another minute of this terrible movie anymore.
