University professor Justin Thorne (Jimmy Smits) did it. A beautiful and sophisticated teacher, with a loving wife and two adorable children. He plays the saxophone, has an expensive car and his students love and respect him. But when temptation calls, in the form of one of her brilliant, cute, sexy and helpful students, Jennifer Carter (Naomi Watts), she leaves herself stupidly. The next day, he is accused of his rape, and his perfect life could be ruined forever. <br /> <br /> When we see an American actor in the Australian film, we know we are not for a masterpiece. But even with low expectations, "Gross Devondent" is a huge flop. Based on a game with a rather unimaginative title and then adapted to a reasonably entertaining book, it fails to engage, convince or even remotely interest the public to a fundamental level. The script is uncomfortable and unconvincing; acting is, for the most part, not much better. Watts gives an acceptable performance, demonstrating for one of the first times on the screen his emotional crudeness, but it is the only positive thing in the film, which seems almost like he could not wait to be finished. <br /> <br /> The management is not horrible or distracting in any case, but it is only painfully mediocre. In addition to the aforementioned Naomi Watts, which could be forgiven, since it was at the beginning of her career, the acting is made of wood and constantly worsens over the course of the film. The usual reliable Jimmy Smits doesn't seem to have tried this, and who could really blame him? All these small failures, however, only add to the film's last fatal flaw, which is that the attention is entirely in the wrong place. Any empathy for the characters or interest in the result is lost in a sea of ​​what is basically a soft-core entertainment of an adult genre. In the end, the public will probably be bored, tired and eager to have done something else with its ninety minutes. Unless you want to see Naomi stay naked 4 or 5 times, you could certainly allow yourself to lose this unwanted movie.
