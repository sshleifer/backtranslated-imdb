The sometimes memorable dialogue of a screenwriter Frederick Fox and a cast of studios of old professionals cannot save this tepid western on whites nailed in the desert by a band of blood-thirsty Cheyenne Indians. In addition to his occasionally catchy dialogue, you won't find any surprises in Fox's script about this clash between whites and Indians. The characters of "Dakota Incident" generate only a minor interest, certainly not enough to make them stand out as much as some of the dialogues chosen by Fox. Unfortunately, a good dialogue is Fox's only contribution because this little conventional sagebrusher wilts with a lackluster ending that contradicts his previous 80 minutes. The ending is so invented as they come and lacks credibility. Most of the characters are nice, but some just don't have common sense. <br /> <br /> Dale Robertson is appropriately tough and tough as the outlaw John Banner, one of the three bank robbers who has to shoot down his low, unaccounted for partner. The veteran western actor John Doucette (Rick Largo) is the best of the bad guys, while Skip Homeier, wasted in an irrelevant role as Banner's brother, Frank Banner, dies later from an Indian arrow. Doucette tries to hit Banner at the beginning, but our hero with the left-handed gun feigns his own death, tracks down later and slaps him with his skin in a city called Christian Flats. Of course, Largo bites the dust this time, but Banner makes an interesting discovery. One of the passengers on a Christian Flats stagecoach in Laramie turns out to be none other than the teller of the bank from which he stole the money. John Carter (John Lund) is not only looking for Banner, but also wants to clarify his good name with the bank that has published wanted posters for his arrest. Evidently, the authorities have wronged and expanded the role of Carter in the robbery. Carter is ready to take Banner to Laramie and hand him over to the law, but Banner has other ideas about Laramie. Banner's ideas change when he meets Amy Clarke (former beauty of Twentieth Century Fox Linda Darnell) who wears a bright red dress and still has a beautiful breast. As all the others mentioned in their reviews, Truecolor of Republic Studio brings out the RED in everything from Darnell's dress to the blood spilled on the ground. The problem with director Lewis Foster is to manage this grinder reel that gets bogged down after the stagecoach loses a wheel and our heroes drill dry to defend against the Cheyenne. Eventually the good guys and the Cheyenne run out of ammunition, but "Dakota Incident" never ends in clich√©s. Ward Bond has several interesting moments as a politically correct politician who defends the path of red skin. By the time this 88-minute powder raid ends, you will feel as if you were trapped in a gorge and threatened by yourself a Cheyenne predator.
