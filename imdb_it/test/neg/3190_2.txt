I give this piece of Hollywood trash 1 in 10! Seriously! I mean, I like comedy as much as others. I can also just take a stupid play and actually sit and laugh with it. But this film had nothing to laugh with OR. <br /> <br /> I like almost all the actors in this movie. So I thought to ignore what many people have told me (my fault for not listening). I was just mortified at how stupid this script was! Simply ridiculous and not even fun. The only funny scenes were in the previews that everyone saw in the theater when they saw other movies or on TV. I was very disappointed and I would really like to know why these relatively good actors read this script and then sign up again to participate! Bad decision on their parts ... <br /> <br /> ********************* MAJOR SPOILER *********** ************* <br /> Okay - here's my biggest question about this movie ....... If the characters are looking back at this Jewel story (Liv Tyler) after the fact .... then how can Paul Reiser go to a therapist to remember the past!?!?!?!? He dies in the last scene being crushed by the dumpster !!!! Can someone answer me?!?!?!?!? A big joke by the filmmakers ... Nobody noticed it?!?!?!?!?!?!
