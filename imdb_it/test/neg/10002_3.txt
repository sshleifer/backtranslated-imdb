Not even the Beatles could write songs that everyone liked and, even if Walter Hill is not a moc-top, he is second to none when it comes to thinking about action films. The nineties came and the social platforms were changing into music and film, the emergence of the Rapper turned into a movie star was in full swing, the acting took a back seat to the overpowering regional accent of each and transparent acting. This was one of the many ice films I saw as a child and loved, just to watch them later and shudder. Bill Paxton and William Sadler are firefighters with vital lives until a burning tenant is about to go up in flames with his hands on a map with golden implications. I give it to Walter to quickly and neatly set the main characters and position. But I blame all those involved in making Lame-o shows. Ice-t and cube must have become hot right now, and while I enjoyed both of their careers as rappers, in my opinion they fell into this movie. It's about ninety minutes of a guy who ridiculously turns his back on the other guy to the point where you find yourself stuck in multiple states of disbelief. Now this is a film, it's not a documentary so I won't waste my time telling all the stupid twists in this film, but there have been many, and they haven't led anywhere. I had the feeling of seeing him that everyone on the set was confused and just played their way. There are two things that I still like, one about a scene with a needle and the other is Sadler's huge gun 45. In conclusion, this film is like a domino pizza. Yes, I eat it if I'm hungry and don't want to cook, but I'm aware that it tastes like shit. 3 stars, meh.
