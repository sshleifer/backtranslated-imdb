Bad. Personal opinion? The people who did it? They knew it when they made it. To act in this film, again my opinion, three criteria had to be met ... # 1: You had to own your clothes and jewelry in the Goth style. It makes the wardrobe simpler and cheaper in this way. # 2: You had to be able to remember and repeat your lines with the cues. Note that I didn't say you had to do it right. Save time and work on paper. # 3: You had to be willing to remain naked. It provides an R rating and therefore strengthens sales. Want to see a better movie? Easy. Grab a camera and some of your friends together and do it yourself. Trust me, you won't do worse. While vampire movies are, well, this sucks. And a suggestion for people like me who like to look for small quirks in movies ... Consider the link between vampires and crosses. Now, take a look at the symbols and names on gravestones in the cemetery parts of this thing have been shot. Ed Wood could not have planned that kind of accident better than himself.
