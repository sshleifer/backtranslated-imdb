Ok, I guess I'm a fan of Stephen King's stories distorted, mutilated and destroyed (when they reach the 'Screen') like some of us sad Masochists out here. I know that most of them are hurt. I am waiting. I commit myself. I humbly allow it ... <br /> <br /> But, THIS time ... GEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ ... Okay, so I think I saw this a number of years ago ..., well. I thought it was pretty good ... WRONG ... As I'm saying (granted in a verbose, annoying, indirect way :) I wasn't really trying to be snobbish or to expect much, but what was this thing, a Mini- Series? I have only ONE thing to say: D ...... R ..... A ..... W ...... NO ..... U ..... T How can you POSSIBLE justify the dragging of the minute-by-minute thing, scene by scene of ENDLESS ENDLESS, completely MEANINGLESS, and the creeping mind SLOW dialogue? I mean EVERY noble scene is composed of two people who "DISCUSS" how they feel and vice versa and D ... R ... A ... GI ... T bl ** dy well O ... U ... T After about an hour and a half, which I think is about 1/2 of the duration (I didn't check, I'm sorry :) FINALLY I got really tired! After an hour and a half what had happened OTHERS compared to the original accident ...? They were running away while the "shop" was killing ophthalmologists, news photographers and LOTS & LOTS & LOTS of meandering dialogue. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I promise that it is not that I have an unscrupulous action relentlessly; I love a lot of films where not much happens, but in them at least when they talk and so SIGNIFICANT things are said and the characters are studied in depth, thoughts are transmitted ... SOMETHING !!! ??? Ok, I admit that the actors themselves weren't that bad (except for Stephen King, of course :) I liked the store guy, I thought both "older" people were okay. I liked the general and the main woman. It's only if they could cut out all the HOURS of filling, that's all I'm saying. I mean, it's SUPPORT to be a science fiction thriller, kind of ..., right? you know what really got the prize when the shop boy was doing unnecessarily one of his many phone calls that filled the time, this time he is talking to God knows that everything becomes emotional (at least for him) and behaves as if he were not able handle it. .. WTF !!! ??? The boy has clearly proven to be a cold-blooded and efficient killer. What is HELL for ??? So, multiply that by around 500 and this is basically the reason why I eventually turned halfway; it was either that or I hanged myself, I swear! I mean, there are other "adaptations" of the king out there that are lame, but at least they move ...! Oh well, I suppose maybe you MAY be in the same "story" and you don't mind crawling and having the SUPREME and DIVINE patience to wait until the end, it might be worth it. <br /> <br /> But, I honestly and humbly doubt it ... <br /> <br /> I don't write these things very often, but THIS time I had to or could not sleep at night (as I have done myself DURING the show :)
