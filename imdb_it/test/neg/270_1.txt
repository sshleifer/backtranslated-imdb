I didn't expect much when I went out to see this, but my god what a disappointment. The original was fun in its genre, but it's so ugly that I felt abused when I left the theater. There's no plot, it's not fun, it's not pleasant to look at, it's just embarrassing. After an hour I hoped my patience would be rewarded, but now I regret not having left the theater. Do yourself a favor and ignore it, see it when it comes to the small screen. Or watch it on the cheap DVD, whatever you do don't waste money on it. Don't say I didn't warn you.
