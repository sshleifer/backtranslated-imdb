This film is not that good. It's rather stupid, rather annoying and very badly done. I only saw this movie because one of my friends said he hated this movie. Even if I didn't hate him as much as they did, I found it a pretty bad movie anyway. The only thing that is remotely good is that it was a little funny at times, and I also feel that if it had been done a little better it would have been ok anyway. , it wouldn't have been like it was shot for a film festival, and if the script had been improved it would have been a slasher movie ok. it is not, but instead what it is now, a lousy movie. The acting is atrocious it seemed to me to watch a couple of teenagers recite as a Halloween show or a thrill ride or something. The killings are pretty cheap (as is the movie itself), and basically everything else is low class. Overall, this movie is really bad and you won't miss anything if you've decided to skip this movie. <br /> <br /> 3.8 out of 10 stars
