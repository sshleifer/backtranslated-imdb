This is a rip-off from Cellular. <br /> <br /> Bad casting ... <br /> <br /> Bad direction ... <br /> <br /> Bad Music ... <br /> <br /> And the list continue ... <br /> <br /> well there was no direction since the story, the scenes and the settings were taken directly from other films. <br /> <br /> The combat sequence is also copied. One with the bat was from Kill Bill and another with the fire hose came from a film by Jet Li or Jackie Chan (I can't remember the name of this movie) ... <br /> <br /> Stay away from this cheap imitation and try to see the real thing ... <br /> <br /> I can't expect something original from any of the Bhatts anymore !!!
