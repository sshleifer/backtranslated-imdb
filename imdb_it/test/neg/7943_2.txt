This film definitely made me laugh, but that doesn't mean that it was exactly funny. Well, then again, my friends and I had a lot of fun watching it. <br /> <br /> I doubt there's anything in this film that hasn't been done at least twice before, just like the plot itself. All the characters are overused in the clich√© films with cardboard box roles that do not even require acting ability; consequently, these skills are not provided. We have the corrupt cop, a ruthless murderer who claims to take care of his men and their families while not caring for the people he shoots in the forehead at such a close distance to have spit blood on his face. We have the "frayed cop on the margins" so well indicated in the discussion forums of this film; we have the old policeman of a day away from retirement, that almost all of them must be immediately identified as the most probable man inside, since he has had much to gain and has not uttered words trusted in the film. About as transparent as a glass house on a sunny day. The great black gangster king was a copy of all the previous great black gangster kings in the history of cinema (they could have called him Marcellus Wallace), but only slightly harder and more ruthless, because something must emphasize that we also know Laurence Fishburne of actually good movie. Then finally we have the HIGHLY EDUCATED doctor who can't think of something reasonable to do as soon as the situation differs from his ordinary life and who spends most of the movie sitting in a helpless corner trying to figure out how to hold on to the weapon which was given to you. DO NOT USE IT. <br /> <br /> The entire history of the siege is not interesting, not original (having been used twice before) and this film does not add anything interesting at all. There is the initial probe, then the siege laying, then the assault, then the escape attempts. Meanwhile, a group of stressed, stressed and frightened police and thugs are holding off a police assault team with high-tech equipment and the rather important advantage of VISION. Then again, in the deep night, with the power outage and with a snowstorm raging high up, there is certainly a lot of light, so who really cares about night vision. <br /> <br /> But the best part comes right at the end. In the first scenes showing Precinct 13, we see that it is located in a periphery of an industrial city; factories and office buildings surround it on all sides. From this point, the besieged travel perhaps a hundred meters in a sewer and where do they end up? Some alleys end up right in the middle of a forest! A FOREST! Where does that forest come from? Who decided to lay down a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area? How is this forest, in the last scene, suddenly on a hill above the city in question, while in the scenes inside the forest it seemed apparently APPRECIATED? <br /> <br /> From here I leave judgment to you, and to your common sense. Go see this movie if you're looking for an unwanted laugh, I can really recommend it.
