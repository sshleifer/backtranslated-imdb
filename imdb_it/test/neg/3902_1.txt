Wow, umm this was a very, so to speak, different kind of movie. He calls himself a comedy ... but in reality it wasn't funny at all. He was crazy. If you are willing to accept that 3 people survive a global calamity disaster, why not 4? or 5? ..... and why did it suddenly end without anything happening ??? They could have done it much better simply by having another element in the plot like a squat female for the ugly guy or something ....... zinc, simplistic .... ahh <br /> <br /> I don't know. .. look at it ... it wasn't so bad ..... something funny sometimes .... i think ... <br /> <br /> schneider
