I had expected a graphic, sexual and vulgar adolescent comedy, quite simple, when I sat down to see this ... it turned out to be fairly accurate ... only that he was much more sick and disgusting than I thought. I don't know if the director / writer Gregory Poirier is sick or deeply messed up sexually, but I doubt that a normal person could have made a film like this. I probably could have taken it if it was just that, if the only thing that was wrong was that it required a hard stomach ... but it isn't. The film is also terribly petty and disturbing ... every single character who has more than a second of time on the screen is an extreme ... sexually, mentally or physically. I don't know if this is just the director's sense of humor, but I just found ... wrong. Just wrong. Even in a comedy, there should be some seriousness. The plot is stupid. The acting is bad. The characters are inconsistent and badly written ... all of them. There is not a single nice character in the film. Humor is disgusting and goes too far. The film is so incredibly bad that I really don't think it's worth having anyone's time. If you like classic comedies, crudely rich in sexual allusions and graphics, look at The Groomsmen, or better yet, American Pie ... or Road Trip, my favorite. But don't look at this. I can't describe to you how ugly it is ... you should try it for yourself. However, this is one of those times when I will say that you are better off asking yourself. This way you can only imagine that this film is very close to the bottom ... without knowing that it passes through it, and much lower. This film, above all, looks like a group of horny kids who met, put together a film crew, and every time one of them got an idea, they filmed it and then put the whole thing together. It lacks structure, texture and taste. I recommend it only to horny kids who have seen every single rough and rough comedy and who don't care about quality. All the others ... do the sensible thing; avoid it It's not even worth seeing the loot. Believe me. 1/10
