Have I seen a worse movie? No, I can't say I have it. This was pathetic. If the director is still alive: 1. He shouldn't be. 2. He should be ashamed. 3. God, how I would like to take out my 2 hours of time completely wasted on her a $$. <br /> <br /> To give you some hints of the "movie": <br /> 1. br /> 1. (I'm a male) and I'd rather give myself a papercut when opening my urethra before seeing it again (seriously ). <br /> <br /> 2. It has some well-known names in it (Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio). They don't help, and their careers in the cinema after this "movie" are officially over. <br /> <br /> 3. Dialogue is the worst I have ever heard. "I want to ejaculate on your bozonka."? What kind of writer did they have on this film? Was he still using the hooked phonemes and his letters were mixed to make these horrible sentences? Or was he trying to get the director killed by the few people who saw him? <br /> <br /> 4. Watch this "movie" backwards. Because I PROMISE that you don't want to look ahead. <br /> <br /> 5. This "movie" would make Helen Keller get up and leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 6. The movie set looks like a McDonald's adult gaming venue. I was just waiting for this so-called "Dracula" to fall into the field of balls sometime in the movie. <br /> <br /> 7. Furthermore, I like that in the year 3000 they still have headphones with wires that go to their mouth. No bluetooth, no wireless headphones, no chips in the brain, but they use headphones borrowed from a telemarketing agency that went out of business in 1983 (director of the Nice work set on this. Reading this.) <Br / > <br /> 8. I don't know who was responsible for the special effects, but I could have done better in my backyard with my VHS camcorder that doesn't have a battery. <br /> <br /> 9. I was a devout Catholic before this "film". But since I saw him, I know that there is no God, because if there were, he would not let this film be produced. Now I'm an atheist. <br /> <br /> 10. I'll be honest, I can't talk about the ending. The last time I tried to explain it, I fell into a coma. <br /> <br /> But people are boring you, however curious (or brave) you are, however many laughs you think you'll get out of this movie, please DON'T WATCH THIS. It literally ruined my life. AVOID ALL COSTS! <br /> <br /> Commentary on the director: I hate you. You ruined my life. After seeing this, I feel empty inside. My wife and children left me and they hate me because I could not talk or barely move after seeing this. I lost my job, my dignity and above all my pride. I will never forgive you in this life or the next (which does not seem good from my new beliefs).
