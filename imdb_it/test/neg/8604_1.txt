I found myself looking at Sex Lives Of The Potato with a wrinkled brow, puzzled because so many talented and witty comedians decided to get involved in a film so totally devoid of humor. <br /> <br /> Poo and jokes are fun when you're eleven. Eighteen more and you start losing friends around the water cooler. <br /> <br /> Perhaps you could enjoy some enjoyment from this movie if you are the kind of person who often makes practical jokes involving a mess of dogs, brown bags and games, or maybe take part in "men's" competitions "in the night-outs soaking up the vomit / urine of the companions etc. when you're not returning to your parents' basement to punch your teenage wife. <br /> <br /> Even then "Sex Lives" ... "is difficult to recommend. Perhaps if you are really strangely in masochistic cranial surgery and spend your evenings slapping the elderly or watching the baths flush, you might think that a close-up of a cart is worthy of theatrical distribution. <br /> <br /> I discuss the characterization, the narrative or the performances if I were not completely off the mark after the long tuna-paste / vagina comparison.
