It took me a few years to hunt down this title, a staple of my childhood. Most trips to the video store would select Space Raiders and watch it three times each time my mother rented it for me. It was, I suppose, my Star Wars. <br /> <br /> It's a pity then that it's so smelly. My memories were so confused that it offered nothing in terms of nostalgia, so I had to take it by value. A crew of space pirates accidentally kidnaps a rather annoying little boy and spends the rest of the film trying to bring him back home. <br /> <br /> Exactly addressed to the under-end, it has an unwelcome slap, very poor costumes and -up, recycled special effects, rickety sets and poor acting. But even with the involuntary comedy it is not fun to see her as an adult, where I can identify not only the technical defects, but I wonder how spectacularly the writer and director managed to trap an endless stream of funny and powerful moments that were seen in a million other science fiction films and in the hands of anyone who was remotely competent should have succeeded. I imagine that as a child I probably find it quite powerful - there are many "I can't do it, I'm just a kid" "Of course you can do a tantrum, you just have to try!" - type exchanges; the child drinks beer, etc., but even by the low-budget science fiction standards of 1983 this is pretty horrible, with a true "final" snoozer.
