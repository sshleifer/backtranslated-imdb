I laughed twice watching this movie and in case you were wondering, I was not having a bad day and I was not subject to anything else that would distort my opinion while I watched this cinematic bowel movement. This movie is bad. I wanted to enjoy it and I couldn't. With all this talent, you'd think it would have been at least watchable, right? Mistaken. <br /> <br /> Let's play Suck and Don't Suck! John Travolta - Very nice. Although obviously buried under too many tricks, I found it fun to watch. He didn't suck. <br /> <br /> Uma Thurman - After Kill Bill 1 and 2, the girl deserves more than this atrociously written character. The big moment of this character was showing someone how to operate a T-Mobile Sidekick. Sucked. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn- The role played until the death of a white guy who thinks he is black goes to Vince "Money" Vaughn. Is this character model still considered fun? I love the boy but I want to see him in something better than this. He seemed to be swerving. Sucked. <br /> <br /> Cedric the Entertainer - This guy is good. He holds a great monologue after being called a racial insult (you can probably guess what it is) that was probably the best part of the movie. The material he had been given only by his presence was fun and really high. He didn't suck. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel- Sucked due to an exhibition call. <br /> <br /> James Woods - Sucked but not his fault. Actually, yes, it was. It reminded me of his role in Casino for some reason. I don't like the maniac James Woods, I like to burn James Woods slowly. Victim of bad writing, perhaps? Andre 3000 - Sucked but went down swinging. I think he has potential, as long as he's not directed by a trick on his next photo. <br /> <br /> Christina Milian - She is absolutely beautiful and obviously talented but this film will not make her a star. It didn't suck, but it needs a better vehicle for its talents than a hack. <br /> <br /> The Rock - This should have been the role that catapulted him to the movie celebrity but as directed by F. Gary Gray, he ends up badly abused. In this film, the Rock projects this charisma that makes it so nice that I felt sorry for him. He really tries hard and while he fails completely, he gets an A + from me. This guy is not afraid to embarrass himself and go completely against the guy, playing a gay bodyguard with his eyes on celebrity. I really want to see him grow up. It has what it takes until it is directed by a hacker. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to what I feel is the weak link in this production. I could even go out and say it, right? F. Gary Gray's direction was as solid as a really bad diarrhea. Wow, it was bad. Who had the brilliant idea to let this guy direct? The negotiator was good, but what else on his resume convinced the people that he was the right man? Between his direction and the atrocious writing, I am willing to make the chip for both culprits to get a nice lead salad up to the knees. Do you want to see John and Uma dance? I might be able to think of another movie with those two that I could recommend looking at instead of this. It wasn't worth the ten dollars and fifty cents it cost me to go to the theater. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been ok and it wasn't even "okay". <br /> <br /> RATING: * on *****. <br /> <br /> PS It is worth mentioning the Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas. Sizzling!
