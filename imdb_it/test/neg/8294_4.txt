OK, a movie about a movie that takes a crack during the making of the video clip could be fun. It could be, it should be fun, edgy, even controversial, or at least interesting, and yet ... This film is the negative version of Bizzaro. Hamlin was funny as a producer of a "B" movie. Shatner sounded crazy and yet likeable, and had all the best lines. The rest of the characters were boring, predictable, boring, underdeveloped, boring and boring. The value of production was lame. You will actually see the boom go down in a scene. The sound was terrible in some scenes. Hey, I'm a big fan of Shatner and Hamlin now, but their talents are wasted here. At least the story had a clich√© ending.
