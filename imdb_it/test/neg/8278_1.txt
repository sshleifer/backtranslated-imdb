For me, reviewing movies is an extension of my love of cinema - and horror cinema in particular. The reviews I have written so far have been for films that I love, respect and admiration, and I have rewarded them with enthusiastic awards and assessments for ten. A fan of a horror movie for life, it's a great pleasure for me to be able to share my thoughts and ideas about great horror films with others and hopefully have a hand in exposing people to films that otherwise they could not search. I have only recently begun reviewing films for IMDB, and it was my initial intention to focus only on my personal favorites, examining what I believe to be of substance and lasting value for the horror genre. However, the existence of films like "Graduation Day" is, without pun, a thorn in the side. Completely devoid of any merit, this 1981 mix of unformed ideas is amateurishly directed, misinterpreted and, in any sense, an embarrassed embarrassment for horror cinema. During the short couple of years before and after the release of this film, we saw the appearance of national (and Canadian) films such as "Halloween II", "Prom Night", "Terror Train", "Madman", "My Bloody Valentine "," "The Prowler", "Just Before Dawn", "Final Exam" and "Hell Night", among others. These films, although with varying degrees of quality, have clearly striven to achieve something in terms of plot, plot, acting, direction and general tone Not all films released during this abundant season of Slasher Era would have the artistic merit or commercial success of the original "Halloween" or "Friday 13", but these films were all well done and have clearly contributed to the continuous development of horror films. "Graduation Day", an abysmal farce about a masked killer who persecutes members of a team of high school athletes, was directed by Herb Freed, who can only hope will not attempt never again to tarnish the horror genre with one similar parody. The task of creating profitable horror films is best left to those who have genuine love and respect for the genre. This film fails miserably at every level possible, not least that of the terribly wooden performances, special effects of the dime-store, an irritating soundtrack and, above all, a story that lacks even the slightest hint of tension or suspense. An unnecessary exercise on how to waste film, "Graduation Day" is an absolute shame for horror movies.
