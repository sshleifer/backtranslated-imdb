I found the code 46 very disappointing. I thought the concept was good and therefore had great potential as a film, but I discovered that it had not been published. Code 46 lacked thought and structure and the plot did not flow well. I thought the character of Tim Robbins was not well developed, eg I thought there should have been more information and thoughts put into his family life and not completely ignored him as I thought he was. When they were the first to break a 46 code it was suggested that they should not know that they could be genetically connected but that all the technology was available to them, took his fingerprints and then the genetic details when he was investigating fraud. I constantly found myself waiting for something to happen and for the plot to develop, yet it never existed. I felt that the film had great potential to be intellectually stimulating, but it turned out to be the opposite. Code 46 tried to be too intelligent and eventually ended up lacking imagination. I would not recommend this film to anyone, the only positive thing about the film was that it was relatively short.
