Maybe it's just me, but this movie looked more like a sequel or a sequel than the separate project. Why? When it was shot (only a few years after the war) most viewers probably knew why Rommel was so famous, because his death was so important to the Allies, because he was Hitler's favorite general, but now, 50 years later, it is not so obvious. <br /> <br /> "Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel" is a decent war movie, but it is not in any way explained how Rommel got his nickname, what Allied was doing considered him their best general , why were their soldiers so afraid of the Afrika Korps? This is what is missing in this film - we see his fame, his character, his way of treating soldiers and enemies, but for example. we also see that Hitler was complaining about his successes in Africa, calling him a coward, etc. So, we miss the big picture here - it's "The story of Rommel", but unfortunately the "Desert Fox" part is missing.
