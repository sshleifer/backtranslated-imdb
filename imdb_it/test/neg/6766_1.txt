Yes. A real stinker. I saw this movie on the advice of my "sweet" friends who told me that this is a great "psychological" film. This film makes every effort not to be understandable. I was aware that I had been looking for a stinker after seeing the first 20 minutes. I waited since I expected to see something valuable, and most important of all, I paid for this movie. The wait was unbearable. After watching the film, I talked to my friends and learned that in intellectual circles (they are called with this title) from Turkey this "film" had recognized as a masterpiece. Yes, a masterpiece, but in the polecat category. I think a film should be self-explanatory. This film is just the opposite. Stay away from this thing that calls itself a "movie". Burn your money instead of paying for this "phenomenon". Rate: 1 out of 10
