This film begins in the way every movie should start, with a group of sexy girls in a dormitory running around in their panties and / or topless. A couple of them take a shower. I love it so much! Unfortunately, we meet or main characters. They are not particularly nice. Usually in these films, the actresses don't really act, they give very "natural" performances and they are very nice, funny and funny. Not here. They don't have much personality and I didn't care much about them. <br /> <br /> Some girls go camping for school. Along the way they stop at a backwood service station and meet a band of bikers. The biker gang should have been left out of the movie - first it was a mess, but now it's just stupid. The head biker looks like a middle-aged boy dressed as John Bon Jovi for Halloween. The girls go out into the woods and later the biker gang follows them. <br /> <br /> I really don't know what the hell is going to happen next. There's a lot going on in the world that ends because it's the end of the millennium, then some of the bikers are killed by a mysterious Indian guy who keeps disappearing. Someone is eaten by a Lock Ness monster thing while swimming across a lake. A guy with a silly trick is apparently a Druid, and he needs to sacrifice some of the girls to prevent the end of the world. Or perhaps because of the end of the world, I'm afraid I haven't paid much attention. First she dresses girls with animal skin lingerie. <br /> <br /> It could have been a really fun cheese film, but the biker gang ruined the atmosphere and the plot was so confusing that it didn't even live up to my expectations of class Z schlock. They would really had to eliminate half of the plot elements and concentrate on one or two things. Instead it is everywhere. Overall, if you're looking for the late 80s, I guess you could do worse. If you really tried. There is a lot of nudity at the beginning, but the characters are pretty bad and the plot is too meaningless to be even the least satisfying.
