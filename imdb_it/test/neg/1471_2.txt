This film has been praised to the point of being ridiculous. "American Movie" is a boring documentary about a boring person so ordinary that you will find equivalents practically everywhere in America. It takes a long and hard look at a guy who has failed in everything that is in the interest of creating an independent film ... or two. If his failures were different from his selfish pursuits or if they were in the name of true art, the film could have had a chance. America has an abundance of better stories to tell. This should be flushed and many critics have good reasons to be ashamed. Two inches indeed!
