Although this film (and I use the term freely) was released in 1997, we saw it for the first time tonight. My husband commented that a Tommy Lee Jones film we had never heard of made him a little worried. I watched happily the same, sure that if Jones was in the movie, at least it was worth two hours of my time. After all, he has been one of our favorite actors for years. Although Heche is not one of my favorite actresses, I was also reassured to see another well-known face. The list of established actors / actresses has continued to grow, so I put up with this film more and more, certain that if I pushed enough clich√©s and trite social statements, I would have been victorious on the other side of the plot. Alas, there was no plot. It seemed to be burned by the evergreen doom lava. <br /> <br /> The characters were very thin. The plot was so full of holes that it literally distracted me from most of the special effects and acting in the film. Was the fee for a brief consultation with an elementary science teacher too much for this film's budget? No acid rain ... no toxic gases (like sulfur or hydrochloride) ... no deadly ashes ... no burning heat for the skin a few meters from the lava. Wow ... it's the kindest lava in the world ever! <br /> <br /> Events were no better than characters. Every episode was so invented and far-fetched ... it is as if the writers said "Okay, we have to get rid of the baby NOW" ... and puff, it is splashed by a lava bomb that burns it enough to be rescued lava, but from his own helpless astonishment ... ... but moments later, in the car, he has no apparent pain and immediately afterwards runs effortlessly through the (groan!) building that (oh no!) is about to be blown up air. After enduring all this, your reward is the kid's joke at the end (of all the people that look the same) ... which must be one of the worst movie lines I've ever heard. Although it wasn't copied so painfully, it was ridiculous timing for all the characters involved. Kid and policeman aside, as if the mother was still in the area and only needs to be indicated because she is not talking ... what ... do you hope to slip into the shadows and get away from the little brat once and for all? I don't think so. Obviously the baby's mother would have disappeared or died - or she would have screamed with her head down to find her baby. <br /> <br /> The tough black gangsta hooligan with a secret weak spot against the chip on his shoulder a secret soft spot scene made me bleed my eyes. Even if such pat characters existed, they would not behave as the film portrays them given the circumstances. Something about the imminent fiery death and massive destruction tends to catch people off guard, you know? <br /> <br /> There are too many moments of canned movies like these to say ... really, it's just an embarrassing movie to watch. Those poor writers ... where are they now?
