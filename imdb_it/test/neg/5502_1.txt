surely this film was hacked by the studio? maybe not, but I believe there have been serious flaws in the narrative that, if not attributed to the editing process, could only be caused by bad deeds, criminals, writings and directors. <br /> <br /> I understand the effect that Burton wanted to achieve with the stylized acting similar to the gothic fairytale atmosphere of Edwardian scissors, but unfortunately here it falls flat and does not reach mythical depths of tropes but only the triple offensive of affectation. that is bad acting and superficial characterization even for a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> finally not so scary, in fact, just slightly funny in his attempts. the use of dialogue as a vehicle for the background of the plot was awkward and unnecessary. the mystery of who is the headless knight would be enough, there is no need for the myth of a German mercenary, even if the christopher walken has made a drastic figure but not so threatening - seeing the head of the horsemans makes him look much more friendly of an inhuman decapitated nine foot high spirit as in the original legend. <br /> <br /> no real universal rhythm or tone has ever been established and is not a classic in the burtons category. prodded and truncated like my farewell shot ...
