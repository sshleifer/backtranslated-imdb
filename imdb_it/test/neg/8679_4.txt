This film with excellent production values ​​presents secrets and how friends use each other. Henry May Long is a period piece from the end of the century, very well lit, dimly lit and depressing about a friendship between a sick man and a melancholy and indebted addict. Drama plays are not my cup of tea, and all crying is consumed. Recommended if you like merchant-type features ivory independent, astutely intellectual and slow. <br /> <br /> I suspected that the main characters were in love, but their connection was so intimate, that it didn't really have the emotional impact of "Brokeback Mountain". It has a good script with a scene that talks about how to disappear in life, but it's really a dark and depressing film.
