The most useless film of the decade. The responsible parties should never be able to take up again. I have no words to describe the lack of entertainment that this film provides. You couldn't PAY to watch this movie again. Honestly enough, I think I would be a better person if I hadn't seen it. If I called it offensive, I fell into a category of emotionally fragile extremists. I would say that this film damages the industry. There are films that I refuse to watch, now that I feel they could be so insignificant. I feel like an idiot who didn't have the sense to go out during one of the many moments when I was forced to do it. Yes, I've seen the end and I'm ashamed, like everyone else, including the writer. I'm in awe ...
