This is a piece of CRAP celluloid. You can tell when you watch a mafia movie "you want to be" .... and that's it. This did NOT MEASURE, it did not start at the beginning of his life, the charactors were everywhere ... and the "GODFATHER" term did not even exist until PUZO wrote the book! ..... POI, the real mafia, borrowed PHRASE and did it right after the movie ..... THIS piece of clapping should have thought that the phrase (which represents the mafia don) had been used in the 20s ... when these people were only called "DON" .... outside of the original Godfather movie, if you want to see another decent mob movie, take a look at Puzo, The Last Don (part 1) part 2 sucked.
