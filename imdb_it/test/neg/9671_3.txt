Disney-like fun with some moments of graphic violence and non-Disney sexual references. Bad comedy alongside moralisms convinced by clich√©s. Noah like Abraham, Lot as his evil friend. Ridiculous special effects. Excessive execution with bad synchronization. Were Sodom and Gommora destroyed before the Deluge? Strange turns and too many secondary plots that the Bible does not mention. God as a doubtful father who just needs to be entertained by whistling before deciding that the world must be saved from disaster. <br /> <br /> The director of the B-movie John Irvin adds another failure to his worthless list of misdirected films that seriously lack plot and direction.
