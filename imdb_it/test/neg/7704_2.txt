This movie sounds like a demented episode of "Where Are They Now" by VH1 or "Behind The Music". In the first half of the film (which describes his "glory days") Abbie Hoffman is involuntarily portrayed as a sort of delirious rock star. You know the type; the pose singer, the handsome guy, who has not written anything about the music, has no idea, but gets all the glory for nothing and free chicks. As a result, he takes his success for granted, abuses it and eventually destroys it together with himself. In fact, Hoffman's glory days abruptly ended when he was arrested for treating cocaine, bailed out and hid. <br /> <br /> The second part of the film deals with that hidden time. In it we see Hoffman as a pathetic whine who incessantly blames everyone, anyone, but himself for his ruin. In the end the times completely overcome it; and he will never be able to deal with that. How sad. THE END. Rolls of credits and OH NO! We learn that Abbie Hoffman eventually committed suicide in 1989. I am sure that this is not the image that the directors intend for Hoffman to make this film. Since Tom Hayden and Gerald Lefcourt were involved, I am sure they intended this film as a kind of homage to the life of a man who was after all an icon of the anti-war movement of the 1960s and the left. In this they failed miserably. The film features Abbie Hoffman as a brainless caricature. We are never told what drives him. How did he get to his opinions? How did you capture the imagination of an entire generation? How did you organize such a vast movement? Why was he involved in cocaine consumption at the height of his fame? Why? Who knows, and since the filmmakers don't seem to care, in the end who cares?
