As others have said, could there be any other reason to watch this movie if you don't see the former "Wayne's World" star Mike Myers play a serious role? The plot is interesting, but lacks development and is sabotaged by loose ideas and bad characters. If there had been good panoramic shots of Ireland, then he would give him another reason to see it. But instead it focuses on a small normal village that is obviously surrounded by the "green pastures" of the Emerald Isle that are often shown in Irish films. If there were any cultural "spice" to admire the "Irish personality", it would be worth seeing, but this could have been almost shot in England. Too bad for Myers, but this fails to satisfy or satisfy the heart of anyone who has ever wanted to visit the land of Guinness.
