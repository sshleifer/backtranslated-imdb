I absolutely could not believe the levels of ineptitude exposed in this production. I honestly thought that gay men had a better taste than this. I know I do it. <br /> <br /> Most of the blame lies not in the cast, but first let's get them out of the way ... the only one with real talent was Joe Souza (plus he had the best physique in the cast). He had a beautiful, clear theater voice. Okay, and Jaymes Hodges' voice was so-so, but he had a vacant expression in every issue. The rest could not keep a ticket in a bucket, even if the music was obviously doubled after the fact. It must have been really terrible to hear them live. They were all males too, except maybe three. If I wanted to see WOMEN naked on stage I could go to the bars. I don't know why someone would have chosen to film the production of L.A. instead of New York. I imagine that NY has more talent available to sing, even if one might think in L.A. they would be able to find better guys-WATCH. Apparently not. <br /> <br /> But I digress ... the real blame here is with the creators and producers. This score was the most trivial and insipid tripe I have ever heard. It seemed that some theatrical queens took all their music CDs, threw them in a blender and poured goo on a page. Unfortunately, I'm sure there are many who can't tell the difference between good theatrical writing and whatever it is. I mean seriously, I was laughing out loud for the whole thing, but not at the limping jokes. I think the morbid song of my lover-dead-of-AIDS "titled" Kris, look what you missed "was the most hysterical thing in the whole show. Genius who writes ... Kris / Lost ... wow. .. ALMOST rhyme ... must be a good lyric ... And Jesus ... the END of that song ... "Oh Kris, Ohhh Kris, OHHHH Kris ..." ABOVE AND BEYOND !!! My other favorite was "You must be a Pumpy Junkie Boy to be a Humpy Hunkie Boy" ... WTF ??? The whole show was full of the most arbitrary rhyming JUST BECAUSE lyrics. Where did these people learn to write songs? Apparently they listened to Sondheim and they said "It's not so great, I can do it" ... as the delayed reference of "Bobby, Bobby, Bobby" of COMPANY in a song shows. Another irony: why are the 20-year-olds singing about Robert Mitchum and Tab Hunter? Obviously coming from the mouths of the lyricists and not from the actors ... again, bad writing. <br /> <br /> If you love torture and malice re, and I know that many of you weird fetishists do, go ahead and look at them. But you have been warned.
