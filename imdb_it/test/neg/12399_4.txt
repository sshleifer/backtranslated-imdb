It's strange what fate does to some people. While looking at the DVD in a DVD reseller, I came across a copy of Deadly Instincts. Being a collector of any movie that is science fiction, horror or alien monsters, I decided to buy it (not to mention the fact that it cost five dollars for a bargain, believe me). After seeing it, I came to the conclusion that it was nothing special. But after doing some research on the Internet, I discovered that the film was actually called Breeders and it was a remake of Tim Kincaid's horror film that threatened video stores in the mid-80s. Which I've already seen. My appreciation for "Deadly Instincts" has grown following this discovery. <br /> <br /> A meteorite crashes on the lawn next to a private female college. The only teacher there, Ashley (played by Todd Jensen ????????????????????????????????????, 4 years before), he notices that some of the students are beginning to disappear, while he meets a red-haired black man with a scarred face and a vicious leather dress. His investigation reveals that an alien creature had attacked the meteorite and had come to Earth to reproduce using local women. Together with a local detective who believes he is responsible for the disappearances, Ashley tries to stop the monster. <br /> <br /> The original BREEDERS, directed by Tim Kincaid (who would leave the genre to do gay porn), was a science fiction / horror film that was actually a veiled, soft-core porn movie designed to bring fashion films to fans of the genre. In my opinion, it is one of the worst films made in the 1980s. Because anyone who would like to do it again is rather a mystery. <br /> <br /> This remake is actually a better effort than its low budget source. The film, which takes up the basic concept of an alien monster that tries to interbreed with human women, eliminates every pornographic element. In fact, the film is actually very gentle. There are no sex scenes, nudity (even during the shower scene), oath and violence are kept to a minimum and there is no blood (which could deceive the gorehounds). This makes the remake a safe film for the whole family, that is if the children are not afraid of alien monsters (which brings me to the M 15+ rating of the film, which seems a bit too much). <br /> <br /> Apart from the courtesy of the content, the film has some flaws. The screenplay, while presenting some good characterizations, has a number of holes so large that a meteor collapses. <br /> <br /> What? Are you mad at me for that? Come on, this review needed a bad pun so it will stay interesting. <br /> <br /> However, the setting of the film is a problem that the script failed to solve ?? the film is set in Boston but the buildings don't seem to belong to Boston. Something about architecture is not right. Another thing is the college itself, with a rather large building that houses about twenty students (all female, of course) and with only one class? art. The only teacher has a relationship with a student (and also the custodian!), Who somehow escapes the attention of the principal. Not to mention the cops, who are so one-dimensional (and stupid) that the real PD in Boston would have a good case if they decided to sue. Oh, and the meteor ?? well, the possibility that a meteor sent by Saturn (check the credits) reaches Earth without any propulsion on board is astronomical. This does not include the possibility that all passengers in the meteor will survive landing. <br /> <br /> As for acting, Todd Jensen gives a reliable performance as the heroic teacher while the late Kadamba Simmons (who was murdered by his boyfriend shortly before the film came out) cuts a surprising figure into that leather outfit, besides proving he can act. Visual effects are run-of-the-mill, with credits due to filmmakers for bringing us an attractive looking monster.
