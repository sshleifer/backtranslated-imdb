Duncan Roy's writing and direction are really, and regularly, below average. It's actually kind of a stink. The AKA is almost as bad as its recent (horrible, selfish) remake of Dorian Gray - absurd and twisted dialogue between the characters of the "upper class", at the same time idiotic and pretentious, amateurish, minced in the middle. The characterization and the script - and sometimes the acting - is creaking like a school play ... but worse, there is a sort of self-certainty of the peacock on the direction that is only destruction of the soul when the director clearly has not grasped ... it's just not good. Diana Quick must be taken by embarrassment. DR you should get out of the cinema ... seriously.
