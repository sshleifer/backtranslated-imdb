It is perhaps unfair of me to comment on this film, because, for the first time ever, I turned off a film because it was so bad. I can watch anything, but this movie was very boring. I was bored before putting the DVD and I thought this could be a ridiculous horror / action action movie to lighten the mood. It is not even this, it is a device that increases the level of boredom thanks to the power of 100. I had to turn it off after 45 minutes because all that had happened at that moment was that some people had been diving and a large mole had been discovered . Seriously, this movie is not worth it, even if you can enjoy a bad movie as I can, avoid this movie like the plague. The worst thing I've seen in years.
