This film was pure boredom from beginning to end. Okay, so I greet Boorman for raising world recognition of events in Burma, but that's all he does. About 10 minutes into the movie I thought "oh no, here we go again" and I could tell you exactly what would happen in the next 80 minutes or so. Patricia Arquette was out of her depth in this role, and her acting was wooden and unconvincing. Mind you, with a script so terribly conventional, that perhaps boredom has arrived, and has been so reflected on the screen. Much of the film was simply ridiculous. At one point, Arquette's elderly companion is struck, and is prostrated on the ground. In the next scene, he is running through the forest, obviously trying to break the record-breaking world of 100 meters! - Or maybe he's just trying to escape from Boorman !! If you have trouble sleeping one night, play Beyond Rangoon on the VCR and you'll snore in no time. Rarely critical of a film as heavily as this, but in this case it is completely justified.
