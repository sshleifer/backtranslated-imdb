********** POSSIBLE SPOILER ********** Madonna interprets a former prisoner who needs to retrieve some valuable information that could free her from the murder that was imprisoned for four years does. Griffin Dunne is a tax lawyer who is marrying his boss's daughter. Together, the two should come together in a world where chaos prevents you from getting on the bus ... <br /> <br /> When you get to this, this is a stupid movie. Without trying to give away the plot of **** POSSIBLE SPOILER ****, the villains in the film are trying to protect their boss by recovering the information that would incriminate them for the murder for which Madonna was sent. What kind of villains don't commit murder trying to hide the original murder?!?!?! <br /> <br /> Then there are the policemen who are following Madonna who follow the villains in a limousine, where they have the brides all tied! And let's not forget those same brides maids who fought from the main gate to the front door, still all tied together! And I hate to say this, but that pathetic cat looks like a puma! There are only four in the New York City area, so they may be in danger, but I know there are many in the Rocky Mountains (see "Charlie the Lonesome Cougar" if you really want to see a big "cat" in the film). And let's look at the old man who falls asleep ... NAW! <br /> <br /> The plot is there, but that's all there is to see in this movie, I was barely out of my adolescence when this movie was originally released and I was a little ... what a Madonna fan was, but it was the only reason I liked the movie, but since then, it has no longer had popularity with me, and I have faced with the fact that she's just a terrible actress (good thing she has that career as a singer to start over). She estimated maybe a "5" then, but fell to "barely make a 2" over the years.
