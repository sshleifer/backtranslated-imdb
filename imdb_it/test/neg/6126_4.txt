The beginning of the film is promising. When Jeanne Pollet (Anna Mouglalis) listens to the story of the accident that happened the day she was born, which raised the possibility that she is the daughter of a famous pianist, André Polonski (Jacques Dutrone), decided to find out if it is true or not , and giving the fact that she also plays the plan which is not such a remote idea. Jeanne meets André and his wife "Mika" Muller (Isabelle Huppert) and their son and they discover the fact that there are some secrets in that family as much as her. <br /> <br /> O.K. we have already seen it and it was done in a more interesting way than here. The character of "Mika" Muller is left without us understanding her reasons for her action and she is not interesting enough to take care of her. The piano scenes seem false and the entire sub-plot of the piano adds nothing to the character's intuition, but serves to make the film longer than it should have been in the first place. <br /> <br /> In short, a very disappointing release from Chabrol, who can do better than this
