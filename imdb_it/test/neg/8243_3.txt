In general I loved the Carry on movies, but this is really quite horrible. There are very few laughs because everything is so forced. There is a lot of talent on the screen and some come out better than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hatti Jaques and Peter Butterworth are doing well, but Barbara Windsor looks tired and Sid James is just tacky. Joan Sims does well, but in the usual case, Charles Hawtrey is simply sad. When you think about the sad end of his career, the film is almost too depressing to watch. The homophobia of the film is bad and it is a very unpleasant experience. The set looks cheap and, unlike other films in the series, the film is set very clearly in England. The sea side seems cold and here is a small attempt to create illusions. It looks like an economic production. You will be surprised how wretched you become at watching this especially if you love the series.
