This film stinks a lot. The only reason I gave a 3 was because the graphics were semi-fascinating. The total disregard of a plot and the lack of a superficial even inconsistent development have made it look like just a bunch of beautiful designs. This is by far the worst anime in Japan. I can't believe they actually put their names on this junk. What a rip off to sell this thing for $ 20. If you haven't seen it, don't worry. If you have, I pity you.
