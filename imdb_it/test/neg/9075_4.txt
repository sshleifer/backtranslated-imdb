I chose this film because I was looking for a triangular friendship between a girl and two boys. Since I experienced this situation and got lost, I hope a similar story inspires me. <br /> <br /> My main concerns are: - Why (a) and how (b) triangular shapes? - Why (c) and how (d) does the triangle degenerate? <br /> <br /> (a) The film offers a clear answer: "because it's better!" <br /> <br /> (b) here, it is an open triangle: the three share things together. Mine was closed: everyone knows the others but never the three are together or talking about the missing one: <br /> <br /> (c) The film does not offer explicit explanations but prefers visual and emotional assumptions: the end comes with the sensuality, the sexuality that emerges in the triangle or, more precisely, when for a member, the deep feelings are linked to intimacy and, as for the second and the first, can be divided. I agree. <br /> <br /> (d) In the film and in my story, silence is the proof that something is not right .. And in an ironic and painful way, the instrument for these sad moments is always the telephone: I have lived this terrible planned phone call: "Call me back: I'll wait for you" ?? and when the time comes, is the phone silent? A variation is also shown, when the line is connected but refuses to talk ?? All those scenes were very difficult for me to see. <br /> <br /> If the film was a great help in this way, it also has many flaws: <br /> <br /> - I zapped the boy's family problems <br /> <br /> - why the shower scene on the DVD cover is cut on the film? <br /> <br /> - how does Mickael finally arrive at the hotel? <br /> <br /> - Clément always sees Salomé? says "no" but has its address; and who is the girl with him at the bar: his girlfriend? how do you know the address ??? <br /> <br /> - what finally happens to Vanessa: the final shooting ring is an engagement test ??? with whom ?????
