Ops. I hired him because I thought it was a bitter crop (1981), which was recommended. After the frightening Patsy Kensit appeared, I checked the recommendation and discovered my mistake. OK, it's watchable, because the main characters are very sexy, but the acting is horrible. Stephen Baldwin looks gloomy all the time, which is understandable considering his co-star. Is Patsy competing with Liz Hurley for the most obvious actor on the screen?
