A rather horrible undertaking suggests to the Welshman that he is a childish artist, dragged powerless towards the violent environment he knows best, but unable to resist the vacuous elaborations rooted in banal fantasy. The first story is a haunting language without a tongue, with a sci-fi B-movie premise. The second reaches a bit of intensity, but only through the indignant surplus that leads to the humiliation visited on its central character. The third and most laughable seems to aspire to be a Luxembourg sequel to Child's Play. The direction is constantly meaningless - all the whirling sound and fury, enslaved by the extreme unpleasantness of the environment; suffocating in a badly chosen soundtrack and in indifferently flashy acting. This is pure stupidity masked by a guerrilla sensibility - arbitrary and empty like the abstract images linking the three sections.
