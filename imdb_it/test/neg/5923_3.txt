I really liked the idea of ​​traveling between dimensions and I also liked Wade / Quinn's tension in the first few episodes. Some of the worlds they created gave the main characters extremely interesting backgrounds for their stories. However, as the show went on, there were more foolish disputes between friends and less a real bond. There was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescending. And every world had one of the characters that fell in love. The script became boring and everything was too exaggerated. Too bad it would have been nice to have a very close-knit gang of friends (a la Star Wars) that travels on different dimensions on TV for several years, rather than a tired band of knitwear collectors.
