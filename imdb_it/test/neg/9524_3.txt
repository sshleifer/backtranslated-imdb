AKA <br /> <br /> Proportions: 3 x 1.78: 1 with frame 2.39: 1 (Triptych) <br /> <br /> Audio format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> 1978: A working l 'class adolescent (Matthew Leitch) assumes a false identity and gatheca the high society, where he learns the hard lessons on the divisions between Rich and Poor. <br /> <br /> Autobiographical characteristic of the director Duncan Roy (JACKSON: MY LIFE ... YOUR FAULT), an exhibition of the pre-Thatcherite aristocracy, seen through the eyes of a "common people" at low cost , whose vision of the world is transformed by his adventures among the upper classes. Unfortunately, Roy's script says very little that we didn't already know about the excesses of the idle rich, and the narrative is only briefly lit by Leitch's relationship with a handsome but self-destructive rent guy (Peter Youngblood Hills) who turns out to be no less hypocritical of the same people he tries to emulate. Also played by Diana Quick (as an outrageous snob who believes working-class people are "embarrassed to be true!"), Bill Nighy as the black sheep of a wealthy family, Lindsay Coulson ("EastEnders"), Blake Ritson (DIFFERENT FOR THE GIRLS) and Georgina Hale in a typically flamboyant cameo, which makes her tits flash in every way, without worrying about the world! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, much of the film's impact is diluted by Roy's insistence on using a Triptych effect (three distinct images of 1.78: 1 are written within frame 2.39: 1, each of which provides a different point of view of individual scenes), which reduces the image and moves viewers away from the events on the screen. A long, useless film, too personal for a wide appeal, and hindered by a cinematographic process that fails to reconcile history at hand. A single image version is also available (theatrically framed at 1.85: 1), with the title on the screen AKA: LIES AS AS WISHES.
