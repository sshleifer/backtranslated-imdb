I saw him tonight and fell asleep in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's something I haven't done since then - I never fell asleep at the cinema. <br /> <br /> I LOVE the original and have seen it several times and recommend it to everyone. This may have been the problem, but I don't think so, because there were a couple of bright spots that showed that if they did well they could make this movie work. <br /> <br /> Bette was underutilized and Anne was over used and unbeliever. <br /> <br /> I don't know why the Englishman or anyone else brought this out in that condition. <br /> <br /> They declared it as Sex in the City, but better? Not surprisingly, I really enjoyed Sex in the City and was disappointed with this movie. <br /> <br /> So don't waste your money on this movie - go see everything except this one!
