I thought I saw something good but ... I'm tired after seeing this movie, I don't know what I hated most: the script, the acting, the FX or the music. Try to imagine the worst episode of Power Rangers and it would still be nice. I've seen better FX in FPS Games (the touch with the bone sword or its breath that makes people disappear in green smoke is a touch of genius) and the music seems to come from a spaghetti western. I liked the way the women in the car screamed, when the "monster" walked around the car (even though he was looking in the wrong direction). So give yourself a break and don't look at this, call at least someone to watch a horror movie with you, trust me you'll end up playing a monopoly for some kicks.
