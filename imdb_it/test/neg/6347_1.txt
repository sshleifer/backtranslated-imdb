One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Completely ridiculous. The story is ugly. The animations are completely childish and displaced. The physics of holograms is hilarious compared to how completely they are wrong. OMG, I even want to believe that this movie has a Disney label. How disgusting. The actresses are somehow beautiful, but there are so many good films with amazing actresses that are much more valuable to see than this one. Final comment, bad movie. Don't worry about watching it. If you are looking for movies to watch with your children consider other alternatives such as Ratattuile, Monster Inc or an enchanted story (in cinemas). Seriously.
