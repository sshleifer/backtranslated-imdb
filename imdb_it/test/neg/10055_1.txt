The veteran television director Ted Post treats us of a tiring, confused and ultimately meaningless story raised by Column B of Harold Robbins' Big Book Of Plots. Set against a Phoenix smog skyline, post-Charlies Angles Jaclyn Smith takes a star turn as "the woman whose eyes are mysteriously blacked out at all times" while James Jrk, impersonator James Franciscus, sits on the sidelines. <br /> <br /> Mannix goes western, monkeys are abused, models lean on classic cars, and Smith is constantly overshadowed by Sybil Danning until a yellow-style shell bitterly completes the whole mess . </> <br /> Oh yes, and there's Bob Mitchum too. Somewhere.
