Big D.B. try to keep the peace between the settlers and their red brothers. <br /> <br /> Boone (an elderly Bruce Bennett) must prove and prove to the local Indian chief (Lon Chaney, Jr., who seems drunk, as usual) that his son was killed by an asshole from the tribe that has also dealing with gun traffic when nobody is watching. Faron Young sings, even though he holds the gun as if it were a broom. <br /> <br /> OK western-adventure directed by two guys, none of whom has many credits for his resume, but this film is not bad and has a nice short execution time of 76 minutes.
