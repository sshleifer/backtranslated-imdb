This film shows somehow 6.2 stars, It seems inconceivable that the director has many relationships. I can't explain it. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. You only have a certain number of hours on Earth, don't waste 1 & 1/2 of them on this delayed steaming pile of Guano !!! <br /> <br /> There is no story as apparently the director "wrote" (and I suppose with a blunt orange marker) the script of the day after the filming of the day. The "story" has been defined as capricious, no it is without purpose, there is perhaps a "history" sufficient to fill a spot. Do you hate announcements? <br /> <br /> Now, while both protagonists can act, obviously they have decided not to do it. And in the same way the writer / director can actually write and direct as his next work "Toy Love" demonstrates <br /> <br /> So to recap, even if you get this movie for free, even if you're paid to watch it avoid it. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase Monty Python's search for the Holy Grail, "Run Run!"
