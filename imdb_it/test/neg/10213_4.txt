Hulk Hogan plays the role of a champion wrestler (a true acting actor ...) named Rip, who is forced to defend his honor, the title and his girlfriend from an avid corporation that wanted him to sign for their net (Because wrestling sells!) however, when Rip declines, the net gets a fighting circuit in a circuit called (and I'm absolutely serious) "Battle of the Tough" which is the champion Zeus (played by Tiny Lister Jr) maybe the most deadly man in life. Rip refuses to fight, until his brother is attacked and put into a hospital. No Holds Barred is more or less what I expected from the production of Vince McMahon, played by the less versatile actor of the genre (Hogan), it's basically a lot of involuntary humor, tons of awkward sequences, a couple of action sequences and tons of stupidity. In other words, it's not unlike wrestling itself, so I give it a fair assessment mainly because anyone who rents this knows what they're getting. The film is cheap but well made for what it is and probably wrestling fans will appreciate this. I myself found this ultimately hilarious. These are moments of such absurdity that you reduce only to yourself. (Like the way Hogan jumps 20 feet in the air after being stuck in a limousine, like forcing a guy to disgust himself and of course the way Hogan plays from his cuecard. (IE: "I'm not going to stay around when this check clears! ") No Holds Barred is very funny, true, although it's mainly because of how ridiculous it is. Fans of the camp should really enjoy this clever clinker. <br /> <br /> * * 4- (fair)
