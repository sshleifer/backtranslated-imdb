This is quite typical for the Sci-Fi channel: one-dimensional characters, a ridiculous storyline and terrible special effects. We have a pair of alien stocking puppets on a train, and Lou Diamond Phillips does his best with what little has been given to get a show. And save the day. All the others in this are absolutely superfluous; the ex-wife who crosses the clich√© of time praised first by not loving Lou, then naturally returns to love him again at the end. The hateful state senator who is chewed early and a bunch of boring security guards who run a lot. Then there is an eco-terrorist who is in this film for no reason at all, except to give us 3% more. He spends the entire central part of the film hidden in a box. <br /> <br /> The special effects really deserve their paragraph. We start with a meteorite flying through the air, dragging the flames behind it, about 100 miles an hour. According to the physics of this film, if you exceed the speed limit published in your car, atmospheric friction could make you catch fire. Then it lands on the hood of a car, arriving horizontally. I imagine like a Velcro landing on a velcro. In reality it does not damage the car very much, it bends a little on the hood. Later, Lou arrives by helicopter and runs after the train. Even if the train had only two minutes of advantage, it takes a good half hour to get it. The CGI is so ugly that the helicopter looks as big as the hills it's flying over. Then fly to the side of a mountain - this effect must be seen to be believed. It looks like they took a can of gasoline and threw it against a wall, then superimposed the effect of the flame on the helicopter. About 10 times too big. No wonder the helicopter could not stop in time, carrying five tons of nitroglycerin. Then the eco-terrorist eventually blows himself up, but instead of exploding in all directions like most explosions do, it explodes upward like a cannon aimed at the air. Then there's the whole problem of not being able to stop the train because this would allow the little aliens to get off, but it seems that the aliens can actually fly faster than the train, so why would this keep them on the train Overall, if you have a pair hours that they absolutely need to kill, and it's up to this movie or replicas on the food web, well, come to think of it, some of those cooks are nice. Usually these films have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them; maybe there's a sexy girl, a T & A, or a character who actually has a little personality, or some suspense or, well, something. I haven't seen any of this here.
