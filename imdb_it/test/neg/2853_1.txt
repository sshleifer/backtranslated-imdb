I sincerely wonder why this film was ever made. A Bulgarian-Italian co-production set in a Berlin version in which all Germans speak English with a German accent and all Turks speak English with some Turkish words in between, is hardly believable. English vocabulary is basically limited to "fuck you, bastard" and acting is worse than anyone can imagine. Apart from this, racial tensions in Germany can be an interesting topic, but in Germany I know that there are no gangs shooting each other in the middle of the street in broad daylight. And if all this were not enough, there is also a serial killer around who kills Turkish children and paints them white. To create tension, we see the serial killer and hear him humming Schubert's lullaby but we won't see his face. <br /> <br /> I don't even think they actually shot it in Germany. There are some street shots that are obviously in Berlin, but the actors don't see themselves in those shootings. Probably it is Bulgaria with some German signs added here and there.
