I recently flanked 8 ?? going and seeing this movie in the cinema. It was a waste of time and the only feeling of leaving the theater is a bit nauseating of all the disgusting social pornography. <br /> <br /> It might have been interesting if it had had a pretty absurd twist, but it wasn't so simply terrible with maybe one or two scenes that could have been taken out and done in very nice short films. <br /> <br /> Another thing I thought of is how the director uses all the final stereotypes as characters. It is extraordinary that you as a Finish director can make a film with the worst stereotypes of your nationality. He was sad to sit and hear the audience sitting and laughing at things they thought was typical Finnish, but in general it's just teasing people.
