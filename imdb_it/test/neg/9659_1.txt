First of all, this movie is not nearly complete, I suppose someone took the trouble to steal every other page of the script. <br /> <br /> The film contains bizarre journeys in time without warning, incoherent dialogues, misplaced details all over, music is not bad at all, other traces are misplaced, and also the fact that the volume rises and falls between the different tracks. The lab actually did a descent job, and that says a lot. Lost sound effects ruin the tension, though. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry does what he does best, he just looks worried and occasionally coughs with punchlines from hell. <br /> <br /> I seriously consider this film as the worst of 2007, and I saw some bad guys. Don't spend money on this, it's not so bad it's a laugh, it's worse. Ratings over 1 star should make a blacklist on IMDb, because it's a damn lie.
