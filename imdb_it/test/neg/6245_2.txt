In my ongoing quest to find the worst movie of all time, my friends and I have stumbled upon this little gem. It's hilarious, especially if you don't know (like we didn't) that it's a semi-sequel to another horror series. <br /> <br /> I will not go into the plot except to say that everyone complains about the horrible snowstorm coming (it was equivalent to the characters shouting "FORESHADOWING!" to the camera and waving their arms) , and, in some strange blow of fate, the snowstorm occurred. Budget problems, I guess. <br /> <br /> Add it to a magical front door that is opened or closed depending on the scary effect the director wants to create and the electricity is cut off until the gym teacher decides to take a shower with a lot of soap. I will admit it; I had trouble breathing in points. <br /> <br /> The only decent part of this film, as it turns out, was the original Slumber Party Massacre movie. It's a lot more fun now that I know. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * The end, where it is revealed that the slasher did it because his drunken friends came across her and a companion who got off and then a friend who drives on a train or something like that is probably the funniest psycho-pedagogical origin ever, amplified by the fabulous use of blurs and videos. I'm glad all the friends of the slasher completely forgot the incident until a flashback was needed. <br /> <br /> Run, don't walk, to take this and see the hilarity. Of course, the continuity editor should get an award for all this, if only they weren't stuck in that horrible snowstorm ...
