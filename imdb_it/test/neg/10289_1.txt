This is a snuff movie. I'm shocked that it's even considered in the IMDb library. And, Bill, Julia and all the other "professional" actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick movie. I thought I saw a somewhat classic horror film with a creative end that writers love to invent ... which usually makes no sense when you write a horror film, but as a spectator we try to rationalize and understand. This ending was not creative. He was sick and had all the characteristics of a tobacco movie. I am shocked that it was published for this finale, and more shocked that it will be released by the end of June 2009. It should not be shown in a theater. It is harmful to innocent minds on many levels .... watch the movie, the finale, and you will understand this statement. Also included in the plot is a sweet little girl "not yet 9" says her character. It is not at the end of the film, but it is an integral part of the film. Why do filmmakers feel they need to shock a sick movie to get recognition? The director has a wrong line of work if he thinks it's an art film.
