"The James Dean Story" is presented as "A different kind of film", explaining, "The presence of the protagonist in this film was made possible by the use of existing film material, tape recordings of his voice and by means of a new technique - dynamic exploration of static photography. "The only noteworthy" recording on tape of his voice "is a short recording that Mr. Dean makes while visiting his family in Indiana; he wanted to record any family memories of his great-grandfather Cal Dean, intrigued because he recited with a name similar to "Cal" in "East of Eden". Dean asks if Cal Dean was interested in art and learns that the relative was an auctioneer. James Dean was interested in art and had a warm relationship with his family, of course. This is the only 100% accurate revelation in this documentary. James Dean was interested in art and had an intimate relationship with his family. <br /> <br /> A fantastic "screen test" / "outtake" of "East of Eden" appears near the end of the film. It's a black and white scene between Dean (like Cal Trask) and co-star Richard Davalos (like Aron Trask). Dean is at his best fascinating. If this scene appeared only here, and the film "East of Eden" was not completed, this documentary would be an essential and high-level film. But the scene, a perfect "10" in isolation, should be considered an extra "of Eden of Eden". It is also worth seeing Dean's "Traffic Safety Film". <br /> <br /> There are scheduled interviews with family and friends. My favorites were the guy (Lew Bracker) who was examining a box of things that Dean had left with him and Dean's family. There was not enough for Aunt Ortense and Dean's letter to his cousin was very pretty. More reading of Dean's letters would have been welcome. The friend of Dean's unidentified writer seemed to have a better thesis for the film; the directors may have thought of developing it as a focal point. <br /> <br /> The direction of Robert Altman by Martin Gabel from Stewart Stern is terrible. What were they thinking? Perhaps, filmmakers can be forgiven because of the proximity of Dean's death. Don't expect "The James Dean Story" at all. This film is more about the effect of Dean on people (both fans and filmmakers) than on humans. It is very clearly a first piece of the legend "legend" by James Dean. Tommy Sands sings "Let Me Be Loved". The narrative refers to Dean as "He" with an air of god. The shots of Dean's family that seem to "know" when they die are really unfortunate. <br /> <br /> ** James Dean Story (8/13/57) Robert Altman ~ James Dean, Martin Gabel, Richard Davalos
