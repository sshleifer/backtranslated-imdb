When the fame of a film is the fame of the lesser and lesser known brother of Martin Sheen, you know it won't be very beautiful. "Soultaker" is a low budget, stupid film about a group of 20-year years haunted by an angel of death. It's a stupid movie, but it's pretty funny, and even somewhat likable in its stupidity. <br /> <br /> The film's plot is very small and is stretched as far as possible. Joe Estevez is not a great actor, so fortunately for the public, he has very few lines and his role mainly in his way of walking. This film really looks like it's trying to be a horror / fantasy franchise, considering it has the same storyline as a slasher. 4 characters, everyone dies one at a time ... will anyone live? Who really cares. Even though it seems he hated it, I didn't. I just didn't like it very much, but I was interested for the most part, so I think it's worth something. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 on ****. 90 minutes PG-13 for language, violence and nudity.
