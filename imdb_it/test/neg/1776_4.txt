I starred as Eugene Morris Jerome in my school adaptation of the play and this film is not up to Neil Simon's script or imagination. I know this game backwards and forwards and I can honestly tell you that acting was turned off, production was poor. The changes in the script of the game were badly done. If you really want to enjoy this show, you should see the current drama, not a Hollywood film adaptation. Eugene's character lacked soul and was overly sarcastic in all that he said. The other characters were also out of key. A general disappointment, messy, unfair to the show, performed amatrically!
