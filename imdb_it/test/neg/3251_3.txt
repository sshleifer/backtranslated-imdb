Usually they give sequel the benefit of the doubt and I go slow with them. But this is very poor. The same identical to what happened in the first film happens again here. The same identical. Only they wanted the younger children to see it (this explains the repeated presence of Bugs Bunny but because they threw a 'f * ck' is beyond me). <br /> <br /> They didn't even bother to change the character of Jackie Mason from Dangerfield. Allow me to explain, in CADDYSHACK Rodney Dangerfield played a terrifying real estate owner who angers members of the Bushwood country club. In this film, Jackie Mason plays a terrifying real estate owner who angers members of the Bushwood country club. A great effort they made to change the content of the script eh? No, I don't think so. Dan Aykroyd, very unpleasant, shamefully copies the character of Bill Murray. It also goes behind the gopher (now more like a Gremlin) in much the same way as Murray. <br /> <br /> There's no laughing matter. An example of the "comedy" in this film: Jackie Mason is preparing for a hot date with Dyan Cannon. He is in the bathroom is his robe. He moves to the door to get dressed in his bedroom when the door handle breaks. Wow!?! This is the best they can do. Eight years to think of a completely new sequel and that's all we get!?! I could have pulled a better script out of my ass. <br /> <br /> Look at it only if you are a huge fan of the original. It's the only way you'll find any kind of laugh. All others stay away.
