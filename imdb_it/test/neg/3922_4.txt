Sci-Fi of the early 1950s directed by Lesley Selander. The special effects of course are very primitive, but rather good compared to what else was out there then. Rate for the dual function of the drive-in film; still interesting enough to watch. Two prominent men, Arthur Franz, the brilliant young scientist Dr. Jim Barker and the journalist and journalist Steve Abbot (Cameron Mitchell) join in a flight to Mars with Carol Stafford (Virgina Huston), another scientist and two other experts space (Richard Gaines and John Litel). Upon landing on the Red Planet, space travelers encounter inhabitants who appear friendly and mentally advanced. In reality, the Martians are led by Ikron (Morris Ankrum), who has the idea of ​​conquering the Earth to vitalize their civilization. There is a beautiful Martian (Chapman of Maruerite) that Dr. Barker intends to take back on the return journey. She is the redeemable element of the film.
