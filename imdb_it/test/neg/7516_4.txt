Do you know that they really want to escape from the Moon? And in Geneve is the discussed project that could lead to making the time machine possible? All I can say about this film that is based on facts about the future (at the time of the film) but real scientific projects. I hope the moon does not exist like in the movie. Now about the film itself, I also saw the original film and I also read the book. I didn't like the book, but the film did. I completely agree with a previous comment that this film was depressing, unlike that of the 1960s. He was very good by force, this was just a parallel future of what is good film.
