He was so bumpy - he seemed to jump from one place to another - and the "thief" was obvious. He was a poor man (not to mention the high school) "less than zero". I would like to pass this film because it has very little to add. So many problems remain unsolved, and that's fine - but the fact that you jump to the point where you wonder what's going on is terrible. The voiceover is necessary because the film does not work alone. Avoid this movie and look at something else about a rich teenage angst. I'm sure there are many others to watch. Don't waste time with this.
