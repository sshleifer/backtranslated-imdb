Spoiler warning !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably my favorite Cary Grant movie. I spent most of the time thinking: ignoring it, leaving it, etc. Are you trying to kill her? Should we assume that after the end, when he convinces her to go home with him, that he will kill her after all? I see from checking in a couple of books that this is a reading that some viewers / critics have taken. Finishing early is, after all, a more reasonable way to film a book, rather than changing the ending - and this is a more unreasonable change than the ending compared, for example, to Altman's The Long Goodbye. Unlike Hitchcock's previous example of making the murderer not the murderer because a star was chosen (when Gosford Park refers to The Lodger, the murderous habits of Ivor Novello are not mentioned) the end of the book is not definitively excluded . <br /> <br /> In Robin Wood's Hitchcock's Films Revised, he writes: "From the final point of view at the end, the meaning of each scene changes, the apparent solidity of the narrative dissolves, the illusion of" reality " of fiction it disintegrates, the film becomes a "modernist" text in which the narrative process is brought to the fore. "I like to play games of intellectual interpretation like anyone else, but unless the film is able to read directly , then it fails. This fails. Even after considering the fatal glasses of milk that recur in some Hitchcock films. <br /> <br /> An annoying quirk. The year is 1941. Nothing in the film says it is set in the past. Does Beaky (Nigel Bruce) keep his money in a bank in Paris, and go there to do financial business? Don't you know there's a war? In fact, were there still flights from Croydon airport? Are you on good terms with the Nazis? How ever it was never suggested that the Germans shot him as a spy or something. <br /> <br /> A curiosity. When Johnnie and Lina have dinner with Isobel, the mystery writer, and her brother, the pathologist, there is a fifth person present, who is never explained or introduced - a woman in a tuxedo. The claims say she is Nondas Metcalf who plays Phyllis Swinghurst. Is this not an example of how lesbians have been encoded in the films of the 40s? Should we take her as Isobel's lover? Books that talk about blatant and hidden gays / lesbians in Hitchcock (for example, Robin Wood again) do not include Phyllis Swinghurst.
