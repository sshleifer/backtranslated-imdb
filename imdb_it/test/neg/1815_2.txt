After seeing the film version of Heart Of Darkness, I feel like I've wasted 100 minutes of my life. Although the book was not my favorite, I was very disappointed to see how badly Nicolas Roeg interpreted the story. Despite the fact that he missed a lot of important information, the cast didn't seem to fit into their roles and the whole movie seemed immensely emotionless. The book describes vivid scenes and details that are completely ignored in the film. <br /> <br /> You would think that a director would be able to insert 76 pages of a book into a film of at least an hour and a half. The differences have completely changed the story for me. For example, when the character of Kurtz's girlfriend is indifferent to the fact that Kurtz is dead, he completely changes the end of the book. Not to mention the sets and scenarios used in the film were not as beautiful as they were described. Honestly, it seems that Roeg is filming another story with Heart Of Darkness references embedded in it. <br /> <br /> If you watch the movie without knowing the title or you expect it to be something like the Joseph Conrad story, you might find it good. Even though I thought the camera worked poorly and the cast was unsuitable, it's still a catchy story. However, if you're looking for a good film version of the famous classic story, don't look for it in Roeg's movie.
