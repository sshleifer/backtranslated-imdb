We were thrilled to rent this after reading some reviews and saw that it marked so much here. Well, we took it at home and couldn't believe what we saw. It's basically like it was written by a perverted and tough old guy who couldn't help but put his frustrations and sexual fantasies into an anime film that really lacks plot and humor. The main character is everywhere ... a moment, he is like an immature little child, the next he is mature and intelligent, then heroic, then a perverted stalker. <br /> <br /> The worst part is all the sexual content out of place. I have no problem with sex and digging a film that has good sexual energy, but this is just presented in a way that is creepy. Nipple slides, close-ups of a girls' horse (many times) in white panties or a bathing suit. He was totally out of place and it seemed that the person who wrote him was trying to live fantasies through his cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> We were expecting something of a mature nature, but we just looked at each other and wondered what the hell was this ... besides tossing the cartoon tits and poor dialogue. If you want to see some neckline and horse cartoon characters ... this is for you. If you're looking for something beyond this, this movie was empty. The characters and the dialogue were simply irritating. <br /> <br />
