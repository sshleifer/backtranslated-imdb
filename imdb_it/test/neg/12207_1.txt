This version of David Copperfield is terrible from start to finish. I knew we would witness a wasted evening, when a little silly to embarrassment, Attenborough and Olivier camped him like two villains. After all this it was all downhill. Aunt Betsy was adequate, but she didn't have the eccentric talent for which she was noticed. The worst of the worst was the manufacturer's choice for Uriah. This was the music hall version of this character, previously and admirably played by Roland Young. And what was all this selfish anguish of David. Dickens must have rolled into his grave to see his favorite child turn into a drunkard crying in his beer. <br /> <br /> This was a time when Hollywood knew more than old England.
