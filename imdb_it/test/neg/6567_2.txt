While the Star Trek movie was mostly boring, Star Trek The Final Frontier is simply bad. In this terrible sequel, the crew is on vacation ashore when it receives a distress signal from the Federation that the ambassadors representing Earth, Romulus and Kronos (the world of Klingon home) have been kidnapped by a Vulcan rebel intent on reaching a spaceship to venture into the great barrier. There, he hopes to find God. Using mysticism and bad writing, he convinces many of the senior officers of the Enterprise to betray Kirk and take possession of the ship. They reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they meet a divine alien. This is so bad that it's hard to understand where to start. At the center is a good idea that is never really developed. The plot doesn't go anywhere, instead of where no man has gone before. It's almost as if the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. The action scenes don't have the suspense of Wrath of Kahn, the philosophy is boring, and the humor is stale. Now I will focus most of my anger on William Shatner. When he takes the director's chair, the ego gets bigger. Most of the focus is on him, Spock and McCoy, but not enough others to do. Moreover, while Shatner is usually guilty of having played too much in previous films and TV commercials, he is simply bad at it. Now Kirk is reckless, a practical and silly prankster. One of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song, "Row Row Row Your Boat" in a bonfire round. In any case, this is the worst of the Star Trek franchise. I should have given him three out of ten instead of five.
