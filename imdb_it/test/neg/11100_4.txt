This was a rather boring movie, actually. I think the problem with a French horror movie is that the French have to be easy to scare or something, because this film wasn't just scary. The special effects with the ghost of the mummy seemed not to belong to the film, as if someone had inserted them during post-production to make them more lively, because the actors barely reacted to them. <br /> <br /> The plot is just a kind of meander, which is the opposite of true storytelling. I imagine this was based on a French TV series, where they had to distil it into a two-hour movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a mummy was put out of stock in the Louvre, which apparently has such weak security that this girl and her boyfriend can break in several times. (So ​​this is how people continue to steal the Mona Lisa!) The boyfriend and police officer of the 1960s version of this film get together and try to exorcise the demon. <br /> <br /> So I'm not sure if this mom had to be bad or not. He kills two guards during the course of the film, but he just wants to get to the afterlife.
