Thank God I wasn't operating any heavy machinery, it could have been an even worse disaster. The shots were slow and very repetitive. Different scenes, same shots, medium shot, medium shot, medium shot, snooze. The plot was rather empty. William Hurt was the worst. Where did you get that stupid accent from? The random shots of the scenario just to include them have not added much. There were more Arbor shots traveling in his car than anything else. The director really didn't bring us into any of the scenes and didn't make me feel for any of the characters. I would have valued it to zero if IMDb had the option. Great sedative if you can't sleep. It's been 2 hours of my life that I'll never come back.
