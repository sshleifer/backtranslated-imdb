I agree with a commentator who says that it is really impossible to review Glen or Glenda? objectively. If this is done, the film on its merit should be evaluated as quite terrible, given the exhilarating and twisted dialogue, the generally mediocre or poor acting of the cast as well as zero production values. However, such an assessment does not capture the absolutely compelling experience of watching this film as it unfolds. It is not the fact that the subject of the film is transvestism and that in the 1950s it was a controversial choice for lifestyle. Nor is it the demand for tolerance for people who embrace alternative life choices that fascinate if not as a historical relic. No, what makes Glen or Glenda? still a fascinating film after 50 years is that Ed Wood has laid bare his psyche in a way that so-called auteur directors like Hitchcock or Godard, despite their enormously superior talent, never did. In Glen or Glenda, Wood is not afraid to reveal his deeply conflicted feelings about being a transvestite despite the request for tolerance throughout the film. In fact, the film's conclusion suggests that Ed Wood's Glen's character will be able to "kill" his female counterpart Glenda by transferring the feelings of love and affection Glen has for his female counterpart to his future wife, Barbara. The psychiatrist also reassures Glen and Barbara that, while Glen is doing that psychic transference, Glenda will disappear. So, while Wood could invoke the tolerance of transvestites in general, he was not so sure of wanting it alone. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Wood was not afraid to throw everything else that went through his head. He did it with any stock material that could get his hands on. If it wasn't consistent, so what? What the viewer saw in Glen or Glenda was Ed Wood's imaginative world in all its fundamental strangeness. <br /> <br /> The only comment I wish to add to my comment above is that my two-star rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria mentioned in the first paragraph. The strangely memorial effect of the film, despite its technically atrocious qualities, I don't think can be evaluated.
