"Yagyu ichizoku no inbo" (let's just say "The samurai of the Shogun") is a place between horribly boring and incredibly painful to watch. As a historical epic, it could have had a much better chance of being a rich saga ... but in reality it is nothing more than another low-cost action movie from the 70s with a story based on real events and a sporty Sonny the Chiba eye patch. Before the point in the middle of the film, I was even tempted to commit seppuku! The music is like a thousand dogs in heat crying in their ears for a melody composed by Ennio Morricone (which is not an insult to Morricone). The use of cinematography with zoom lenses is more nauseating than fascinating. And in terms of action, in reality it is nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and non-not-have shocks. What a terrible movie.
