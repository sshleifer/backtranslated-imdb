This series takes a classic story and makes it garbage. Robin is somehow disoriented by a moose-man in the forest and is involved in all sorts of druidism and satanic episodes. The story speaks more of him avoiding the evil sheriff than helping the poor. This is barely watchable. And to complete all the ridicule, they kill Robin at the end of series 2 and replace him with another actor. Some people may like this show as a fantasy show but it is NOT a Robin Hood show. If you want Robin to fight in the name of King Richard against Prince John and the Sheriff and if you want Robin to feed the poor and the oppressed, watch the classic series or the most recent BBC series.
