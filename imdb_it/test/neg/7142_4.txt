Hey! The Grudge 2! How are you? I have a friend I would like to meet you. The Grudge 2 meets Johnny's Worst's 2006 list. Johnny's 2006 Worst list meets The Grudge 2. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? I had the impression that this should have been a sequel to The Grudge rather than a remake. If so, why does it do nothing but repeat the original? This floater doesn't even look like a movie. It's just a 90-minute soundtrack of the strange contortionist girl who makes that annoying crackling sound. <br /> <br /> Sound I would recommend not to get me started. It was a bit scary the first time I heard it, but I heard it about 12,367 times since 2004, so it's pretty much its course. And it's made even more annoying by the 20 people in the audience who thought it would be fun to imitate the sound whenever there was a quiet spot in the film. Sigh. <br /> <br /> People, YOU'RE NOT FUN, THEN SUGGEST! I promise you, EVERY TIME a character was walking slowly through an empty room (that's about 97% of the movie), someone in the audience would turn it on, "Uhhhkkkkkkuuuuuhhhhhkkkkkk". Yes, I know it's a horrible way to replicate the sound with letters, but you get the juice. So a guy from the audience would chuckle and, in order not to be outdone, deliver his own interpretation. I was very close to walking in the audience and punching random people. <br /> <br /> I told you not to get me started. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing about The Grudge 2 that I can recommend. There is no single scare or original idea in the whole film. There is no memorable acting performance. Are you a fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar? Welp, enjoy its two minutes of screen and a line of dialogue. Are you a fan of Amber Tamblyn? I hope you can deal with the fact that he has nothing else to do but walk around looking like he's suffering from a pinched nerve. Can you believe that the story (if you can call it that) is even worse than that of The Grudge? <br /> <br /> At least the original was quite disturbing and boasted some effective jumping scenes. I didn't skip once during this lametrosity (yes, I did the word, face it). Quite right. Not once. The "fears" are so produced and are so clearly telegraphed that there is absolutely no shock value once the "gotcha" moment comes. Watching this movie is like playing a good game of chess - you're always ahead of four or five scenes. <br /> <br /> There are also some strange scenes launched that make absolutely no sense. One that immediately comes to mind is a scene in which a girl drinks a liter of milk and then starts to regurgitate it in the jug. Eh? I say HUH?!?! The audience laughed. I shook my head and sighed. There was a lot during the film. To laugh. Sighing. Shake your head. Fall asleep (I did it twice). <br /> <br /> The film also makes an attempt at a fifth heart in a "twist" plot. Wow. It's so bad that I don't think we should even honor it by labeling it as a turning point. Did they really think that someone would be surprised by the revelation of someone hiding under their hooded sweatshirt? Please. It was as shocking as Elton John coming out of the closet. <br /> <br /> And of course the ending goes to the whole "look, we could have another sequel". As the credits rolled, the audience booed. My feelings exactly. If the public had paid money for this pand burger then things would probably have become violent, and I would have been happy to lead the charge. <br /> <br /> We learned from The Grudge that there is a Japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful rage, then a curse is left behind. Just like a Ben Affleck film, it is a "stain" that forever becomes part of the place where death occurred. Well, in The Grudge 2 we learn that when a horror movie covers the budget during its opening weekend, then its sequel will be done, and most of the time it will be so bad and leave a stain on any theater where the film movie shows . <br /> <br /> THE GIST <br /> <br /> If you are a total wimp and have never seen The Grudge then this could provide some economic fright. But I strongly advise you to save money, otherwise there is a good chance that you will become the one who leaves the theater with a grudge.
