A group of people goes into the jungle for various reasons, and eventually finds a lost city (where apparently they are the Diamond Kings of Solomon) and a race of super-gorillas ... Now, you know you're in trouble when you put good actors like Linney and Curry in a movie that reads ... a talking gorilla, and that's just the beginning. Ok, what else ...? <br /> <br /> For an action / adventure film, the film is ... well, that's exactly what it is missing. The first hour (!) Of the film I'm not even in the jungle, just trying to get there, with subplot after subplot (something about a local military regime, whatever), and when they finally do ... it's just no more fun. <br /> <br /> The effects of the film are just so-and-so (and really bad compared to the previous Jurassic Park movie). <br /> <br /> Now, the ending .. The father does not take care of the death of his son, but is only interested in diamonds? Uh-huh ... only in movies, people, only in movies. <br /> <br /> A complete waste of talent, this adaptation by Chricton (Jurassic Park, Twister, ER). 2/10.
