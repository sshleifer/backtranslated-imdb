Someone should teach the people who made this film that there is a difference between "presenting more twists" and "fucking the audience". They even use hypnosis as a tool to cover the holes in the plot; whenever they can't get in or out of a scene, they simply say "he's regressing to his past" or "she's coming out of this moment", and they think that explains everything. This film is a dishonest crook and in the last 20 minutes it becomes a real fiasco. (* 1/2)
