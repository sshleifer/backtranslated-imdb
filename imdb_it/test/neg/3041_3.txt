This is so overly cliche that you would like to turn it off after the first 45 minutes. The beginning is very interesting, with a fair going on and someone is killed. This film would have been better, set on this setting. <br /> <br /> So, Jill Johnson is a depressed sprinter with boyfriend problems. I don't see the point of adding the breakup with her boyfriend that occurs in any of the events in history. <br /> <br /> Since Jill came home late, her father babysits her for the Mandrakis in their glamorous home on a desert lake. The children are sleeping and the maid is cleaning up, another empty house next to her son who is in college. OK. <br /> <br /> After about half an hour of his ambush around the house alone, he gets a couple of hangings. Ooh, those scary ones. To which his friend comes to the rescue, to come up with a couple of high school jokes about "love" and so on. Friend goes and goes to his car. To which then, she drops her keys. Uhhh ... then the music! DumDumDum ..! She fumbles to get them and gets into the car. Which, of course, doesn't start. How much was a clich√© ...? So ... disappears = D Jill, alone again. UH. (Most of this film is with her alone, so there's not much dialogue) So the more you regret, you call the police. Who says he can't help her, but calls back if he has other problems. <br /> <br /> So you suspect your boyfriend is calling, or your boyfriends are calling. They have been but only once. How this should be very scary? Oh, and did I say? Her friend now arrives on caller ID and a disturbing man's voice comes on. He gets scared and avoids himself. <br /> <br /> Yes, jump like this. He sees that the light in the house of the son of the Mandrakis continues. So she runs through the woods with music like her partner and enters. Bleheh. <br /> <br /> AH ITS SO BORING I CANT CONTINUE !!!!!!!!!
