I'm coming out to fight here because this movie was shot so well and so well projected that I'm angry about its de-evolution twice more than I would have been with a minor job. Without revealing too much of the plot, I can only say that the first part of my VHS 2 set was a nerve-racking and unfolding delight of bizarre but plausible plot developments. The main character was appropriately naive but also intelligent and very very open. The events he is quickly forced to deal with are the separation of his parents, the cultural shock when his Pakistani roots collide with a complete failure of English society in the 1960s, his father's dubious transformation into the revered Buddha of Suburbia, and his cousin's transformation into a feminist militant while his best friend suddenly becomes an icon of the flourishing punk movement of the seventies. Among other things. <br /> <br /> What angered me was the amount of detailed work that each actor put into creating and establishing their characters in the first part, only to have everything that is destined for porn episodes very much bad in the second part, too many to justify the development of the plot, and too explicit to even look erotic. My biggest gripe is when the filmmakers let their private fetishes interfere with the truth of their film, and this for me was a supreme example. <br /> <br /> I felt a bit like I was invited to a party of very intelligent and funny strangers, just to have closed doors and guests not allowed to interact, and all of us, instead, are forced watching 70s sex porn movies. What an insult to the hard work of these fantastic actors! Why not create a cheeseball shot to begin with? And why launch a great main character who can actually act, and then break away from him every time you're building a big show? I almost felt like he too got tired of the endless sex scenes in which all he did was lie down there pumping his pelvis for yet another naked actress. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line - The first part is a minor genius, Part Two are the perversions of second-level soap operas. I know the book is quite explicit, but I heard that these good actors were exploited in real life as their characters were in the film, and it made me very angry and very uncomfortable. Only John Waters can bring out such degradation of actors and plot and make it appear artistic. My suggestion is to look only at the first part, throw the second into the proverbial pile of garbage, and you will love the Buddha forever. Score A + F = 0
