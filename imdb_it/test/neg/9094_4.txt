A chilling and bloody tale of a couple who inherit a 150-room Italian castle while still complaining about the loss of their young son. The marriage of the couples appears to be on the rock due to the accident that took the life of his son and left his blind daughter. After making the inventory of the castle for a future sale, a horrible, tortured and deformed creature breaks to lose it from the bowels of the 12th century castle. Pretty bloody with great horror atmosphere and some sexual traits. Played by Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Jessica Dollarhide and Elisabeth Kaza.
