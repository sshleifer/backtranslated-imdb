You could have put the characters on the island for whatever reason and have the same movie. The first had an original story, the second one from King Kong, and at the end (I hope) of this trilogy the story seemed to have been completely circumvented. Drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives. That was all there was to do. The special effects were decent but not worth $ 8. If you have a discounted theater in your area, wait and see for a dollar. I wouldn't even worry about renting it. Too much money for this shocking thriller.
