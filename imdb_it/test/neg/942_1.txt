I see absolutely nothing weird --- not even remotely funny --- in this stupid movie. An unrealistic, silly, ridiculous idea - simply completely ridiculous. Hard to believe that the main character, who seems so articulate, intelligent and imaginative, would not be accepted in any university. Even more difficult to believe is that nobody closes the place. The actors have portrayed characters directly from Characterville. We have seen many times in many films. Nothing new here. I found it on TV late at night, and since there was nothing else, I watched the whole movie boring and stupid. What a total waste. Maybe if you are a teenager, you might find it funny. Movies are made for an immature mind, so guys, try it. The rest, no.
