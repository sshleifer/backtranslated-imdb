The film wasn't so bad, especially with regards to the plot, but the actor (and hairy!) Who he chose for the lead role was a bit skeptical in the acting department. I would have chosen someone else. The idea of ​​"going to America" ​​was very ingenious, and the main character who questioned everything he had ever known made him a little funny, but not so much when there is a pasty blob for a leading actor. <br /> <br /> The plot was interesting. This leads to the question of how the theme of cloning will be managed in the future. Certainly cloning would not be allowed for the purposes of the film, but it is still a valid argument even for today. The clones are still people ... right? <br /> <br /> The film was not particularly special, but it is still much better than some of the cheeses released in the 1970s. Let's not forget the "Giant Spider Invasion". I give it a 4, since it didn't TOTALLY smell, but the MST3K version makes this movie a 10. (I still like Dr. Super Mario!) You'll like this movie, but it won't be your favorite.
