Because there can't be better TV movies, today I was on a free day and I watched this movie on a satellite channel in the UK. What a terrible waste of my time it was. Poor sets, Poor acting and Oh my God, what a terrible flood. Blimey that woman can even run faster than a stream of water! <br /> <br /> I'd really like people to make TV movies using better effects, better or at least credible storylines, and far better acting. Killer Flood is well up there with poor acting. A few pieces of ham could do nothing worse. <br /> <br /> 1 last thing I really agree with the comment on the dog, but I think it would have already been put to the test in real life!
