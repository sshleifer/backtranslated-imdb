To think that it could only improve was the worst hypothesis I have ever made .... <br /> <br /> Drivvle does not describe this film well enough! <br /> <br /> Not only is the plot thin, but I have a more emotional acting from my fish! <br /> <br /> It was a shame to see Pete Postlethwaite, whom I respect as an actor who tries to do the best with the little he has had to work with ... <br /> <br /> I think a cartoon cut by Stephen Baldwin would have done a better job, and in fact I was more animated. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! This could really be dangerous for your health!
