Being a wrestling aficionado, fight movies generally suck (Backyard Dogs, Bodyslam, Jesse Ventura) but this is not the worst I've ever seen. Yes, it's bad but it's better than some of the others I've mentioned. <br /> <br /> Hulk Hogan plays the role of himself and, for some reason, a rival network wants to beat him because he doesn't want to be on that network. Let me explain to you so that everyone can understand .... photos USA Network has Rip ... and TNT will do anything to get him. <br /> <br /> Makes sense ... no? Well, don't feel bad because it doesn't make sense. Nor does it make sense that a legitimate ex has a REAL fight with Rip at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> None of this film makes much sense, but compared to other wrestling films and following Hogan's films its not so bad. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
