Needing to take a deep breath for this ... <br /> <br /> Terrible special effects that have tried to go well beyond the budget. Brash and shameless plagiarism of other science fiction films (like Pitch Black). Terrible acting. Endless slow motion scenes of characters walking the sand dunes aimlessly. A meandering dialogue that does nothing to promote history. Characters wearing turtleneck sweaters on a deserted planet with only two. A "merchant" ship equipped by a team of soldiers armed with camouflage suits (why exactly would you still need to camouflage the forest in space?). Some of the worst casting choices in the history of the no-budget movie - a swollen "captain" of steroids that looks more like a muscular-beach athlete than a trusted commander, and a "convict" who looks and acts like a dangerous rabbit . 70 minutes in length, 35 of which could have been cut if the director had some idea of ​​"compression of time through editing" ... <br /> <br /> I will not go forward. Suffice it to say that while some components of this horrible film may (and should) be forgiven because of the low budget; the bad conception, the ridiculous plot holes and the script that induce snoring are unforgivable on * any * budget. The end result is a boring, boring, waste of time. Sorry guys, I hate being so hard on an amateur movie, but you have no excuse for completing this kind of work.
