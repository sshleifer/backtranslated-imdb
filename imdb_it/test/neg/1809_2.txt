A version for the TV version of Heart of Darkness seemed like a good way to add more information to the book, well, that was the wrong assumption. The film made it even worse. I was very disappointed with almost everything in the film. I was hoping the film could help put together the pieces of the book I didn't understand, but it didn't do anything like that. He left me still confused and suspended. It is one of those movies that makes it seem like it would be more fun to watch the grass grow instead of watching the movie. It's not exactly anyone's cup of tea. It was a terrible film, boring and slow. <br /> <br /> To begin with, Nicolas Roeg must have been rather desperate when he decided he wanted to take on the task of making the book already boring in a movie. It is a guaranteed loss. It's like going to fight a knife, but forget the knife on the kitchen counter. The person without a shirt is about to lose; and in the case, the person without a shirt was Roeg. All I've heard about the movie are bad things, and the movie deserves those bad things to say about it. From the viewing of the film, I had the impression that the people who made the film, had leafed through the book to get the key points. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, although the film followed the main plot of the book, it left out some details, and even changed the ending. I'm not a fan. Roeg left when Marlow and his crew met the Russian sailor's camp, and in that camp they found the book. He also didn't show when the camp came across the sign that reads "Wood for you. Hurry up, approach it carefully" (Conrad 110). Also, at the end of the book, Kurtz dies on the boat, not in the inner station. In contrast, Nicolas Roeg did something good while he was shooting the film; he managed to hire some decent enough actors to star in the film. For example, he acquired Tim Roth and John Malkovich, who would later on both undertake successful careers. In doing so, he added something to the horrible movie. Besides, even if I'm cutting his book to shreds, I have a certain respect for him, because it takes a lot of courage to try to face The Heart of Darkness. It's not exactly the easiest novel to film in a movie. Twus a valiant effort, though! In conclusion, if for some reason someone really wants to see this film, I suggest first reading Heart of Darkness. In this way, you will have all the scenes that have been left out of the movie and you will not get completely lost when you look at it. But I really advise you not to read the book and not really look at the film; both will be a complete waste of time. Trust me. I was forced to do both by my English teacher, and now I wish the book and the film didn't exist. If the book or film is pursued, good luck!
