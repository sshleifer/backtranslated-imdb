This film had a very twisted and very elaborately set plot, which I, frankly, could not follow, which is surprising considering that acting and dialogue may have been only the product of writing a kindergarten. If you like Kathy Ireland, then maybe you would like to see it. The film was probably made as a vehicle to try to bring it to Hollywood, but if that were its goal I would have to say that I hope it didn't invest too much money in its production.
