I went to see this movie at the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least pleasantly fun. The only thing I liked was when Robin Williams crashed into the car at the bottom of the hill, and finally, when he seems to have been killed. Glenn Close was nasty and obviously didn't seem old enough to be Garp's mother. A mother like Garp's would have had her children taken away by the Department for children and families. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams and her glazed donut-like look of benign goodness are simply too sweet and affectionate to me. He has two roles that he can play: funny person or sad, tragic, good-hearted victim. See the Fisher King, Good Morning Vietnam, and all his so-called "dramatic" roles. It is always the same performance. Put it all together in a long mini series. Glenn Close is always a cold fish. Remember the fatal attraction? Would you have a relationship with her even on your worst day and if you were single? Did you feel any spark between you and Michael Douglas ?? Have you ever seen Glenn Close warm up any screen ?? John Lithgow had the only interesting role. This was the day he played serial killers and bad guys, so seeing him as a transsexual was at least fun. Garp is made for all those people who love to see films about sick, abnormal, dysfunctional people and then say that it is beautiful and deep.
