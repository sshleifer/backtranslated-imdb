Creating a comedy is like walking on a rather thin tight rope. It works or not. Grandma's Boy is one of those movies that doesn't work. It may have some very fun parts, but for the most part, it's just a terribly unpleasant comedy from the usual supporting characters in the Adam Sandler movies (without Sandler himself, he's just a producer). <br /> <br /> Alex (Allen Covert) is a game tester. He is 35 years old and is the best tester and game player in his workplace otherwise full of children. He ends up taking his apartment and his things he took to not pay the bills (as it turns out, his roommate had just spent the rent money on Filipino prostitutes and didn't pay the landlord). Desperate, he moves in with his grandmother, Lilly (Doris Roberts of Everybody Loves Raymond) and his two roommates. <br /> <br /> This is the basic plot of the film, cast with subplots on a new girl named Samantha (Linda Cardelli, unrecognizable from her days as Velma in Scooby Doo) who tries to convince testers to complete a new game as fast as possible, a game similar to a robot that creates the prodigy JP (Joel Moore) who works with Alex and wears much of the same clothes as Neo in The Matrix and, of course, all kinds of sex-related jokes and drugs. That's all. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film, besides the fact that the real conflict in the film occurs and is resolved in the last fifteen minutes of the film, is that it is not funny at all. It's absolutely boring, and only sparingly funny. Nothing really happens. No emotion, no real sense of direction and a lot of intense oaths. You find yourself perhaps laughing at some funny jokes that the actors say, but otherwise sit in total boredom, wishing you hadn't even worried about the movie. The way this film was lit by green and how Fox thought it could make money will always remain a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> There is really no entertainment value to come from. None of the actors is actually performing well, they act like idiots for the camera and hope for the best. Stoner's comedy has been done many times and sometimes it really works (Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle and Dazed and Confused come to mind). Here, it makes the film even less fun than it already is. The random inclusion of a monkey and a pair of naked breasts does not make the film better. <br /> <br /> In addition to some funny jokes, this movie should have just come out completely. It's not very funny, the whole plot is stupid, boring, and it's just a horrendous movie. Avoid it like the plague. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
