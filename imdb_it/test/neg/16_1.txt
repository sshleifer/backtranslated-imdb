For years I have been a big fan of Park's work and "Old boy" is one of my favorites of all time. <br /> <br /> With many expectations I rented this movie, only to find the worst movie I saw for a while. It's not a real horror movie; there is no suspense and even the "light" part is so lame, that I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> I introduced my younger brother to Chan-Wook Park and what a disappointment he got from this. For me, an idol has fallen. <br /> <br /> If you loved movies like "Old boy", Mr & Lady "Vengeance" or even his short films on "Three extremes", don't waste time, the film is not worth it.
