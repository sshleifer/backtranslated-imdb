I never comment on a movie, but I have to say that this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I feel it was created by a film student for beginners and not to put talented students down, but it was horrible! I didn't buy the lead actress and I felt like I was in acting with her while she was in the cinema. His decisions were very safe and I feel he was imitating other actresses in the movies and not acting and making his decisions. The management was very confused and the sound was stronger than the actors themselves. The end may have made a little more sense if there was someone telling the events and not a song. I love Patsy Cline, but his songs appear very often in movies. Perhaps the selection of the songs could have been a little more original. The "crazy" song was such a clich√©. As I said before, I never commented on movies and saw my share of good and bad, but this was the worst. Sorry.
