This is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> I can usually sit in a Van Damme movie if I have to, since they are usually a bit of a laugh and don't require much thought. This has no saving features. <br /> <br /> It has a distinct lack of plot, humor, acting, direction, etc. A real stinker at all levels. <br /> <br /> I never came out of a movie theater during a movie, even though I came here from up close. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
