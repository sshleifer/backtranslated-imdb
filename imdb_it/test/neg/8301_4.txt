Although I had already watched this time some time ago on Italian TV, this time I found a surprisingly tolerable potter, supported by an international cast of well-known faces (including a mocking Joseph Cotten in the baron's shoes) and, contrary to many another film of the Euro-Cult subgenre, a crashed plot instead of a lethargic rhythm. <br /> <br /> The creature itself seems a bit dubious and Cotten is a little too old to be taken seriously by an eager scientist still dabbling in creating life forms from corpses (one would have thought it would have been done army of them now and did not strive to perfect his technique yet) but Ms. Neri looks good in and out of costume and reliable Herbert Fux is probably the best as a lecherous grave-thief / blackmailer.
