OK, fan, it's on DVD. But the only reason to watch this is 1) say that you did it (because of his notoriety), or 2) if you're a Bill Paxton fan. I'm not a fan of hardcore music, but it was fun to watch and it was the only thing that kept me from abandoning this simple boredom. It's a shame, because this could have been a good movie with a little screenplay and if done by someone with a bit of intelligence (and with a cast driven by someone besides Judd Nelson, totally disbelieving and without talent). Of course it's bad, but it's BAD, and not in a positive sense. If after reading all the comments on how weird and disgusting this film you are still interested, give yourself a favor and look at some bizarre, disgusting and dystopian filth instead. There are films by John Waters, David Lynch, "Braindead" by Peter Jackson, "Basket Case" by Henenlotter, etc. There is much better out there.
