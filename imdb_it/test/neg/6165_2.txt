I'm sorry guys, everyone who thought that this movie could be something exceptional, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The standard, the film we wanted to set, is completely ruined by a very simple plot. So simple, that the film does not evolve until the end. I wondered if the plot was about the action but the main character (played by Mickey Rourke), but I found out that the character was inconsistent - either he is a professional murderer or a guilty brother. But both of them don't go together, because the guy who tries to drive places him in dangerous situations where no professional killer would put himself. Now, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, he is a good-looking actor, but he played his somewhat unnatural character. I didn't believe in his acting, it seemed that the director tried to bring out a personality he could not provide. And he didn't have to, because his less crazy behavior was quite disturbing. The only one to act great was Diane Lane. If it wasn't you, I'd give this movie 1 star. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I expected to see some well played movies and some interesting plot. And I completely upset him with my high expectations.
