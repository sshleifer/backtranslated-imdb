This movie is really bad, and I usually suck for bad movies, but it was too much. Seeing this is like OD'ing on pure SUCK. Now, you might think you saw the bottom of the cane. You may have passed all the titles of Full Moon and Troma, all the films of Edward D. Wood Jr., Uwe Boll, Albert Pyun and directed on DVD films of faded men of action. You may have also seen Death Tunnel, Ghost Lake and a wide range of films covered by MST3K, but in their original form. But you don't really know the awesome movie until you've seen Darkhunters. And if you didn't, you shouldn't. Don't worry Not only this film is incredibly written, directed, filmed, edited, acted and smeared in cheap and inexpensive effects. First of all, it's a pretentious mess. But not good, Greenaway or pretentious or exhilarating Lynch style messed up in a sort of Ittenbach or Early Waters fad. It's the kind of pretentiousness that comes when someone incredibly stupid thinks he's found something incredibly smart. A bit like M. Night Shaymalan (sp?), Only that the man looks like a mad messiah when compared to this train (and this comes from a climbing hater Shaymalan). It's also boring. It's not boring to go boring, which is okay, if the movie rewards your patience. Darkhunters does nothing of the kind. It's boring in an "Oh my God (King God, if I see another shot of a cat set to an odious audio signal, I'm going to re (kill myself)" - in a sense. <br /> /> About those who claim to like this film, he is a brazen liar and anyone who claims that this film is complex or profound knows what a mother is like in bed.
