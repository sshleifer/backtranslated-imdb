It's only when a band is touring and has only one original member. It is not the same as the classic line. All new actors play the main roles of Rag, Scotty, etc., with Ashby as virtually the only face back of the first movie. And it was just a small note from the first film, which served as the only redeemable group of the three guys that Scotty was trying to help meet the females. The film is poorly written, with the most stupid dialogue on this side of Armageddon. Even for a T & A movie, this is a turkey. Not even the low budget hard films of the 80s fans will want to sit in this film, which has no plot and many negative aspects. This film would have been better without ever being released. Simply ugly.
