This film is proof that you can't just go to a Redbox and read the descriptions of the movies and pick one and try it. <br /> <br /> While I will give them great credit for producing a film with special effects halfway on such a low budget, and at least a decent script and storyline ... unfortunately, it was just that: half decent road. <br /> <br /> If you like movies where things are not all in all, and don't worry about cheap effects, you might like this movie. Honestly, it wasn't really my cup of tea. I should have gone to bed rather than spending time watching. <br /> <br /> For a sci-fi movie best produced on a LOWER budget (!) Take a look at "Primer".
