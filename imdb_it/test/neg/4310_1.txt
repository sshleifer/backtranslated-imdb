Sure, you can put an airplane model on a black background and call it sci-fi, and that's enough to get me interested, so if you're like that, Black Horizon will interest you at least before you watch it. The best part of the film is when they shoot some real footage of a shuttle launch. <br /> <br /> The film sounds like the Naked Gun series, cop cops spoofing with bad clich√©s and bad acting. Unfortunately, I don't think they wanted to be funny, the actors are really made of cardboard, the dialogue really sucks, so just laugh at them and not with them. <br /> <br /> a side note, it is rare to see a film that takes place halfway in outer space, half on earth, and is not to be confused between expected extraterrestrials and supernatural events. I really feel sorry for a more realistic drama based on our space efforts.
