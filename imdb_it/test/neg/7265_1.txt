In short, this film is a declaration of artistic failure. <br /> <br /> Almodovar is easily the most important European director of the 80s and 90s. No other living director has shaped the style and content of current European cinema more than he. It is therefore not easy to affirm that his last effort is not just another disappointment after two lackluster films, but rather a complete and total disaster that confirms that he has exhausted ideas, humor and, worst of all, empathy for the characters creates. <br /> <br /> This is not due to the complexity of the story. All Almodovar films are almost impossible to summarize. This time, in fact, it's pretty easy if you're familiar with his previous work. "Broken Embraces" is a remake of "Law of Desire", only this time the director is straight and his jealous lover is a millionaire. <br /> <br /> For those not familiar with that movie, I'm making a summary. If you don't want to know too much, please skip this paragraph. A blind man, who was a famous director, seduces a sexy and sexy woman who reads a sheet for him after a casual street encounter (yes, really, that's how it starts). Just then he receives a visit from his agent and best friend. He tells her that he learned from the newspaper that a certain millionaire is dead, reporting the story 14 years ago. He can still see and is about to direct his next film. He reveals the inexperienced lover of the said millionaire as the protagonist, since he is immediately struck by her. The millionaire discovers their relationship through silent videos made by his gay son, who has his lip synchronized by an interpreter (some fantastic scenes: Cecilia Roth). After violent controversies, the lover escapes with the director to a seaside resort where he discovers that the millionaire, who produced the film, published it in the worst possible edition, destroying the director's reputation. The couple decides to return, but has an accident in which the director becomes blind and the aspiring actress dies. In the present, he discovers that his agent has preserved the negatives of the film and starts rebuilding it. <br /> <br /> As in "Bad Education", there are various secondary plots to reinforce this rather subtle story, and as in "Bad Education", the result is more confusing than satisfying. For example, the agent's son, who works as a DJ, has an accidental drug overdose - which is completely useless for the plot, and also played pretty badly. <br /> <br /> Mainly, however, the actors must not blame, but how their characters are written. Blanca Portilla as an agent has so many skeletons in her closet that not even a brilliant performance can save the character from ridicule. Lluis Homar is the dream of an old man of a protagonist, who lives in an artificial world in which an English alias and some sweet words can seduce any super-model. And Penelope Cruz is the embodiment of this old man's sexual fantasy. His character is completely lifeless. The reason why it would have passed from an old man, who at least helped his family, to a man a little less old, who is not charming enough to convince either as a romantic hero or as a passion, remains completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> But all these shortcomings would not make this film so horrible. However, Almodovar does the worst thing possible of a director (or any kind of narrator) short of ideas: he cites, something he has increasingly done and with very few benefits. The film inside the film, which "Broken Embraces" uses as a guiding device for the plot, is actually "Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown" (1988), only this time it's called "Chicks and suitcases ". This somewhat unimaginative title can give you a hint about how this beloved classic is treated: while the dialogue that composes the last ten minutes of "Broken Embraces" is a frenetic and extravagant exchange of unique headlines in the original film, here is a severe, colorless, annoying business meeting. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is the DOA conceived by a grueling creator of wonders of the past, almost as horrible and disappointing as the last feature of Indiana Jones. Perhaps not so many people would agree, because Almodovar was a genius. I would rather prefer to express my respect for his accomplishments by humbly asking the reader to look at "All about my mother", or "Legami", or "High heels", or "Matador", which testify to the uniqueness of Almodovar and unparalleled talent . A few more films like this, and his legacy could very well be destroyed forever.
