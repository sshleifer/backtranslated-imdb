This "horror" film lacks any horror or even slight suspense. Even the blood is not good. The plot would have some promise if it was made by someone who cared what they were writing / filming, but the people who made this film obviously didn't. Basically, the film proceeds in a series of lines and starts like this: <br /> <br /> The main character insists that he is not crazy. <br /> <br /> "Milo" is hidden in his yellow raincoat or riding in front of a car in the saddle. <br /> <br /> The main character insists that he is not crazy and does not dream of talking about his passion as a teacher. <br /> <br /> Someone is killed unsatisfactorily. <br /> <br /> The main character insists that he is not crazy and that he makes a couple of fake sobs. <br /> <br /> Are we seeing a pattern here? If you don't, you could enjoy this movie. Otherwise, look at something else. The budget is low, low, low AND SHOW (unlike THE EVIL DEAD, which makes you forget your shitty budget), and the acting is bad, bad, bad (with the possible exception of the janitor). In general the film is boring, boring, boring. I can't think of a single scene that is actually done well. In fact, I didn't like the film so much, so much so that I turned it off ten minutes before the end, which I very rarely do ... heck, I looked at the MANOS, the CLONES and WILD WILD WEST not MSTied. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Save yourself and look at PHANTASM again.
