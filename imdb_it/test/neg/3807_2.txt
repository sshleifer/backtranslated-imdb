A washed-out journalist named Bart Crosbie (Pat O 'Brien) blackmails gang leader Heinz Webber (George Colouris) for the money to pay his son a life-saving operation. In return, he agrees to surrender himself for the murder of his publisher, which the gang killed to prevent an incriminating story from being printed on them. <br /> <br /> Typical poverty-line b-pic of direct time for much more than Terence Fisher, who in a few months would have become one of the principal directors of the British horror films of the Hammer studio. The script is far-fetched and the teen idol Tommy Steele (guitar in hand) was drafted to sing a poor rock and roll called "The Rebel" in a bar that serves as a legitimate front for the band's activities.
