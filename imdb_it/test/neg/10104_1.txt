This film is really pathetic in every department imaginable. terrible, terrible, terrible. It's only about eighty minutes, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol movie (so twenty more hours in the life of the state of the empire would certainly be a lot more interesting). <br /> <br /> Where to start ... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, its bad acting, the spectacularly gloomy effects, the terrible music, or just the thin wafer weave that looks a lot like a sieve. This film is an incoherent chaos <br /> <br /> A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, the maid comes out looking through the window that he comments with an average English accent "God damn". To correct that woman. God will damage this horrible monstrosity. <br /> <br /> All those involved should be deeply ashamed of themselves. We hope the director never finds the funds to work again.
