I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of satanic horror movies and, in fact, I like them less and less every time I see a new one, and that's not really surprising when I end up watching movies like Satan's Brotherhood! Despite his low rating on IMDb, I was surprised to hear some positive things about this film and my expectations increased. This turned out to be a big mistake as this is exactly the film that his evaluation suggests it is: it's really bad! The plot is the basic group of Satanists that cause problems, and we focus on a small city where people have been killed and kidnapped and it's not clear why. Of course, the Satanists are behind it and this is bad news for a mother, father and daughter on a road trip who get trapped in the mysterious city. I had the feeling that this film could be along the same lines as the lousy Satanist movie "The Devil's Rain", and even if it's not as silly as Robert Fuest's next film, it's not even better. The plot seems to be quite down on Earth, but it's also pretty boring and I can't say I enjoyed it at all during this movie. Satan's brotherhood obviously has its fans, but I'm not one of them; this is a film I see no reason to recommend ...
