"On a clear day you can see forever" is nothing but a New Age update of the story of "Pygmalion" / "My beautiful lady": a professor tries to turn an ordinary girl into a woman of high society. This time, instead of using language skills, the professor tries to do it with hypnotism and the regression of past life. <br /> <br /> You know that a musical has problems when reviewers constantly mention sets and costumes before they mention the plot and the music. The songs are immediately forgettable. (No, "Take me to the Church in time" here, I fear). And the plot doesn't go anywhere. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, there is no "there" here. The characters roam history without ever going from point A to point B. Professor Chabot repeatedly states that he will be at the root of Daisy's troubles, but he never seems to do it. <br /> <br /> All significant conflict is avoided. For example, there comes a time when Chabot University asks to stop his research on reincarnation or to resign from his position. Now there is conflict! Will he give up his career for Daisy? Alas! Nothing comes from this development. A scene or two after college changes his mind and tells Chabot to continue his work. So much for the conflict. <br /> <br /> The talent was certainly brought together for this film: Directed by Vincente Minnelli. Written, in part, by Alan Jay Lerner. A cast of Yves Montand, Bob Newhart and Jack Nicholson. And, oh yes, played by Barabara Striesand who was almost at the top of his career at this point in his career. <br /> <br /> But everything collapses. Lerner's attempt to reincarnate his greatest success, the aforementioned "My Fair Lady", is doomed to failure as Daisy's attempt to revive the grandeur of his past. <br /> <br /> If you like musicals, there are much better choices than this.
