I should probably blame myself, but I certainly expected more from a movie called "Black Dragons" and revolves around secret World War II conspiracies, Nazi plastic surgeons and revenge. This film is a boring failure with an incomprehensible structure. The real plot (which is basically quite ingenious and intriguing) becomes clear only during an explanation towards the end, but the problem is that we stop worrying a long time ago. Let's see how the icon of horror Bela Lugosi infiltrates a society of eminent American politicians and kills them one by one. The story is timed before the Second World War and ?? especially after witnessing the end ?? it's definitely a premise with a lot of potential, so it's a shame not to be worked out more correct. There is however a great dialogue that I cannot resist sharing! Man towards woman: "Do you want to marry me?" "Why?" "So I can beat you, it's the only way you'll leave this place!" It is the only highlight in a very boring film. Bela Lugosi is adorable ?? as usual ?? but its spooky performance alone is not worth buying this movie. If you are interested in seeing more of his monstrous performances (in films with decent screenplays), take a look at "Invisible Ghost", "The Corpse Vanishes", "White Zombie" and of course the 1931 Dracula version.
