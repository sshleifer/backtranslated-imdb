THAT! it's a bad movie and deserves its reputation as an unwittingly funny movie. It takes a serious subject and presents it as the version of Cliff Notes or the Classic Comics because there are not many emotions or a real narrative - only episodic segments sewn together with "stupid real stories", transmitted by a variety of yutz . <Br /> <br /> This is a deservedly derided film, as badly written and played. However, what I found most interesting about the film is its apparent gay subtext. Instead of Che Guevarra and Fidel Castro working for a communist Cuba, they seem to be more of a gay couple - with Che behaving in a timid and detached way and Fidel as the ardent suitor! Again and again, the film abounds in broad lines like when Fidel begs that "Cuba needs you .... I NEED YOU !!" I'm not sure the study meant this homosexual undercurrent, but it doesn't take a brain surgeon to recognize it! I am very surprised that the other reviewers have not pointed it out. However, if you remember this when you watch the movie, it makes viewing much more exciting and even more fun. <br /> <br /> One last note. In recent years, Che has been very chic - even a fashion statement with treasures of teenagers dead in the brain, who have no idea who he was, wearing shirts with face. Considering he was a cold-blooded killer and a nihilist (a strange combination for a doctor), this new reverence for man is gross. What will they do next, put Hitler or Dr. Mengele on t-shirts and posters? !!? Even the communists with consciences should be upset by the bloodshed that Guevara was responsible for and I find it ironic that the people with computers are supporting a man who would probably kill them given a half chance! <br /> <br /> Considering how stupid and unintentionally funny this movie was, it does nothing to promote the message that Guevara was not a hero. I'd like to see a realistic film made of his life - with good and evil, but also with dialogue and a plot that was not created by chimpanzees!
