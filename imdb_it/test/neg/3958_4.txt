This was probably intended as an "arty" crime thriller, but fails on both counts: there are few chills and not enough substance. The fast-paced rhythm makes it difficult to sit, and the occasional action scenes are too little cared for and staged in a confusing way to offer many rewards. At least the acting level is high.
