I want the 99 minutes of my life that have been wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie. The acting was horrible! I was a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio. I will never look at them the same way again. Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd were no surprise. Everyone knows they could never act. Fortunately, only Dan tried an accent. His accent was a disaster as expected. I think he was confused about the position of the film or that he never spoke to anyone in Minnesota. I hope this review helps anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time. The only reason I was able to sit down during the entire movie was because I was stuck somewhere with nothing better to look at or read.
