In the 1960s, those of us who were bad movie buffs thought that "Plan Nine From Outer Space" was the worst movie ever made and would stay with it forever. To put things in perspective, we also thought that $ 3,000 was a lot to pay for a new car. <br /> <br /> When we grew up, our innocence was progressively eliminated because we were exposed to films like "Hercules in New York" and "Overdrawn at the Memory Bank", which completely redefined the "bad film" genre ". In this context, last night, my son and I saw "Alien From L.A.," which pushed the envelope to an extreme unimaginable only a generation ago. Calling this film "bad" (or miserable or execrable) fails to do it justice, like any other label existing in English. Even if there were words with which to accurately describe this film, it would have no consequence, since they would be banned in civil society. <br /> <br /> The Alien referred to in the title is played by Kathy Ireland, who apparently took a break from modeling swimwear for Sports Illustrated, to kick off her film career . His casting might seem like a recommendation, until you actually see the movie. The make-up artists earned their money by making Kathy look so sad and unappealing that you wouldn't want to touch her with the end of a broomstick - it's no small feat. To put it bluntly, in this film he has a face that would freeze Medusa. Even worse than his appearance, however, was his voice, which was so raucous that initially I could not believe it as a native of a human being. Throughout the film, I found myself longing for a blackboard to drag my nails to cover the squeaky squeak of his dialogue. At the end of the film, Kathy finally gets a makeover and finds herself in her beloved swimsuit. I suggested to my son that the film would have been better if they had put it in a bathing suit at the beginning of the film, so at least we would have had something to look at. My son pointedly pointed out that if they removed the swimsuit and stuffed it in their mouth, it would greatly improve the film for two reasons. I refer to the clear splendor of his observation. If you have any doubts, compare this dreck with "Barbarella", in which a competent director shows how to exploit the resources of a heterogeneously beautiful protagonist in the fantasy genre. <br /> <br /> Of the plot, in turn, there is little to comment on, given that there was so little evidence. It is said that if one million of monkeys entered incessantly for millions of years, they would eventually come up with "Hamlet". With the elimination process, the rest of the time they would come up with something that came close to this script. Imagine, if you wish, a present-day Alice who falls into a hole and lets herself fall 500 feet on a rocky slab, after which she gets up, dusts off and starts looking for her long-lost father in the kingdom-city of Atlantis. Once in Atlantis, he spends most of his time running, fighting, climbing stairs and stairs, and basically trying to keep out of the hands of a general who seems to have no soldiers to carry out his orders, and who would do look like Tiny Tim macho. This summation, however abbreviated it may seem, is probably longer than the script. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, as you enjoy the production values ​​and take all you can of sets and costumes through smoke and haze, you realize that this is a movie you can see on screen where all the $ 20 budget went. <br /> <br /> The thought that crossed my mind is that filmmakers should not be given access to drugs and alcohol while they are making a film, or perhaps before, if it leads to results such as "Alien from LA ", although in all honesty I must admit that I do not know if they were actually involved in substance abuse or simply brain dead at the start of the project.
