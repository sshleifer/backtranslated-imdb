Movies are not worse than that. Horrible plot, terribly chronometric characters and effects, pathetic and yes, this is using "B" standards. <br /> <br /> And for the boys: nothing, this film is a terrible disappointment, couple scenes that could have been great but nothing is achieved if it doesn't accumulate without delivery. <br /> <br /> This film appeals to anyone, a horrible film, has had a bad effect; plot, acting, "B" flavor, special effects and all the rest. Also no nudity or eroticism for boys or girls.
