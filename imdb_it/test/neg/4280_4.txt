As an avid Disney fan, I wasn't totally impressed with this film, certainly not motivated enough to capture it in theaters. I am, however, so happy to have taken it on DVD and seen the special features. <br /> <br /> You MUST check the "moose comment": the entire movie can be viewed with comments from Rutt and Tuke, the prominent comic moose of the story, which are expressed by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas. Two veterans of the famous Second City ad-lib comedy troupe - of character - for an hour and a half of a film to which they are clearly attached. I laughed all the time. The enjoyment I got from this comment compensated for the lukewarm reaction I had with the film itself. Do yourself a favor and listen to it!
