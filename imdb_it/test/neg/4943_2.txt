I am very disappointed. First of all, the German synchronization is very bad. Perhaps in the original version (with subtitles) it would have been better, but the whole film seems to have seen Luna Papa and Black Cat White Cat and tried to produce something in this style too. But failed in every respect. It is an incongruous mixture of a strange incredible story and very childish gags. No atmosphere, no life. Extremely primitive sexual humor. I voted 2, because 1 is the worst, and the other point for "Sybilla" is really pretty. Sorry, I like "oriental" movies, but this is really superfluous.
