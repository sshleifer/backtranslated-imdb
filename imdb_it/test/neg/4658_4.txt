I have to say that I had low expectations for the film before seeing it. All the people around said it was great, but I knew exactly what they wanted. They like the Aerosmith song, which is really great, they like the incredible special effects that had cost a lot, they like the comic side of the movie and of course many girls who love Affleck which I think is a really bad actor who doesn't he tried to be one, failed and now it's nothing. And all these things, in addition to the reviews and reviews I read on the internet, gave me the idea that the film would be a huge disappointment since I'm a big fan of cinema. Well, I was right, but at least I was prepared. <br /> <br /> The film is really commercial. It has been said, but I will say it again. We have over $ 100 million in budget, we have a love story between Hollywood stars Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and many other famous actors, who are popular with the fact that they rarely agree to become a part of the cast of a commercial film if their names are not written with big letters on the screen Like Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi, highly respected actors that I like very much. They could play many characters in many different types of movies. They could improvise, they could turn the sleepless lines into hilarious jokes. Overall, they could turn small movies into really interesting, funny or dramatic movies, people always love and love. Like Fargo in the case of Buscemi or A Simple Plan - Thornton. And to be honest, I'm really disappointed that they took part in Armageddon. Thornton plays an intelligent and refined man involved in politics if I remember correctly. Buscemi is one of the members of the deep core drilling team that is sent to save the world by destroying the asteroid that is about to disappear the world. <br /> <br /> What I didn't like - well, I think I've already understood. I pointed out the negative factors. History is boring, without art and foolish. It is so obvious that the film depends on the effects and the dramatic ending which is ridiculous. At least movies like Deep Impact and Godzilla have something special that could be considered art. At least it is not so obvious that the film is made for financial purposes. Apart from that, the bad performance of all the huge stars. The jokes are not funny, the lines are absurd and sometimes they don't make any sense. In fact, I read recently that on stage, Ben Affleck asked Bay if it would be easier to teach astronauts, than to become astronauts and Bay's response was simply "Shut up!" which is a really fun story that perfectly shows the desperation of creators. <br /> <br /> And enclosing, I will give an explanation of why I give 4 to the film. Well, I like "I don't want to lose anything" and I was impressed by the special effects that are obviously the only good thing about the movie. The first scene is memorable. These are the only 2 positive things I liked about the movie. Michael Bay is an average director, but The Rock and both Bad Boys were hundreds of times better than Armageddon he was, he is and always will be a big bad movie.
