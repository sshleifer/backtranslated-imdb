Okay, first of all I should say that I assume this was done by a group of friends on a limited budget. With this in mind, it should not be compared to successful features and my score would be higher. But still ... <br /> <br /> After giving him a chance, he violated some basic rules of film directing to the point that both the spectator and the amateur director in me got hurt. VERY. <br /> <br /> Think: Blair Witch in a car but REALLY boring. <br /> <br /> Think: you left the camera on the dashboard and registered to get lost in the park at night for an hour ago, then let your friends watch. <br /> <br /> The scariest part (POSSIBLE SPOILER NOTIFY ... IF SPOILING HERE IS POSSIBLE) It was at one point the image rewinds and you may think that you will have to look all over again. SCARY. <br /> <br /> Apart from stupidity, this is a good idea for a low-budget film that makes a film tonight. But the concept walks in a thin line between being really good and those really bad, and let's just say it wasn't very nice. There were just too many parts where nothing happened. At first I thought it was the director's plan - you had to be lulled into a sense of security and then the really scary things would have started. But no. <br /> <br /> I kept trying to find positive things to say (and I had plenty of time to think about it), and I will say that the music was pretty good. And I have to give the woman the credit of being around alone, scared for a really long time. But it is so. The actors who played "infected" people seemed to be making fun of zombie movies. Or they got their motivation from the Bug wearing his Edgar "MIB" suit. Chances are, if for some strange reason you watch this movie, it's on DVD or Tivo, so you can go on fast every time that waiting for something to happen becomes too difficult. <br /> <br /> I hate being so critical of something, but at the same time I've seen many such movies and nothing has ever been so painful. If they only chopped it half an hour and added something scary, it could be decent. Maybe that will be the director's cut ...
