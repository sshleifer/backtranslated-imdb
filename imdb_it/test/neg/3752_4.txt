The bawler of the 1950s is so ugly that it's unintentionally funny. Tom Conway plays Dr. Gerard, a scientist who is turning the natives into a monster using voodoo. Her poor wife, played by Mary Ellen Kay, is held captive by her wacko hubby who has no time for her, but threatens to kill her if she leaves him. Marla English arrives as an avid killer who has already killed a man to find a treasure in the jungle. His idiot boyfriend, played by Lance Fuller, is on safari. They take "Touch" Connors, (later renamed Mike Connors, of the fame of Mannix) as a guide. English is a terrible actress, but hey, no one else in the cast was turning into cheers or prizes. "Touch" (sorry, I can't even type the name without breaking out, I mean, what ...) gave the only half of the group's decent performance and this is saying a lot. The monster is only seen briefly, and the ending is predictable to say the least. I would say that this film falls into the category of films "it's so bad, it's almost good". It's good on a rainy night when nothing else is on the pipe.
