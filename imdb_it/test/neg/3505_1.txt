I can't believe the positive reaction to this film. I had high expectations and was disappointed. First of all, they used every racial clich√© of cheese in the book. It was so predictable. For example, from the second moment the young Latin boy appeared, you knew he would be a good boy because he looked like a gangster. The character of Matt Dillon has been played a million times, a policeman who had hardened over the years and who would have seen the light to a certain extent by the end of the film. Predictability has just ended with those characters. A phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script. The moral of the story was PC at most. There have been some clever twists but not enough. The dialouge was sometimes embarrassing. It wasn't bad at all. I can't believe this film has achieved the highest score so far. It was a bit funny, just a little offensive to intelligence. I admire what this film was trying to achieve, but it went very well.
