* POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> I will only say what has not already been said here (and I will continue to do so for the rest of my comments on the WWF / WWE). <br /> <br /> If you plan on having a game for the female title, at least make it interesting, rather than just a squash to put the current champion back. I guess Moolah can't handle an intense game, but they wanted to have the legend in a WrestleMania. <br /> <br /> I thought the Killer Bees had been wasted on WrestleManias, especially here. I became a fan in 1989, about a year after B. Brian Blair left and Jim Brunzell became a canvas back. So I didn't realize for a while that they were a top tag team, even the best contenders. <br /> <br /> But I liked to see Bill Fralic in the real battle. He really came here alone, creating an arrogant heel character in a pre-game interview and even making an elimination in the real battle. In addition to Steve McMichael and Kevin Greene, he is the only professional athlete of my generation to have respect for wrestling (does anyone remember Dennis Rodman?). And what was the ridiculous green tights of the Hart Foundation?
