Martin Lawrence could be considered a talented man, but those days are far away. Runteldat shows a man who immediately tries to interpret the sympathy card for his situation, but takes responsibility whenever he thinks he can benefit his ego. The sad truth is that at this point in his life, his best days were behind him: his funny show had died in the water after his co-protagonist left and today faces a career of dubbing and terrible action films. <br /> <br /> One gets the impression that this film was not made to give Lawrence's career another boost after his humiliation, but rather a childish attempt to free up the air by both trying to save pathetically what was left of his life and somehow turn it into something to be proud of, a decisive moment in which he was shown to have "earned" his fame. Unfortunately, the concert is nothing more than a hammering Martin who tries incoherently to be funny, invokes pathos, and then claims not to worry about hardcore at all. The sad truth is that this is the real public embarrassment for Lawrence: the way he likes to invoke sad pity makes you want him to take off his underwear on stage, shake a gun around and start over. There is no real intuition of his performance. Just as the child title states, Martin is trying to make his last moment of truth in his own way and fails miserably. It would have been better to wait for the E! True Hollywood Story instead of running on a stage and making an idiot for the second time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the saddest thing about this concert film - or rather, the praise of a career - is that Martin has not thought of it. What did this film have to show? Unfortunately, his fame was fleeting, it was a flash in the pan before the underwear incident, and now that the only way he can get the job is Will Smith's gait or a Pixar production. They could even call this concert "Tombstone" because that's what it is. Martin Lawrence dies on stage here, and with that it may have been an interesting career. Now? Just a pathetic note in history.
