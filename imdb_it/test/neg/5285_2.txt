Perhaps one of the most beautiful and horrible films of all time, since it's so ugly and casual, it's a bit hilarious and I don't know how to think it ... it reminds me of Cabin Fever ... this is just something about that guy who jumps out porch doing karate and screaming "pancakes" is intriguing. Since many people have already outlined the plot and all I'm going to do is summarize the quality of the film with a quote: "I'm the park ranger that will get you up there". yes, enough said? If you're looking for quality or a really scary movie, I don't recommend it. but if you like these movies, I guess you'd like ... I don't know how, but I think some people would do it.
