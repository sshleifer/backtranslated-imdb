In an attempt to make a film a bit comical but serious about the art of growing marijuana, Stephen Gyllenhaal (director) fell into a few bunk short of a good movie. While the cast is nothing short of surprising, this film is extremely difficult to seduce. The acting of Billy Bob Thornton, Ryan Phillipe, Jon Bon Jovi, Hank Azaria and Kelly Lynch could not even save this film from failure. It would be wiser to empty three dollar bills on the toilet, then check this movie in the local video store. <br /> <br />
