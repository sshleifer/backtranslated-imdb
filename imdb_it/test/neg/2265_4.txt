I read the book "Scarlett" and I expected a good movie the first time I saw it. I'm afraid to say I was disappointed. The film did not follow the book and made many changes that I did not like. <br /> <br /> One of the changes that I did not like in the way Lord Fenton was portrayed. It didn't make sense to make him a bad man. The way things ended between Lord Fenton and Scarlett was very different and their whole relationship was too intimate. <br /> <br /> In the film there was also much less clash between Scarlett and Rhett than it was originally written in the book. The film sent the two in two completely opposite ways and didn't seem to cross often enough to make it seem like there could still be love between the two. A good film, but I think it could certainly have been better than it was, if it was more faithful to the book by Alexandra Rippley.
