OK, so Herc is a hunk ... but the rest of the 3 hours were wasted, wasted ... oh, humanity! <br /> <br /> Poor Sean Astin had to follow his teacher on the same hills as New Zealand ... wait! It could be? Someone in the Lord of the Rings production crew was making movies at home in his spare time! Yes, it is! <br /> <br /> I wish I could say at least that it was promising. <br /> <br /> Special effects were often ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But, Herc was a hunk. <br /> <br /> NH
