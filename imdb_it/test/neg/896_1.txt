Sometimes it's fun to watch movies implode from your couch, but other times it's just horribly painful for both eyes and mind. House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute is one of those rare examples of when your eyes and your mind are begging you to turn off the movie. This final episode of the House Party series is by far the worst, not just the sequel, but the film was released by Hollywood. It soon became clear in this "characteristic" that director Chris Stokes loved Ferris Bueller's Day Off with a passion. I say this because it becomes very clear that Stokes had no problem raising the originality of Bueller from the hands of John Hughes and choosing to create a film completely devoid of humor. You would think that by "stealing" themes and images from a more enjoyable film, your film would at least be able to generate a laugh or two. With House Party 4, Stokes has shown that he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel, much less a Hollywood movie. From his confused and confused story, from his inability to make sense of his characters and old recycled and exhausted clich√©s, all that Stokes is doing is hitting a bigger nail in the coffin that houses the House Party movies. It reminds me of that student who forgets his project because of an hour and quickly glides together with super glue, macaroni, cat hair, chewing gum and straws and presents it as "Hannibal crossing the Alps". It just looks horrible and you feel embarrassed for the creator. <br /> <br /> So where did this film take a dip in the realm of comic stupidity? Honestly, I don't think most places will let me talk for so long, so I'd rather mention some of the bigger topics that hit me the hardest. To begin with, I still can't shake the Ferris Beuller scam. It was as if director Stokes was ashamed of having to direct another sequel to House Party and decided to introduce a completely random formula (from a more entertaining film) and see if he could cut and paste elements of the original series into that formula. It was a huge mistake. When a director tries to do it, what eventually happens is confusion within the audience. We think we are going in one direction, but instead we go in another direction. This is exactly what can be witnessed in House Party 4. In one case we have John-John trying to have the "biggest party of the decade" while he is also trying to get a record deal (ok, it reminds me of the original House Party), but then we go to this casual island where Uncle Charles is afraid of flying, his grandmother gets drunk and some idiotic and dull moments with an alleged murderer. Again, we start somehow strong and end up chaotic. This is the confusion I'm talking about. Director Stokes did not have the ability to hold his hand on the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story. He would prefer to cut corners, keep the jokes cheap and think that the public is an idiot rather than trying to revive a dead stone series. One might think that when a director was given the task of filming another House Party movie, he would have thrown himself into thinking that it would be him who revived it or brought it back to life, instead Stokes just wanted to get paid. <br /> <br /> I realize that I am slowly getting older as the days go by, but I think I keep my hand in the culture of the younger generations. I listened to rap and R & B growing, but the "Immature" group never came to either my cassette deck or my CD player. Why? I don't think they ever had a sequel, but apparently director Chris Stokes, it would have been useful to write them as protagonists in his new movie House Party. Has anyone in a study ever realized that this would have been in the red rather quickly? Or what about the option of having Stokes himself as a car repairer, nothing like a director without the sense of comic timing that launches as the only source of possible humor. It was one of those few cases where I really missed Robin Harris, and I never thought I'd find myself saying it in any movie. Outside of a band that does not play the lead role, I also thought the rest of the cast would continue to suck the life out of this movie. Uncle Charles was annoying when he tried humor. Kim Whitely was completely wasted on her scenes (both literally and figuratively) while ?? well ?? all the others practically fall into that category. <br /> <br /> Where did Chris Stokes spend most of the budget for this film? Not for special guest stars because, although this film boasted some, there was certainly no one present at the "unforgettable" House Party, nor the possible dream that perhaps Kid or Play would make a final appearance. House Party 4 did not follow any default project, which ended up ruining this functionality from the ground up. Can anyone explain to me why there was a need to use the habit of "murdered fugitive who was an authorized taxi driver" for humor? Stokes was reaching deep into the bottom of the barrel and producing only more manure instead of substance. For once I can admit that there is no saving value for this film. House Party 4 has buried the series, and while I hear that there may be others in the pipeline, I just hope that Hollywood realizes that this series is dead. Hollywood needs to let this series end, forget the past and move forward into the future. I'm thinking of a sequel to Who's the Man? it would make them start in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Vote: * on *****
