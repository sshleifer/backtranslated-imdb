To reproduce "Lost Horizon" as a musical, the need for a musical composition of the Rodgers & Hammerstein or Lerner & Lowe type was needed. Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the wrong choice. That being said, my favorite thing about "Lost Horizon" is its score. It's just that the score doesn't fit the piece. The cast, composed of non-musical talents (Ullman, Finch and Hussey, are all nicknamed, and still don't sound so great). <br /> <br /> Frankly, the novella, on which this, and previous versions of non-musical films were based, is mediocre at best. While the possibilities of a truly valid cinematographic musical version exist, they are not realized here. The film manages to be a good rain vehicle to pass the time. Otherwise, you'll be better off buying the CD of its soundtrack. Recommended only as a piece of curiosity, due to the terrible reputation of the film. I have seen much better; but I saw MUCH worse.
