This film is too stupid for words. Even if you consider the film parody, if you consider it completely camp, even if you're wasting your time watching it - because you've seen it hundreds of times before. But maybe you're a big fan of high and shrill girl voices, you still love Barbie and Ken and you can endure this typical 80's electric guitar background noise ... Well, then you'll have a chance.
