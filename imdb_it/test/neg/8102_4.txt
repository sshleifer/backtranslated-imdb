This was a strange film. A little horror and definitely noir. Some fifth journalists meet and mysteriously begin to die with a Japanese dagger in their hands after Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi) appears. <br /> <br /> Soon the Lone Ranger arrives in the person of FBI agent Richard 'Dick' Martin (Clayton Moore). Martin is ineffective in finding the killer because he is more interested in his niece (Joan Barclay) than a missing doctor, who is part of the gang. <br /> <br /> After the last man dies and the doctor is horribly disfigured by a strange serum, the true story of the group comes out and it is here that it becomes interesting and bizarre. I will not pay it. <br /> <br /> Lugosi was as wonderful as the skulking killer.
