If you could give this movie less than a 1, I would definitely do it. I had read a review of this film in the LA Times and found myself walking by the theater and remembered the review. My wife and I played and thought it couldn't be as bad as the critics said - you know the critics. Sure enough ... Give me a break with the horrible acting, the horrible camera work, the misuse of the budget (which was mentioned over and over as an excuse). I've worked on films with smaller budgets that are 100 times better. It is the director and the producer who make the films work: they choose the teams. That's all. If they don't put it together and make it work ... they just won't. So they didn't - and it's not. I don't think they can ... I had to take the time to write this review ... although I'm sure the film crew doesn't appreciate this review - I hope to do you a favor by my desire for you to do well, but - in a other career. Good luck.
