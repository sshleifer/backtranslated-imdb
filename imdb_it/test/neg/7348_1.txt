I've always hated this delayed show. I liked the Cartoon Network shows like "Dexter's laboratory" or "Megas XLR. But I never liked this piece of turd. Basically because it has stupid characters (the good guys or the bad guys seem to be mentally retarded) they have stupid voices (especially Bubbles. It should be the "cute" character of the show, but it's incredibly annoying. The plots are very, very stupid. Some episodes may have been interesting but the show almost always becomes childish and trivial. There wasn't a nice character, the music was horrible and the animation is the worst I've ever seen. Evena's five-year-old boy could draw better! I don't see why the whole world seems to love this piece of trash. "The Powerpuff Girls" seems to be one of the worst cartoons ever made Fortunately "the Foster House for imaginary friends" of the same creator was much better.
