A protected young woman, educated at home and possibly very gifted, hosts a disturbed, excessively emotional side that surfaces on the surface after the absent father pays a visit to his mother, asking for a divorce. Directed by the famous director of photography William A. Fraker, this baffled psychological thriller falls into the trap in which most of the films directed by the directors of photography are to be found: each shot is composed for maximum style, but at the sacrifice of the fluid and tight rhythm , compelling narrative. Fraker (and his director of photography, László Kovács) are very fond of fluffy whites and golden hues, giving the image a touch of shine. The villa in the center of the action resembles a funeral parlor, and Fraker walks on the rattling wire like a funeral. Robert Shaw and Sally Kellerman (as Shaw's girlfriend), two of the most interesting actors of the 70s, manage to cut the plastic overlay and are quite compelling despite the jagged montage (which turns their scenes into small pieces of half activity -realized). Sondra Locke, another interesting screen personality, seems to have been chosen for her resemblance to Catherine Deneuve in "Repulsion". Pale and with saucer eyes, with imposing and long hair, Locke is a curious human puzzle, and at the beginning it is rather intimidating and dangerous; however, this role is so old-fashioned that Locke can't find anything new to get out of deep freezing, and she has fun. Fraker allows Locke's scenes to go on and on, while Shaw (with an extraordinarily casual appearance) finds himself in the impossible position of playing with lovable dad. All these absurdities could be worthwhile if the script had been punctuated with a minimum of tangibility (or, at least, of a dry humor or a humorous relief). As it is, Lewis John Carlino and Edward Hume, copied from a novel of "Go To Thy Deathbed" by Stanton Forbes, adapted the viewer at the beginning, and only the charisma of the players takes us to the finish line. * 1/2 from ****
