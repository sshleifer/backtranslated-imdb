This is the prize that made me lose all respect for Hugos. <br /> <br /> If such a "distinguished" panel cannot see or worry about the obvious narrative problems of Battlestar Galactica, then what value is their prize? The answer: not much. <br /> <br /> Prize-winning shows should be examples of creativity and excellence, none of which is in evidence in BG, this episode or any other I've seen. <Br /> <br /> Shooting in gray videos is not "artistic", it's cheap. Shaking the camera is not "creative" it is vomiting and lazy as can be. <br /> <br /> All that BG has shown is how corrupt most of the award-winning "academies" are and how easy it is to buy prizes with a lot of money for PR.
