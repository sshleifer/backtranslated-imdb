The parade of horror has an innocent teenager (Meg Tilly, always attractive) trying to tune into the popular clique at school (although they seem to hate her openly) and letting themselves be subjected to their initiation into the sisterhood: spending the night in a terrifying mausoleum . Despite the complete absence of originality, this low-budget thriller manages to produce some decent special effects and has some good performances (in particular from Robin Evans, who exudes ferocious bell as leader of the girls). The script is not razor sharp, but it has enough oddities to make the process rather bearable. ** from ****
