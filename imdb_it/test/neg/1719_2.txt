Fantastic science fiction with a paltry budget, without charm and charm. Even the scenes linked to the fall of the asteroids are stolen from other films with the same plot. It's just a bad copy of "Asteroid" (with Annabela Sciora) and "Deep Impact" (with Morgan Freeman). Mr. Hopper seems to be anxious to slip away from this useless and boring science fiction voice. <br /> <br /> Give this to 2 (two). And don't say I'm not a good guy!
