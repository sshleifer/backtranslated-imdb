(spoiler) Pretty horribly, I really saw the movie that this horrible movie was a sequel to. His name was Ator the Fighting Eagle and I saw him when I was only 8 years old. It made such a terrible impression that I never forgot it. I have been a fan of MST3K for a long time, so when Cavedwellers came out on tape I bought it. I was horrified to realize that it was a sequel to the sad Ator movie I had seen so long ago! Ator's costume has, in some ways, become increasingly succinct compared to the last time I saw it. How can he wear that little little bikini? Doesn't it matter if it shows the fact that he didn't ... errr ... package? And poor loin ... it has no wrinkles and no girl, and it has to follow the frizzy haired Ator around all the time. Has anyone else noticed that Miles O'Keefe walks like a woman? No wonder he is not interested in the beautiful Meela, even if a little weak. The villain, wicked but attractive, Zor is more of his taste, I'm sure. I loved Zor's helmet painted with cardboard spray and the way he spent all his time trying to touch part of the Ator. The fight scenes are so badly choreographed that it is a wonder that the swords are able to connect. The dull old man spends all his time standing looking down at himself. Ator drinks from a cup given to him by a guy who hates him, and then seems surprised that they drugged him. He must be quite intelligent, but he invented a hang-glider in the space of five minutes, then turned it into a split in the space / time continuum in order to travel briefly in seventeenth-century Bulgaria. It was after he stabbed the giant snake puppet, of course, and saved the post-coital Meela while she sat without doing anything at all. The real hero of the film was Thong, who saved Ator several times from his boundless stupidity, and killed the evil Zor in his pact. Congratulations to Thong, the only competent person in the whole film.
