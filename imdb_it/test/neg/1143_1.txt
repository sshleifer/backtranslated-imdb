I loved the original, I watch it every year. but the second is a piece of trash and should never have been done. The second could have worked if there was a different position. The son was not an original or even behaved like one of Eddie's children. Third, he was too clever for Eddie who downplayed his father's role. None of the other children where they are inside. It could have been much better. I don't know why they even tried to make this movie. There was no continuity from the first film. I'll pretend this doesn't even exist. It is sad that the actors have not even seen that they have been taken for a ride. A really bad film. I just think I wasted an hour or more on a bad movie and I really love all national lampoon movies.
