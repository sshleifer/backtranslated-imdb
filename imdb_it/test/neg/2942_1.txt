"The Twins Effect" is the worst movie I've ever seen! Not only is the support weak, but the characters too. I'm sorry to tell you Edison fans, but Kazaf is by far the weakest vampire I've ever seen in my life. I'm sorry, Edison; your role in this film was disappointing. Edison doesn't fight at all in this film and I'm sure that if they hadn't had Kazaf in the film, the plot wouldn't have been very different. The main plot of the film is not explained enough and the whole film focuses too much on the growing relationship between Helen and Kazaf. I mean, who the hell was Kazaf and why did they need his blood? Yes, it's the prince right? So what? <br /> <br /> Some scenes in this film were simply stupid. Yes, the action was great but the whole scheme was stupid. In a scene towards the end, Duke Dekotes says that Kazaf is the strongest of his brothers ... yes, it seems so now that he has grown. Why would you wait until it's big to attack? Another scene was with Jackie Chan, one of my favorites. In the scene, Jackie asked Helen who the creatures that followed them insistently were. How can you be so naive as not to know they're vampires? People are dying around them with bite marks on their necks; surely the NEWS would be on it faster than you can say "Vampire". <br /> <br /> The characters were yet another mistake in the film. Helen, played by Charlene Choi, is Kazaf's girlfriend. What kind of girl wouldn't be afraid of Vampires, especially if it's your brother's job to kill them? I can bet you that you wouldn't have found a girl as brave as Helen if you had been looking for your whole life. Helen is annoying, bitch, and is a drama queen in the film. It tries too hard to be different and eventually fails miserably. One of the strangest and most disturbing characters I've ever seen in a movie. Why should you bite someone's neck, especially if you're not a vampire? It is very strange that his reaction to Kazaf's confession does not turn him off. Kazaf, played by Edison Chen, is another stupid character in history. What a degradation for a young actor like himself to act in a film with a role so little built. He does not defend himself for the whole film and does not fight. Even if I'm a fan of Edison, I wouldn't want a man lying on the ground all the time. Gypsy and Reeve are my favorite characters in the film. Their love is pure and sweet. Gypsy is gorgeous and doesn't try too hard like Helen. Reeve, played by Ekin Cheng, is wise and seems to be the only person who makes sense in the film. A failure of the plot was the death of Reeve. The film had absolutely no substance, but self-destructs by removing one of the only cute characters. Another character was the Duke Dekotes. The story did not focus much on him and therefore made his desire to get Kazaf's "rock" irrelevant. <br /> <br /> It is very sad because towards the end of the film, I forced myself to watch because I desperately wanted to see Kazaf fight. The end was so abrupt because all the time I expected it would be so beautiful. Kazaf, who is the alleged vampire prince, does nothing for the film and I'm sure if he was eliminated, the film wouldn't have been much different. I strongly advise you NOT to waste your time in this film as I did. I was very disappointed. If you are looking for a great movie, why not watch "The Lord of the Rings" or "Pirates of the Caribbean?" Cute characters with a well written plot.
