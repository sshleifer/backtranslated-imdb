I really wanted to love this movie, because I love Troma and I love the trailer and I love "Ghouls", another of Ferrin's films. He had some almost positive moments, like the old men who love the song while playing the car crash scene, and a scene towards the end where the protagonist gets a bit of a closure. But overall, it was just boring and slightly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The "unimaginable" shocks that Ferrin had were really predictable and worn. Poop, killing of prostitutes, incest. He could still have been good, but badly done. Unsure if you are trying to offend, amuse or both. In the end, it didn't even. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, we watch Troma's films because we want films with the heart. This film has not always had the impression of having the heart. There were some beautiful scenes, but in the end it was boring and unpleasant.
