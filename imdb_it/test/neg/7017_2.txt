I'm a big fan of "Auntie Mame" with Rosalind Russell. She was really the perfect actress to play that character. <br /> <br /> I heard that Angela Lansbury was very good on the stage in "Mame", but it's hard to imagine that anyone is passing Rosalind Russell. <br /> <br /> Lucy was such a beautiful comic that her comic pieces saved her performance in this movie where I think it was misplaced. Actually, they should have nicknamed her sung voice - to hear these songs sung to a faster pace and with strong voices really change the whole effect. <br /> <br /> I just saw the awakening of the stage in Washington DC and I think Christine Baranski was as good as Mame, Harriet Harris - the ugly chain that smokes on Frasier - played Vera and was particularly good at it. <br /> <br /> Both would be a good casting for a TV movie of this show. Maybe if that production comes to Broadway, they will consider filming. <br /> <br /> I also think Tracy Ullman would be as good as Agnes.
