The rich horse breeders in Buenos Aires have had a long-standing non-negotiation policy with the Crawford's in Manhattan, but what happens when the mustachioed Latin son falls for one Crawford with bright eyes, blond hair and some lively movement on the runway from dance? The 20th Century-Fox musical has a glossy patina but looks a bit run down. It is very heavy in the frenetic dance and similar to gymnastics, extremely thin in history. Betty Grable (a replacement for the eleventh hour for Alice Faye) gives a boost, even though she is paired with the leaden Don Ameche (in light brown make-up and straight hair). Good also: Charlotte Greenwood in the role of Betty's plump aunt, a limousine that is constantly asleep at work and Carmen Miranda playing herself (who else?). Argentina's reserve stocks far outnumber the action filmed on Fox's backlot, and some of the supporting performances are pretty horrible. At the time of the great horserace finale, most of the spectators will have had enough. * 1/2 from ****
