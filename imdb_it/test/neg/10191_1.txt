I happened to run into this movie and checked IMDb for more information: Score 6,7, well ... not so bad. Genre: scifi ... well I like scifi. So I took the movie and couldn't wait to spend a relaxing Sunday night watching it. But but ... NO. <br /> <br /> As a summary, this is not a movie at all. It is a religious advertisement, including: preatching on Jesus, god, devil, end of the world, etc. The film begins with an epic kidnapping story: night driving, stationary car, bright light and so on ... Well, actually it was the film. Last of this ... ummm ... frankly I don't know what to call it ... it was the dialogue about the end of the world and the final judgment. Quite the same things these television preachers tell you, but they are "good". <br /> <br /> Honestly, if you don't want to watch a scifi movie or something with UFOs, please stay away from this "thing". It has nothing to do with them. If you want to hear the opinion of some cuckoo, what the bible says and what you should do. Then go ahead and look at this "thing", but I still prefer to go to church on Sunday. <br /> <br /> This is complete. (and evangelical Christian propaganda, as other users have said = Well ... I should have redeemed comments from other users before I had the film. <br /> <br /> (27% of voters voted this "what "like 10. Yes, right, please, go somewhere else to do your propaganda)
