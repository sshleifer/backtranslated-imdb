We all know that special effects cost, but it seems they could have used the money they saved by writing the script to get better shots. The train is obviously a model in most of the moving shots, the helicopter is obviously computer generated, the alien looks like the one from the end of the Space Balls, except it's a decade later and the Spaceballs have an excuse. <br /> <br /> the only clever thing they did was to blur all the special effects to make them more difficult to see. <br /> <br /> Even the actors could not compensate for such a poorly written script and it is quite obvious that they have not even tried them. <br /> <br /> Please, don't waste your time. Please.
