There have been very few good moments in this film. Only a couple of characters have been cut out and not so well. There were plot holes large enough to drive a truck. The rhythm crept like an old man. There have been many moments when the film never returned to appreciate Coco stripping. What happened to her? What about Garci's sister? Is he better now? What about Leroy? We learned absolutely nothing about him. What about the electronic piano? What about the rich girl who aborted? What happened to her? This was an interesting subplot. <br /> <br /> Overall this is not a good movie and I would recommend another musical that was in this movie. WE DO THE GUARD TIME AGAIN !!!!!!!
