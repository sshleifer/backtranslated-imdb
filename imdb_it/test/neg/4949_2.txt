I was just watching a Forensic Files marathon on Court TV. The episode was identical to the plot of this film, up to the secret of incest and the affair-with-sister subplot. I don't remember any disclaimers based on a true story, but the case has MOW written everywhere. Apparently it is the chronicle of the real murder of Ruby Morris by her husband Earl, sentenced to 25 years of life for his murder. I'm just going to show you, the truth may be stranger than fiction, because I thought the Lifetime plot was artificial and more than "a stretch" with regard to credibility. I'm with the other posters who said the acting was bad. I didn't notice it with all the players, though. He was really the main character, the daughter, whose performance was bad.
