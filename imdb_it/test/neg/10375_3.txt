I just saw it at the Castro Theater in San Francisco and I had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive and uninspiring movie. This is a 75-minute film that lasts 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly engaging material. It is not bad in any way offensive, it simply repeats things that have been said many, many times and in a more interesting and provocative way. With only a couple of exceptions, the interviews continued to go on and on, making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic. It's more like a "like" guide to something that can't be done anymore. I was alive during the era but felt little connection or nostalgia for what was being presented.
