I just finished watching Dog Watch. I thought some parts of the movie had been pouting with more than a few implausibility. The acting was not bad and the plot was not bad. BUT, as the saying goes, the devil was in the details. <br /> <br /> Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) It was shown that the bleeding on the bandage of Charlie Falon (Sam Elliott) came from the back of his hand while his knuckles were bleeding. <br /> <br /> 2) Would a detective have stolen his murder victim from a very bright area? It seemed very silly to me. <br /> <br /> I am not unusually picky for a movie but, in my humble opinion, this is absolutely NOT recommended by me.
