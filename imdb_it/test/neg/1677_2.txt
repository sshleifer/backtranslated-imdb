This movie ended up on the cgi I mean sci-fi actually did the original '' BATS '' it's better not to use cgi as the sequel. in this film it is the simple people who run from mutated killer bats. and really bats in Afghanistan?! the plot concerns army soldiers who find a terrorist and are attacked by bats and die <_ <but the reason I gave this 3-star movie is because the way the camera magnifies soldiers. acting is bad and this doesn't even look like a horror movie. throughout this film is a TV movie good enough for the science fiction channel. but if you like science fiction movies you will like this movie because you like channel 43 oh and if you fall asleep during the movie don't be surprised. oh sorry i think i give him 2 stars instead.
