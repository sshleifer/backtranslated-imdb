An American werewolf in London had some fun parts, but this is not so nice. Computer werewolves are simply awful: the perspective is all out, it's like seeing them through a distorting mirror. The writers trample the throat of many of their gags. American boy tells the Parisian girl: "Is there a coffee?" Instead of leaving him, they have to sigh the girl and answer "This is Paris".
