I am aware that there are some fans who might like this movie. I am aware that the idea of ​​"seeking God" might seem interesting to some, but to me it is really boring. <br /> <br /> The film is simply boring. When it gets a little interesting, it becomes stupid. Come on ... does Kirk fight against God and win? How low can we get? The only good part of the film is the camping scene in the first 5 minutes, which is really great, but after that, the film becomes boring, irritating, with nothing but good music. <br /> <br /> Thanks God we have Star Trek VI. (Oops, Kirk beat him).
