Not just why? But "What were they thinking?" This must have been a bit of a recovery for Gus Van Sant, because this is one of those weird movies that should never have been (re) made. It wants to be the Hitchcock movie <br /> <br /> frame by frame, but without the magic or the tension or the great movie <br /> <br /> making. Rent the original, save yourself.
