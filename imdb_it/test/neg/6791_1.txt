Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the last 10 years. The screenplay by James 'Jimmy' Trivette, Walker's companion, is almost pathetically written of a part of Wesley Crusher in Star Trek TNG, and is interpreted with equal conviction. <br /> <br /> In this show, people do not respond in the way people respond to things in real life - everyone is polarized - everyone is either completely good or completely bad (unless Walker himself has a 2 minute speech with them and then change instantly). That's not how life works, that's not how people are. This show does not take place in this reality. <br /> <br /> The plots are as realistic as Murder She Wrote, a show in which an arrogant old woman can simply enter people's homes without getting angry, and can ask that police officers do what she wants and they lean back for her. With Walker, everyone on the show, including the "bad guys", behave as if he were the kind of heroes myths and fairy tales are made of, and time itself turns to its whim. The jokes that sometimes come out of the mouth of the people in this show are beyond ridicule. It is as if the writer for the part of Wesley Crusher (for the "series" parts) and the writer of the most entertaining videos of Bob Saget (for the "humorous" parts) have come together and written all the scripts for this show. > <br /> This show is for people who think that good always prevails over evil. It's for the elderly. It's for eager thinkers. It is for people who always want to have a happy ending. It is for people who want to drift into oblivion. It's for people whose drug is their television. <br /> <br /> It makes me shudder every time I even see a commercial for this show. My opinion is that it's the worst show on television in the last 10 years. I liked Chuck Norris, but this show has always tainted him forever. I can't even watch his older films without thinking about this show.
