another eli roth in the making. self-promotion, bad script, excuse for a horror director. the winner is the farthest from mary poppins' new horror icon (referring to the Disney score). What is happening here? you have Marilyn Manson who opens and closes this piece of shit and chitty chitty bang bang all through it. can this even be called horror? horrible, yes, but horror is a trait. David Lynch should report them for stealing elephant implants. please stop these fan boys, you want to be directors now. Video directors already have sufficient competition in the film industry. going online and talking about how good your movie is doesn't make it true. stop the madness. I work in the industry and yes, these films are fun to work with, but they are rarely fun to watch.
