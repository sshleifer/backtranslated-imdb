I like cheese horror movies, I think the dead alive and the bad taste are fantastic and I think the lazy pajama party II (not even tied to this movie) is hilarious. But this movie is absolutely smelly, I didn't laugh, I didn't even like it .. you can see all kinds of mistakes that aren't even campy. The best scene in the scene where the woman looks out the window is where she beats her head on the windowsill? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> Do not rent it thinking it is related to the series of slumber party massacres. It's terrible and I don't even have the slightest idea how it was distributed. Rent it with a fake name and burn it, do everyone the favor.
