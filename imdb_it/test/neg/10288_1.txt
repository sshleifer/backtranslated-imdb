After such a frightening and raw opening that gives you that creepy "Bite of the Chainsaw" - challenges, everything falls apart. <br /> <br /> NOTICE SPOILER: As soon as the two FBI officials start jabbing, you know they are real killers. Anyone who has seen enough of these "crazy-ya" -movies can understand it. <br /> <br /> This movie is crazier than one thing in mind: representing brutal murderers. Why, then, isn't the child tortured and killed? Will this be the next for us movie lovers? Torture and child abuse? What's wrong with you people? Lynch really has a disgusting and ugly mind.
