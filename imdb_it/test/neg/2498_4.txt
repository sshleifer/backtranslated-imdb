Well, since it's called Porno Holocaust and directed by Joe D'Amato, I went to this movie expecting a sleaze ... and although I somehow understood it, Porno Holocaust was a big disappointment as it's damn VERY BORANTE. The title suggests that the film will feature pornographic material, and it's not wrong: Porno Holocaust is pretty much just pornographic, and most of it is always the same stuff, it was a fast advance before the end. The first sex scene is between two women and has put my hopes up, but after that it degenerates into a normal porn, and the rest of the movie (for the first time!) Is made to talk, and you can imagine how much fun to sit! The plot focuses on a desert island where, believe it or not, something strange is happening. Of course, it doesn't take long before a group of people - made up of a few men and some scientists, all of whom are sexy women - land on the island. They have sex a few times and strange things happen, then over an hour later they are attacked by a mutant zombie creature with an eye for women ... <br /> <br /> This must have seemed like a good idea for an original porn - a zombie who likes to take it, but it's not surprising that it doesn't work well at all. The film came just ten minutes from the two-hour finish, and this is too long for a film like this. I have no idea why Porno Holocaust is as long as it is; if they had just cut a minute of each sex scene, the film would have lasted less than ninety minutes and this would have made it much more tolerable! The zombie takes what seems like an eternity to appear (it's been a long time before there's a long enough sexual break to allow them to actually travel on the island), and when it finally appears, it's a huge disappointment! I realize that this is a low-budget junk for B-movie, but D'Amato certainly could have tried a little more and found something better! I'm not even going to worry about mentioning acting, atmosphere, etc., It doesn't make sense. Porno Holocaust is basically just your average porn movie with a slight splash of horror, and I can't recommend it!
