OK, I've seen over 100 Troma movies, and some of them are pretty bad. "Sizzle Beach U.S.A." It was awful, and "I Was A Teenage TV Terrorist" was unwatchable, but this is THE WORST MOVIE IN THE TROMA LIBRARY! <br /> <br /> A group of women is kept in a prison and tortured while trying to escape. <br /> <br /> This is really terrible. Even as an exploitative film. Doris Wishman and Hershall Gordon Lewis would probably kill the director if they saw this excuse for a cult movie. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br />
