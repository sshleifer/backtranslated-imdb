I have only commented on films that are very good and totally garbage. My goal is to help people who want to see great movies spend their time - and money - wisely. <br /> <br /> I also want to stop the people who waste their time in trash and want to publicize the fact that the director / producer of these junk movies can't get away for a long time. We will find out who you are and we will vote with your feet out - and wallets. <br /> <br /> This film clearly falls into the rubbish category. <br /> <br /> The director and writer is John Shiban. It's always a bad sign when the writer is also the director. Maybe he wants two checks. He shouldn't have any. So remember the name - John SHIBAN. And if you see anything else from him, forget it. <br /> <br /> I won't say anything about the plot - others have already done it. I'm a little worried about how much the director loves to zoom in on the poor girl's face when she cries and screams. These long-lasting shots are a little worrying and could say something about Mr. Shiban's mood. Perhaps he should receive psychiatric help. Enough already. It's shit - don't waste your time.
