I had a bad feeling when I saw the economic title. It took only a couple of scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker! The only enjoyment I got from it was to laugh at technical defects (example: the car's background sound sounds disappears during the scene with Danny and Dog in Dog's car). Production shows a total lack of imagination (for example, the machine-gun fire slows down many times). Sandra Bullock essentially plays a part, completely useless for the plot. To say that this film actually has a storyline does more justice to writing than you deserve. The ancient computer hardware is quite interesting. This film was released in 1982 (not in 1987 as the IMDb database indicates) and the current "high tech" was an amber screen on a 4.8 MHz IBM PC with floppy drive. Maybe the PC was the real star of the movie ... at least it was interesting. <br /> <br /> We got it on DVD for a couple of dollars in the WalMart business basket. As the other reviewer notes, we paid too much!
