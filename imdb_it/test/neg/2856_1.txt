.... You have this stupid excuse of a Child's Play scam! Friend, what were they thinking? First they have a mess with a Rumpelstiltskin horror movie and then they suck like this. Enemies of Fariy Tale! Well, to be honest, I saw it as a child, and it scared me a little, simply because I was old with the assumption that Pinocchio wouldn't do it, wah wah wah. But I grew up and started thinking about this as a Child's Play joke, a non-absurd fairy tale and an episode of Tales From The Crypt, or trying to be at least one, with a lame ending that was stupid, and he had many holes in the plot, and I still can't understand how he came to life. Was it the work of an evil Geppetto? So what, after some bad deeds, becomes a real guy who becomes America's Most Wanted? Personally, I think the concept of an evil Geppetto sounds better, builds an army of wooden killers and starts a wave of crime, fun. But this is terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible! TERRIBLE! Smelly like a shoe, and horrible! HA SUCKED IT SUCKED! If you want killer puppets, satisfied with the killer doll, in particular Child's Play, instead, there are no ties. Or if you want a fairy tale upside down, look at Leprechaun, or if you want Pinocchio, look at the animated version of Disnet or the live version with Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Martin Landau. >>>>> -10/10 (negative 10)
