This film is a shame especially considering that Andrzej Wajda is not an amateur but a professional director. However, this film fails to deliver anything you expect. <br /> <br /> First of all - I am Polish, so I can tell the whole background story, because I read books. But how can you say that there is also a war in this film - a group of people goes back and forth, some soldiers are screaming ... Is this really World War II or are soldiers on vacation? <br /> <br /> Acting and dialogues - poor, poorly poor. A.Å»mijewski, D.Stenka, M.Komorowska, W.Kowalski, A.Chyra fit into their roles, the rest of the (Polish) cast is out of place (in particular M.Ostaszewska, one of the main characters, what a choice unlucky). 99% of the dialogs are not spoken, they are just put there, the actors have difficulty performing and it's no surprise considering what strange things they had to say. <br /> <br /> And this brings us to the most disappointing problem - you can't hear it. Everything is so theatrical, artificial. There is no real life, no feeling in it. There are lots of original World War II footage and, guess what, the material is much more powerful and dramatic than what A.Wajda did. <br /> <br /> I can only see one positive - despite historical errors (like the acronym ZSRR, it was created for post-1945 propaganda purposes, to please the Polish ZSRS was gone, and now there was ZSRR , but in 1940 there was no ZSRR!), fortunately it is undoubtedly proved that killing Katyn was done by the Soviets (yes, it is a fact, not a controversial gossip). Fantastic, two hours for a 5-10 minute scene. <br /> <br /> In any case - wasted time and potential. This is a tragedy of epic proportions, the will to fight in 1939 (just shown), not declaring war against the Soviet Union by the Polish authorities (so not shown here), the imprisonment of soldiers shortly after, living in outrageous conditions (don't show here), hope and fear what will come next (just shown), and then ... extermination. Hand in hand with the Germans - The Soviets were exterminating the Polish nation, targeting people who formed the backbone of Poland. Unfortunately they succeed and the results are still visible until today.
