I'm a fan of low budget B movies and campy horror movies, but this was too much for me too. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome the weak plot, the effects of cheese and the uninspired acting then the horrible writing will kill you or you would like it. The dialogue was most probably written by high school leavers, who thought that saying "sir, yes sir" over and over again made these boys look more military. <br /> <br /> The characters were all the typical stereotypes of cardboard: Gung-ho sarge, gung-ho type other boy on the sensitive side, evil scientist with secret agenda (bald or Corsican), damn mischievous chick who would warm up if she tried too, stupid sexy girl with vital information, idiotic "genius" "nerd, random other military dudes dying soon enough, and alert of the character of spoiler, mad scientist who was in charge" until something went terribly wrong "Oh yes, I almost forgot, there is a secret military (marine?) submarine, sitting on the bottom of the ocean, 5 minutes from the headquarters (or so it seems), full of radioactive scorpions (ok?) and corpses. Your mission is vague and ill-defined ... <br /> <br /> If you look at this, don't say you haven't been warned.
