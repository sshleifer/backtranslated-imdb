The director looks like a good, solid man. His parents struggle with the same problems we all face. They have moved away from each other. They loved each other. They misunderstood each other. And the poor public must sit through ninety minutes of what are probably the trials and tribulations of one of the most boring families coming out of Long Island. <br /> <br /> There are few interesting choices in this documentary - the music is trivial, the footage not inspired, and the story is the same story that took place on every Birch Street in every city in America. I don't mean to sound too hard - a sweeter and well-intentioned documentary has rarely been made. The director is the kind of man you want to be friends with. I just hope he struggled so much to present the material while his parents kept their marriage alive.
