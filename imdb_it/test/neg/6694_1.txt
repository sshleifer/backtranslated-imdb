This show is perhaps one of the most boring, most fun shows I've ever seen. While humor was subtle, and I am all for subtle humor; the jokes weren't funny at all. <br /> <br /> The show is about two Kiwis in the mid-thirties living in New York trying to start their musical career. <br /> <br /> I saw that episode where Brett leaves the other Kiwi behind during a robbery. Ok, the idea of ​​the plot has potential; but I had the feeling that half of the episode was just filling, and the other half was really important for the story. <br /> <br /> What I want to say is that they kept explaining how the one who was left behind felt betrayed and had a lot of distrust for the other guy. I have a tip for writers: mention it once for idiots who can't understand it the way it plays, and move on. <br /> <br /> And I discovered that the characters were annoying. The character who left the other behind, Brett, proved to be too innocent and naive, the one who left behind went around talking to this monotonous and robotic voice. <br /> <br /> A third character, who was the director of the band, was obviously incompetent, but he was the only character I liked. He is also the one who deserved the show as a star. <br /> <br /> All in all, a show I never plan to see again.
