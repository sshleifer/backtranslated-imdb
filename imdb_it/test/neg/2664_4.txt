James Cagney plays Richard Gargan (nicknamed "Patsy"!), A former gangster who now oversees the pranksters as the new superintendent of a state reform school. Warm genre entry where Cagney is the whole show; dominates the picture, but only because there is not much other interest in progress. Jimmy only gives what is expected of his hard-boiled character, which can be satisfying if you're ready for a quick fix. The director (by Archie Mayo, although Michael Curtiz would have helped) is simple without being particularly compelling, even if the narrative slips into the second half, bringing the film to a messy conclusion (with even Patsy of Cagney getting lost in the shuffle). Remade in 1938 as "Crime School" and again in 1939 as "Hell's Kitchen". ** from ****
