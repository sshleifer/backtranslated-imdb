Not just the money we paid to rent it or even go to the movies. I'm talking about how big production companies waste so much money on things that are actually boring and don't talk about ridicule. With the millions of them they used to make a film like this, because I don't think the actors here would actually work for free or for an insignificant sum. With that money, imagine how many good independent movies you could make, or maybe a good Hollywood movie. It's just to rob you, but not anyone, just most of the guys who are willing to go see an Ashton Kutcher movie, just because they're fans of him. Actually I don't even know how someone with common sense can actually act in this type of film. If you look at it in reality, the actors are the same quality as this movie. So I think I shouldn't be surprised, I really couldn't have expected more.
