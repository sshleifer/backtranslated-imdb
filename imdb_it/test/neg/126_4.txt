It is worth the entertainment value of a rental, especially if you like action movies. This characterizes the usual car chases, fights with the great soccer style of Van Damme, firing rifle shots at 40 rounds and even terrorist style bombs. All this is fun and competently managed, but there is nothing that wipes you out if you've already seen your part. <br /> <br /> The plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit, which is intelligent but hardly deep. Many of the characters are heavily stereotyped: the angry veterans, the terrified illegal aliens, the crooked policemen, the indifferent feds, the whimsical head of the lady's station, the crooked politician, the fat federal who seems to have been typed like the Mexican in a movie of the 40's Hollywood. Everyone acted passively but still nothing special. I thought the main villains were pretty well done and quite well performed. At the end of the film you certainly knew who the good guys were and they were not. There was an emotional passage while the worst ones got their merits. Very simplistic, but then you didn't expect Hamlet, right? The only thing I found really annoying was the continuous cuts to the daughter of VDs during the last fight scene. <br /> <br /> Not bad. Not well. Passable 4.
