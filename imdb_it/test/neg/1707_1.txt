There was a time when Michael Jackson was revered as the king of pop. Then came a time when it attracted negative publicity as much as lemonade attracts wasps. Finally, it is time that we really feel sorry for this man. <br /> <br /> This "movie" is another reason. I promised an angry fan of Michael Jackson to watch it with her. You know the kind of fan - someone who tells him to appreciate everything that the object of affection has ever done. As I watched this movie, which he had already seen twice, I realized how far this fandom went. Probably far enough to classify this film above a 1/10, as some people miraculously did. <br /> <br /> The film attempts to be a parody of many other films and series, in particular Cast Away, Lost and Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, it fails miserably at every level. The acting does not save the story absolutely horrible, the filming has the quality of a videotape too often reproduced, the special effects have been better performed in Be Kind Rewind (for those who do not do it now: with aluminum foil) .. All this would be fun if the movie was successful, well, fun. Unfortunately it is not. It hurts to see this. <br /> <br /> And then there's Michael Jackson's appearance in this garbage. It appears on a projection screen to deliver an important message and manages to find furniture like Jabba the Hutt and as serious as a 4-year-old child. Just when I thought "to whom is the terrible person who caused this poor man to participate in this film and, once again, to make fun of himself", I (finally) reached the credits and discovered that the movie was actually shot partially in Jackson Ranch at Neverland. In other words: Him. Like. It. <br /> <br /> This film, and Jackson's involvement in it, is truly disturbing. Don't even look at it for the "haha, a movie in the Info Bottom 100" effect. Or be warned.
