I went to see this 3 nights ago here in Cork, Ireland. It was the world premiere in the small cinema of the Triskel Arts Center as part of the Cork Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I found "Strange Fruit" as an excellent film. It's a bit rough, but for a low-budget movie you'd expect! In general the acting (in particular from the main protagonist Kent Faulcon) is wonderful, the cinematography and the direction are excellent, and the script is extremely amusing and stimulating, with some beautiful set-ups and witty dialogues. <br /> <br /> The ending was a bit sudden, with no conclusion given to the characters and events once the finale came to its end ... but maybe that's what the directors were thinking? It certainly made the film more disturbing. I liked the fact that the main character has never dealt with his mother on the screen: he leaves you asking if he will never do it, as in real life sometimes these things are never resolved. This was a good choice, leave it unresolved rather than emotionally wrap it! <br /> <br /> Tense and full of suspense everywhere, "Strange Fruit" is an extremely ambitious debut and I have high hopes for what the writer / director The next Kyle Schickner will unleash. He - and his colleagues - are a talent that is worth watching. <br /> <br /> I hope "Strange Fruit" soon gets a wider version, as more and more people deserve to see this movie, an above-average thriller with some original and insightful twists on homophobia and racism in the deep south of America. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended: 7/10
