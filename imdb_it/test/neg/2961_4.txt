I saw Shallow Grave years ago, and * that * was one of those movies that I kept in memory for a long time. It was intense from start to finish and with lots of sudden twists. But all this made sense. <br /> <br /> I can't say the same about Dead Bodies. Above the title there is a subtitle that claims to be "even better than Shallow Grave". This is a big lie. <br /> <br /> Dead Bodies loses strength and becomes much less convincing during the film. <br /> <br /> Two supporting characters, for example, turn out to be far less innocent than they seemed to be before. It might be a surprise, but it didn't surprise me. I could see it coming a few minutes earlier and * this * is a big difference with Shallow Grave. Another thing I have to mention is that the characters in this film often respond not very realistically. They behave more often when the film comes to an end. <br /> <br /> I would have found it much more interesting if some of the characters were completely innocent, not knowing what was happening. It would have been better for the contrast with Tommy and his friend who have to bring a * huge * secret with them. <br /> <br /> But no, for some stupid reason the producers of this film have decided that all the characters should show their darker sides. It doesn't work in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> The ending seemed an open ending. It left me with an unsatisfied feeling. I was expecting a lot more. <br /> <br /> At first I would have given this film six stars because it's not entirely a bad movie. I enjoyed watching it. Most of the time. <br /> <br /> But occasionally I've seen some really bad acting and unrealistic acting scenes and this time because of the disappointing open end, I kept to four stars this time. And because it turned out to be a mistake I spent time and money doing it. Unlike Shallow Grave, I will probably forget Dead Bodies very soon. It's not really such a special film. <br /> <br /> The producers could have done a much better job with this film. It's a pity they didn't do it.
