That growl ... <br /> <br /> That scowl ... <br /> <br /> The acts of random violence ... <br /> <br /> The guttural voice ... <br /> <br /> The fetish wear ... <br /> <br /> That shaved head ... <br /> <br /> It can only mean one thing ... <br /> <br / > GRACE JONES IS BACK! <br /> <br /> Actually my sources tell me that the role of the main character in Blade was not played by the 80s diva, but by Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> All in all this is not an improvement. <br /> <br /> Blade is an adaptation of a comic character; somehow in the transfer from the simplistic and two-dimensional world of the printed page it became even more simplistic and lost a couple of dimensions. <br /> <br /> The plot is almost unbelievable and adds nothing to the vampire, in fact, very similar to Nosferatu, it seems to suck life out of the public. In short, the upwardly mobile vampire wants to become more powerful but opposes Blade, half human, half vampire, all annoying. Everything culminates with Blade being put on a vampire juice press, some bad martial arts and the most ruthless CGI since 1968. <br /> <br /> Blade must be the less empathic character after Dolph at Dolph Lundgren (also a comic adaptation maybe there is a trend here?). Surely the public should be on the same side of the "hero"? And while a vampire can be a tragic character, this is not true for Blade, he is relentlessly cruel, contemptuous and not much better than bad guys. <br /> <br /> I suppose Wesley Snipes has behaved like a career purely so that everyone else can be compared favorably. While his movie growls, you find yourself looking for a stake - even a ballpoint pen - anything to put Blade in the grave. <br /> <br /> As a piece of narcissism, Blade is practically unbeatable - we are treated to endless persistent shots of a fresh Snipes at the gym for no reason. Likewise, no other actor has any chance of giving a reasonable performance; the likes of Steven Dorff * CAN * play, but they have to play a second violin at Snipes' boring performance. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson used to appear in good films, here he is reduced to a companion that you only know will not reach the final reel. And what happens when Blade finds out? Yes, you guessed it, he rushes to the scene to take revenge in the villain's underground lair. <br /> <br /> Why can't you dominate the world in a quiet country house? They always went to the underground cathedrals that would have made Albert Speer wonder if they were a little grandiose. Many of these plans could be stopped at this time if the local councils paid more attention to plans for enlarging the basement. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is just as boring and unimaginative with nothing new to add to the genre. Vampires have been suppressed and perhaps should be put to rest for a while - at least until someone can think of a way to make them interesting again. <br /> <br /> Finally, there * Is * a Grace Jones' vampire movie, it's called Vamp and it's about ten times better than this.
