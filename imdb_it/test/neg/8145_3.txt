Two years after this short, the last short "Our Gang" was released. After seeing this, you wonder how long it lasted. The quality of "Our Gang" has decreased rapidly after switching from Hal Roach to MGM, and this short is a perfect example. The gags are all very unpleasant and Froggy's last line of this is the best day of his life and makes you think of a bad photo of how the rest of the time is for him. A bad example of film production.
