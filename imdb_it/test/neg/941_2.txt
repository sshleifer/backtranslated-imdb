Crazy, horrible farce, basically about a young man who refuses to comply or who uses non-compliance better to achieve his goals - deceiving his parents into believing he is attending college. The truth is that this idiot was rejected by every school he applied to. After seeing this garbage, you'll see why. <br /> <br /> What a ridiculous name - South Hampton Institute of Technology. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand the beginnings of this school of nonsense. The problem with this type of film is that in the end the non-conformist becomes the accepted mode. <br /> <br /> Let's step back into the world of reality and call this movie what it really is: excessive manipulative garbage!
