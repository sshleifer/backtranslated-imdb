During an eight-year period in the 1980s, when Charles Bronson made nine films, only one was released by a company other than the Cannon group: "The Evil That Men Do", a collection of TriStar Films by Sir Lew's ITC Entertainment company Grade. Bronson was already at the height of his collaborations with director J. Lee Thompson, who went through several actors up to "Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects" in 1989. <br /> <br /> Expectations should be quite high with Bronson and Thompson who work for a dress better funded as ITC, but 'The Evil That Man Do' is a big disappointment on many levels. Despite being a low budget, the B film from the 1980s, "Evil" has an attractive potential for a great film. Everyone in the production department, however, took an easy way out and sold the hacking job without deserving of Bronson's imprint. 'The Evil That Men Do' had a concept and technical resources that could have been used to make one of Bronson and Thompson's best films, but instead it will go down as one of the most mediocre. <br /> <br /> This 1984 The political thriller / action maker opens brutally with Clement Molloch (Joseph Maher), a British doctor, who holds his special training course for political leaders in Suriname. The gray-haired passive Molloch is an expert in torture methods that is employed by numerous political regimes. In the seven minutes of opening, we see Molloch using electricity to inflict unbearable pain on Jorge Hidalgo (Jorge Humberto Robles), a dissident journalist. As one might expect, the scene is horrible to watch and has been cut from the original VHS version. <br /> <br /> Hidalgo was none other than a friend of Holland (Bronson), a retired murderer who is enjoying life in the Cayman Islands. The Netherlands was contacted by the journalist years ago to free Molloch's humanity, but rejected the offer. A Mexican professor named Hector Lomelin (José Ferrer) visits shortly after Hidalgo's death to talk to the Netherlands about finishing the job, bringing videotapes of testimonies from the Doctor's victims. At first, despite denial, Holland accepts the dirty work, targeting Molloch and his adorable sister Claire (Antoinette Bower) in Guatemala. <br /> <br /> Holland enters Guatemala City with the help of a consultant, Max Ortiz (René Enríquez); she poses as a tourist with the widow of Hidalgo Rhiana (Theresa Saldana) and her daughter Sarah (Amanda Nicole Thomas) in tow. As with most of Bronson's subsequent production, his character attacks Molloch's henchmen one by one, crossing the path with a squalid American diplomat (John Glover) and his support killer (Roger Cudney) along the way. A brutal ending takes place in the cracks of an opal mine, where the Doctor only gets the deserts of many of his victims. <br /> <br /> 'The Evil That Men Do' is based on a forgotten novel by R. Lance Hill and jumps to American political affairs in Latin America during the 1980s. In fact, "Evil" is hard in every sense of the term, since it uses sensationalism and doses of brutality to cover up enormous weaknesses in the development of the plot and the character. For every advantage that this film has, there are three or four negative aspects, deriving from the craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> While "The Evil That Men Do" has a great concept, the film is never really more of an excuse for Bronson to wipe out the foreign scum. In the style of bad fiction, "Evil" is full of cardboard characters that we never knew or understood. The Netherlands, despite being strongly interpreted by Bronson, never talks about her inner feelings or explains what prompted him to become a killer to hire. Rhiana, a terribly weak part for Theresa Saldana, is disgusted by Holland for most of the way, but later feels an affection for him. Where does his love come from, especially after seeing Holland kill several people and wanting to go home only a few scenes earlier? <br /> <br /> The most interesting characters are actually Molloch and his sister Claire, because so many questions can be asked of them. Of course, we never find out what brought them so close, how and where their torture began, what exactly Claire's role in their business is. These plot holes can last indefinitely, especially with the texture of the paint numbers that seems to do things as it goes on. Why was Hidalgo's daughter taken to such a dangerous situation, except that she was appropriately taken hostage by Molloch? If Molloch's bodyguard, Randolph (Raymond St. Jacques), clearly saw Holland and Rhiana in the cockfight arena, why is he so friendly with them in a late bar? Is his memory so short? And what was really the purpose, besides the economic theatricality, of Holland that threw Molloch Cillero's driver (Jorge Luke) from a window sill when the murder could have been handled more discreetly in Claire's apartment? <br /> <br /> General acting is decent and somehow Bronson gives one of his strongest interpretations. The management of J. Lee Thompson lacks points, but may have been compromised by a limited time on the site. In addition to the filming of Evil in Mexico, the presence of ITC is evident through the best values ​​of production, cinematography and music. Rural areas are well used to convey the warm and dusty atmosphere of Latin America and director of photography Xavier Cruz offers intense colors and clarity. Ken Thorne's orchestral soundtrack ("Murphy's War") is refreshing in an era of synthesized garbage. Strangely, these positive aspects only add to the frustration of a good movie that is screaming to go out. Peter Lee Thompson's editing is better than usual, albeit with more laughable errors in continuity. <br /> <br /> 'The Evil Than Men Do' was perfect milling material for the early 1980s and I find it difficult to recommend it for the action of the 21st century fans. The Columbia TriStar Entertainment DVD is a valid presentation, offering widescreen and standard format with subtitles in four languages. While the video quality is well above average, "Evil" was originally recorded in simple mono audio. The theatrical trailer is offered and actually has a grindhouse look, with eroded colors and blurred sound quality. <br /> <br /> ** out of 4
