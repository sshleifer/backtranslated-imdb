I really hated this movie and it's the first film written by Stephen King that I haven't finished. I was really disappointed, it was the worst shit I've ever seen. What were you thinking doing three hours out of it? Could he have a pretty good story, but actors? No. Suspense? No. Romance? No. Horror? No. He had nothing. <br /> <br /> He has this strange, crazy man of science with Einstein's hair, the classic thing. Not real at all. And a man keeps rejuvenating all the time. It looks like they just used the name of Stephen King to make a bad movie, too long with nothing exciting. <br /> <br /> I gave this film "1 (horrible)". If they had like -5, I'd probably take it instead. It was a complete waste of time.
