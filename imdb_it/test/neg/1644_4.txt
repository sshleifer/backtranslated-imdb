Nice pain ... to think you've seen it all ... Danny Thomas looks so out of place in this mess. He looks really uncomfortable. She can't sing worthy of licking herself, and when she's paired with Peggy Lee (PEGGY LEE ???) she easily .. EASY ripping him off! Perhaps the director saw this and made him do the real bad comedy routines he sometimes does in the movie. Peggy Lee is ok, but everything is a mess. Good for a laugh, maybe.
