Friend, what a horrible movie. As with many terrible films, the structure of his terribleness lies in the script. This is such a pathetic attempt at a psychological thriller that gives the entire genre a bad name. Ok, here's one of the main problems: the character of Sandra Bullock is kidnapped by Jeff Bridges in his car in a busy shop in broad daylight. Somehow, her boyfriend Kiefer Sutherland does not find a single witness of this act and subsequently spends most of the film completely unaware of where he is. Come on! Personally, I find this completely offensive even to the smallest of members of the public. Yet we are forced to buy this nonsense. Of equal frustration is the unexplained reason for Jeff Bridges' actions. His character is a bit eccentric academic, of course, but far from the sociopath that would do these things. Go through about ten minutes, give or take, spilling his beans to Sutherland about why he did his cruel deeds. But the explanation itself also lacks the most elementary sense of logic. Therefore, no member of the intelligent public can really believe in the possibility of his illness. And if you subtract that element from the story, the whole thing disintegrates. <br /> <br /> Also of great concern: - Jeff Bridges uses a strange, pseudo-French accent for no reason. <br /> <br /> - The whole boring subplot involving Nancy Travis, in particular she who saves the day by turning the tables on Bridges. <br /> <br /> - The crazy woman who somehow manages to remember the number plate of Jeff Bridges although she also thought that the Lucky Charms leprechaun is real. <br /> <br /> - The name of Sandra Bullock's character, Diane Shaver, conveniently recomposes to form the word "disappeared". Are you kidding? -The logistical impossibility of drugging, abducting and burying (in a very remote position) a human being within forty minutes (as he specifically alludes to Bridges). <br /> <br /> This is a film that made me reminiscent of the fictional, incredibly stupid (but very successful) character of Donald Kaufman in Adaptation. Many screenwriters are brilliant and inspired artists. Some are just bozos that convince the idiots who run the studios to make their rounds. This particular script is so incredibly obscure that Donald Kaufman himself could have sold it. Unfortunately for all of us in the real world, Todd Graff actually did it.
