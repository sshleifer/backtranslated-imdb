This film demonstrates a theory I have had for some time - in Australia, as long as a film deals with the right subject, it will be a success regardless of how terrible it is. Aussie Park Boyz could not be worse - the acting is beyond all things, the plot is basically a poor Warriors warrior and the producers have no idea of ​​the ethnic bands in Australia (a twenty-first century Irish band in Sydney! The last time any Irish band was in Australia was about a century ago at the time of tinsmiths!) But because they are ethnic rivalries, one of the four arguments guaranteed to be a success in Australian cinema (along with families in difficulty, groups of minority and the biography of a famous Australian) has won numerous academic awards. I have always suspected that Australian critics would grab every kind of garbage that deals with these problems, but a part of me thought, or at least hoped, that they had their limits. This film demonstrates the opposite. So, for all of you aspiring Australian filmmakers, don't worry about putting thought in your film or choosing people who can really act, or even getting the right facts - just write a script of a poor family trying to make ends meet, or someone from a foreign race who comes to Australia and has to deal with racial prejudices and stereotypes, or, if you want to pull out a leaf from the book of these people, an ethnic band that fights some other ethnic band that really isn't plausible period in which the film is set and your film will win five academic awards regardless of how pathetic it is!
