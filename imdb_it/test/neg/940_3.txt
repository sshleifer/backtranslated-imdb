I wasn't so impressed with this movie, finding it rather boring and simple. The plot was interesting, a little boy who created his college and enrolled hundreds of children, but the laughter was few and far between. The jokes were not really funny and I never had an instinct in any of the scenes. The characters were not intriguing and I felt no feelings for any of them, not even the lively and fat little boy with glasses who tried to enter the group of the brotherhood. It was a good first watch, but it didn't blow me up and it's not one I'd recommend. Comparing it to other films of the same genre, for example, American Pie is simply cruel, because there is a movie that has been laughter-a-lot. This ACCEPTED failed to raise a smile!
