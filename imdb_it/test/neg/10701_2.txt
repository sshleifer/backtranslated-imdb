This movie stinks. There is not much more. The last fight looked like Walker making fun of my grandmother, not a supernatural demon with the strength of ten men. I found the most interesting spots. The twists and turns could be seen reaching a mile away. The only saving quality of this film was its conclusion. Avoid this at all costs ... unless you like the bad Chuck Norris movies.
