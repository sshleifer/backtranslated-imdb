I realize that the sentence on my summary is not too polite. <br /> <br /> This film written and directed by Scott Caan and starring Giovanni Ribisi, Don Cheadle and the same runs for 88 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a dog in this puppy of a movie., It's cute. <br /> <br /> The film was opened in 2 US cinemas in late April 2007, for a week and grossed all $ 914. It went quickly to DVD in early August 2007. <br /> <br / > We were able to take about 40 minutes before turning off the DVD. <br /> <br /> This was the type of film that was played on the lower half of the double bill. You saw the main movie and imagined seeing what this is like, you might have left before turning it off. <br /> <br /> The 3 actors and girls in the film have done and deserve better than this .. <br /> <br /> Ratings: ** (out of 4) 54 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10_
