This little fussy is remarkable only because it is the worst movie ever made by Abbott and Costello. It's terrible from every point of view: poor music, horrible choreography (look at the awkward male dancer), special effects and sets, wooden actors (the protagonists are barely in high school in their profession and were never named later) , and a script without a single laugh. The best times were ahead for the comic duo. Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd is very preferable, as is the television series, which has sometimes been inspired. But skip this one.
