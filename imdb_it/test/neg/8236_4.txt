Revisiting old movies that you thought were average is not necessarily a good thing. Sometimes they get worse. Promoted by the Fangoria camp (in Gorezone they labeled it "the scariest Texas film CHAINSAW" ?? um, no), LUTHER THE GEEK inexplicably developed a cult followed by an "intense" horror film. Actually, it's just a stall and a mediocre movie, a bite movie that briefly sets itself apart from the pack with a killer cackling like a chicken. Yes, like a chicken. To the credit of the director, at least they didn't make the killer look like a duck at LA NEW YORK RIPPER. It would simply be silly. <br /> <br /> The narrative logic is completely abandoned in LUTHER THE GEEK. I'm not saying that slasher movies are rich in reason, but at least in HALLOWEEN Michael Myers fled. Luther is actually released after a long scene in which people claim he was reformed, although he cackles like a chicken and has a razor prosthesis (which apparently turned into a prison). It is the kind of movie in which a couple sees a slam in a door and the girl refuses her saying: "Oh, my mother must have forgotten her keys, forget a lot of things since my father died". The kind of film in which the hysterical mother comes across a policeman in search of Luther and tells him: "The murderer is in my house!" So what does it do? He grabs her and literally drags her back into the house and says: "Show me only where he is and I'll do the rest". Why not call back? <br /> <br /> Too bad the film is full of such horrible actions and dialogues because Luther's character is actually quite interesting. Most of the credit goes to Ed Terry, a dead player for Tom Noonan in MANHUNTER, who gives Luther a disgusting threat. In the hands of a fair director, LUTHER THE GEEK could be on the same level as SONNY BOY or SANTA SANGRE and be a real cinematic strangeness. But Albright is not that director and merely places the charming Luther character in boring pitfalls.
