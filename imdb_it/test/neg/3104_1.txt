the worst movie I've ever seen, I haven't even looked at it, I simply forwarded it quickly to Burt's bits and then to the end !!! he is the only reason to see it !! I have to admit to having a copy as I am a HUGE Burt fan (stop laughing) and I needed it for my collection I wouldn't care when this movie came out I had a rent nightmare as my local store only had 2 copies and fans of all the various stars have always beaten me there, I imagine my disappointment when I sat down and watched this movie !! THERE ARE NO ONLY NO QUALITY OF REDENTEMENT ABOUT THIS FILM !!! Absolutely NOTHING I NEVER LIKE THIS FILM !!! this movie has become a running joke between me and Burt's worst companion !! Rob Lowe's worst time is half my life
