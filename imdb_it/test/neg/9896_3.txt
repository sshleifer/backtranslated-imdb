CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer who lives in Australia. An American by birth George Greenough has sailed and photographed himself, friends and recently, dolphins, in Australia for 35 years, all using various invented cameras that bind him on his back, on board or in a boat. In the mid-1970s he collaborated with Surf Mag publisher and emerging director David Elfick to create this visually interesting tale about this life and photography. The result is 75 minutes with CRYSTAL VOYAGER. Even in the 70s the audience was a little baffled by this film, neither surfing nor surfing, because George swims on a zippy table as a child, not a real surfboard ... he makes up for the boring buzz of George ( occasionally dry or funny that in reality it was fun ... as if you were almost setting fire to or falling on something) with a spectacular "you are there", the power slips through a wave that runs for 23 minutes, all set to music by Pink Floyd. In 1974, when it opened the Sydney Opera House, it also contained a cinema. Crystal Voyager was booked there as an arty-sporty OZ pic and by default it became a success: as the 'opera tickets' cost much more than a movie ticket, the public huddled to see this movie as a sorry for being 'at the Sydney Opera House' ... so the film did record business as an economic attraction for residents and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they had seen a show 'there'. This created this myth that the film was a huge crowd call and the reputation spread. As a result, he was joined by the fantastic cartoon FANTASTIC PLANET and had a thrilling ride through the UK and Europe as a double film. I ran it in a coastal movie theater in the 1970s and the crowd was pretty upset about this. Recently George has re-emerged the style of Lord Of The Flies with another well-photographed marine adventure called DOLPHIN GLIDE that offers viewers a dive and swims with the wild dolphins of Byron Bay. It's an eccentric 20-minute short with an even more eccentric 20 min than George. Each of them met a collective yawn both from the media and from the public in January 2005 ... which makes CRYSTAL VOYAGER a "must have been there" in all these years. However in a special Oz Surf night in an outdoor cinema last year, 2000 people arrived ... but then 2000 they got up every night to see something there during this summer movie season ... so the damn thing has hit another office binge box. How many were really appreciated is very open to debate. Once again they were more than likely simply perplexed by this crazy movie with a surprising reputation. However, since 1975, Elfick has embarked on an extraordinary career as a producer and director of numerous Italian and international films. Look for NO COMPENSATION or STARSTRUCK or UNDERCOVER or RABBIT PROOF FENCE or LOVE IN LIMBO for a clear and present applause to its results. George, however, is still floating out there somewhere buzzing and looking for something else to film or drop a camera.
