I saw this movie yesterday on a public service channel. They advertised it as a horrible movie, so I was attracted to seeing it, and I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br /> A group of 18-19 year-olds goes to an excavation site at an old Viking castle in Denmark, to try to discover the myth of the Vikings of the Berserker. Strange things happen: something is in the forest, and people start to disappear. <br /> <br /> The main thing about this movie that really annoys me is that the story should take place in Denmark, where I live. There were so many places in the film where the Hollywood style overlapped with the Danish reality. It really made me laugh at acting and drama in my eyes. <br /> <br /> You never see the characters interacting with any of their surroundings. He feels like a mini-Hollywood in Denmark, and takes away the credibility of the film. When at some point you hear someone speak "old Danish", it sounds exactly like modern Swedish. A really bad research, considering that the director is Danish. <br /> <br /> The characters in the film used GPS and maps, and this is really fun, as Denmark has the size of your garden. Nomads where you are, there is never more than 50 km from the sea, and 500 meters from civilization. And if you are in a castle, there will be tourists everywhere. We see many overviews of the forests in the film and sometimes we see what looks like North American vegetation (?). I didn't like the story exactly, maybe because the acting was so bad. When the characters see swamp creatures for the first time, they are not even afraid. I imagine that their acting skills were insufficient to show realistic emotions. In the end, there is an unexpected turn, but it didn't hit me, since I didn't care much. <br /> <br /> Swamp creatures are cheap, but they had the potential to be scary. Unfortunately, they fail, as we observe them well in the forest when the characters arrive at the castle. Also, there are no really scary scenes, since the Bog Creatures are mostly around. <br /> <br /> However, the conclusion: ignoring the facts, the film is the typical B-horror film. I guess people in other countries can enjoy more. Until you are aware of reality, it does not matter. Just like I think of the USA as a great action movie, everyone else can think of Denmark as a forest with a castle ... and some living dead in a swamp ...
