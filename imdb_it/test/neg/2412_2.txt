The only good thing about this film is the artwork on the H. R. Geiger promotional poster. Anti-nuke protesters that all looked like punk rockers from the late 1970s, and somehow became non-violent, (except for their leader, "Splatter") who occupied the cities. The boys of the brotherhood descend on punkers to do violence to them and turn them into victims. The bad acting and the negative plot then descend on the true victim, you, the viewer. I gave this "2" because some sexual scenes offer at least the potential MST3K. <br /> <br />
