The title comes from a passage in the Bible (Deut 28:28). Let's just say that it's taken horribly out of context, but nevertheless, that's where the title of this dying film comes from. The other reviewers cover the details of the plot, so I won't consider them. But the husband, who is a psychiatrist, holds a lecture on "lower function" where he discusses how a person can meet another person and can experience a "catastrophic crisis" in their lives where they stop being masters of themselves and incapable of just judgment. He says it on the podium at the exact moment when he fixes his eyes on Leonora Vail in the audience: the woman who will become his lover. Not very subtle to show that this is really what will happen to this poor man. I think the whole premise of the film is implausible and simply didn't work. There's an over-the-hill psychiatrist here, and we have to believe that this beautiful young woman falls for him and stands between the happiness he and his wife shared. What is even more plausible is the way the betrayed wife responds when she learns of infidelity. Not only does she understand, but INSISTS that her husband embarks on a vacation of several months with the tramp - "so we can all get a little relief from this unbearable stress". GIVE ME A BREAK!! I wanted to reach the screen and control not only the adulterer, but the dark wife. <br /> <br /> The fact that the entire film takes place as a flashback after having already revealed the end of the film in the beginning (the fact that her husband had a terrible accident) - leaves no doubt about the outcome of the sordid affair. I think this was a bad decision as it leaves absolutely no unexpected twists, as the whole film is completely predictable. You already know the resignation of the wife to the matter at the beginning of the film when she calls the mistress at the bedside of the dying and does not express ill will towards her. <br /> <br /> Not only is the script defective, but Noel Coward is horribly misplaced (even though it's his script). He and Leonora have absolutely no chemistry on the screen. Interestingly, Michael Redgrave was originally chosen for that role, but he was replaced during the shoot. I wonder what it was? In the end, neither husband nor wife make you feel sympathy for either of them. I think Margaret Leighton played the bitch part pretty well. But she could not possibly overcome all the negatives of this film. Moreover, as in the case of many British productions of this era, dialogue is difficult to understand due to the actors' quick and spoken pattern. I saw it on TV and couldn't even rely on subtitles to fill in the blanks for me. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this.
