With all his technical flash, the 1993 "Stalingrad" movie is very disappointing. Before seeing it, I had read the non-fiction stories from the Stalingrad campaign and had seen many documentary films and photographs of the royal battle and its participants. I don't think any film can really manage to represent the titanic struggle and suffering that actually occurred, but I still wanted to see what a relatively recent German film production would be like. While there are some good elements of this film, overall it's a failure. For me the worst aspect is that it includes substantial anachronisms, and also some very elaborate and cliché elements, the most evident in some meetings between a German officer and a Soviet woman. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are some ideological elements in the film that lead to very distorted perceptions, including what amounts to a caricature of a German chaplain, some disproportionate class war messages and problematic representations of "good" Germans "against" bad guys ". Certainly the German armed forces of the Second World War included men who were able to maintain some decency during the war, and others who did very bad things, but the attempts in the film to show this contrast are very simplistic and childish. I give credit to "Stalingrad" in the sense that it does not completely depict the German troops in the simple demonic quality which is the stereotype that many people now have, yet the film includes its own stereotypes, like an almost too good-to-be-true knave that has attitudes more akin to the 90s than the 40s, and two completely evil infantrymen and a rearguard officer. <br /> <br /> Some recent films like "Stalingrado" and "Save the Private Ryan" are often praised for their "authenticity" in depicting graphic fighting scenes, yet these same films are deeply flawed and distorted in their description of the attitudes, values ​​and behaviors of the soldiers and civilians of 1940. "Stalingrad" and "SPR" have major and minor characters who lack the unconscious stoicism that was common among normal people during the time of the Second World War. Certainly soldiers throughout history have been famous for their frequent cynicism and their occasional cynicism, yet the self-absorbed, talkative and touchy characters in both of these films are something else, and are much more widespread in our world today. than they were in the 1940s. While many people these days like to denigrate the war movies of the 1940s and 1950s that present more patriotic messages and are not as graphic about the fight, many of those earlier films like "Battlegrounds" are much more accurate in their depictions of soldiers typical "attitudes, and are often successful in showing the horrible effects of war in more indirect ways. <br /> <br /> A well-made part of" Stalingrad "is a battle between German infantry and Soviet tanks, which makes a reasonable work to capture some of the horror and confusion in this type of combat. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" does a poor job although it shows the common appearance of the front-line soldier. A part of this it could be due to the difficulty of finding thin, haggard-looking extras in our pampered and well-fed America of today and in Western Europe.Also, too many German troops in the film are not wearing their u uniforms and their equipment appropriately and do not show the professional survey that was common in the German Wehrmacht even during the years of the German defeat. If you want to get an idea of ​​what the German troops looked like, I recommend the following documentaries that contain footage of Stalingrad's campaign: "The world of war", "The war of the century" and "The war of Russia". Also the books "Operation Barbarossa in photograph" by Paul Carell, "Stalingrado" by Geoffrey Jukes and "Stalingrad" by Paul Carell contain many useful photos. Also the books written on the battle of Antony Beevor and William Craig are recommended, and the latter is particularly suitable for ordinary soldiers and civilians on both sides. <br /> <br /> Relatively recent films that, in my opinion, are much better than "Stalingrad" and "Saving Private Ryan" in portraying people's attitudes and characters during World War II, and the general feeling, the appearance, horror and pettiness of that war, are "Der Untergang" ("The Downfall") and "Talvisota" ("The Winter War"). While "A Bridge Too Far" and "The Longest Day" cover events on the Western Front rather than the East, they are also excellent war films, and are very close to factual accounts. The last two films lack a bit of the grit that is more widespread in more recent films, but compensate for that lack with their other strengths, including veracity.
