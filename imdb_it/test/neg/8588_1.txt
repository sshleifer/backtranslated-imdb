Another lame attempt to make a "gritty" and "stimulating" film - whatever the hell it means. They have Al Pacino say many words like "Television killed football". Yeah whatever. This is another film that shows the Delusions of the Greatness of Oliver Stone. If Stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something, why does he insist on romanticizing sport with his chamber movements and Kid Rock songs? He also throws Cameron Diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons. It's a shame that Diaz and Pacino have to meet in such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Ever since "Scent of Woman", writers and directors have used Pacino to romanticize their pathetic lines. His characters are nothing more than speakers - their voices cover what would normally be redundant and trivial. He needs to reinvent himself, showing how he can act without shouting. He must stop being sorry for hockey scripts with "Organized football is messed up" class and play a good story.
