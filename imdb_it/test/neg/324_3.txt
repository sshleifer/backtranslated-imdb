On Halloween, three friends look for an ancient cemetery in the suburb for fun and remove a cross from a tomb, where Jack-O was buried many years ago by peasant Arthur Kelly. The evil creature is unleashed, kills the trio and looks for descendants of the Kelly family for revenge. <br /> <br /> The "Jack-O" is a combination of a terrible story with a terrible acting. I was curious with the name of John Carradine in the credits and I can't imagine how a relative authorizes the use of archive footage in such a bad film, showing a total lack of respect with the name of this great actor. It's impressive how bad acting is, moving the film into a comedy instead of the proposed horror genre. This is the kind of nice movie to watch with a group of friends, drink beer, make comments and laugh a lot. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jack-O ?? Demo de Halloween" ("Jack-O ?? Demon of the Halloween")
