Here's the spoiler: at the end of the film, a little piece of you dies. You'll spend the rest of your life searching in vain for that missing piece, but it's gone, it's gone. You will walk the streets at night scanning the windows of your neighbors as they sit down to dinner. Friends and family members will try to identify when exactly you became a living dead. You will answer their questions and concerns with an empty look and some mutter on a fleeing testicle. When AMC inevitably turns Tomcats into the "movie of the month", a series of mysterious murders will take place in your city. You will wake up the next morning perched on the kitchen floor with a faint taste of brain in your mouth. Then you'll go crawling in the living room and on the sofa. You will fix the wall, you will get a little wet and then you will start laughing maniacally. Because once you died inside, Jake Busey in a thong is really damn funny.
