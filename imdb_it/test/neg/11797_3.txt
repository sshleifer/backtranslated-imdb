Obviously, someone was trying to capture the wave of "Blair Witch". <br /> <br /> This movie was created like all the shows of the haunted "reality" that are popping up on TV lately (and I have to admit, I get a kick from these), but this movie is VERY cheesier! Probably the first three quarters of the film are full of "participants" crossing the house, WHINING. Give me a break! Spending 10 minutes complaining about getting into the attic is not my idea of ​​a good time. All paranormal events are brazen configurations. No rope, but too perfectly captured by the camera to be real. Even the "participants" were not very nice. Two stupid guys who don't take it seriously, a girl who gets scared at the fall of a hat and the quintessential "paranormal" person. Is it becoming the cliché - "formula" for a ghost movie? <br /> <br /> I must admit that the last 15 minutes were pure tension. They took every ounce of tension in the film and blocked it in those 15 minutes. I admit, I spent that time walking in the kitchen. I would not recommend this film to younger viewers, even if they are PG13. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for some entertainment, if you don't take it seriously, we'll give you the kick-off for this movie. There are a lot of situations to make cracks! If you are looking for a great story, look elsewhere;)
