After writing this review I have trouble trying to think of what to write. Not much in this film. The plot is a South Asian woman who falls in love with an English Londoner. The problem is that he and his friends had a racist streak. At the same time, her friend at work is unknowingly having sex with her brother for her, and only intensifies from there. The problem is that this film is very predictable. As soon as all this has happened, it's all pretty standard. Slightly transcends even if it lasts only 90 minutes. This is more of a Chick chick than anything else. So if you are male, I don't recommend this movie.
