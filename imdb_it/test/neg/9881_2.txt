My first impression when I read the synopsis for the upcoming film was that it would have been very, very different from the book. The movie trailer said the film should take place when Vivian is 19 after her parents were killed in a fire in America. Meet Aiden, aspiring graphic novelist. Working in a chocolate shop during the day, he must accept that it will never be normal, because every full moon becomes a loup-garou - a mythical creature thought to be very close to a werewolf. <br /> <br /> Most of the small changes didn't seem too bad, even though I'm a fan of the book with the title of Annette Curtis Klause. I knew it would be different, but I wanted to see it to support the book, thinking that a change of age, a change of setting and some small changes in employment would have had no impact on the plot overall enough to make me want to rip my eyes off from their orbits and leave me bleeding on the cinema floor. <br /> <br /> The film has unnecessarily killed many important characters, one of whom was Esme, Vivan's mother, right in the focus on the fire that was supposed to have killed her father. I pushed it aside and ventured into the movie, tired and slightly annoyed. Crossing through Romania, the camera angles were decent, the scenery was beautiful and the music was ... interesting ... but it left me with the impression of "Why does Vivian look like this, and why is she wearing a hoodie?" Jumping to the later parts of the film, I must say that I am surprised that the authors of the script seemed to support incest in a sense and rather than stick to the relationship between the character of Vivian and Rafe, the Five leader now became her cousin through she (surprise!) Aunt Astrid, who, in the novel, was the bitter and hated rival of Vivan's mother, and, I might add, in no way related to either of them. <br /> <br /> Go to the top outside the character's distortions, Gabriel had somehow become the leader of the pack and obsessed by the fact that Vivian was his companion so that he could satisfy a non-existent prophecy. Not only was his physical appearance complete with 180 from the description of the book, he was, apparently, also Rafe's father. Yes, it's true, it's a nice little incestuous knot of wolves all packed. <br /> <br /> The little things that bothered me were scenes like forest hunting. There was a red head that stood out from the rest of the crowd, the one that "kissed their enemy" before their prey was free to run and be hunted. Why was he there? Why did she look like Astrid? I suppose my mind is not large enough to understand why such a character had to exist in the film without any explanation as to why it existed besides kissing the beautiful victims. <br /> <br /> I loved how the Amoeba was completely cut out of the movie. I loved how legally intertwined Aiden's past, what of the seemingly dramatic scene in which he was telling Vivian how his father wanted him to learn self-defense, and then beat his father "self-defense" to make him look such a tragic character. <br /> <br /> The 180 characters are very funny when they are completely useless. At the end of the film, I felt like someone was touching the novel, scribbling half of the list of character names, drawing some connection here and there, hinting at the fact that Gabriel was a bit of a jerk, Vivian fell in love with Aiden, he fears her when discovers that he is a loup-garou of legends, and "someone" is "killed by a silver bullet" and there is a kind of happy ending because Vivian finally feels accepted by someone who loves her for who she is. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2/10 because the camera shots were relatively decent, and the casting could have been worse, but as far as directing is concerned, because the leap from loup-garous in the air in human form as if they wanted to fly (with the arched backs and the inclination to jump from high places), glimmer briefly, and then fall to the ground like wolves? The only aspects of this film that even made me look up to the sordid, unpleasant ending were the wolves, the beautiful scenery and the boys who love eyes. <br /> <br /> All together, I have to say that in order to fully enjoy this film, you need to be prepared for misconceptions, strange events that are not always explained, countless incestuous ones that have not liked the book or have not read the book.
