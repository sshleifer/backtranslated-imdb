I should agree with the previous review: This film has fantastic animation, but it has problems for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The holes in the plot are enormous, the dialogue barely explains the concepts of the plot - the MAIN PLOT POINTS are not even completely explained until the last five minutes of the film. The characters affirm the obvious, while failing to explain the most confused points of the film. There are characters that appear and matter in the plot that are never explained - many of them have names that are only mentioned * once *, and are extremely confusing to a viewer. <br /> <br /> Don 'Wasting your time with this movie. Unless it's inside for a good laugh and it's like DUMB.
