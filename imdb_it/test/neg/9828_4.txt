The sumptuous production values ​​that you generally find in a Merchant / Ivory film are all here, but this is an extraordinarily boring take on what could have been a very lively affair. I agree with a previous manifesto that makes no sense that the story unfolds through the eyes of an African-American family, yet their ancestor, Sally Hemmings, barely has a role to play in the proceedings. There is not much clarity in helping the public to understand the motivations of one of these historical figures. And I was very annoyed by the accents of a number of characters. Nancy Marchand looked very English for what is supposed to be a French nun. And both Gwyneth Paltrow and Greta Scacchi seemed to try different accents in various scenes. In fact, Gwyneth is very little served in this biographical film. His role as the daughter of Thomas Jefferson, Martha, is written in such a way that he can never understand who he really is. One moment he is slapping a slave, and another moment, he is deploring the whole system of slavery. Nick Nolte plays the role quite well, but he never really gets us interested in Jefferson or any of his exploits. Very disappointing after all.
