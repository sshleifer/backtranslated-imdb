I find Herzog's documentary work to be very irregular. Fata Morgana, a kind of complement to the Lessons of Darkness, lacks not only the harrowing spectacle, but above all the careful eye of an author. It is compared to an amateur aspect, pans without purpose on the left and right through the desert of the type one would expect from any German tourist equipped with a handycam, the camera left by a car window to collect all kinds of images without of meaning, wire fences, abandoned buildings and patches of earth that cross the lens in random order, interconnected with shots of sand dunes. At one point Herzog meets a group of hungry cows that rot in the sand, yet the image is presented in a very similar way to you and me, perhaps worse, the camera peering by hand from one cattle to another. For a documentary that tries to be a visual feast, a hypnotic and surreal excursion into unexplored landscapes, the visual orchestration and the conviction of a disciplined author is missing. The Mayan creation myths recited with the voiceover, then another text that Herzog loved for literature is everywhere, a bit boring and boring. It is not until the end that Fata Morgana jumps alive through a series of bizarre encounters. First with a man and a woman playing music in a room, the man singing in a distorted voice through a microphone, both apathetic in their task. A man who supports a turtle. A group of old people trying to get out of some holes in the ground. In addition to this, this seems to have very little substance to offer or visual splendor to offer.
