I bought it out of curiosity. How did John Carradine (who died in 1988) and Cameron Mitchell (who died in 1994) make appearances in a film made in 1995? Thanks to the miracle of unused films, it's possible that the film has been sitting on a shelf for a few decades, here's how! It can be said why the film used to shoot the scenes does not match the film used for the "Jack-O" filming. Ed Wood's curse continues to live. The good thing for both Carradine and Mitchell is that this is exactly the kind of movie you would expect to find on both their filmographies. The same goes for Scream Queens Linnea Quigley, Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith. <br /> <br /> The setting is Oakmoor Crossing on Halloween, and a kind of curse is released when dumb and mischievous teenagers break a grave. The result: a slaying killer with a scythe and a big plastic pumpkin on his head! He (yes?) Goes after the healthy Kelly family for revenge (and kills others who stand in his way). The father opens a Haunted Garage for neighborhood children. The son (Ryan Latshaw, son of the director) has a continuous and perplexed facial expression for all his scenes and a dramatic hilarious theatrical scene that lies in a tomb. At least he's a child. Her mother's eyes come out of her head as she struggles to read her dialogue. There is also an annoying woman who shows up to explain things that seem to want to pronounce a phonetic pronunciation on all her dialogues. <br /> <br /> So what about the names of the actors? You see Stevens, Wildsmith and Mitchell briefly on a television screen (they are used to making up time). Linnea plays a bigger role as a babysitter and does exactly what it can with it. His enthusiastic performance helps a little. There's also a laugh out of the blue when an ultra-conservative couple watching a Rush Limbaugh clone on TV bite her. The woman slips on a carpet and sticks a toaster with a knife. It is electrocuted and the end result resembles a flame-burned Muppet. <br /> <br /> All in all, pretty funny things! I wasn't bored!
