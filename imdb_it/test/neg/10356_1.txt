I'm a fan of this generally excellent show although sometimes quite boring, but the third season has taken some terrible indications about the plot. The HERO episode is an example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> The story that finally reveals itself is that the Cylons deliberately allow Bulldog - a pilot captured several years earlier during a Black Ops mission - to escape, steal a Cylon ship and return to Galactica. The plan is that when Bulldog returns, he will discover that Adama has left him to his fate and be so infuriated that he will kill Adama, which he almost does. <br /> <br /> Now the problem is this: the Cylons installed it so that Bulldog thinks he escaped alone. This means that Bulldog gets off the Cylon ship without assistance. So he kills a Cylon and gets out of his holding cell - so much we see. So, we have to assume that he heads for the flight hangar, manages to get into a Cylon hunting ship and learn how to operate it, takes off and returns to Galactica. That's right. <br /> <br /> Now Starbuck has managed to make one of them work in season one, which was barely credible, but he only had to make it fly visually out of orbit before coming into contact with Galactica. Bulldog has to program his ship so that he makes several jumps through hyperspace and manages to reach Galactica from a few thousand light years away, in an unknown direction. How do you program a ship that contains completely alien technology? Cylons connect to their computers by touch, there are no visual consoles or keyboards. And having managed that miraculous endeavor, how do you know where Galactica is, bearing in mind that Galactica took off about 3 years earlier and is trying to escape the Cylons - doesn't it leave the headlights behind? Even taking into account the suspension of disbelief that must be applied to any science fiction show, this episode makes absolutely no sense.
