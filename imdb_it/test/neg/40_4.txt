I bought it on VHS as "Terror Hospital", and when I got home I checked IMDb and I was like OMG, it's the legendary "Nurse Sherri" !!! So here's another one from Al Adamson, who had clearly learned some tiny amounts about making the film since the "Blood of Dracula's Castle". When that previous effort is a more or less totally sclerotic nodule, it mixes it up a little, adding a definite element of variety and surprise between incompetence. Certainly half of the film is a post-operative blind football player who shoots in the breeze with his stacked nurse, but at any time we might be cutting off the disgusting disembodied head of the satanist's mind, or the nurse Sherri who runs a farmer a pitchfork, or a little bit of abstract student-film rhythms to go with the button-blob effects in the possession scene, or the most courteously topless heart ever, or god knows what else (I forget, to be honest) . Like stupid pieces of sh * t go, this runs to the high end. Congratulations, Al.
