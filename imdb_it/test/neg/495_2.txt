No emotion. Bad music (and I'm a metal boy from the eighties reformed, so I would be vulnerable to some good things.) Everything is in half. The brother is a parody, there is nothing to restrain ourselves except to see what horror of the eighties will come later. The tour manager tries to bring a humanity to the thing, but he is not given enough time. Wahlberg is fine and Aniston is staggering. We know he didn't need money. Is this the only role you could include in your summer break? Surely he has to slap his forehead whenever he appears on VH1 - which is only slightly less often than Ozzy. It barely qualifies as a TV movie. It is hard to believe that it was actually distributed in the hall.
