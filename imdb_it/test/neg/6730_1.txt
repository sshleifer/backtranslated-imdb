I must say that I really liked UNDER SIEGE and HARD TO KILL. <br /> <br /> watching Seagal do his fun martial arts on people. I've always been looking forward to Seagal-Movies and, unfortunately, I was initially disappointed with GLIMMER MAN, which I found really bad. FOREIGNER is probably one of the worst Seagals I've ever made <br /> <br />. Horribly boring, badly edited, wrong soundtrack and so on! Dear reader, do yourself a favor and stay away from this! <br /> <br /> Honestly: stay away!
