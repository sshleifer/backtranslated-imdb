The idea behind Dead Silence is fantastic: the explosion of zombies takes place during a paranoia radio talk show. There was so much for this movie. Unfortunately, as soon as the zombies made their appearance, everything was lost. <br /> <br /> The film is ridiculous and only those with a passion for cheese, horror b-flick can enjoy it. The zombies were really stupid! They ran around waving their arms. They looked like a group of people wearing a home filled with elementary students. I know this is a brief review, but I don't see the need to invest much in this. It's a stupid movie. You have been warned
