There are many reasons why I'm not a fan of fact-based films, but more than any other is how filmmakers give themselves the creative license for the story. If they have such an imagination then why not use that talent to create something original? Otherwise, stick to the facts. This could have been an ok film if only they had done just that. Ed Gein was a frighteningly scary human being. It has been said that if I took Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Leatherface, wrapping them in one person, Ed Gein would be even more sick / scary. So why can't someone make a film about him that can convey this? When will they discover that reality is ultimately scarier than fiction? <br /> <br /> I've read books and watched news programs about him and, now I'm not a screenwriter or anything, but I think there's enough documentation on Gein that it shouldn't take long to write a story about all of them these atrocities committed without creating murders that had never even been documented. I am aware that he was found guilty of only 2 murders, but with all the evidence he found in his house and in the barn there should be many other ways to put this film together rather than using the vice relationship with his mother, and his girlfriend filler, and too much. <br /> <br /> I think what I'm wondering is this ... why at the end of the film did I know more about the supporting characters than about Ed Gein? Because we didn't know his mother, father and brother and the relationships between them ... what made him the psychopath who was ... what abuse he endured as a child that could have contributed to the man he became? Instead, the only thing we had of his childhood was the flashes of him like a little boy ... running. <br /> <br /> In the end I give him 4/10 stars. Here are 2 for blood and 2 for Kane Hodder. Although in my opinion it was a kind of ugly casting, considering that Gein was a small man, and possibly effeminate, and Hodder is anything but small and nowhere near what I would consider feminine. Maybe I was just excited because it was Jason Voorhees.
