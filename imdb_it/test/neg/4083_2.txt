Oh Mr. Carell! How you fell! After a bright moment in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, Steve Carell's choice of films began to clash sharply with what has come since. Although THE OLD YEARS OF 40 YEARS were fun, it was dwarfed by her "Sunshine" character. Hoping to find something that would lead me to throw popcorn out of my nose, I decided to rent EVAN ALMIGHTY and see what possible guffaws might wait for me here. Not much ... <br /> <br /> Given the script and the cliché script, the entire movie felt forced and emotionless. Having a bit of fun emphasizing the values ​​of the family and the current attitude of the US administration towards the environment, Evan Almighty also tries to put a profound biblical moment into humorous terms, but fails miserably. <br /> <br /> Almost every person on Earth knows the story of Noah and the Ark. God's wrath was sent down with 30 days and nights of rain that flooded the entire planet while Noah, his family and two of each of His creatures on Earth rode the humidity in relative comfort through the wooden ark gopher. It was a great moment in human history (if you believe the biblical text). <br /> <br /> So, why would God appear to a man and ask him to build an ark that would only bring the animals of the world for a few minutes after a dam broke? The simple answer is that he would never do it. Too much emphasis has been given to US government policy and not enough to world events, making Evan Almighty a terribly short-sighted and American-centric film. Although conceived as a comedy, it never reaches anything that comes close to belly laughs. Maybe some grunts and a smile, but little else. John Goodman (CARS) pulls another forced performance as the deplorable Congressman Chuck Long, whose sole objective is to create development opportunities on national protected land. Even the strong presence of Morgan Freeman (10 ITEMS OF LESS) as God cannot help clean up this mess of a soggy film. <br /> <br /> The only amusing moments are between Carell and the animals, especially when Evan discovers that animal magnetism is REALLY similar. The birds literally flock to him. Flock of sheep around him. Lions are proud to be close to you (please forgive word games). <br /> <br /> The special effects were fun to watch but they were short (rightly so). The "flood" was interesting as the Ark was obviously guided by His hand and pushed in the right direction. <br /> <br /> But apart from that you are in for little more than an offense to common sense and intellect.
