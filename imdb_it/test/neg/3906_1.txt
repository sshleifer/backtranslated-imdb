I saw this film in part because of some positive comments here on IMDb. After wishing to have those 90 minutes of my life back, I feel it's my duty to go here and say ... Please, don't worry about watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I can't argue with the actors' efforts - they did what the material could do, but that material is terrible. The rhythm was deadly - slow, tortuous, and you saw everything arrive about an hour away, and then it took a while to happen. The dialogue was boring, useless, not at all funny. The characters were all absolutely indifferent. And the photograph was, in my opinion, of very low quality - the clich√© of "character uses the home video machine!" has been used with a very negative effect. <br /> <br /> Yes, Jeri Ryan is a fantastic person. Don't let time waste on this movie.
