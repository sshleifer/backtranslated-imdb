I suppose to say that this is a terrible all-around film would be unfair, but it's pretty ugly. The sub-Disney plot involves the dogs that play soccer and fall in love (aw, how cute!) The acting is not bad, but it could certainly be better, especially that of the young Canadian actor Kevin Zegers, who, during the whole film , seems embarrassed, as if he didn't even want to be there. However, children will love it, but parents are careful!
