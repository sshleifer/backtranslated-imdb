(There Are Spoilers) The usual slasher film with the story that takes place in and around this mine abandoned by God outside the almost deserted city of Sutterille. After receiving a map of letters and a gold nugget from his brother Jared, Shadrach Smith, Clair and her husband Nick Breman, Carrie Bradac and Sean Hines, they drive to the village along with four other friends and gold seekers of Alx armor & Tori, Steve Wastell & Sangie, and Hayden and Rox Ann, Rick Majeske and Elina to present their requests. <br /> <br /> Later it turns out that the fact that Jared disturbed the long-forgotten gold mine caused the death of the ghost of the infamous Jeremiah Stone, Vernon Wells, and with this reboots his reign of terror . Stone, or 49er, is one of the most ridiculous skeletons / murderers in the history of cinema. Stone seems to have been buried for years under a few tons of coal that spins around with this hook that cuts people in two. After doing almost all the local hermit cast Aunt Nelly, (Karen Black), her daughter Eve (Alexandra Ford) was also one of Stone's victims, tells those still alive that unless they return the gold to the mine stone, the crazed miner never rest until he kills everyone who still has it. <br /> <br /> Aunt Nelly is given the time to tell her story before she turns into Stone's human torch and ends up jumping into a nearby stream. the film goes on endlessly with the murderer miner in the grip of fury, with the air of being as scary as a burnt and equally dark toast. Even those in the film seemed to show no real fear of him. In a scene where he broke into Aunt Nelly's house, everyone inside him charged, instead of escaping, causing the ghost miner to lose his right arm; Stone spent the rest of the film with a pickaxe attached to his "log". <br /> <br /> In addition to actress Karen Black, the movie "Miners Massacre" also has veteran actors such as John Phillip Law and Richard Lynch as Sheriff Murphy and Old Man Prichard. Things passable but nothing special the film has a predictable ending with the entire gold mine burning. The public gave a hint to the creators of "Miners Massacre" that the end of this brainless madness is nowhere in sight and could resurface in the near future in a possible sequel, God help us all!
