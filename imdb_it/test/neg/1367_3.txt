"The Brotherhood of Satan" is an amazing combination of conventional horror elements mixed with some imaginative characterization and direction (Bernard McEveety). It all starts with Father Charles Bateman (like Ben) driving west with his beautiful blondes: the delightful Ahna Capri (as Nicky) and her daughter Geri Reischl (as K.T.). Things get more bizarre and weird for the trio as they approach the city of Hillsboro, which is taken over by a satanic cult! <br /> <br /> When dull travelers hit Hillsboro, the "action" moves on to the most interesting assemblage of characters in the film: L. Jones (as Pete, the sheriff), Strother Martin (as Doc), Charles Robinson (as Jack, the priest) and Alvy Moore (as Tobey). Their interaction is sometimes fun. Soon, everything becomes very silly and predictable. Mr. Martin is the point of reference (as one might expect); considers the possibility of a satanic cult to be a "fucker's story", but is (obviously) their leader. The ending of "Come in, Children" is disconcerting; unless, perhaps, it was the original title of the film.
