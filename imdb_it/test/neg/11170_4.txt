Robert Aldrich's brutal and almost black comedy "The Grissom Gang", a reworking of the 1948 British film "No Orchids For Miss Blandish", has the twenties heiress Kim Darby kidnapped by a bunch of clumsy thieves; soon, that band is sent and poor Kim is transferred into the clutches of another crooked group - third-class gangster brothers with sweaty, pasty faces and a mother who looks like Buddy Ebsen in drag. At first, Darby (not very brave, and not very clever) tries to escape this drooling brood, but I'm on her. In the end she stops trying, and here is the trouble of history. Are we in the audience that should sympathize with you? Should his growing concern about family humor be moving? They are disgusting and stupid characters and I wanted to see as little as possible. But since the secondary stories (the progress of the cops on the case and another involving the cheerful singer Connie Stevens) are pretty boring, the director has no choice but to keep pushing back those sweaty faces on us. Soon, even the nervous Darby begins to sweat, even if his scene in the barn is sensibly executed and the moments of Aldrich are stimulating, if disorganized. ** from ****
