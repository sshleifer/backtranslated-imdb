Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella: it's a cast of all-star actors, but "The Box" proves once again that it's not a guarantee for a solid film. The premise seems promising: a couple receives a visit from a mysterious person who offers them a million dollars. The downside is that someone will die, a person you probably won't know. So what do you do ? This gives us an interesting story for about 30 minutes. After that, the story completely derails. A vague plot plot not inspired by an alien conspiracy involving NASA, nothing is explained here. <br /> <br /> "The Box" is a disappointment, it could have been much better. But since it is based on an ultra-short story, this explains the errors of continuity.
