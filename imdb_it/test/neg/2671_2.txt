Most of this film was fine, for the sequel to a sequel to a sequel ... <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the amount of suspense there was; I actually expected him to be thrown out of the window in favor of blood, blood, blood. It wasn't, but there are some rather ridiculous deaths. <br /> <br /> The thing I didn't like, however, was the whole complicated plot. They could have been all right, if the writers had taken the time to explain them all. But what was the purpose of the secret society in the mental institution, in particular? Why were they protected from Michael's damage up to a point? What exactly would they do with the child? How did Jaime Lloyd get pregnant, after all? Why shut her up for 20 years because she gets pregnant too? Why did Michael kill all his co-conspirators in the end? Why were there fetuses in the lab? The actors seemed to have "understood everything" once they saw the fetuses. But it was never explained to the public. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie to see people turn off, then this will be fine for you .. However, if you can't stand a story that is thrown at you and that remains unresolved when the titles out of the queue, you should go and look at something else.
