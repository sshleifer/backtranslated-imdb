Let me foreshadow stating that I have lived in Louisville, Kentucky, all my life. I grew up about half a mile from Waverly. In winter we dragged our sleds along the Maryman road and crossed Dixie Highway to go sledding on Waverly Hill. Many times during the winter of 76-77 we climbed into the Tunnel to warm ourselves. The place was still run as a "Geriatric Center" at the time. We went through the tunnel to the hill to hit what we thought was the "Morgue Gate". I must be honest. The only feeling we felt was that we were losing something we shouldn't do. I should say we went to that tunnel over 50 times that winter. Nothing more strange than teenage boys who behave in a stupid way. I love the fact that he is getting attention after all these years. One evening, when I was young, we looked out of our porch and it looked like the whole hill was on fire. There was an old hospital on the hill that burned. It burned for hours while the whole neighborhood was out and watching. The thing that gets lost on Waverly is that many people have survived tuberculosis. Let's face it ?? The doctors then did everything they thought was right to save people. It took a lot of courage for people to work there knowing how contagious tuberculosis was. Too much focuses on those who have suffered. I also traveled to the building several times in the early 1970s. We went to visit the jaws in the nursing home through a group of young people from the church. By the way, the doors weren't jailed like steel doors with chains and padlocks as portrayed in the film. They were wooden and open, sometimes too open. It smells of urine and feces and you have seen the occasional open dress associated with dementia patients. It was true that it had been closed by the state in the early 1980s. A lot of what might have to do with the age of the building or the right guy hasn't paid off. This is Kentucky after all. The part of the documentary that shocked me most was the accumulation of bodies in a cart. If I'm not mistaken, it looks like it was a Holocaust movie. This was added for dramatic effect. He left me with a sour taste for the director. I'm a skeptic when it comes to "Ghosts". I believe that many around here really consider the place to be persecuted. Waverly for me however symbolized a fun place for the adventure for a boy with a sled.
