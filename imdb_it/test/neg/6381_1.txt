For some reason I really didn't like it and felt embarrassed about how bad it had been since I bought it and watched it with my family. We all hated him passionately. It's a pretty nice children's movie, maybe in the year it came out. However, think about it: an obsolete children's movie? What's the point? Kids generally don't like watching such old movies, and I don't see what adults should definitely get out of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some children's films (like Mary Poppins or Wizard of Oz) can be enjoyed even now, but Time Bandits is totally obsolete. For your information, and I think it's applicable in this case, I didn't like Dr Strangelove or Spinal Tap at all. So if you disagree with me on such old-fashioned movies, you might like Time Bandits. <br /> <br /> There is also a horrible case of exaggeration, as I recall from the "bad guys". Think of the two stupid "bad pirates" in the Pirates of C. movies, except that in Time Bandits they are nowhere near amusing. <br /> <br /> However, I warned you, this is all I can do. The people who vote for this film must have appreciated it many years ago. If you've never seen it before, don't worry about looking at it now.
