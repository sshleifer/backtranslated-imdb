Reba is, without doubt, one of the worst "comic" series ever. I wonder why there are people who write good comments about "Reba" ... You look at "Friends", "Marry with children", "Fraizer" if you laugh at it, you can never laugh at stupid jokes and ridiculous accent of the singer who is trying to make his way into the comedy and obviously has no chance. The actors / actresses next to Reba are OK, so I feel bad for them stopping in a so-called comedy show with the funniest person in the world (Reba). To summarize, I suggest this TV show to see how low comedy can become and appreciate those that can make you laugh
