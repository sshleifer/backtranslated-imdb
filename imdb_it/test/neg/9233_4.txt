I understand the director's purpose of telling stories that are not stories, but the way he tried to show the passing of time (the couple of joggers, who for the first time seem to jog together, who jog with a stroller (sic !), That the man alone ...) and connect the "adventures" of the characters (the final scene, with the maid climbing a mountain seeing the big black on another cliff, and then seeing the boat with his former employer and say "Oh, a boat!") were horrible. At the same time, I liked the way he portrayed the upper-middle class, even in an excessive way. I think it's a lousy movie. If you want to watch it, do it as a student of a film school, trying to see aspects and technical problems. It will help a lot.
