I really wish Hollywood could invent new ideas and fast. Instead they go around and recreate and mess up a perfectly good movie with a re-make. This movie is terrible from the DeMille version. For the whole movie I was telling myself, Huh ??? - What???? - I don't remember that part. The only exciting thing about this film so far has been the separation of the Red Sea. And in Heston's version - it was much better than this version. Has anyone else seen an atomic cloud or an atomic bomb fade in and out when the Red Sea had been separated? I think I did it. Anyway, I could ... see the last part tonight. <br /> <br /> I'd like Hollywood to address different ideas and topics when they are making new movies. Instead of reworking old movies. <br /> <br /> They should be left pretty well alone. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: <br /> <br /> Well, I looked at the last part. Moses composed the second copy of the ten commandments with his own hand - or I saw things - please someone - send me an email and let me know. HORRIBLE
