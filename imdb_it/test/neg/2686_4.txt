Obviously it seems that many people really enjoyed this movie, and it's wonderful. It is certainly a very well-intentioned film, and I appreciate it in an age of heartless or emotionally damaging films. Unfortunately, the film has a lot of problems and it was not something I enjoyed watching. <br /> <br /> The main problem is writing. It's not very funny. When something tries to be snappy or witty and fails, it is much worse than when it never felt wit. This film is largely a series of "lively", but kind returns between adult family members, none of which seem imaginative or apt. There are also some central premises in the film that seem like too many coincidences or motivations of character to be credible or really working. Some of the background seemed more intriguing and served to decorate the story quite well, but it could not compensate for the momentary flatness that pervaded almost the entire film. <br /> <br /> The direction / editing doesn't support the film well, although I can't explain exactly how. Somehow things always seemed fake, and the actors for the most part forced them to force unnatural material. They tried, and I didn't criticize anyone here. There were also too many small roles without charm outside the family. <br /> <br /> It is not a good rent in my opinion, even if, again, apparently a number of people found it very fascinating (I am 38 years old; I suspect that perhaps people over 60 could appreciate this film more ?).
