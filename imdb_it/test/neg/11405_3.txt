You can usually ask two questions about the 80 low budget horror films. and this `Demon Wind 'in particular. 1. Is it a good movie? No .. 2. Is it a funny movie ?? You bet! Demon Wind is a creepy and nauseating tale, full of make-up effects and bad violence. The story is practically non-existent and involves a group of young people who reveal the horrible secrets of one of the group's ancestors. Apparently, his grandparents lived in a neighborhood that worshiped the devil, and the evil (in the form of demons and fog) still lingers around. But, I got to deliver it to this movie. From beginning to end, breathe morbidity! The diabolical undertones, the playful gore and the (relatively) decent acting make this film rise well above the classics, no doubt, of the 80s. It shows a little creativity and courage (literally) where other productions of this decade they fall more easily into routine and oblivion. These creators were clearly inspired by the success of "The Evil Dead" and perhaps also by "Demoni" by Lamberto Bava, but what the hell! It's fun and done with a lot of enthusiasm. Although this film has a rather high `what the f *** '- standard sometimes. Especially towards the end, when flashbacks and laser shows are happily mixed. And what the hell is the story of those two aspiring wizards? Nevertheless, `Demon Wind 'gets my recommendation if your likes are not too high on horror crap!
