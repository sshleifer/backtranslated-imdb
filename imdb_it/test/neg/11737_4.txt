The 1998 version of "Psycho" had to be withdrawn in the 1960s, rather than today. The headliners would have done a good job with the setup. There were two scenes that protruded like a sore thumb. The first was at the beginning of the film when Marian Crane (Anne Heche) was sitting at her desk. His boss took his client to his office because "it was air conditioning". I imagine most Arizona companies have air conditioning. The other was the meeting of Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) and Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen). Lila sporting the Walkman seemed an exaggeration to update the film. The film frightened a number of spectators in the theater.
