I saw this movie on TV last night, hoping for a realistic account of what could happen if there was an epidemic of highly transmissible diseases. I was disappointed, and I think the film was rubbish. It didn't seem real. Some acting was horrible, especially that of the doctor. It was the worst I've seen. It all played as a "worst case scenario" for CNN. Even the bits of human relations on the film of the mandatory disaster did not seem sincere. I've seen some catastrophic films, particularly meteorological ones, that are actually so bad that they're fun. This is almost as bad, but it's not even funny, it's boring and boring. Don't worry about this.
