The young spinster, who does not associate with women of her age and is watched by the lord of the retirement set, invites an apparently mute young man to his apartment on a rainy day. Nervous and overly polite to hide her sexual insecurities, she is very happy when the boy is taken home to his guest room ... but not so happy when he starts sneaking out the window at night. Sandy Dennis is not an unfortunate actress, but because she is attracted to these sad sack roles, I guess we'll never know. Based on a book by Richard Miles, and very far from a commercial drama that could be achieved, this obscure material attracted not only Dennis, but also director Robert Altman (whose work is static, at best). The narrative seems almost a sex inversion of "The Collector", a label that may have sold movie rights but that doesn't turn out to be a good cinematic idea. Even the best sequence in the film (Dennis shopping for a prostitute to satisfy his prisoner) doesn't come off, with Sandy acting both sick and indignant (whose idea was this plan?). Michael Burns is quite as good as the kid who uses this grumpy and sick woman only for his comfortable digging, but he is run too shyly by Altman, with lots of strategically placed towels and flesh-colored clothing (Altman clearly wasn't ready for a photo mature with adult themes at this point). Sandy Dennis has a series of very good scenes; she doesn't chatter mindlessly here, think before she speaks and is alarmingly alert in her actions. Unfortunately, the role itself is a disaster, with an apparent slide towards mental deterioration that seems to happen off the screen. As such, the abrupt ending is exasperating and the overall result is lukewarm. * 1/2 from ****
