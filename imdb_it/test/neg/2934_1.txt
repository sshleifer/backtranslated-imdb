In & Out made me want to vomit. I've never seen such a blatant movie! He seriously wanted to say that being gay is something wonderful and joyful, but he has no idea how to say it. For me, this was not a comedy, unless it was cruel and sick when a victim falls for it. <br /> <br /> From what I've seen, this film has had four (4) major flaws since (A) The character of Matt Dillion announcing to the world that he is the former teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is gay. No matter how incredible it is that the character of Matt Dillion won an Oscar for what seemed like a serious role on the edge of a crack-up. But why should he say such a thing? After all, this has never been a problem with Howard's students, his friends, his family, or his goals. Nobody. So why would he say something like that when it wasn't true? More precisely, why doesn't the film give us an answer as to why he said it? The reason is because there is no answer, and for convenience of the plot no answer is given. The second flaw (B) is that the film seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is - the attraction and sexual relationship with members of the same sex. In this film, being gay is based on the acceptance of Barbara Streisand's musicals and a passion for literature. It's all based on stereotypes! <br /> <br /> Both of these defects meet again in that graduation ceremony that must be seen to be believed. Matt Dillion discovers the commotion that is happening in that small town and the film seems ready to let us know what made him say such a thing. When he arrives at the ceremony, he says nothing and I wonder why he came there in the world. He has solved nothing. Then when all the audience got up to announce that they were gay, I was so moved that I wanted to throw up! Those people were standing in defense of Howard being gay making fun of all those stereotypes. What the film has forgotten is that he was using those stereotypes to show why Howard was gay. Filmmakers just shot themselves in the foot! But wait, there's more! <br /> <br /> During the ceremony, (C) Howard seemed to be on trial for losing his job as a teacher, because people believed he would influence his students to be gay. What the film was trying to say is that homosexuals NEVER recruit or influence their students. But haven't we seen Tom Selleck's character press Howard's pressure over and over again, to the point of unexpectedly kissing him, leaving the closet when there was no closet in my mind to go out of? From this, the film clearly shows that homosexuals are able to recruit. The film, again, then shoots itself upright. <br /> <br /> And (D) when Howard came out of the closet, didn't anyone notice how the script closed him for the rest of the movie? I counted only three lines he had later: "Yes!" to his parents, "Hi!" to a student, and "Are you ready?" to Tom Selleck before the last scene vomited. I could be short of one, but the point is that he is not allowed to tell us what made him decide he was gay. I wanted to know what was in his head, because I never believed for once he was gay. <br /> <br /> As a bonus, the film also includes several really offensive scenes. One in which Howard asks a confessed priest for advice on what to do for a friend (him), who is engaged and has not yet had sex with her boyfriend. "Does this make him gay?" he asks. The priest replied "Oh yes, he is definitely gay". Uh Huh. Or what about the scene when all the old ladies gathered around to tell Howard's mother that she doesn't need to be sad about her son's dark and deep secret, because, well ... everyone has them. Then a lady confessed that she had never seen "The Bridges of Madison County". Funny? No! The film shows that it is insensitive and has no idea how harmful it can be for a family to have one of its members who has announced that they are gay. I know. I have several friends who are gay and none of their families took it well. That was a mediocre way to spread the whole situation. <br /> <br /> For me, the last straw was the last scene that gave them the impression that Tom and Kevin were getting married. The camera lowered very slowly towards the front of the church when ... It was not what you thought! I was completely disgusted by that point and I could never forgive that sick joke. I have nothing against movies about being homosexual or homosexual. "Philadelphia" and "Longtime Companion" were very honest and true in what they had to say. "In & Out" is just screaming for political correctness, but has no idea of ​​corruption at the center. what I picked up from the film is that if you are 99% straight and 1% gay, that is if you have the slightest doubt, YOU ARE SURE GAY. It is as if homosexuality is becoming a dominant trait in genetics. In reality, if everyone told you over and over again that you were useless and stupid, in the end you would believe it too, right? This is what happened to Howard Brackett on being gay. I left the theater sad and angry. Angry all weekend, in fact. This was a seriously ill and cruel film, the WORST of 1997.
