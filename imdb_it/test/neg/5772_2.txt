A group of friends receives the word from a friend who found gold in an old mental auction near an ancient abandoned western city of Suttersville. Despite warnings from the local sheriff, Murphy (John Phillip Law), Old Man Prichard (Richard Lynch), an unhappy fool who cheats tourists with alleged collectible Wanted posters, and superstitious superstitious Aunt Nelly (Karen Black) to stay out of the mine because of is a notorious legend (.. that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to the devil and killed the daughter of a priest (Jeff Conaway) will return from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his pipe) , these people see only the green, not the red blood that could potentially leak from their killed bodies. Finding the gold of Jeremiah Stone intact, the pockets and suitcases are lined up, prepared for the brilliant future that is supposedly ahead. But, if you don't pay attention to the warnings of those you consider followers of woods, the obvious result will be a gruesome death. Jeremiah Stone, as can be seen, just lies a skeleton next to an alter that contains skulls lined up next to each other while the candles above them light up, the pick below waiting for its master, with dust particles that bring it back to a grotesque corpse with demonic exposure, its eyes burn with anger. This unfortunate group, hoping for some fun around the fire with gold that offers them warm prospects for the future life, will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his petty omen. Another victim will encounter the ugly end of a shovel thrown across the windshield of his vehicle, directing it straight into his neck. Another failed attempt to retreat caused Stone a frightened victim to drive his car up a tree, his body is engulfed in flames while he can't escape without damage. Another, a local girl looking for her new friends, worried about their welfare, receives the pickaxe buried in her stomach. Aunt Nelly informs those still alive about the Forty-Niner and the curse on those who break into her eternal escort ... and pays the price to relate that information. Will anyone survive? Or is the whole group destined to perish at the hands of the zombie miner? <br /> <br /> Artist of makeup effects and creator of monsters, John Carl Buechler directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or a strong story, opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and anyone else find yourself in his way. It provides a sufficient background, and at best this is weak, because the killer allows a special guest star, Karen Black (.. oh, how her career has sunk into the abyss) to explain to the viewer about him. The story given to us has the miner holding a priest's daughter hostage, threatening to carry it out while the Suttersville authorities warn against such an action. Surprising enough, stone plants foreshadowing just behind her, with the opposition dumping their rifles with little effect because it sold its soul to Satan. By withdrawing into his domain, the shaft of the mine, Stone sends a warning against anyone even attempting to take what is his, the loot. Typical of most woodcutters in general, this group of twenty-year-olds is the victim of the garden variety, with little development as well as a few jokes and exchanges of words that fill up until the undead maniac throws himself on the scene to massacre them. They are the usual group, from the city, trespassing into unknown territories, resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant. Like many of the late 1980s, much of the violence is off the screen. What is on the screen, the minimal gore, is presented in a somewhat trivial way and happens rather quickly. The ghoul trick for the murderer is shown only from time to time, is mostly shrouded in darkness, the horrified faces of the victims as they catch them or chase them receive more credibility than the method of destruction. One thing is certain, the stuntmen have been burned many times. At least three times, a character is burned alive by a lantern or a fiery vehicle. Martin Cove has a minor cameo like Black's ex-husband, Caleb, who now lives with a much younger and denser honey. Vernon Wells (of The Road Warrior and Commando fame) plays the lead role of Jeremiah Stone as a human being, still capturing the same kind of threat to which he is specialized. John Phillip Law seems to enjoy himself as a rather polite and hospitable sheriff, welcoming strangers to his neck in the woods. Buechler has a fairly attractive cast of actresses, all with tight pants and rather small T-shirts, which show their elegant and athletic figures, in particular Elina Madison in the role of Roxann, always ready to take off her clothes for a greedy miser, Hayden (Rick Majeske). Stephen Wastell (The Ghosts of Edendale) is Axl, a rather awkward sheet, used as a target for many jokes including his "forest dump" scene and current state of unemployment.
