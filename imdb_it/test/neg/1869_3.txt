The busty beauty Stacie Randall plays in PVC, bitch bitch Alexandra, Faust's faithful acolyte, an evil entity trapped in hell. Determined to free his master, the menacing maniacal burst into a warehouse to steal a magical gem vital to his success; but while leading a satanic ritual to summon Faust, the stupid mare accidentally enters the pentagram she drew on the floor, which results in the loss of the gem and the release of two diminutive troll-like creatures called Lite and Dark. <br /> <br /> Now Alexandra has to find a replacement gem, which will not be easy: the only other stone that will do the trick is brought to the neck of her ex-lover, police detective Jonathan Graves (Peter Liapis) , who is investigating the robbery in the warehouse and who knows all too well what Alexandra's wickedness is capable of. Meanwhile, the ludicrously intertwining half-sized pints Lite and Dark face all kinds of hard troubles while trying to find a way back home. <br /> <br /> In the world of Jim Wynorski's deformed film, all the females are big tits with the fashion sense of an economic prostitute. Ghoulies IV is no exception: any woman in this film, be it a police captain, an antiquity curator or a mentally ill in an asylum, is hot, hot, hot and doesn't carry much, and it is this fact that makes this otherwise totally unwatchable piece of almost bearable STV shit. <br /> <br /> But be careful, even if the presence of semi-nude, the quality crumpet makes the execution slightly simpler, there is still a lot in this film to ensure that it is labeled as a test: the acting is wooden and the dialogue is painful; the black humor (as described in the DVD script) is as fun as a knee for the licentious, with the comic bars of Lite and Dark that are particularly worthy; and the special effects are the bargain basement, made up of rubbery creatures and visual effects that would have seemed dated ten years earlier. <br /> <br /> 3/10 only for the high child quotient.
