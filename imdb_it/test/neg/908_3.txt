The film uses motifs that could be plagiarized by "Wait Until Dark" (1967), a much better film than Terence Young, with Audrey Hepburn. "Dead Silent" is a pale paraphrase. There is nothing new here - the object hidden in the doll, the bad men who want it, the villain who poses like a good boy. The disability, however, has shifted: Audrey Hepburn could not see, the child in the DS cannot speak. But both stories depend on the handicap. Where "Wait Until Dark" creates unbearable suspense, "Dead Silent" lets you guess the result, history being such a stereotype.
