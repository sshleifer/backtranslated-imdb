I no longer have respect for IMDb ratings. I think a group of Mormons flooded the site and voted for it. This is not an artistic film, it is a Mormon propaganda. Nothing wrong with this, but the outline of the plot and the way it is described are totally misleading. If you are a bible that beats Christians or Mormons, watch this movie, you will love it and you will think it is truly amazing. For anyone else, don't worry, the story is so invented, something random happens that actually doesn't follow consistently. This guy tries to commit suicide because he sleeps with his neighbor. Are you kidding? What a pussy! However, this is a terrible film.
