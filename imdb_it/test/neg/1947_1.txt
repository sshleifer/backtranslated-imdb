This is really bad, the characters were dull, the story was boring, and there is no sex scene. Furthermore, it lacks drama, the conflict is minimal causing an extremely slow pace. Nothing happens in this movie, you would expect a sex scene, but they only have a kiss. The plot revolves around three characters, a man, his wife and a stranger who gather from above. The couple invites the stranger to be with them, because he is homeless. At this point you would expect the stranger to have sex with his wife, right? No, they just kiss. Furthermore, this film contains no action, no comedy, no drama or even suspense. It makes you think that maybe the studio hasn't even read this script !!!!
