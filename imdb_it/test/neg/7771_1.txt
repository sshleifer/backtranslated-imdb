In 1970, feminists invaded the "Miss World" beauty contest in London and interrupted the occasion by beating the stage with flour and eggs. Why? Because, rightly or wrongly, they felt that the event was humiliating and degrading for women. I offer no criticism of their actions. It is a free world in which we live. What I want to know is: why don't their modern equivalents invade studies where shows like this are made and do the same way? <br /> <br /> 'Sex & The City' is composed of four self-absorbed women from New York: Carrie is a fashion slave who turns into a kitten when a man blinks her eyes, Charlotte yearns to find the perfect man (they don't exist, love) so that he can use sex to trap the poor devil, lawyer Miranda scares men by tasting nonsense like 'out of touch with my emotions', and finally we have Samantha, the incarnation living of the old Martini and "anytime, anywhere, anywhere". Feminists support these characters - particularly Samantha - as a shining example of modern femininity. Well, if the cries of words in crowded restaurants are progressing, I think feminists should take a hard look at themselves and what they should represent. <br /> <br /> Had "Sex & The City" been the creation of a man, it would have been pulled from the ether to be sexist. Instead, as before "Charlie's Angels", he convinced apparently intelligent women to think they acted as a positive force for good. There is something very clinical and cold-blooded about the show. "The Benny Hill Show" was also sexist, but at least it was fun.
