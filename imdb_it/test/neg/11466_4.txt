Michael Bassett's film 'Solomon Kane' (based on the eponymous character created by Robert E. Howard) is a disappointing movie Fantasy Action-Adventure, which despite some genius scenes fall to the ground with its embarrassing rhythm, its poor characterization and general dullness. Solomon Kane (James Purefoy) is a mercenary in the army of Queen Elizabeth who fights in Africa, where he finds himself face to face with the reaper of the devil ?? a demon that collects the debts of the Devil, that is, souls? Refusing to go to hell again, he escapes from the Reaper and begins a new life in an English monastery. With this new life, Solomon abandoned his culture of violence and massacres and now embraces the values ​​of peace and non-values. But once expelled from the monastery because of the Devil's Reaper's fear of returning, he must return to his home in Devon and make friends with a Puritan family on their way to the New World along the way. On their journey through the British counties, the family is attacked and their daughter Meredith (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is kidnapped by the evil sorcerer Malachi, who is led to the front line by the mysterious masked pilot. Now a man of peace, Solomon must return to his previous life as a man of unrepentant violence and destruction to save Meredith. <br /> <br /> Despite having a great background material to work on and potentially creating an exciting and enduring medieval action-adventure movie, the film fails in three key areas. The pace of this film is terrible, which could have a lot to do with its incredibly short running time of an hour and forty minutes (and this is most likely a consequence of the fact that they want to turn this movie into a trilogy). Constantly jumping between drama and self-characterization to that of action and bloodshed, somehow kills the excitement of action sequences. Instead of keeping the audience on the edge of the seats foamed by eagle-eyed anticipation, the film feels incredibly submissive and this follows the next boring criticism. Despite being advertised as an "action-adventure" movie or in some circles and an "action movie", "Solomon Kane" is almost certainly not. The action is trivial and boring, and is generally over before you have the chance to admire the beauty of a beheading. Finally, apart from Solomon himself, there is little characterization within this film. For example, we know little and, for this reason, we care little for the young woman Soloman undertook on her journey to save. And I imagine once again that the director makes reference to this criticism for the fact that there will probably be a second film that hopefully will touch on these aspects that this film certainly missed. <br /> <br /> It's not an absolutely terrible movie anyway. James Purefoy offers a fantastic interpretation of Solomon, the mercenary who must decide whether or not to use his conscience or his blade, and how his decisions will have an impact not only on himself but also on those around him. While respect, admiration and recognition must also go to Bassett and his crew, to create lively places that beautifully reflect the period in which they are running. Sometimes, it's hard not to get carried away by admiring the beauty of the places, the composition of the shots and the staging at the show here. Which certainly shows that a lot of time and effort have been put into this film, but unfortunately it's not the same for the story and for the characters at hand. 'Solomon Kane' certainly has the potential to be something more than just an 'epic action', yet it seems that once again the lack of true depth in the story and the characters has led Michael Bassett to create nothing but a single dimensional look at the sword during the medieval period.
