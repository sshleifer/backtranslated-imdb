This film made me angry because of its stupidity that I felt the need to create an account on IMDb to share my opinion with you. I liked Ashton Kutcher in "A lot of love" and this is why I always wanted to see this film despite his current 4.2 vote. It is highly overrated. I trusted that an actor (none of them) would judge the script and would not agree to participate in such a low / hour quality production. It is very disappointing The theme of home-sitting was much better used in "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo". Things that didn't make sense here: everyone's hand, the landlord leaves his precious pet with someone who knows nothing about caring for it. Secondly, the rule is not to let anyone enter the house, but the housekeeper does not follow this simple rule. Is the door not locked?! And so on..
