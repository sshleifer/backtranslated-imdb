During the university, our philosophy professor, Mr.R, played "Roger & Me" in its entirety. This was at a time when the obese misfit was still rather unknown; a charlatan-in-the-making, a family name that was still busy perfecting his bending skills and still learning to manipulate the easy-going, the pathologically paranoid, the mentally ill, the sexually frustrated, the illiterate, semi-literate, incapable and gullible gullible among you. <br /> <br /> As we finished watching it, I thought, "Yes, it was pretty funny - in a totally stupid Bugs Bunny in a sense, but what is an ultra-paternal, anti-capitalist propagandist turkey which has no objectivity in all this, its sole purpose is to take low-cost shots at people and ideas that the film's creator has the pet peeves - a documentary with every imaginative effort. "However, our beloved professor Marxist was absolutely enthusiastic about R & M, and we did not limit ourselves to NOT criticizing any aspect of it, but Mr.R actually spent the rest of the class praising the "qualities". That's how we understood each other, the words "propaganda", "manipulation of spectators", "leftist extremist" or "presentation of selective facts" never came out of his perennially smiling mouth ... And just to remind you: this had to be a philosophy class, not INDOCTRINING YOUR STUDENTS WITH YOUR POLITICAL BASSES Of course. <br /> <br /> However, now I arrive at the really interesting aspect: this professor, Mr.R, is now a very successful screenwriter in Hollywood. He has written several left-hand scripts with level A stars in them. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story: those are the kind of people for whom all doors are open in Hollywood. <br /> <Michael Moore is a director without talent (who has proven beyond doubt with "Canadian Bacon"), but being a Marxist liberal opens the door to anyone. Tinseltown is full of angry extremists from Chavez, so because political brainwashing through simplistic representations of reality has been an integral part of the Hollywood experience for many decades. <br /> <br /> Embrace this demagogue and you've betrayed your brain forever.
