A child puppeteer, for a show for children with public access, goes beyond the end when he finds that the children who entertain in a hospital are victims of horrible abuses. This film has some of the worst indescribably monstrous parents you could ever meet. Not a film of exploitation as much as a special after-school on the dangers of child abuse. Apparently harmless, Rabby takes matters into his own hands when the police appear to be neutralized by the lack of evidence to condemn the disgusting parents of their terrible abuse against their children. Children are emotionless and zombie-like (.. due to the amount of abuse inflicted on them), noisy, inconceivably harsh, contemptible and belligerent parents. Mothers, in particular, are so obscene, rooting themselves for their execution. They are essentially miserable people who bring their frustrations to children. Our investigators are a little tired, frustrated by the whole judicial process, from the way police procedures are often unable to prosecute those who beat their children to submission. While the crimes themselves are atrocious, the film does not explicitly process the horrible screen activity. I would say that the reason for seeing this is for Tom Basham's performance as the deranged child-man who slips into psychosis. There is a strange sequence of dining tables between Basham's Mr. Rabbey and his guardian shortly after killing the parents responsible for their son's death, regarding how he lives in a fantasy and how what he just did left a indelible sign (.. note the changes in behavior, a rather impressive work, going from innocent to gruesome). Peter Renaday is Lieutenant Hayes, the detective in charge of homicide cases, who expresses on his face the tension that is causing him the toll. There is a first performance by John Ashton in the role of detective Matthews, who always feeds Hayes' wrath because of his inability to follow directions, not to mention how much he is opinionated about parents who abuse their children. Unpleasant and relaxed blues music that seems inappropriate for a film like this. Controversial conclusion that even children can only tolerate so much. A little too slow for my taste, but there is an effective use, I thought, of Basham's eyes before he does business, waiting patiently as he prepares to strike.
