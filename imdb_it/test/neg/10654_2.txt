This film is terrible, it was so hard to believe that Katie became a passionate teenager with the power to save the Chinese people's pity, the film showed no convincing arguments to prove it. And the rest of the plot made no effort to show us anything more than good economic sense ... <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can draw from it is that it shows how arrogant a being human can be. Katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother, the most annoying character I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> The acting and the scenery were OK, but the plot ruins everything, full of economic clich√©s and hypocritical scenes, I expect to never see this film in my life again. Skip this!
