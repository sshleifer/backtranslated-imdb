This movie really starts strong. We know that Roberts is an Atlanta hotshot sent to Australia to solve Coke's marketing problems. We also know that he is an eccentric genius. Roberts's acting convinces us quite quickly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the plot is so inconsistent, that whatever the result is, it is nullified by gaps, inconsistencies and boring movie sequences. <br /> <br /> Usually, I'm a fool for daring and distant plots. Examples that I like include "Dark Star", "O.C. & Stiggs" and "Popeye". Coupled with the fact that I have to admit that this film was well acted, I am also surprised that I cannot recommend this film. <br /> <br /> The total break in this film occurs in the middle of the film. All the comedy is lost instantly and the film becomes dark. Later, the film limps. The film's attempt to restart the play is unsuccessful. Other surprises await the viewer and are even more obscure. <br /> <br /> To be sure, mixing drama with comedy can be a formula for success. However, with this film, the result is just as effective as "new coke".
