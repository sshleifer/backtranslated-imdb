MELTDOWN is rather interesting SCI-FI. No important balance sheets, very few special effects; but decent acting and a plot of world destiny are sufficient to sustain the vision. An asteroid grazes the atmosphere and pushes the Earth into an orbit closer to the sun. Global warming quickly becomes unbearable. A determined LAPD cop (Casper Van Dien) does everything he can to save the world from a certain annihilation while the rising temps are devastating. The pressure is on to save humanity from this solar catastrophe; as well as protecting his daughter, ex-wife nurse and TV reporter girlfriend. The cast includes: Stefanie von Pfetten, Venus Terzo, Amanda Crew and Vincent Gale.
