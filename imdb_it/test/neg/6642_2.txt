There are many mysteries in life. For example: why does anyone other than Carrot Top agree to appear in this film? Why did anyone distribute this film? Why did anyone pay to see it? I imagine that none of these questions will ever be answered, but one thing I know for sure, this film is one of the worst ever made on such a large budget. It would already be bad, but the addition of Carrot Top's humor makes it even worse. The only entertainment that could be obtained from this film is to burn it, destroy it or destroy it in a funny way. If I had to classify it against every film ever made, it would be right between "Problem Child" and "Biodome". Nuff said.
