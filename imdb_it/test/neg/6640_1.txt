So I activated the HBO that I thought would have quality movies and I saw it. Carrot Top is so little fun to watch. I've seen little funny movies before, but I think I find this one so impossible to watch because Carrot Top seems to think it's hilarious. Watching this movie is really like watching a movie designed for 5-year-olds with crazy things, plus the superior reactions full of stupid jokes that only a 4-year-old would appreciate. <br /> <br /> What's surprising is how some other talented actors actually signed up for this project, like Larry Miller and M Emmet Walsh. If you've ever seen Carrot Top's absolutely horrible MCI ads (or whatever they were), this is pretty much the same, just worse. It's a crap party that's a waste of a big budget that could have done something, save the homeless ... everything but this. I'm not sure it's at the bottom 50 of all time, but for the $ 10 million spent it's a disgrace.
