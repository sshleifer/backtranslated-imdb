I'm a big fan of Northern Exposure. Men In Trees is a complete Northern Exposure knock-off. There are people from New York City, stuck in a remote city of backwoods (Marin Frist / Joel Fleishman). He didn't immediately hit him with a local (Jack Slattery / Maggie O'Connell). The city has only one pilot who is not often available. There is only one radio program. And the whole show is about bizarre people with sincere and strange relationships. Too many parallels. Exactly like the Northern Exposition, except for an obvious demographic changed for each character. I'm bored. Give me something new to think about. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the writing is pretty good. But if it was a school project, surely he would have obtained the plagiarism mark. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the people who love this show have been protected by the creativity and hard work of Joshua Brand and John Falsey.
