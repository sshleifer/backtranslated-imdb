We sat in this movie thinking why is this or that scene from the movie, what does this have to do with the plot? We were hoping that in the end everything would be slightly clearer. <br /> <br /> I think the director in a piqu√© attack threw the script into the air and then a small (and vindictive) attic recomposed it randomly without any regard to the scene that was filmed (possibly with scissors and glue stick). <br /> <br /> The reasons for the film include: Bad Communism? Is nihilism bad? Bad bad parents? Bad threesome? TV bad? Consistent scripting? Good deconstructionism? In reality it is not clear. <br /> <br /> Finally, no German water taxi would EVER have an open staircase that would let passengers fall into the water. The abundant quantity of "achtung" signs everywhere is proof of this fact.
