I was very willing to give Rendition the benefit of the doubt when it came to all the negative press I had read about it. Even at about three quarters of distance, I still thought he was confused and a little inconsistent, but otherwise a solid story that came to its conclusion. And then the fund fell. Not necessarily wanting to ruin the film for anyone, but the conclusion turns everything you kept to be a matter of fact about what and when things went into your head for no particular reason other than to tell the world, yes, they are cool, and I know. I love a good turn, I love a good time ah-ha, but only when it's relevant to the story at hand. The complete misunderstanding by the filmmakers has no purpose in the general story, the deadlines do not need to be parallel and do not need to be separated by a week. The whole revelation was to destroy any merit I was going to give to director Gavin Hood and screenwriter Kelley Sane, which could be a good thing, because looking back, it wasn't a solid film as I initially would have blindly given. to obtain the term rendition in the public consciousness of the cinema, but he needed a story that delved more deeply into the connotations and politics involved, rather than glossing over those issues for a story of a woman in difficulty due to the disappearance of her husband and the anguished rebellion of a daughter against her father "interrogator". I understand that the participant in the background film needs a human quality to grasp and for this reason I am not complaining about having traveled that road. My only concern is that we don't have enough of what the title says we should get. Instead we are shown numerous plot lines, all confused and brought to the fore before being sent back to the lower regions of our consciousness, to which we should never return. Is it happening so much that you forget what you should have at heart, the wife? the interrogator? the CIA agent? the victim? the senator? the Middle Eastern daughter and her zealot boyfriend? In the end I gave up and let the film take me where it would be, and eventually it became someone totally different from what it created. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens happens as a result of an explosion bomb. This bomb is at the center of every plot and eventually ends up being so harmless that you can't believe how big the waves it has spread. The old butterfly wings flapping quotes are in full effect, because a boy's revenge mission ends up destroying the lives of so many. Whether for death, destruction, physical and emotional abuse, or career suicide; no one really escapes unscathed. However, at the end of the day, only the story of a man who was removed to Egypt for torture is really interesting. We are led to believe that he is unequivocally innocent from the start, yet he is waterboarded, electrocuted, etc. In order to extract any information you might have. When those in power include a man who has no compassion or reason to stop until something is poured out (whether true or not), and an observer without the courage to take it or stop it, the situation lends itself to some intrigue about how it might end. The three actors involved are all the best parts of the film and demonstrate once again that the film should have been interested in them for the whole. <br /> <br /> I don't want to belittle people like Reese Witherspoon, (the victim's wife), or his former employee senate, played by Peter Sarsgaard, because they actually do a good job with what's given. Even Meryl Streep, her bizarre accent, and Alan Arkin don't detract too much. However, he is the trio of Jake Gyllenhaal's CIA agent, Yigal Naor's interrogator, and Omar Metwally's victim who really shine. Naor is as brilliant as the Egyptian trying to stay sharp as a razor during working hours, but as compassionate and worried as a father trying to locate his daughter. This man is brutal, but it is because it is what his occupation requires and why he is invoked to find answers. Metwally never gives a second fake during the pain and suffering inflicted on him. Whether he's lying or doesn't really know anything about the terrorist who called his cell phone, we totally buy his situation and wait desperately to see what the situation looks like. As for Gyllenhaal, someone who seems to have a performance recycled during his career with varying degrees of success, finds a part that suits him. The demons that enter his soul during the ordeal are forced to be part of the wear of his body and his mind, causing both ambivalence and the need to intervene. The two feelings are fought each other until he makes a final decision, and his attitude of stoic attitude, boyish that fights perfectly. <br /> <br /> It is simply a pity that the plot of a plot is never found as the main focal point, despite being the film's namesake. With all the mess around the edges, we as an audience bounce too much, lulled in a sense of time and sequence, and then slapped each other in the face while everything unravels in more than a laugh about us then at, "I bet I didn't seen coming. "I felt cheated and unfortunately this is the lasting effect I got from the movie. If it had been simpler I could have had more fun, but as it is, you can still take some positive aspects from the whole badly defective.
