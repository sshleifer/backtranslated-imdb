I really am not kidding when I can honestly claim that this film is not suitable for viewing Sunday night on ITV4. <br /> <br /> Underground scenes are horrible when London is supposedly under 30 feet of water, the character of Robert Carlyles is drab. The team of police commissioners reminds me of something that Kate Moss threw and Nigel Planer looks very VERY old, in fact, I'm worried that he might have had a stroke during filming. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle's father who was 'always right' evidently slaughtered too many Ketamin and while he plays an important part in this embarrassing journey, he deserved to be killed off the road before being caught pretending to be Kate Winslett (Titanic) dangling on the Thames Barrier. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for movie lovers but I avoid at all costs.
