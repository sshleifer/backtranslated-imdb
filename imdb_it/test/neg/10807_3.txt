Now I watched it when it first came out on VHS, and all my friends and I thought it was a pretty good movie, but then again we were teenagers. But honestly, it's not as good as a film in retrospect. A kind of metal for hair, Dokken version of Carnival of Souls. But a bad movie doesn't exactly mean that it is unwatchable; however, this seems to lack the charm that usually contains the normal Mst3k feed. But if he was on cable, and I was bored and drank beer - sure, I'd look at him again. But then again, I saw Howling VII about five times now, so maybe you shouldn't really listen to me. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else think it's sad that the director commented on his film? And why did he feel the urge to use capitalization so much?
