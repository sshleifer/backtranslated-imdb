This film can be described as a very long episode of a very bad sitcom. How many vaguely humorous misunderstandings can you fit into one movie? Notes are misplaced, bags are exchanged, conversations are incomprehensible, people get confused, situations are misinterpreted, and somewhere along the line people have to laugh at something. The writers are really struggling to keep everything, which makes the dialogues really forced. If someone in this film behaved like a real person, this would be solved in about two minutes and everyone could go back to their lives, but they must keep the misunderstandings. Sometimes this movie also tries to make some youthful laughs, but everyone who does is remembering how funny "American Pie" was. The scene with the nerd telling the prostitute (who thinks he is a foreign student) to "eat his sausage" goes on forever, not a second is fun. I have to give a little credit to this film: because of the subplot of stolen money, it's not as boring as it could have been. He also has a laugh here and there, but then sadly returns to another question of the character's misunderstanding. Overall this film is simply too weak.
