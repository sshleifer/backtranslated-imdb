This is a terrible makeover of a great movie called "Up In The Air" with Frankie Darrow, Mantan Moreland and Marjorie Reynolds. I managed to overcome only 20 minutes before turning it off. Almost all the lines are identical, I have no idea why they would do the movie again. I totally disagree with a previous post that does not like songs (there is the same too), in the original the song is top quality, I'm not sure that Marjorie Reynolds actually sang by herself, it's hard to say since the voice was usually added later, and the songs are very good, surprising in a "B" movie. If you have the chance to see the original, it is available on DVD. You will be pleasantly surprised.
