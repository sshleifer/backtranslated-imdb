This film is the last straw. As two passionate fans of romantic comedy, this film finally made us understand that nothing good came out of this genre from Love Actually. There was nothing good in the film. It was an affront to love, to death and all the rest. Including horses and beaches. There was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. This film took the spark of Nicholas Sparks. Diane Lane can't act to save her life. She was not convincing in her laughter, she cried and danced. And she needs a better haircut. There is no reason to watch this movie. Save yourself. The romantic comedy is officially dead.
