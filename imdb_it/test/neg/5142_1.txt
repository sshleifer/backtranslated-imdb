OK ... so ... I really like Kris Kristofferson and his usual ease in his lines in his films. Age has helped him with his low-energy spoken style and he will steal a scene without effort. But, Disappearance is its misstep. Holy Moly, this was a bad movie! <br /> <br /> I have to congratulate the cinematography and the actors, including Kris, for trying their most damned to make sense of this silly and confusing story! None of this made sense, and probably Kris also didn't understand it and was just following his moves, hoping that someone would come to him and tell him what it was! <br /> <br /> I don't care that everyone in this movie was making love for the project, or some nonsense ... I saw low budget movies that had a storyline for heaven's sake! This had none, zilcho, nada, zippo, empty of reason ... a complete waste of good talent, scenography and celluloid! <br /> <br /> I rented this piece of garbage for a dollar, and I want my money back! I want my 2 hours back, I have invested in this Grade rejection of my time! Don't watch this movie, or waste 1 minute of your precious time as you walk through a room you are playing or even open the case that holds the DVD! Believe me, you'll thank me for the advice!
