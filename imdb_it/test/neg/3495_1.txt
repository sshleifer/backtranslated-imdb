I went to the cinema expecting to see a great movie based on all the word of mouth and fantastic reviews. by the time the opening sequence began, I realized that I was in trouble. the music and credits were trying so hard to arouse emotions that I wanted to throw up. all I got from this movie were the common characters, the artificial dialogues and a script without emotions. director / screenwriter Paul haggis managed to get great reviews with his manipulative and hypocritical writing, but he doesn't deceive me. some performances were good. Don Cheadle is always good. I think Terrance Howard is slightly overrated, but he was decent. ridiculous it was too much on the nose. should stick to the rap. Brendan Fraser was fine. Jennifer Esposito left no impression. I find nothing interesting about her. Sandra's bull is always the same in all the movies, she's fine. Matt Dillon was very good and I enjoyed watching it work. Ryan Philippe was also good. but as for the script and the bad direction - this is actually one of those films that is so annoyingly bad that I actually took the time to write about them. I would not recommend this film to anyone, what a waste of time.
