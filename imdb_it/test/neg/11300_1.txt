I witnessed some atrocities in the cinema. In the last two years, it seems that producers and directors are willing to make films that push me closer and closer to madness. Hannibal was no exception. I didn't expect much when I went to see the movie. The book was ridiculous and the saying "The book is always better than the film" did not assure me at all that this film would be anything but junk. But what I came to see was a film that made all the other bad films appear in comparison. <br /> <br /> Usually, when I see a terrible movie, I find myself more amused than anything else. Unfortunately, I couldn't even laugh at the sad excuse for a film that is Hannibal. The film was filmed with promise, I guess. He had Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore and Gary Oldman. And to direct, there was Ridley Scott. There have been films with significantly less talent that have been tremendously better. There was so much I would have cut from this movie that I doubt it would have remained something. It was pathetic. The plot was so ridiculous that it seemed like a complete idiot had written it. What's worse is that the book was even crazier, and there were some scenes too extreme to be included, which is sad in the case of a movie in which <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD * ** <br /> <br /> Ray Liotta's brain was being torn to pieces. That scene more than anything else made me want to cry, because it has tarnished its predecessor to such a monumental level. Silence of the Lambs was one of my favorite movies of all time. But Hannibal was a joke of over two hours. This film should only be seen if people want to learn how not to write a good movie.
