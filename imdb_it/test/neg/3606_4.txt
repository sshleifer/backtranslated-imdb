The cast of EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE returns for the sequel to Disney Pictures, but this time the spotlight is on Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton), who is no longer the henchman of Yzma (Eartha Kitt). Kronk has started a new life and is very happy with his role as chef of his restaurant. Things go cheerfully until Kronk learns that his Papi (John Mahoney) is visiting. Kronk is worried, because he knows his life will not impress his Popes. One thing he has always wanted and never received is a "thumb up" of his father. A barrage of mistakes and a gigantic explosion of cheeses in the restaurant leave our friendly hero very deeply in trouble and anxiety. To save the day, a little help from his friends. <br /> <br /> Other items: Tracey Ullman, David Spade, John Goodman, Wendie Malick, April Winchell and Gatlin Green.
