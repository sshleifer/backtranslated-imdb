OK, Chuck Norris has appeared in many hilarious movies over the years. This is not one of them. I won't even bother trying to get into the plot of a biblical expedition gone wrong. The "acting" of the main characters is so woody, Pinocchio would have done a better job! The synthesizer-based soundtrack is even worse than the one in Deathstalker. While traditionally low-budget ghostly films often try to capture audiences by adding a lot of graphic violence, this is trying to capture an audience by launching the mambo religious jumbo to the viewer. The plot is reduced to different versions of the Bible.
