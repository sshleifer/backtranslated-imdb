Mansfield Park, in its second part, is my favorite of Austen's novels, and Fanny Price my favorite of her heroines, so I am saddened by the unfortunate fate she suffered in her big and small screen representations. The only good reading of the character I listened to was made by radio by Amanda Root, who gave her the same quality as that of Anne's character in the movie "Persuasion": a strict, secure and sincere moral centrality. If the actress had been younger, it would also have been a good visual interpretation; but the Fannys that have reached our eyes so far have more resembled, respectively: Mary Crawford; Ruby the scullery girl; and (in this incarnation) a jovial servant, or perhaps cretin, with his high moral principles has pulled down a peg. <br /> <br /> Well, I had hoped for something better, but I had feared worse. The serial had a solid Edmund, in an actor who was the best of the nice saps, and the perfect, that is perfectly abominable, Mrs. Norris; otherwise it was boring. The film, which apparently was intended as a deconstruction or some other bad theatrical idea, came out as a confused burlesque. After these disappointments and the most recent disappointments of the twin pieces of this production (the new "Persuasion" and "Northanger Abbey"), I could not help but have conflicting expectations for this; and overall, it made me feel slightly better disposed than not. He condensed the novel intelligently, and eventually left me more or less the same feeling, like a version of a comic book. On the other hand, to do so he had to rework most of the characters, with the exception of Crawford, and incidentally he has reduced or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book, including his most famous character and what should be , if not, his most famous scene. <br /> <br /> The character is aunt Norris, always ready to direct other people on what to do, but always avoiding having to do it alone; there is absolutely no sense here. And with her goes much more: her observation that cuts Fanny, "... considering who and what you are"; Sir Thomas's discovery that he had forbidden Fanny from a fire in his room for all these years, and his apologies for her; Fanny's honesty in recognizing, during a home visit, that Aunt Norris, despite all her faults, could manage the house better than both her sisters. But then, the whole journey lacks history, and so is most of what happens to the theater tests and most of what disapproves of Sir Thomas on his return; and in fact Sir Thomas and his wife are different from what they were. Above all, the scene in which Crawford proposes to Fanny, one of the most complex of Austen, is simplified to the point of making it shameless; In spite of this, Fanny is firmly convinced of what she knows to be right, and of what she knows to be most probably true, against all the distractions that Crawford and anyone else can throw at her. For a male reader, now no less than when it was written, he reveals with unmatched clarity - in any case unparalleled, as far as I know - what a woman goes through in an attempt to deal fairly but decisively with a man whom she has reason to be suspicious. It is a brilliant scene in the novel; on TV it's just a scene. <br /> <br /> And, Fanny, oh, Fanny: when will we see your fellows?
