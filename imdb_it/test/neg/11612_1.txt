The plot looked good, the actors looked okay, the movie should have gone well <br /> <br />. But it certainly wasn't - It didn't take us anywhere, the scenes from <br /> <br /> are weird. Maybe it was meant to create something new, to make us think <br /> <br />. What at least did: where is the rest of this film? For me it was <br /> <br /> wasting money, time and talent. Someone might want to see this <br /> out of curiosity, to see if they can understand it. Other than personally <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone.
