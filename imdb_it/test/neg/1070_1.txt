It is fascinating how this title manages to make the average viewer slip away as something new and revolutionary (citing some of the comments). Murali K. Thalluri must have thought alone: ​​"Oh, handsome! Elephant ... What a fantastic movie! I'll try to do exactly the same movie and see if anyone notices!", Unfortunately, he even failed with his outrageous idea . The film turns out to be a complete failure. Considering that he tries to capture the splendor of Gus Van Sants "Elephant", it makes it even more ridiculous - an embarrassing misstep for a director. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the suicide of a student in the school bathroom. This scene already shows the awkward acting skills of everyone involved in this scene. Don't buy a single word they say. He continues, interrupted by short interview-style pieces of children who "live in their married life" with every distressing anxiety in its pure and simple stupidity based on any worthless monologue. Thalluri intends to present the characters in this way, to give a sort of quick-how-food-food insight into their hearts ... and fails once again. Not five minutes later, Thalluri finally screams to the audience "Yes, folks! I stole this movie and for some strange reason, I'm proud of it!" taking Gus Van Sants the most unmistakable narrative style of "Elephant": he turned the scenes twice to allow the viewer to follow every character involved in a scene on his particular way and role in a school situation. Hm, doesn't that sound terribly familiar? For me, this certain level of tolerant tolerance has been violated to a point where I could no longer endure this terrible film. Shame on you, Murali K. Thalluri, I say! I am particularly surprised that "2:37" reached official selections at Cannes in 2006, while everyone must have surely remembered "Elephant" (2003) at the same Film Festival a few years ago! So, how did the gentleman's name make the most repugnant rip-off appear? I find myself completely baffled by this error. <br /> <br /> Directors like Thalluri use public ignorance that is not (and cannot be completely) aware of any independent film out there. Given that Elephant has little to do with mainstream cinema (although it is undoubtedly a masterpiece), few people notice that the story told in "2:37" had already been told before! As is possible in a film festival of such great importance attributed to Cannes, I cannot say. It is sad and shameful that such things have passed and almost no one sees the real fraud in it. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is in any case exclusively commercial, worthless as an independent film and (at some level) rather a fake parody of its obvious idol, "Elephant".
