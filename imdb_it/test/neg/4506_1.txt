Actually I saw THE EVIL on the big screen. I saw it as part of a double movie in the early 80s (I don't remember the other movie) when I was in my teens. The film is bad, worthy. Incredibly bad. The effects are atrocious (you can clearly see the cable that pulls the black girl on the floor). There is absolutely nothing scary about it. In fact, I laughed throughout the film. <br /> <br /> History has tried to create this great built for the climax, when we should finally see who is responsible for all the evil and we will see a fat Victor Buono, who is as scary as a stuffed Twinkie. Seriously, what are they thinking? Good, who was a villain from the TV series of Batman, is one of the most ravenous actors who has ever graced the big screen and I can't imagine anyone being terrified by him. <br /> <br /> EVIL is almost forgotten now (for good reason) but in reality it is a very funny film and I wish I could see this turkey again, just to see that black girl being dragged across the room by a force invisible with that very visible cable.
