THE STAR PACKER is one of an estimated 152,000,000 westerns John Wayne played in the 1930s. Well, the number is a bit exaggerated, but it seemed almost like this. This is because these B-movies were made quickly with very low budgets to be the second, or less, characteristic of a theater. Most Bs were pretty cheap and tended to cut corners to keep costs down and THE STAR PACKER is no exception. To save costs, incidental music is not used, execution times were kept less than an hour, writing was often rather derivative and the actors are mostly less talented - and Wayne himself was definitely far from be a household name at this time. Some of these features of Wayne are pretty good, while others, like this one, are watchable but also rather silly and irrelevant. I liked this movie and most of the others, but it's probably because I cut a lot of Bs. <br /> <br /> Wayne plays John Travers - a US Marshall who investigates the actions of a local band to chase local people off and steal from the stage. It's strange, given that the film was apparently set in or near modern times, as they used modern telephones and machine guns: things you wouldn't expect to find in the old West. Such anachronisms are actually quite common in Westerns B - as Gene Autry's films (for example) abound with them. Wayne's partner is Yak - played by stuntman and true friend of Wayne, Yakima Canutt. <br /> <br /> The villain is an unknown figure named "The Shadow" and distributes his instructions through a black screen that hides his face! This sounds exactly like a character in a series of films - the kind of villain the kids loved but the adults moaned because they were so stupid and kind of like Blofeld or Dr. Evil! The problem is that if you listen to his voice and pay attention, it becomes clear at the beginning of the film that this "shadow" is George Hayes. Now, talking about Hayes, it's the same guy who later on in the movies was known as Gabby Hayes, but here and in many other Wayne movies, it looks and acts NOTHING like Gabby. In THE STAR PACKER, he was well dressed, articulate, and clean-shaven - imagine! In real life, apparently this was the real George Hayes - though I doubt he was evil! Now, as you can see from the last paragraph, there's really no mystery in this film. It remains with acting (passable and nothing more) and acrobatics - which in reality were really surprising. Again and again, one extraordinary stunt after another happened - like the men who jump from horse to horse and some scenes of great combat - all done, among other things, by Canutt and his friends. Canutt was often double John Wayne in the movies - and went on for decades. The problem with some stunts, however, is that it seems that the directors actually killed some horses to get those big pieces of "stumbling" seen later in the film. Until about 1940, filmmakers often threaded thin metal wires and galloped through them! In the process, the horse's legs were usually broken and the horses were subsequently euthanized! One of the worst examples of this was the film JESSE JAMES - in which several horses were brutally killed - that lead to the American Humane Association which insists that an organization representative is in charge of filming films to certify that animals are NOT injured in the production. Thus, from around 1940, the films bear this small disclaimer. THE STAR PACKER was made long before the disclaimer and I can't see how the horses did these "tricks" without being killed. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is at best a passerby due to a poor plot, occasionally poor acting and an incredible cruelty towards horses. I am not a bleeding heart, but I cannot understand this contempt for a poor old animal.
