Such as? I was wondering why I hadn't seen it in theaters or even in one single spot, and then, after seeing the movie, I realized that I had been deceived by HARDCORE. I'm a big Transporter fan and a big Blade fan, so when I saw him I imagined a killer fight scene between two guys, lots of shootings, lots of stuff. Instead, I got Ryan Phillippe's movie with a short cameo from Statham and Snipes. The guy who makes the audio and video in the criminal lab has more screen time than Wesley's. It was like renting a Jackie Chan movie waiting for a bunch of kung fu and getting Erin Brockavich. I expect bad movies from Hollywood, but actors like Snipes and Statham should treat the fan base better.
