While this is certainly a well-made piece of film production, it is completely devoid of any entertainment value. <br /> <br /> If you are already depressed, this movie will send you over the limit. <br /> <br /> If you feel a little depressed, this movie will be just another thing in your life to feel bitter. You will feel that it was fortunate to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> Otherwise you might be able to get past this unharmed movie (I didn't 't, BTW), sure knowing your life is much better than Jim's. Then again you might consider that you are kidding yourself, and that in fact you are in a much worse situation than you had previously accomplished. You might feel a little annoyed by Jim for bringing him to your attention. You might want to slap him a little with a wet fish. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that, as much as I liked this movie ... I hated it. It took a long and miserable road along the path of oblivion and then suddenly, for no reason, turned around and then stopped. <br /> <br /> Jim has no lighting, at least not one that is carried on the screen. Jim has a miserable life and a poor set of options. He discovers nothing to which one can relate and fails to make significant progress on his journey of self-discovery. <br /> <br /> Of course no one alive could write a happy ending to this film. As others have said it's not a Hollywood fairy tale, it's gritty and it's real. It's well done Life is quite a struggle sometimes. If someone should know "the answer", it is good to shout it from the rooftops. <br /> <br /> However, I feel cheated because this movie pretends to have something to say. Feel that he is going to say something, that if you only suffer a little more, he will have something to say. It will make you stop and think. <br /> <br /> It is not. <br /> <br /> Once again, I stress that this is a well made film. And therefore it can be of value to a film student with a weakness for example. lighting techniques for using color palettes. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, it's absolutely flawless.
