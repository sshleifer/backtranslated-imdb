The most famous thing about this film is that this was the first time that Garbo spoke in a film. Regardless of that "goal" (if you want to call it that) this is a film that does not go beyond the scurrilous melodrama, with Garbo doing his best not to fall asleep. <br /> <br /> The plot involves Greta Garbo returning to her father after 15 years abroad. His father, who is a captain on a barge, is happy to see her, even though he behaves a little cautiously. Soon he falls in love with a grizzled sailor, who also realizes that something, a barrier if he wants, holds her back. <br /> <br /> In any case, the two guys don't particularly like each other and soon they come to Garbo's shots, when he spreads the situation revealing his Big Secret that doesn't surprise us, if you've read the video box (damn to you MGM !!) Garbo is nothing but arms in this film, he acts and acts by waving his arms, and scratches himself quickly. The two male contacts are fine. Probably the best interpretation comes from the classic silent actress Marie Dressler, who plays even drunk girlfriend of the drunk captain. What a show! Too bad the tagline could not read "Dressler Talks!"
