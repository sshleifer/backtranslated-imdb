Tagline: the lucky ones died ... before watching this. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a Bulgarian movie from the 1920s, so I can't say that this is the worst movie ever made, but it's definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. I can hardly remember it. <br /> <br /> All I can remember is a family of stupid people who do nothing right. Their car has a wheel on four stuck in the sand, so they decide that there is nothing to do and prepare to live the rest of their life there. Then there is an old man who is aware of the existence of a band of cannibals in the place where he is, but he never considered the idea of ​​reporting the fact to the police. <br /> <br /> And speaking of the police ... if these freaks lived there for years eating humans, many people must have disappeared ... why did the sheriff not suspect anything? <br /> <br /> But I stopped asking questions after the first five minutes or so. The rest is boring. An incredible boredom. <br /> <br /> I will be merciful and will not talk about dialogues. And the acting. And the effects. <br /> <br /> I will only mention the final scene, in which the fanatical girl eliminates a snake (the snakes! They come out at the end, what the hell do they have to do with the story?) with a precise throw of a sniper stone , demonstrating Mr. Craven's total disregard for reality and for the things that happen on planet Earth in general. I believe there were riots when the film was first released in 1977. <br /> <br /> Even being eaten by a cannibal would not be a just punishment for the director for this attack on intelligence.
