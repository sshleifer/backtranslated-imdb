When I heard that they were doing this I felt happy considering that the first movie was pretty good, even if a little short. <br /> <br /> But then I remembered some of the disasters of the Disney sequel I saw earlier (I look at you Little Mermaid 2). <br /> <br /> However I looked at it and unfortunately I was very disappointed. The best thing is that the entertainment is superb. It really has that special touch that the "right" Disney movies have. <br /> <br /> Apart from that ... the rest is disappointing. The plot is seriously everywhere. A moment concerns something, so it completely changes into another plot and then changes into another completely different plot. It reminded me of how the movie Family Guy was like 3 separate episodes, turned into a movie. I laughed at most once. Kronk was a lot of fun in the original movie, but that's not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie, unless someone lends it to you for free. <br /> <br /> 4/10
