The review on the main page admits that the film is horrible but that you should forgive it because it is very violent. No, you shouldn't. There are spoilers at the end of this review, but how can I "spoil" this rotten movie I have no idea. Even if you are a huge fan of Alien / Pred as if you were waiting for the DVD. It is not even worth hiring it at 3.99 but you will be much less inclined to really hate this movie if you pay more than 12 dollars or better per person plus concession purchases at a theater. <br /> theater I saw AVPr that there were exactly two laughs, both from a girl sitting next to me. Apart from that, there was total silence everywhere. No oooh, or "that was bad ass!", Nothing. Imagine you are a patient on an operating table and the anesthetic is given. Now you know what you'll feel in the theater after the AVPr opening scene. <br /> <br /> What was the budget for this film? Like War of the Worlds, MI 3 and other films based on f / x, the director seems much more involved in what CGI people can invent than in developing characters or a storyline. Spielberg tried and failed several times, usually with Tom Cruise. Sure, movies make money, but should they? The report on the war of worlds and minorities had the budget to pay a decent script, Tom Cruise and others, and SS himself, but they were still horrible. I'm sure AVP has wasted 90% of its budget on CG and has had no choice but to hire an actor who would have said yes even though the casting agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and collecting random actors. <br /> <br /> There is no tension developed in any scene, so we are never close to surprise. Who cares who is killed? We didn't know anyone, we all know what happens when lil aliens make their bodily exit, we all know that blood is acid. In Alien, Aliens, 3, Resurrection and even in AVP, filmmakers make use of the fact that Aliens can think, can hide and lay traps. This director decided that Ridley Scott, James Cameron and others were idiots for developing characters that actually want to see live or be killed. In this episode you will never be interested in who lives or dies, not a child, a parent, a pregnant woman. The characters have only one purpose in this film, to die. The opening scenes establish the fact that the film will be a predictable joke. The character's development scenes mix clich√©s, bad moods and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point where we really don't care if they are killed as long as they die in ways never seen before. But they don't. The director tried to do something different from those who preceded him in the Alien franchise, but he managed to discard the good parts of the first films, the human protagonists, and to steal the rest from other recent science fiction films. <br /> <br /> There is no single original use of the characters Alien or Pred. In fact, the Pred has few problems killing the aliens by the dozen, although the last film led us to believe that Pred had worshiped the Aliens as a mortal enemy who used the killing of someone like Rite of Passage. The AlienPred is never really developed as a fearsome creature. His ability to inject parasites into a host was torn from several films, most recently he was probably Hellboy, where Samiel's dismembered tongue injected eggs into Hellboy or Doom where the mutated creatures left their back tongues after spying the throat of a victim. <br /> <br /> We are simply not given reasons to worry about anything in this film. There is violence but it is not surprising or surprising and there is nothing that has never been seen in any of the hundred slasher films. The CG is OK and both alien species are made to look and move like in past movies. But since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad, we all hope they die. The girl was probably the best actor in the group, but unfortunately we are not made to worry about whether children, women or anyone else lives or dies. We just want the movie to end. In the end he does, but not before another stolen story line from Resident Evil 2 has a Gunnison nuclear target to wipe out the infection. And not before another stupid scene that should open the door for more sequels, but does it? In a film full of bad scenes, the worst could have been saved last. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the repetition, but all that is repeated: bad script, no plot, non-original action scenes, uninspired direction, abyssal action, decent f / x that have been wasted due to of the many defects. <br /> <br /> I don't mind going to an independent film and being disappointed. Actors, directors and crew are probably making a career and working on a tight budget. For a film with this kind of budget and hype I feel betrayed and disappointed. This film is a painfully boring waste of time from the opening scene to the end credits. Sad to say that a preview of Hellboy 2 was the best part of AVPr and that the HB2 didn't even look that good.
