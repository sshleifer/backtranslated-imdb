If you suffer from insomnia, Radiant would be the best way to send you into a 7-year-old coma. The film is so absurdly exaggerated and banal that it is difficult to imagine that director Steve Mahone could overlook such dullness. <br /> <br /> The story has a Doctor in exile (who we never see) who moves in the desert creating a vaccine that will cure all diseases by filling guests full of antibodies that can fight any infection (yes like that episode of Futurama). Vaccines do not work and human guinea pigs are infected by a virus that kills within 48 hours. <br /> <br /> Not wanting to be captured by the masquerade boys, the group goes to the desert to cover up, hoping the sun will kill the virus. All this is narrated by Michael, the only one of the quartet immune to infection. And it is the most boring narrative ever. They may have launched someone with an interesting voice, but instead we have someone with less vocal personality than Clive Owen. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the publisher insists on cutting more than half of the film, giving it a strange dreamlike feeling and increasing the desire of the public to go to sleep. Not surprisingly, half of the audience came out of this, I wasn't one of them for some reason. But I should have it damn good. <br /> <br /> The ending should be shocking, intelligent and foreboding. But it's simple and simply not. A relief yes, but not dramatic in the slightest. <br /> <br /> The extreme cheapness of this production and the muffled sound that makes many dialogues unintelligible what could have been an interesting science fiction story if it had better actors, cooler places and a sense of urgency. As it is, Radiant is a snoozefest.
