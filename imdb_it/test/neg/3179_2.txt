I like Wes Studi and above all Adam Beach, but who is this film is a pretext. Ponderably slow. Too cryptic to the point of tarnishing, not because the plot justifies it, but because there is almost no plot. Even less in the characterization mode. This is almost like one of those creaking mysteries of Charlie Chan (the cheapest versions of Monogram in the studio) with a lot of red herring and extravagant characters (like the old ex-senator with the checkered past who is now recluse) and lots of people who are killed on art objects that you wouldn't look at the mall twice. Great scenery though. Beautiful red hair, though I never understood what she was doing in this. Nor could my wife. Sheesh, at least the old B series movies had the decency to be short.
