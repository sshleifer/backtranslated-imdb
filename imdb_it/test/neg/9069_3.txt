The 70s were undoubtedly the golden age of "made-for-TV" horror. This is one of those that was probably churned out like a movie of the ABC week. It is the old story of a house and / or ghost who owns one of the new owners. The film has promises, but it is never made. Everything is rushed too. Tension and suspense need time to build and grow. And there's nothing new. We have seen everything before and one better. <br /> <br /> One last thought: I don't understand why the character of Robert Wagner falls in love with the long-dead movie star when he's married to Kate Jackson for heaven's sake! !!
