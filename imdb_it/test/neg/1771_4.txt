This is a species that hatches in a beautiful model (Mathilda May). An irresistible child with the urge to kiss and kill! <br /> <br /> The film starts with a strong throw and is infected with a bore virus from one side to the other. <br /> <br /> The weakest spot is the presentation of the basic plot / story. As you should have compared, Natasha Henstridge's Species got the same storyline, but adds a lot of interesting plot and doesn't mention good deeds and the strong clymatic ending. <br /> <br /> This explains why Patrick Stewart joins the fleet of companies in Star Trek Next Generation; he wanted to find more models in glass cages, floating inside Halley-Comet. <br /> <br /> To see for science fiction fans.
