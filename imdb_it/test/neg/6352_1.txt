I bought this film for a dollar and thought I could never be wrong, my big mistake was watching it. I enjoyed the acting of Ice-T and the rapping that gave a lot of class to this film about Los Angeles and the world of the pimps. There is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in a practice ring and who has a career, but due to mental problems since childhood and the killing of this other boxer retires. He is hired by a pimp who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls who work for him in their trade and make sure they are not beaten. This boxer falls in love with the boss's girlfriend and starts all sorts of problems. This is fun and therefore becomes a great laughing comedy.
