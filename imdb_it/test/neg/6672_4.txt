Well played, yes. Very well, I must say, even if I don't speak Chezck. Beautiful cinematography But the script is lame, really lame. A predictable soap opera, in which you know exactly what is going to happen. OK, maybe the ending isn't predictable, but okay? It's one of those movies that you have the feeling you've already seen, and forgotten the next day. <br /> <br /> I just got a note from IMDb that said my comment wasn't long enough. It's very sad, because I have no idea what else to say about this movie, which actually says a lot about it, don't you think? The thing is ... It has no soul and no originality. Compare this film with Barrio, or Riff Raff, shot more than ten years ago (or the extraordinary recently filmed The Child). It is sad to see that this is a much worse film.
