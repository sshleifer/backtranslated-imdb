I'd like to know who cheated the producers of this film to pay for its production - That persion is a genius of sorts. This film somehow caught my attention for about two-thirds until I realized that it wasn't going quickly. I think the music managed to make it look like something was happening, but in reality there was nothing. It wasn't scary. The dialogue was poorly written. The first 90 minutes should have been covered in about 15 minutes. This would have been a moderately acceptable episode of Twilight Zone or Outer Limits. <br /> <br /> At this point I'm crazy for having lost all that time. It's a couple of hours that I'll never come back. <br /> <br /> I hope these comments will save someone from wasting the evening. Take a nap or go to the gym. Or, if you want to be scared, activate a cable news channel.
