If you've ever listened to any of James Lee Burke's books on tape or CD and the reader was Will Patton, you might agree with me that Will is the personification of Dave R. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones is a native Texan (or so I heard) and no one portrays a Texan better than IMHO, but he is not a cajun. His delivery is completely wrong. I lived in the state for several years and I can still hear the strange patois that contains a Louisiana accent. TLJ has no such thing. <br /> <br /> I thought Marry Steenbergen was a good choice for Bootsy, but I missed seeing Cletus (who will be chosen for this role? The Rock? Mickey Rourke? will have to be great). Overall, I thought the film was just a 4 - the plot unfolded like a fish out of the water and didn't have the normal interest, yet linear non-continuity that the book typically has. <br /> <br /> We hope that Hollywood will try another JLB book, "Last Car to Elysican Fields" would be a good choice. We could have seen some of the best JLB villains ever.
