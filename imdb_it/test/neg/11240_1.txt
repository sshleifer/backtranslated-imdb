I have just given a 10 for Thieves Highway, I mention this for two reasons one to show that I am not an idiot who only gives negative reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread that is the falling in love of a woman of the night. <br /> <br /> We all know that Pretty Woman is a movie for girls, but you can't avoid them all, they will eventually catch you. Pretty Woman does two things to me, two terrible horrible horrible things, first portrays prostitution as a career more like a dancer, you know with absolutely great friends, leg warmers, lots of giggles, borrowing one other. You see in the reality of Pretty Woman the prostitute and this is a prostitute we are talking about here, she has a fantastic life, she is happy with the only occasional whining to explain her situation. My feeling is that the protagonist of the "happy Hooker" type is much more palatable than an almost realistic character, which for me raises the question of whether you make a film about a type of person but I'm too scared of the chicken to adorn that player the features familiar to that role, then why do it? If I make a film about a chef but don't want to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat, then why make a film about a chef in the first place? By freeing yourself and transforming the prostitute into a respectable dancer, the story does not fully grasp the point and as a result never lets you go to any of the moral or social questions you might have, that I peek out, really really lame. <br /> <br /> Secondly, "Pretty Woman" insults the same love story, Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no idea how to seduce or romanticize this "lady" who is without her plastic friend , yes, don't leave home without especially if you are an idiot in a dress that has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve sketches of money in one way or another, even when he meets her for the first time it is the Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work, the necklaces here the diamonds over there, the money, the money, where is the charm? where the charisma is, don't talk about the attempt to plan please. <br /> <br /> The girls who love this film will also be the girls who love shopping more than most. The guys who like this movie didn't even realize that the old Eddy has less charm than a computer, as they probably don't even do it and so they won't register. More importantly, anyone who loves this movie will hate 'Thieves Highway' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same topic. <br /> <br /> I will finish on a song: <br /> <br /> Beautiful woman who roams the street Beautiful woman, the type I like to treat Pretty woman, I don't believe you You're not the truth No one can spend as much as you Mercy <br /> <br /> Pretty woman, you won't forgive me Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see Pretty woman, and you are beautiful how you can miss the imagination like me <br /> <br /> Pretty woman, buy some Pretty woman, talk to while Beautiful woman, sell me your smile for me Beautiful woman, yes, yes, yes Beautiful woman, look my way Beautiful woman, tell me you'll stay with me .. and I'll pay you ... I'll treat you well
