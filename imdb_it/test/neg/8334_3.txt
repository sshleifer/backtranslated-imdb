When the film started I had the feeling that this would be something special. Acting and working with the camera were undoubtedly good. I also liked the characters and could have grown to empathize with them. The film had a good atmosphere and there was a bit of imagination. <br /> <br /> However, as the film progressed, the plot never seemed to take off and was limited to shooting scene by scene. I was not able to understand the connection between the stories. All I could see were the characters who occasionally bumped into each other and references to ships in bottles. Without this connection, they left me with some brief insignificant stories. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised it went so well in Cannes
