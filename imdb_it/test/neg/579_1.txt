I'm a big fan of Robert Taylor and tried to find all his films. This is one I didn't have, but I saw it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and I was very disappointed. I know he was a contract player with little control over the scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script. Victor McLaglen was even mean and Brian Donevy was almost unrecognizable. Considering the off-screen relationships between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on the screen between the two of them. But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the United States would order a Lt Marina to leave the service secretly to hunt down bank robbers, and report only to the President, which made it difficult to appreciate anything else about the film . Death row scenes were completely still. The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing. It improved later in Ball of Fire, thank goodness.
