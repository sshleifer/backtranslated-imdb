The figure of the Empress Elizabeth of Austria (1837-1898) is, in fact, mostly associated with Romy Schneider and the trilogy Sissi of Ernst Marischka (1950s) in which the beauty, the sweetness, the sweetness but also the history are always present. This was the Sissi, perhaps the myth for some; however, a powerful portrait. The spirit of the Habsburg grandeur and the spirit of Bavarian simplicity and linearity have greatly influenced those films. Simply, they had a soul. However, Jean Daniel Verhaeghe's film, although made 50 years later, appears to be a misrepresentation of the empress and her life. It seems to be an attempt to show something different, to reveal a certain realism as a cure for sweetness; however, it does not seem to add much, but rather deprives the whole story much. Let me analyze this in more detail. <br /> <br /> September 1898, Sissi embarks in the port of Geneva. Accompanied by her maid, she goes to visit Dr. Mayer (Didier Bezace) who will tell the whole story of life to find herself in this tragic life. The action consists in flashbacks of important moments in Sissi's life, but these moments are presented in a chaotic way and, therefore, someone who is not very well informed about Austrian history can be completely deceived or confused. Much attention is paid to the bad marriage of Sissi with the emperor Franz Joseph. The scene of his wedding night is a failure. No one has dealt with such an issue (I intend to undress and pay). The attention to the fact that Sissi is misunderstood is right, historically, however, the points that her opinions differ from the rest of the courtiers are not the real ones. Where is his desire for peace? Where is his love for his nation? Where is his charity? Sissi seems to be rather very elegant, modern, liberal (from the point of view of the 21st century). He is especially concerned about his appearance, which is not historically true. Sissi had an inner life that is not shown in the film. "Once women wear pants" is a sentence uttered by her and seems to be the image of Sissi presented in the film. Sissi detests the monarchy, which is the film's considerable criticism of the Austrian empire. Furthermore, he partly accepts anarchist movements and, to my surprise, blames her husband, Emperor Franz Joseph, for the death of Rodolfo, their son. What is the story in which Sissi was present at Mayerling? Sissi's relationship with Sophie, the mother-in-law, is shown best, but the scene of Sophie's death barely seems authentic and the conversation a little clich√©. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to criticize so much, but another crucial aspect of the film that I find weak here are the performances. Although Arielle Dombasle has her moments like Sissi, she generally doesn't fit the role. It looks more like a "female fairy tale" than a tragic empress. The trick is grossly inaccurate, as are most of her gestures as an empress. Malik Zidi is a bit better like Rudolph and can be considered as the one that increases the value of the services in general. Yet, Stephane Audran does not do a special job like Sophie: you simply don't get the impression of why he hates Sissi. He despised her for the sake of Sissi's young age while being crowned, for her behavior, lifestyle and her convictions. In part it appears in the film but surely it is not enough. But the biggest mistake is, I think, Julien Hans Capua as Andrassi. Andrassi was a count of pride, honor, patriotism ... here, it seems to be a sort of libertine thought just to make love with his queen. And the representation is so weak that this performance is very very pale. The careful choice is Tatyana Ivanova as Catherine Schratt, she really fits the role with her looks and her gestures. But unfortunately, his role does not take much time on the screen. <br /> <br /> A good point of this film are some quite authentic costumes and places. The port of Geneva is well presented and the moment of Sissi's death is a nice surprise for the film. It doesn't seem to be like it really was; however, the moment is good from the symbolic point of view ... the empress walks and knows nothing that this is her last moment. That's how it must have felt, that's how a madman destroyed a part of the greatness of the world. Another good visual moment was when Sissi talks to her son Rudolph in Corfu. But these moments are rare. <br /> <br /> In short, it's not a good movie. It distorts a very eminent historical figure, a significant historical time, tries to heal the sweetness of the Sissi trilogy but seems to offer nothing creative. The charm is gone, the grandeur is gone and the story is ignored! Not worth looking for! 3/10
