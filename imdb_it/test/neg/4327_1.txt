I had the feeling that the two hours spent watching this movie could have been better served maybe by going to the local bookstore and looking for fashion magazines and advertisements for Halston. Or maybe looking at the dry paint. Those two jobs would have at least engaged my mind a little more than "India Song". The most frustrating part of this experience was that I could see what moods / atmospheres were trying to be created and the notion of these could have been interesting if they had been enriched more. Instead, what happened was a presentation of an incoherent, foolish chain of non-events - with the same scenes reworked several times to beat some sort of point in our senses. <br /> <br /> I was sorry to spend more time on this film writing any kind of review, except maybe to warn other people against this waste of time.
