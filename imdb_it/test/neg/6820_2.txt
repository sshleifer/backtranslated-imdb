Dooley and his canine companion, Jerry Lee are together again in this second sequel (? !!?) I honestly had no idea they had made a sequel let alone two. And for a film that was only slightly better than "Turner & Hooch"? This time after Dooley retires, he has to pair his dog (with other dogs, people) and wait for Jerry Lee to hunt. Real class stuff. I mean, come on now. The original had at least some good laughs. This does not have one. Jim Belushi looks old and worn. Both Belushi brothers were fantastic in the 1980s. If John hadn't died, would he be as bad as his brother today? This thought makes me sad for some reason. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: USA network
