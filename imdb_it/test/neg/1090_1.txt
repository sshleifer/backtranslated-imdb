Terrible in a bad / good way ... this film has officially become the worst "TV movie" in my book ... except for the value of the field it offers, I give it a 1 in quality and a 10 for the field value. Tip: watch with friends, champagne and lots of popcorn ... we suggest you throw some on the screen! Preferably friends who like Chris Noth from his 'Sex in the City days' ... this movie is terribly funny. This is definitely the lowest point in the careers of all the cast members ... honestly, I don't know how they controlled the laughter while the lines were delivered! Daniel J. Travanti is absolutely pathetic. ALL participated in the excessive acting school; and poor Joan Van Ark, I believe she was the only one to take this theater of the absurd seriously ... she is nevertheless accredited as a producer. His "mom" jeans and bad plastic surgery are the stage thieves. This film also crosses the delicate line of social incorrectness when they introduce a mentally challenged character into the plot. This is a dark movie that shows Lifetime listed as {With Harmful Intent} .... anyone else had the pleasure?
