I had already heard of Ali G in the music video for Madonna "Music". I always think it's funny. (Actually, it really is.) Just last year I always thought of buying a VCD of "Ali G Indahouse". That's why a few months later, I bought it cheaply and started watching it. <br /> <br /> But the film surprised me. My older brother and I expected it to be a big laugh. It turns out that "Indahouse" is just a stupid piece of trash. It was really very bad. It also contains explicit sexual content and very raw humor. It also didn't make me laugh, just a big smile. We really hate that movie. Oh, by the way, I'm going to sell it. <br /> <br /> Ali G was very different in his film than his TV shows - in such a negative way. Maybe he wasn't very focused and serious enough to make this movie. Just because there are sex scenes in it, doesn't mean it's hilarious (because sometimes, too much isn't so laughable anymore). For the first time ever, I was disappointed in him. This made me really sad and happy. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 1 out of 10. Actually, I really want to give it a rating of 0. It's one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I would not recommend anyone who wants to watch good comedies that are not too explicit or horrible.
