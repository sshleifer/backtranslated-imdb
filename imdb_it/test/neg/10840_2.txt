There were some decent moments in this movie, and a couple of times when it was pretty funny. However, this did not make up for the fact that, overall, this was a tremendously boring film. There was no connection between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider leaving his future wife for this girl who apparently had been knocked out. There was a better chemistry between him and Liv Tyler in Armageddon. Hell, there was a better understanding between Sly and Sandra in Demolition Man. <br /> <br /> There were several moments in the movie that didn't really need to be there and they were terribly slow. <br /> <br /> This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding". Wait for it to be out for a year and a half on video and rent it in the 0.99 cent basket if you have nothing else to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon and you can't think of any better movie to rent.
