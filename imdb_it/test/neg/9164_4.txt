As adorable and adorable as they are, the story of three singing squirrels does not seem to have enough meat to sustain it for an hour and a half. I thought the first half hour of this movie deserved to be seen. It was fun, there was some laughter, it was full of energy. Then he somehow lost it. I wouldn't even say that it vanished, because it seemed quite abrupt. The fun was gone; the laughter has disappeared. Even my daughter noticed it. He's 4 years old - he laughed several times in that first part of the film, then he stopped laughing. Perhaps it has taken a tone too serious - the producer of the evil film that works to chipmunks to death. Something happened, however, and it didn't go well. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is trying to tell the story of how the chipmunks started (Alvin, Simon and Theodore). Everyone knows the Christmas song. Here we find out how they met Dave and started. The film is updated at the present time, although their true origin is known for the street address of Dave in 1958, which was the year when animated rodents were created. Jason Lee did a good job while Dave and the Scottish voices were also pretty good. David Cross, like the evil Ian, irritated me for being blunt, and I couldn't understand the meaning of the character of Claire, played by Cameron Richardson. He added little to the film. It's a film you can watch with children - it's probably a movie you would only like to see with children, in fact. Get a 4/10 from me.
