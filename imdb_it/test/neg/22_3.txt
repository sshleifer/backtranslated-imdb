When you make a movie with an assassin-premise premise, there are two effective ways to deal with it; you can make it as realistic as possible, creating credible characters and situations, or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it to laugh (which the producers of "Silent Night, Deadly Night" have done, for example, on an equally controversial topic: a murderer of Santa Claus). The people who made "Bloody Birthday", however, don't do any of those things; they simply rely on the shock value of a child's image with a gun (or a knife, or a loop or an arrow) in his hand. The result is both offensive and stupid. The whole film seems like a bad idea that has been subjected to a production (and then maintained by the release for several years). It is redeemed a little from the good performance of the children, but it is VERY unfairly done. (* 1/2)
