If this film were outrageously poor it would be fine, the problem is that many take it seriously. In short, some points: <br /> <br /> - There is no story, no focus, no lead and all the questions asked cannot find an answer. Overall, the film is extremely repetitive and boring (I have been to several war-torn African nations several times and found all the persistence in local misery and despair that was very painful to look at but still meaningless). <br /> <br /> - The questions raised are pure manipulation and the truth is that these are not questions but statements. <br /> <br /> - I am not a filmmaker, but what sense does it raise, for example, the issue of arms smuggling, if the only element brought to the public is the declaration of a local journalist? The director doesn't even bother to show us at least one sequence in which he would have been waiting near the airport to try to locate heavy trucks that left the area immediately after a plane landed. <br /> <br /> - The fish story takes less than 5 minutes, and is supported only by a sequence in which the director takes a documentary shown during a local conference. This guy did some work ???? <br /> <br /> - Abject poverty is continually shown in endless sequences, but where is the point? You can go almost anywhere in Africa with one hand cam and shoot the same pictures unfortunately. Where is the big news? <br /> <br /> - Filming of prostitutes who watch and cry over the images of their murdered friend and fellow prostitute are worth the worst emotional manipulations that can be seen these days on thrash and real TV. <br /> <br /> - The parallel drawn between the famine that is ravaging the country with over two million hungry and the export of fish is absolutely useless, dishonest and makes no sense except to manipulate the spectators with feelings typically anti-globalized and anti-western. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting debate in France after an academic published a very detailed commentary on the film, which brought the number of journalists working in Africa for decades to investigate some more details. It turns out that: <br /> <br /> - The fish waste shown sun-dried and collected by some local people are not intended to be eaten by humans at all but are collected for export at reasonably good prices for purposes of animal feed. I think I'm not the only one to have had the impression that the director suggested the exact opposite. <br /> <br /> - Arms smuggling is a reality (but once again, where is the big news?), but not how this film explains the problem. If the empty planes that land in Mwanza participate in the smuggling, they actually unload their shipment in a different place in Africa, then go to Mwanza to collect the fish so as not to make the return journey empty (meaning that they actually land empty Mwanza ...). <br /> <br /> - People eat fish locally, contrary to what the film suggests (about 40-60% of what is taken away from the lake) and thousands of people live with it. Good for them! It is a private affair of that kind that will one day lead African countries out of poverty and not Western laments and endless foreign assistance. <br /> <br /> I can't say how shocked it is to see the success of this movie!
