This film is about a girl who goes to live with her rich cousins, falls in love with her cousin and refuses the advance of an amoral suitor that puts her family in difficulty. After seeing the 1999 version and reading the book, I decided to look at the previous version. I found that he was faithful to Fanny's character in the book, but he was also a boring character. Fanny's character played by Sylvestra Le Touzel was lackluster; often seemed to be about to faint. I also didn't like Robert Bourbage who played Henry Crawford. I couldn't imagine that he was interested in Fanny or his cousin Maria. Jackie Smith Wood who played Mary Crawford was fine, but the wig she wore was so ugly. I lost interest in his acting and kept staring at his wig. I kept thinking that he would fall from his head. I could even see a lock of her real hair under the wig.
