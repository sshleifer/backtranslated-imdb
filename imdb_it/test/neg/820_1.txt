I like the Ali G show, I think the guy has the comic instinct, but he hasn't (yet) developed it for a talent. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit worse than I expected. I don't find Ali-G offensive, just stupid. Jokes for 5 year olds, some good, some terrible. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie that looks "offensive", but it's actually funny, see "Green Freddy Got Fingered". <Br /> <br /> 2/10
