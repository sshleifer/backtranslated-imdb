This show is like watching someone training to host a show. There are some good comedy ideas and tons of mediocre ones. It does not seem that writers know the difference between what is fun and what is just strange or gross. <br /> <br /> It has its moments. When Spike drained a neighbor who had let his dog repeatedly dirty his lawn, he hit the peak. But the hilarious moments are too few, and there are too many experimental comedy bits that miss the mark. <br /> <br /> The show is better than, for example, looking at a test model or the QVC network, but it needs some better writers. <br /> <br /> Reading the positive and positive comments of IMDb on this show, I am convinced that most of them were written by Spike staff members and relatives and friends. <br /> <br /> Solo is not very good most of the time.
