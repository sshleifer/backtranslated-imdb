If the good intentions were enough to produce a good film, I would have evaluated the turgid, ponderous, obvious "Focus" a little higher than 4. Macy does his best, but as a previous poster commented, Miller's little parable there asks to suspend disbelief too often. Perhaps the novel gives us a little more experience on Newman, so we can understand how someone who is obviously not lacking in intelligence could be so dense in perceiving the attitudes of those around him. I agree with another reviewer that if one is not aware of how mediocre citizens have been to America during this time, then this film could open their eyes. I grew up in the 1950s, and the "good" pastors of my Lutheran church found nothing wrong with having a picnic at the church on a commercial beach, the sign of which clearly indicated that Jews or blacks would not be admitted. Today it is difficult for young people to understand that this was the norm, and not only in the South. Even in 1964, when I graduated from a rather racial (but sexually segregated) public school in Baltimore, my black classmates could not attend the traditional "father and son banquet", since it was held in a structure that did not admit blacks. Unfortunately, it was an establishment owned by a Jewish family. The topic of "Focus" is important, and we should never forget, despite the persistent signs of racism in modern America, how truly repulsive were the attitudes of that previous generation (in fact, the "greatest generation"). So, maybe this film is a bit valuable in countering the recent wave of sentimental loathing in the forties by the likes of Steven Spielberg and Tom Brokow. But in the end, as in "Far From Heaven", the good intentions of filmmakers are undermined by having a protagonist so ridiculously ignorant of the social conventions of their time.
