Ok. I'll admit it. I'm a big fan of b-movies. Back when Michelle Bauer, Linnea Quigley and Brinke Stevens dominated. And in those days, even bad movies were still good. Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is simply ugly. Even a small cameo by Brinke Stevens (taking up Linda's role as "Slumber Party Massacre" 21 years ago) does not help this. A group of cheerleaders take refuge in a luxurious cabin after the van breaks down. A psycho pursues them one by one, capturing them in various states of barrenness. Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this a bad evil! Skip this turkey and go rent "Slumber Party Massacre". 1/2 *
