As long as you enter this film with the knowledge that it will not contain any historical facts of any kind, it is not bad. <br /> <br /> It is on the same level as "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" by Sam Raimi, regarding the plot, acting, humor and production values. You'll see the similarities in different places. However, most of the fight scenes are not good and the film suffers. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance controls the screen as always, and at no time do you get the impression that he is giving something less than his best level. Same for Oliver Reed. The problem is that their strong performance makes Don Diamont's less extraordinary acting skills look even more uncomfortable than his square jaw. Even the perennial bit player Cas Anvar was very good, playing a character very similar to Salmonio in the aforementioned Hercules. <br /> <br /> If you like low budget swords and magic films from the early 80s, you're probably going to enjoy this show. In reality it is a pity that they have attached the name Marco Polo to it. It really has nothing to do with Marco's life, contrary to the expectations of most people who want to see this film.
