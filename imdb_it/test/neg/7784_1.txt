A friend of mine once rented this, thinking that Peter Fonda would recite it, could not be bad. MISTAKEN! It's as ugly as anything can be. There's so much to laugh about and it's not the jokes. For example, in a scene Hawken enters the forest and when he comes out he suddenly comes out with a completely different dress! Where was the director's brain when he shot that scene?!? Probably the same place that Fonda was when he agreed to make this film. It is really a pity that we should see an actor as good as a madman in this poor excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> Nobody's performances in this film can be called acting. Jack Elam is brought here only to bring back the number of stars, but all he does is look surprised in a very dark and terribly filmed scene in a bar. Not to mention the "Indians", the girl was so crazy that I wanted to shoot her only to end her misery and mine. If I could give a 0, I'd do it. Too bad the brand does not exist here. This is really reminiscent of a bad joke or an amateur movie made just for fun. This should serve as proof of how B-movies can be bad.
