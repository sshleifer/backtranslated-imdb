This film is sad. According to my fellow IMDb users, (* SPOILER *) RAPTOR uses footage from the Carnotaur films. Well, since I haven't seen the Carnotaur movies, I can't say. But, I notice a bad set up and an even worse acting. This film is a large steaming pile of s ***. It makes absolutely no sense. Here is this thing called PLOT: the mad scientist recreates the birds of prey. Birds of prey kill people. The sheriff investigates. * SPOILER * (although I don't know what it is ruining) the sheriff attacks the plans of the mad doctor. Army boys and birds of prey are sent to kill army boys. Raptors. Yeah, for sure. I could make a clay figure that looks more real. FX is the cheapest ever used in a movie. There is a lot of blood. Gore economic. It doesn't even seem real. I will agree with another person who voted for this film that the only thing this film is doing is that it ends. There are about two seconds of originality in this film. And this only comes when the sheriff is talking to a tax agent over the phone about his electricity bill or something. This idea was used in around 100,000 other films with 100,000 different names. Overall, I'll give RAPTOR 1/5 just because it's finished.
