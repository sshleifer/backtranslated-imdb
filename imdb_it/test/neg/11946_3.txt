There is really only one reason to watch this barely adequate and entirely predictable movie about a tired chef Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta Jones) whose life changes when she inherits her orphaned niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin) after her sister was killed in a car accident. And this reason is to watch Aaron Eckhart (Nick) who, with his floppy haircut and attractive attitude, looks good enough to slap between two slices of organic Pannini and eat with an olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette sauce and a little sun-dried diced tomatoes. It reminds me of Sean Bean. The idea that he could take his shirt off was the only thing that kept me awake until the end. He removed his petulant apron several times, but to my disappointment, he never went further. <br /> <br /> I can't be too critical because I was watching it on pay per view at home, so it didn't cost the price of at least two movie tickets, and I was educated to be grateful for small mercies. But really, this is Rom Com at its best. Zeta Jones offers a very flat and monotonous performance, she seemed totally devoid of passion (probably because of the time that apparently passed in the cold of the restaurant? Thirty you can't have fun) and her face barely changed in all the film. Abigail Breslin was pretty good like her niece, she's such an attractive girl that it's pretty impossible to criticize her, and anyway I loved her in Little Miss Sunshine. Patricia Clarkson always has a good value for money and I can't really criticize her performance as a restaurant owner, because she seemed very little abused, considering she's a good actor and how little she had to do here. But the whole thing is just a clich√©, much of the banal dialogue and the result so obvious. This is the cinematic equivalent of painting with numbers, and Zeta Jones and Eckhart generate little heat on the screen. <br /> <br /> Nick loves Italian food (no doubt pointing to his passionate inner passion) and cooks to the sound of Puccini. His appearance in the kitchen of Kate at 22 Bleecker (the name of the restaurant) inevitably portends his feathers but his mysterious ability to bond with his niece by cooking pizza and building a Bedouin tent in the living room, carries Kate around and, despite some stumbling along the way, she ends up giving him her precious possession. No, it's not his honor. But his recipe for saffron sauce. <br /> <br /> I'm very unfair here, right? I mean Rom Com is Rom Com, and we all know what we're letting ourselves in when we sign up. But does it always have to be so incredibly boring?
