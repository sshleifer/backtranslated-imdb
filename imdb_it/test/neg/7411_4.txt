A big waste of time is all you will get out of this bag. I rented it hoping for a suspenseful movie with maybe some believable scenes, but the guy has always been disappointed. I think the title should have been "Camping 101", or something like that. Well, anyway, stay away from this movie. It stuns you to death. Don't be afraid of the big foot, be afraid of this shit !!
