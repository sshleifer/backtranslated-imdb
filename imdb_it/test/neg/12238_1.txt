If it were Jack Black listed as the main actor I would stay away from this movie right away. It actually makes some of his films look good when compared to this movie. This film should have been filmed as a cartoon from 3 to 8 years old and would have been much better. It is nothing but a pile of stupid skits of other films put together to make a big mess. The film looks like it was shot in about a day with no thought behind it. There are some times when it seems that there will be a turning point and the film actually has a plot for the film or at least one plot would develop, but the silly skits inserted ruin the whole film.
