The other reviewer was completely correct about this. The writing was horrible, the acting was horrible, the subject was horrible. The actors didn't seem to be really involved in the movie, as if * they * had * to be there. There were some unique camera effects, but they weren't really relevant to the story (or what there was of a story), and they weren't produced particularly well. <br /> <br /> I suppose they were trying to ride the success (can I say so?) of other eschatologically influenced films (Omega Code, Left Behind). And yes, it makes Christians embarrassed when these types of films are produced. I would not recommend this film to anyone, especially a non-Christian.
