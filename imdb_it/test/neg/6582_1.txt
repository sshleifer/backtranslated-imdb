I know most of the other reviews say this movie was great, but I don't agree. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's a good book! Actually it was one of my favorites when I was very young. But it is not meant for theaters. Maybe for a short half hour, but I don't see how they can turn a short children's book into a whole movie. <br /> <br /> It's a nice movie, but I would recommend it only for really small children. The older ones won't care. Adults might have a little more interest if they look at it with their young. But anyone 7 years old will have a festival of Russians. <br /> <br /> Sorry if you don't agree with me, but this is my opinion. :)
