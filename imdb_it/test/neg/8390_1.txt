Unless you want to get bored of dying. I was never a fan of Gus Van Sant and as part of what the previous posters described as the new youth generation I was very disappointed and a little angry about the stereotypical representation of the characters in the film, especially because they used to tighten the plot ridiculous of the movie that is making the masses see that the skateboarders are social waste and should be accused of crimes. As a skater I watch a lot of skateboarding and shooting during skate scenes, which is obviously an important part of the story as the main protagonist is a skateboarder, it was terrible and the Bourne esquire identity was used with the camera moved with the slow movement to give a horrible effect. This film is full of ridiculous stereotypes as evidenced by the "emo" soundtrack which adds to the media myth that all skateboarders are white rockers. Simply a really bad movie.
