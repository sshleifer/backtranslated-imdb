There is nothing to say if I don't want my time that this movie took me. I'm not a racist against Latinos. Hell, I'm half Brazilian. I loved the movie Kids. It makes no sense. These guys go around and do nothing. They are not even good at skating. All the while I'm just waiting for something to happen, anything! but is not so. Nothing happens throughout the film. I have already said that skating sucks. I could make a movie called beaten rocker, and the whole premise will be to throw away punk deficient posers like these kids. I won't even get in, this movie sucks. Please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you come into contact with him so some other poor soul will not make the same mistake.
