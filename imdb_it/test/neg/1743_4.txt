Some modern Janapese horror films are very good. Strong plot, moments of fear, good acting, while others are alone .... unfortunately, Uzumaki belongs to the latter camp. <br /> <br /> I will evaluate the film based on 3 elements: Plot, Scary Factor, and Acting. <br /> <br /> 1) Plot: true to the name of the film, the plot moves in a circle and can never really be explained. OK, the city is fascinated by the spiral curse, but why? And why do people act so foolishly? There is a fleeting attempt to explain what is happening to the reporter ... without restraint ... <br /> <br /> 2) Scary factor - if this was to be a horror movie, it failed miserably. I can't really remember a scary scene with a lot of build up. <br /> <br /> 3) Acting: very monotonous. People walk, they say meaningless phases. I can't feel much empathy for our tragic heroes. <br /> <br /> All in all, there are much better modern Japanese horror films out there with a coherent plot and a strong characterization. Don't waste time wasting your time with this aspirant.
