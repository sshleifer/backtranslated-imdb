I ... I don't know where to start. Dragon Hunt could only be the worst film in the history of cinema. Even Anus Magilicutty was better than that because he was intentionally bad. Showgirls? No, it had a kitsch value and was technically a well-made film. But Dragon Hunt takes the cake and eats it, then vomits it and feeds it to a homeless person. It's a kind of parody. <br /> <br /> Acting, if it can even be called that, is tough. It doesn't have the charm of improvised acting, so it must be scripted, but played with an almost mischievous tone of poor quality. Several lines were delivered in a way that shows the actors (or basically, those people on the screen) who regretted being connected to this movie or were thinking of a particularly funny Saturday Night Live joke they had seen before they found themselves in front of the camera. I could write three more paragraphs about the quality of acting in this film, but you and I don't want to hear it both. <br /> <br /> The make-up and special effects (which, with most films, is the only good thing) were ridiculously bad. The antagonist, whose name is so ridiculous that I can't remember him, has a Mohawk stuck on top of his head. Yes, glued to his head. And you can say that it is also glued, if you look at the spot where it meets its pockmarked skull you can see a strip of plastic, not unlike those on false eyelashes. Fortunately it is practically the only example of no-nos make-up in the film. <br /> <br /> There is also some terrible development of the character, to put it lightly. The women, who are strangely rude run by the alleged benevolent fugitive brothers (and I mean, they are really pushed around), are not just ugly but ... startles ... they don't know what they're doing! In one scene they light their apparent lovers, they unite with the ugly ugly even more ugly, and then they snort of coca. Apparently they managed to get their hands on a very good cocaine, because they started shaking and laughing even before all this went back into their nostrils. Great timing girls! They also wear really horrible things, clothes that belong only to the late 80s and early 90s. <br /> <br /> Overall this film, this film, this waste of films, I should say, is also a waste of time. Watching it will hurt you and will require the suspension not only of your belief but also of the whole brain. If you want to be stoned with your friends and have a good laugh, see if you can get this movie (you'll probably have to download it) otherwise, don't even think about it. I hope I was helpful.
