The only thing he has to offer are the interesting opposites of Tru and Jack, their choices and points of view and the philosophical questions he raises. Tru feels that he's helping people who shouldn't die, and Jack feels they should die, and he's joking with the plan of fate, or the plan of the universe, or something like that. <br /> <br /> But it is obviously capable of changing things, so there is obviously nothing like fate in the metaphysics of the series. Jack has no basis for believing he is there. And very conveniently, Tru never asks him the right questions. No one does. Which clearly shows that the creators of the series do not have an answer. <br /> <br /> There is simply no plot! <br /> <br /> Instead, they leave it murky because the series may be able to continue with the boring girlish stuff, only occasionally interrupted by Tru and Jack running against each other for unknown ends . <br /> <br /> It turns out that there is nothing in this. A teen pop series that claims to be something else. <br /> <br /> Your time will be better spent sleeping.
