My only regret is that you can't rank a movie on IMDb with a 0. "For Dinner ..." it certainly deserves! AT LEAST. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER? * The film begins with a group of people entering a crypt to awaken an ancient Vampire. When a guy cuts himself and his blood drips and falls on the putrid and dry corpse that is supposed to be a bloodsucker, the metamorphosis takes place and the Vampire, with an effect similar to ANIMATION (you would believe it!), Quickly takes a more human form, only to reveal that he is wearing a tuxedo and a bow tie! A snowflake, yes. Red, if my memory serves me well! I tried to check the random scenes by skipping a bit, but it didn't get any better than the opening sequences. This is where I turned the film off, cursing it for making me hope to see a Vampire movie. This is definitely not one, unless you are 5 years old and you could take such stupidity seriously. <br /> <br /> So, if you like Vampires and don't want to feel disgusted or even disgusted, learn from my mistake and don even try to see this garbage!
