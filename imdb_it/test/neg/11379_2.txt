I just came out when the movie starts (because I saw Juliette with the name on the screen). The script seemed very complicated to me, but before the film continued, it became understandably clear. I focused a lot on it but the result was disappointing. the object of sex used too much on the film unnecessarily and it seemed to me that the director ignored those who have a tendency to the opposite sex. In my opinion, the well prepared script could not be embodied. We watch the cast, the film promises something at the beginning or I expected too much ... and in the end ... the end is so mediocre that I wouldn't expect it. The main character Cassandra wants to give a message about having a child and how a child can change a life, in my opinion that scene is the real disaster for the film. all in all the characters are fun and play beautifully. but only the cast can't save a movie.
