A good cast ... A good idea, but it turns out to be flawed as hypnosis is not allowed as evidence in the courts. So many good actors and they all behave so badly! So, because they were all attracted to this mess ... And yes, it has its positive aspects like lighting, etc ... But in the end I asked myself two things ... How could so many talents lead to a mess so bizarre? What is that accent Nigel Hawthorne is wearing? Is / was a great actor and so what does that accent talk about? Is it impossible to identify it? What was he trying to do? Perhaps it's his subtle indication as to tell us: 'I've been involved with a turkey, here's a lousy accent for going with it!'
