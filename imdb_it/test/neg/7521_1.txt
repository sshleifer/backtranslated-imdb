I was one of the many crazy people who were spared paying for it at the theater, even though I paid $ 4 for matinee prices (before 6:00 pm). <br /> <br /> The story of the remake was ho-hum, the CGI morlocks were lame, the Elois were rastafari to imitate today's fashions (no, I didn't think the girl was hot for nothing), the king - killing of the hero's modern girlfriend was a bit cruel, in general just a sad, bad remake. <br /> <br /> I will take Rod Taylor, Weena and the fat-eyed Morlocks on this stuff at any time. My opinion is that many of the reviewers who love this horrible remake are kids, which takes into account neither the good taste nor the true value of the old classics that are largely unappreciated by today's most confused and increasingly desirable youth . <br /> <br /> When the 60s version came out (I saw it for the first time in the 70s for summer fun) it was pretty damn awesome and it continues to hold out. It is not necessary to have an abundance of CGI in a film for it to be better. Too much of this seems fake. I can't say enough badly how much the Morlocks looked disappointing and ran and jumped around like they were in a child's video game. 3 stars out of 10.
