This WWII film, set in Borneo, tries so hard to work on so many levels, it's a shame that it doesn't work on all of them. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte is an American on the run who testifies to the executions of his companions by the Japanese. Wander in the Borneo jungle, lost. Cue Nigel Havers, who finds the adopted Nolte tribe. Nolte, who now resembles Robert Plant, has become the new king of his tribe. He defeated a faithful warrior in a bloody battle and tattooed on his chest (a dragon). Now before going out and getting a painful tattoo and a one-way ticket to Borneo, things don't go well for Nolteland. Havers wants the tribe's help to fight the Japanese, who are invading the island. It teaches natives how to use machine guns, and quite a bit of shooting starts. While the tribe is more successful, they come across a new squadron of Japanese who are not like the others. This team cannibalize the villages they conquer to keep their strength high (talk about your sushi), and move through the jungles even faster than the tribe. Since we know the outcome of the war, we know that in the end the triumphs of the tribe, but with heavy losses. The spoilers are coming: Havers is injured and returned to "civilization". It gives the position of the kingdom and Nolte is captured. Havers then goes through the problem of releasing Nolte, and the end of the credits. <br /> <br /> The direction of Milius is certainly adequate, but the script here is rather vague in its motives. Presents story ideas, then abandons them to get to the idea of ​​the next story. Nolte is horrible when the soldier becomes king, desperately trying to channel the spirit of Colonel Kurtz of Marlon Brando. It speaks of freedom, the beauty of the jungle and the wealth of its people, and for a second you will not believe the words it speaks. Often it is unintentionally funny, especially his initial insect in the jungle, and he spends the rest of the movie playing like a hippie. Nigel Havers spends the movie looking at Nolte as if it were Raquel Welch. The vague underground homosexual current between the two goes beyond friendship, not entirely, and insinuates itself into an unspoken relationship that must have had something to do with the natives. <br /> <br /> Havers often wanders and has an internal conflict, rejected to hunt down the tribe's heads, but basks in Nolte's attention. His fellow British stooges go native faster than the Bounty landing party in Tahiti, but all I've seen in Borneo is that it's very wet and has lots of greenery. <br /> <br /> The betrayal of the climate, in which Havers gives the position of Nolte, is completely devoid of any reason. There is not a single thought as to why Havers does this, except to let the film continue. I was angry when, by chance, Havers and Nolte ended up on the same ship going to the Philippines, the ship ran aground and Havers runs into the hold to free Nolte, freshly mowed. No goodbye kiss, but Havers says goodbye to the king, explaining the title. <br /> <br /> If you were fighting a war, and an enemy squadron was eating your allies, wouldn't it make you crazy? This Japanese elite team is not shown enough, although their eating habits are so horrible that I would immediately become a conscientious objector. The same kind of phantom enemy has been handled much better in "The Thirteenth Warrior". <br /> <br /> Other types of interesting ideas are abandoned. What about the fact that modern technology causes the death of so many backward people? Why did King Nolte let the English use his subjects without too much hesitation? Why can't Hollywood find a decent actor to play the role of General Douglas MacArthur? <br /> <br /> In the end, "Farewell to the King" is a delirium, not anchored by a strong protagonist, and tries to be too many things without thinking and exploring its options. I can't recommend this. <br /> <br /> This film is voted (PG13) for violent physical violence, violent gunshot violence, some blood, some swear words, some sexual references and adult situations.
