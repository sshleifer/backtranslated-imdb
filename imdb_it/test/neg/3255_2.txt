This movie sucks. It's horrible. If someone liked it, those people should get to the top of the heads. Jackie Mason's character seems retarded. That guy who tries to kill the gopher is a loser and sucks. Even though Chevy Chase was in this movie, it wasn't funny. This film had raw and inhuman jokes and had no Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight or Bill Murray. Although the character of Jackie Mason had the personality of the character of Rodney Dangerfield, the character of Mason sucks. Rodney Dangerfield was fun! He should be back! I don't care about Ted Knight, but Bill Murray should have come back. The original Caddyshack was Murray's career performance. If it had been fun in the first, it could have been fun in the second. <br /> <br /> Final comment: I recommend this movie to ... NO ONE !!!!!!!! THIS SUCKED MOVIE !!!! HAS SUCKED, SUCCESSFUL NOW, AND ALWAYS SUCKS !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> 2/10
