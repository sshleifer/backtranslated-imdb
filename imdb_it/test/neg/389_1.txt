This film includes 2 known actors who previously enjoyed watching. Actions are great and every action is felt by the heart. But it makes me think that these two were catapulted into a acting / acting class in college for the first time and said they were acting in a dominant and constrictive way in the other in a room without letting her leave and the woman being really innocent and treat her with enough hump to convince the public to cry for her release. <br /> <br /> The only good part is acting skills, the plot has the same trick as Hitler's influence and I started to hate the main character for that. But all this could have been done in 15 minutes in my opinion, so dragging it for over an hour was pure punishment for everyone who looked at it. <br /> <br />
