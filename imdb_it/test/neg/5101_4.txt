this is the television show of the 90s, not the 1979.it movie seems to be three episodes for a total of just under 90 minutes. Before watching, I thought it was one of the versions of the film, and I immediately noticed, he had a TV show. I didn't care too much. I just felt that the story wasn't there, and there wasn't much in terms of excitement or drama. I was watching the time spent on my DVD player frequently, since I was really bored. I also thought that part of the dialogue was, to put it politely, not good. Also, I thought that acting left a lot to be desired. but this is just me anyway, it's nice, clean, healthy family entertainment. There is nothing offensive here. Kids will probably appreciate it. For me, The Black Stallion is 4/10
