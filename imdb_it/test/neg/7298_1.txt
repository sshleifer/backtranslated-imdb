This film is far and wide and beyond all shadow of doubt, the only worst and most contemptible film in the history of the universe. <br /> <br /> It's really * it's * so bad. <br /> <br /> Personally I have always appreciated the guilty pleasure of a terrible movie, and I rented this thinking it would be one of those. For my immense disappointment, it was not. <br /> <br /> The script is delivered in a way that looks like they are reading the lines directly from the signs, the story makes absolutely no sense and the actual movie looks like it was shot on a home video camera. I couldn't even finish looking at him. It's even worse than "Witch Academy", and it's a real feat in itself. <br /> <br /> I can't even understand how a director could make this film, and therefore still have the good sense to believe that it was decent enough to release. <br /> <br /> Painful, horrible, horrendous.
