Although it is true that the film is quite interesting, the execution leaves much to be desired (very similar to Blood Orgy of the Leather Girls, I Spit on Your Grave and Born in Flames, all superior). I don't think it's porn, but porn is in the eye of the beholder: if it works like a porn for someone, who am I to say he / she is wrong? I was rather puzzled by the statement in the general review of Winkimation ("Such a Shame") that "for once we actually see the faces of men when they arrive". A few years ago I occasionally did freelance reviews for an adult magazine and I remember seeing a lot of men's faces when they came. I think this is probably more common when the film features the few "stars" of male porn (and especially when that male is the director). Although, of course, I can't refer to specific titles, I know there are some examples in Ron Jeremy, uh, work. Also, I don't know that I would agree that a man necessarily shows vulnerability on his face when he comes.
