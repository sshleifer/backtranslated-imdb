From the moment the music grew (second part of the film) and it was a movie tripe, I knew I had to make a long journey. Incredibly clich√© (I laughed a lot and knew how the plot ended OK before the finale) - they didn't use Louisbourg particularly well and the costume and hair were pretty horrible. (My particular favorite makeup moment is that the only way they grow old Depardieu as far as I could see was to put a straight wig on him instead of wavy). I could go on talking about the ridiculous inadequacy of music for a long time - the film could be massively improved with an 18th century score. <br /> <br /> (ETA: AH, it's that awful moviemusic guy Patrick Doyle who is responsible for the score - don't say more! It shouldn't be allowed next to historical films - it should stick to the 20th century settings. ) <br /> <br /> Even the "visit to the notable part of the people" was exhilarating, especially his small visit to Madame Pompadour which was not interpreted in a particularly convincing way. <br /> <br /> I thought the only actor who appeared rooted in the century in question was Michael Maloney in the role of James Murray. He absolutely stole the show for all the 30 seconds it was on the screen. Tragically, he showed you how the movie could have been. <br /> <br /> The love scenes had a bit of warmth - the two protagonists were incredible together. <br /> <br /> The most horrible scene for historians is where they are at the great weekend dinner in Britain before Wolfe's sails and he raises his glass and says the first two lines of "How's the glass in around "or" Why the soldiers because "like a toast. Absolutely atrocious bankruptcy in historicity, much better to leave it out. Thousands of people know the damn song and thousands more believe the rumors that Wolfe and the company sang (probably drunk, not all stuff like this group). Daft.
