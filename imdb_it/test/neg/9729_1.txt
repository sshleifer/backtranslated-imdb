Wow! I don't even know where to start with what made this movie so horrible. Maybe I should start by saying that during a "lit confrontation" between the antagonist and the protagonist, I had to leave the theater because I was laughing so hard. Yes. The acting was really bad. The acting wasn't even the worst part. The plot was almost entirely shown in the previews. The characters are all grossly underdeveloped. Dialogue and "dramatic moments" are ridiculous. The bad guy is a caricature of an out of control, drunk with power, sadistic. <br /> <br /> But hey the actors are nice, so I guess he should have improved.
