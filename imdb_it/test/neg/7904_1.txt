This "film" and I say it lightly, is nothing but pure garbage. I'm sorry for those people who actually wasted their money to go see this in theaters ... I saw a film screener from a friend and I regretted it since then. <br /> <br /> As a woman of color, I am EXTREMELY embarrassed to see this. Furthermore, I am extremely horrified that even people of other races may have seen this and may believe that it is black behavior in general. It is full of stereotypes against all nationalities and genders, hideous vulgar vulgar jokes and unbalanced jokes flavored by rather well-known African American comedians who should have known better after reading this script! I must also mention the numerous rap and hip hop singers / rappers who populate the film as if it were too long a music video --- they had absolutely no place in the film. I guess they were the "Jins & Singing Minstrels?" HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> The "writers", the producers and anyone who has had the stupidity of financing this "film" should all be shot or locked in a room and forced to watch this shit relentlessly for the rest of their lives . DON'T LOOK AT THIS FILM !!! It's time lost from your life that you can never go back.
