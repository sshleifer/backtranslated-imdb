I lived in Barstow Ca. in 1968 when the movie The Killers Three arrived at the local theater. The trailer was enough to make me pay my hard-earned money to watch this movie. I really expected a Bonnie And Clyde film and Dick Clark played a shy nerd while Robert Walker and Diane Varsi played a miserable attempt to reintegrate Bonnie and Clyde. Needless to say, it never went well. Maybe that's why it never became a video. Even as a child I had something left that was taken from me when I left the theater. After all the best parts where in the movie trailer. The film was boring and practically useless. By the way, Dick Clark is killed, so it wasn't a complete disappointment.
