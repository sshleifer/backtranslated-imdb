Once upon a time there was a great American film. What combined horror and comedy with equal emotions. This film showed an intelligent direction. Revolutionary special effects and superb comic and serious action. It was titled "An American Werewolf in London". Sixteen years later the long-awaited sequel was finally placed on the board outside your local theater. Surely he would have at least some of the thrills of the original. Think again. "An American Werewolf in Paris" is an incomprehensible mess from beginning to end pitiful. The problems begin with the protagonist. Tom Everett Scott's performance is stiff and boring. From the beginning he seems willing to show that all young people are simple. In his defense, not even an experienced Shakespearean theater could have obtained a good interpretation from the youthful and witty dialogue. At one point, one of Scott's deceased friends, whose soul is condemned to walk on Earth after being carved by one of the werewolves, is finally able to leave for the afterlife. So joke with Scott and his friends. "Ok guys, see you." What a memorable farewell. Julie Delphy soon turns out to be Scott's mysterious European love interest. Basically, it's a French girl who plays the French girl. It's not much. But all this stupidity is not even the most disappointing thing in the film. The special effects, so an integral part of the superb original film, are very far from this flop. The werewolves look like cartoons. And no matter how well you carve a cartoon with muscled lycanthrope muscles. It is still difficult to be afraid of a cartoon. So instead the American band on vacation, led by the ultra weak Scott, continues to find excuses to return to the boxes of the werewolf catacombs. Here it is much easier for this incompetent team of special effects to keep computer-powered creatures or crazy beast masks under the cover of darkness. Some have said that if you don't watch this film as a sequel, it's not so bad by comparison. I disagree, this film cannot stand alone, and is even more dishonored than the original genius. If it doesn't want to be looked at as a sequel, it shouldn't have borrowed much of the 1981 movie title. I don't care how much you love werewolves. Or how much you loved "American Werewolf in London". as I did myself This is simply not worth the time. "Ok guys, see you." Terrible. 3 out of a maximum of 10 T.H.
