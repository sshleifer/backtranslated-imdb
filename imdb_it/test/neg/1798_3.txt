Roeg's interpretation of Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" was not exactly what I expected. Although based on one of the most studied and interesting texts in history, the film has become a bit boring. History never manages to capture the viewer. It is simply indifferent in a sense. <br /> <br /> The traces of the text are easily identifiable, but still it is not Conrad's "Heart of darkness". The script of Benedict Fitzgerald (who also wrote "The Passion of the Christ") uses only Conrad as inspiration, and thus becomes Fitzgerald's "heart of darkness". The film is not worth it, unless you are particularly interested in Conrad or perhaps John Malkovich.
