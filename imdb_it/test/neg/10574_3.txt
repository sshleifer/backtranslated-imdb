And so it began with "Shreik" a transmission of horror films, then we had Scary Movie, a really good attempt at a new kind of genre, the illustrious dismemberment. anyway .... now we have: Scary Movie * Scary Movie 2 Scary Movie 3 Scary Movie 4 * Date Movie Meet The Spartans Not Another Team movie * plus many others (really funny movies marked with *) <br /> <br /> and ..... Superhero films ... it seems that the people who make these films still fail to understand what makes warrants fun. using the scams of other movies in a fun way is all very nice if done correctly, but not many producers seem to know how to do it. Scary movie (1) worked well, the following sequels were as horrendous as the attempt to play the franchise, but it was redeemed by Scary Movie 4. No other teen movie was good because it used bad words ... and on the merits, I'm fed up with teen movies. however, this movie sounds like a bad version of all of these. he relies on a slap that would also drive the three stooges crazy, violating the image of Stephen Hawking, and then when people start to get bored (and the producers know when it will be), we are treated with Pamela Anderson in a close-fitting dress. to conclude, the parodies should consist of creating a homogeneous model of an original film with an original plot, not intoning the random take-off of a legitimate film on the plot of a real film. <br /> <br /> ... I shudder at the thought of "SCI-FI MOVIE" and prepare my knife seppuku
