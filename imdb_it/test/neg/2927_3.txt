Presented as a romantic comedy set in the early years of World War II, it fails to be published. The problem is that, well photographed, it has no coherent plot or texture. Starting as a murder, the mystery offers no hope to its actors as it winds through recent history. Depardieu is wasted in a trivial role that obviously isn't comfortable with playing. Adjani cannot bring the image. The hero is not; obviously an imitation of Hitchcock's "wrongly accused" role lacks balance. Neither heroic, comic nor suspense. <br /> <br /> This could have been a good movie. "The Lady Vanishes" comes to mind combining suspense, romance and comedy in a serious film about fascism.
