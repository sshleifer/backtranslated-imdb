most probably one of the (if not the) worst movie ever conceived, interpreted and interpreted in the history of cinema. Who on God's green earth would have thought of launching Cameron Diaz and James Mardsen as a couple? He looked like his mother. God forgive me but I'm just honest. And that was the last of the many problems that plagued this horrible excuse for a movie. It was a horrible statement against women, but at least if you blame women for problems in the world, tell a decent story, not one with so many annoying loop holes and pathetic excuses of suspense and chills. Everyone should get their money back to see it in theaters or buy the DVD.
