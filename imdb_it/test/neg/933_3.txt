I was watching the beginning of this Friday, mid-day, while working on the computer at home, relaxing a bit after a hectic week, cleaning up some files and responding to some communications. I was interrupted a couple of times, so I had trouble getting all the details (even if it's not a Hitchcock-sized job, one detail missing through the whole story out of place), and it wasn't exactly a "compelling" piece of work. <br /> <br /> So, during an advertisement, read the only previous comment here (from "mgconlan-1"), and you can basically agree with its details. <br /> <br /> Not quite in the category of such a terrible film is fascinating "good", but I'd like to take it on tape when I'm running again (rather than seeing it on the air), so I can go on fast if necessary and see the parts I missed this first time. <br /> <br /> Assign it a "3 *" due to the attractiveness of the four main characters.
