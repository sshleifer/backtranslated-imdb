First of all, I just want to say that this show could do well, much better than it does now. What brought him down was certainly acting. Miranda Cosgrove, who plays Carly's main character, seemed almost worthy of her show when she was on Drake and Josh. Unfortunately, iCarly was a big disappointment. Not only can Miranda not behave convincingly enough, but she is incredibly rigid when she moves. It seems like she wasn't sure how the "carly" character would move or stand. In the very first episode at the end when she throws the hat, her arm never leaves her side from the elbow up. even when he danced it seemed like a stick in the breeze. And the song? The acronym was great, just because Drake had been in it, the music was pretty good and Miranda's voice sounded false. I have to admit that the plot and the settings are good, unrealistic, but hey, that's Nick. They are practically known for their stupid lines and characters. But wow, iCarly is the worst of all.
