Man alive, this game is ugly or what? The graphics are much below par, even if they were on a playstation 1, no matter what a Gamecube is. The gameplay is pathetic and the camera movements confusing. What a worthless game! <br /> <br /> I totally love the animation of Warner's Batman and it's nice that they make all the games this way. Batman: Vengeance could have been great as they were from the beginning, retaining all the visual elements and Gothic voice actors, but they stumbled when it came to gameplay and graphics. The result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is not fun to play. I really have to underline how bad the graphics are. Don't be fooled by color combinations. I've seen better things on a Commodore 64.
