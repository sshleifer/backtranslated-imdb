I watched this cooking show a couple of times before I wanted to tear my hair out. Just a question ..... Who CAN NOT cook cooking a simple meal slapped in 30 minutes when all you need is at hand, already bagged, sometimes pre-chopped and you have very little to do except chop some vegetables . Also, almost every cooking show on TV is 30 minutes and most of these chefs do all the preparation work (except Sandra Lee), during their show. Oh and yes ... they also do full meals. <br /> <br /> I love the comment of the guy who hated "EVOO" comment. Add "DE-LISH" to my list of stupid tag words. <br /> <br /> So you have the obvious ... a strong and sociable woman who is really her best audience. He laughs at his own boring comments, cups too many times for the camera because he wants to convince us that he is as good as he thinks. <br /> <br /> NO, she is not "the prettiest thing". She is a 40-year-old woman who is not DE-LISH.
