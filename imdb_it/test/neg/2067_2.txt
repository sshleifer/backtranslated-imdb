I can't find the words to express how bad I thought this movie was. The initial precept was promising, but in all respects it was totally terrible afterwards. We run through the main points. Plot - good initial idea but really terrible development. There were many points where I thought "no, nobody would do something so stupid". The finish was incredibly anticlimatic. Characterization: all the characters were completely trivial or grotesque caricatures. I keep trying to think of what it was not - maybe the mother, but that's all. Music - intrusive, inappropriate and generally terrible. Management - totally amateur. Cinematography: I doubt they heard about it. Camera angles / stability / zoom levels are often very negative. I'm totally confused by the way this film has marked so much. It's the worst movie I've seen in movies for years, if ever.
