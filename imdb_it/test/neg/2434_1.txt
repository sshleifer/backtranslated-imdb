I think this was a HORRIBLE mistake by Disney. First of all, Kuzco DOES NOT need to pass "empress school" to become emperor! It has never happened before. Secondly, the new entries do not seem at all original. Very poor redo. And while I loved the movie The Emperor's New Groove, the New School is simply stupid. Like all jokes they are the same, and many are from the movie. The plot becomes redundant, always Yzma (is that the way it is written?) Trying to become an empress, Kuzco stops her, etc. Or Kuzco learns to become a better person. I think Kuzco gets boring with his constant complaints and questions. He's a spoiled brat and it bothers me. I don't think this is worth five minutes of your time, much less than half an hour.
