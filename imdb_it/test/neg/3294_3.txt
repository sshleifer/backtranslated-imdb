I grew up watching sitcoms like Seinfeld, Roseanne, Simpson, etc. Etc. In other words, mainstream television. Over the years many sitcoms have come on the air and those of a very small percentage are really smart and fun. The War at Home is a fine example of most modern American comedy. <br /> <br /> I give a show of 3 out of 10 because it's what it wants to be, a comedy, but it doesn't seem to do everything to be a good comedy. A good comedy should make you lose your feet with his big jokes, you shouldn't be able to see them coming and in TWAH I see almost every joke that comes. The characters are probably the most simplistic and horrible stereotypes I've ever seen on the screen, and acting is not very good except for the father who perfectly interprets a stereotypical beer that perfectly drinks the American idiot who loves sports. <br /> <br /> Poor acting, incredible characters and jokes that don't catch you off guard distract from this show to the point where it's unwatchable. If you don't have the cable and want to see a play that is worth watching, try Boston Legal. Worth more than your time.
