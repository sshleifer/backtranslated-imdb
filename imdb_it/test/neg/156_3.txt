"The Tempest" by Jack Bender is an adaptation of Shakespeare's play "The Tempest". Bender transports the plot from medieval Italy to Mississippi during the period of the American civil war. He includes the problem of slavery and the role of revenge in times of war. Prospero, renamed Gideon Prosper is not the Duke of Milan but a landowner from Mississippi. Learn voodoo magic from the slave Mambo Azaleigh. Save his son Ariel, who thus accompanies him in his exile. The island is not situated on the sea but in a swamp near the banks of the Mississippi. There lives an Alligator hunter, a so-called "Gator-Man", who later tries to rape Miranda, Prospero's daughter. During the civil war period, Ariel wants to join the Union troops to help fight slavery. Prospero doesn't care about the war. He is interested only in his personal revenge on his brother Antonio. When Antonio and his accountant Willi Gonzo (Gonzalo) try to cross the river, Prospero raises a storm. Federico Union soldier gets lost in the swamp and finally arrives on the island. He and Miranda fall in love with each other, but Prospero won't accept it. Meanwhile, Ariel turns into a crow of Prospero, discovers that Antonio has pretended to ally himself with the Union, but he intends to betray them. Antonio and Gonzo meet Gator Man in the swamp and conspire with him against Prospero. They kidnap Miranda and Ariel, but Prospero freezes them and helps the Union defeat the southern army. In the end Ariel is free, Frederick and Miranda are destined to marry, Prospero returns to the plantation and Gator Man returns to the island. Peter Fonda represents Gideon Prosper in a powerful and convincing way while Antony's character remains rather flat. It was not a bad idea to do the Storm before the background of the civil war, but perhaps the director risked too much. In some parts the story seems built or comic. For example, Gator Man appears without explanation. Who needs a kidnapping to bring Prospero into his mind and who loses faith in his power shows that Bender tried to make Prospero more human but made him a weak old man without his magic. Prospero's original authority and wisdom have not been clarified. <br /> <br /> ------------- End of part 1 --------------- ---------- ---
