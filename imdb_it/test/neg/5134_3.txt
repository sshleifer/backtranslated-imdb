OK, I don't want to upset anyone who liked this movie, but it was a really bad film. Just the way the scenes were changed and the acting made me shiver in some places. I really tried to enjoy it but it was like a student film, they must have the smallest budget. I really liked the plot and the characters were nice, but the film as a whole was just awful. Also, why in almost every movie with lesbian characters does one of them have to commit suicide or die or go straight?!?! This is how you send a wrong and unrealistic message. I gave 3 stars and all in all I think it was very kind of me. Watch this movie only if you want to laugh at how bad it is.
