"Electra Glide in Blue" is a slow-moving B-movie in which Blake plays a desert motorcycle cop who wants to be a homicide detective and gets involved in a murder investigation. A mediocre film at best, "EG in B" features some members of the Chicago band, a touch of action, a bit of philosophy and a lot of boring dramatic stuff. It is not worth the time.
