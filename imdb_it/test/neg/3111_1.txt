I bought this film for about 2.5 dollars at a local flea market. I thought that with the cast in this movie (Ice-T, Rob Lowe and Mario Van Peebles are all OK), it would be pretty good. Boy, I was wrong. This film bothered me. Almost every scene drags on too long. The scene where Rob Lowe is watching this girl singing and dancing in a bar lasts forever! It was one of the worst scenes I've ever seen in a movie. The rest is not even a problem. My guess is when they finished the film, they only have 30 minutes of film, so they did everything to last 3 times longer. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The current 1.9 rating here on imdb is right in the money. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Go watch some paint for 1.5 hours instead of watching this! <br /> <br /> If you want to see some of the best films made by this director, look at 'Mean Guns' (with Christopher Lambert & Ice-T) or "Postmortem" (with Charlie Sheen) instead.
