Yes, in this film you are treated with many small snowmen attacking in a seemingly very hot climate, so yes, this film should definitely not be taken seriously. In reality it is a much worse film than the original, at least in this case the whole production seemed to cost more than a couple of dollars and a video camera to do. He has his funny moments, but in reality he plays with the cheapness of your movie and make your laughs kind of a weak movie if you ask me. You can't make up a good story, your effects will be really bad, hey, let the movie be the worst possible with horrible lines and we have our movie. The first had at least a somewhat believable story like the snowman of the one attacked during the winter and not the one that amounts to a resort. It also had better effects, this is just a step or two in front of the "Hobgoblins" regarding the monsters and you really want to be more than a step two above a bunch of puppets. Yet it compensates for all this with a super final that depicts a large sea vessel extracted from the powerful frost. Actually, I'm just joking, but actually it was the fun part of the movie.
