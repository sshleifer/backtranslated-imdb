In 4 words, Captain Corelli's mandolin was "completely at odds" with the book. The novel provided a sufficient background to understand the relationships and personal challenges that the characters had to overcome; the writer chose to ignore the details. Ignoring them (for example, the role of the priest initially as a buffoon, but later as a spiritual leader, the inability of the girlfriend to read until he is taught by a socialist rebel, the bomb experts advise Corelli and his eventual ironic death), the story and the characters fall flat. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I ever abandoned halfway. Interesting cinematography, great actors DON'T make a movie; the story yes.
