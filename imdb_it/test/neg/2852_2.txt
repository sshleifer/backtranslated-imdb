This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave 2 out of 10 stars is the appearance of the beautiful Lydie Denier in some scenes. Despite her 42 years she is an extraordinary woman in every aspect, her naked scene in the bathroom with Armand Assante is hot as hell. <br /> <br /> Anyway on the film, well, nothing really interesting to say, a Neonazi and a Turkish band fighting on Berlin in scenes that include people shooting in the street in daylight and inside a club where 30-40 people shoot each other with machine guns in a place no bigger than my house and surprisingly after a few hours of fire only three die and ten are injured LOL. <br /> <br /> While the gangs are fighting in the Berlin territories a serial killer is killing small children and then he throws them painted white in various places in the city. <br /> <br /> Armand Assante appears as a Turkish detective who, although he now works for the police, was a former head of the Turkish band and is now about to solve serial killer crimes. <br /> <br /> The film is obviously a very bad rip-off of the classic film M. The killing of children, the involvement of the underworld, the character of the serial killer and the final scene with the "test" of the serial killer is more than influenced by this classic film. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, the script simply stupid, the production of the lowest possible standards and in general this was a great waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Don't even worry about renting it.
