Two teenagers in the north-east of England are desperately trying to raise funds and buy season tickets for their favorite football team. They go through a series of "comic mishaps" but eventually arrive smiling. <br /> <br /> The trailer for this film sells it as a comedy and includes most of its carefree moments. However, the tone is always darker and the end result is a depressing story populated by familiar stereotypes. The two "heroes" have no problem lying, cheating and stealing. Their opponents are an insensitive teacher, a bad pantomime of a father, a psychotic skinhead and a well-intentioned but incompetent social worker. The other female characters are a teenage drug addict, a pregnant student and an abused wife who seems to be smoking to death. There are no nice characters, and the public can only feel compassion or contempt. Local actors Tim Healy and Kevin Whateley both play against the villains, but the writing and direction of their characters are so one-dimensional that they have nothing but value for novelty. <br /> <br /> Chris Beattie and Greg McLane perform well in the two young protagonists. However, they are mixed, because they have the wrong accent. For anyone coming from the north-east, it is obvious that they both come from the Sunderland / Durham area, yet they are expected to believe they are natives of Newcastle. Like Geordie, I can assure you that the accents are not the same at all. Take the phrase "Let the poor boy talk". We say "Let the young man spy" while they say "piwer lad spiyk", with two distinctly different vowel sounds. This discrepancy creates a ridiculous double irony in a scene in the Sunderland football field, where the two boys are trying to mask the accents of Newcastle they don't have, and * pretend * to come from Sunderland - which they clearly do. In a kind comedy this kind of criticism could be seen as a stickler. However, the film's bleak tone makes it clear that writer / director Mark Herman points to gritty realism: it means that "close enough" is actually far away. <br /> <br /> I was hoping for humor and optimism from this movie and instead found old tired clich√©s. Tyneside is not a gray desert populated only by losers, and in telling us what it is, Herman should have known he would have caused offense. It's interesting to compare the film with the same "Little Voice" by the same director - also largely late and populated by one-dimensional characters, "Little Voice" has at least one talented heroine and not bask in misery to the same extent. I listened to "Belter" alongside "Billy Elliot" this year, but that movie is a much more pleasant and life-rich experience. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, I might just be too old, but having lived on Tyneside for 42 years, I've never heard anyone outside of this film use the expression "Purely Belter".
