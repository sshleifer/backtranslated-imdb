Actually I was planning to watch this movie when I noticed it in my TV guide, but after about 5 minutes the time is decidedly more precious than "Who's That Girl" could ever be worth. Describing how bad Madonna's acting is is impossible and the end result is one of the most annoying characters ever captured in the film. This shit is an insult to the movies and the intellect. Hardly ever! Vote for a film that I don't see from beginning to end, but in this case the first is impossible. 2/10
