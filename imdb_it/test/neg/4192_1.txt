This is the worst movie I've ever seen, as well as the worst I will probably NEVER see. I don't see the need to repeat what everyone else has said before, just be warned ... <br /> <br /> This is NOT one of those bad movies you think you want to see why you want to be able to do fun, it is simply BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. <br /> <br /> This film is the equivalent of having a "pet rock" as your friend. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait and wait for something to happen. Unfortunately, he never does. At least with a pet rock you knew what you were hunting for. Lion's Gate completely deceives on this bomb ... No ... this is a disaster. After watching this movie, you would have sworn that George W. Bush had his hands on the whole film of this film ... yes he is an idiot. <br /> <br /> Stay away, unless, of course, you want to see the worst movie of all time. It's probably like the Lion's Gate thought he'd make some money from this piece of tripe.
