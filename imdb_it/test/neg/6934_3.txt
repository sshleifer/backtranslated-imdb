The film scores 3 because he had the courage to be very different. It features an acting while you can hear their thoughts and desires! This is truly a strange film and an experience I will never forget. The only problem is that the experiment, although somewhat interesting, is generally rather boring and uninvolving. In fact, it's surprising that a Norma Shearer and Clark Gable film could be THIS boring! The film is based on a play by Eugene O'Neill and looks quite seasoned indeed. In fact, it would have been better to keep it as a theatrical production - it simply didn't translate to the big screen at all. <br /> <br /> So this movie is only recommended for tough cinemaniacs and who loves Gable movies so much just has to see all his movies!
