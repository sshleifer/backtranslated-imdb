"Ordinary Decent Criminal" is sad because obviously it is trying to be successful and, obviously, it obviously has no chance to do so apparently due to the absence of a clear sense of purpose. An abysmal failure in the funny Irish comedy with Spacey as a thief who loves to outsmart the cops and his competition by becoming a kind of folk hero in his mind, this movie manages to be slightly funny when he tries to be funny, slightly more boring when is trying to be interesting, and forget about sentimental or moving or engaging even if it takes shots at those pure qualities. "Ordinary Decent Criminal" has a clumsy script, a na√Øve direction, a workman's execution, a subtle story, a mediocre casting, a mediocre acting and in the end it loses itself and sinks into a quagmire of hopeless mediocrity. Move on to this. (D)
