I was forced to watch "Changi" last year in Australian 10th history. Looking around the class, both classes, all 40 students were almost asleep, all 40 heads on the table whispering to the person next to them. I refuse to believe it because I'm only 16, that my opinion doesn't matter, having studied World War II, not only did I feel embarrassed and ashamed to watch this piece of Australian trash television. I was freaked out by the frightening effort of this mini series applied to the use of film elements. The acting was poor, the script was very inaccurate and the score was scary. Please, don't watch this movie, it's partiality and very racist (to the Japanese).
