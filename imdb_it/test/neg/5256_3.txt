This film was highly recommended, but I'm not sure why. I'm not really Adam Sandler fans, except for the first 50 dates he moves away from his usual angry man routine. Damon Wayans is an undercover cop and Adam Sandler is the guy he pretended to be friends with for a year to be able to steal it. Of course Sandler is quite angry about this betrayal. Angry screaming cue and silly facials from the king of the variety. They end up on the run and of course they become friends again after a big misunderstanding (involving Sandler who shot Wayans in the lead - he survives so is Bulletproof). I must go on? You'll find out what happens if you look at it anyway. When our DVD player continued to take a break (hey it was $ 80 from the OK supermarket?) It was said that the player knew that the movie was boring and refused to play it.
