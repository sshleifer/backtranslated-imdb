I'm the kind of guy who loves hooded movies from New Jack City to Baby Boy to Killa Season, from grade to Hollywood. but this film was something different. I'm not hated and this movie was a bit funny. but some pieces were just weird. well, the acting was not going well, compared to the performance of Silkk The Shockers in Hot Boyz (quite good) and Ice-T in the new Jack and SVU (fantastic). the scene where Corrupt (Ice-T) kills the urge to be a Jamaican dude says something and turns on burning both Ice-T and the other, this kills the Jamaican, however Ice-T is unharmed, very similar to the other Ice the movie Urban Menace (which features both of these actors) is that the character of Snoops is supernatural, but after this there is nothing to suggest that Corrupt is like a demon. When MJ (Silkk) is first stabbed, but after that he fights normally and is stabbed in the thigh-WITH WITH BLOOD. and when MJ confesses to killing a policeman because the cop beat his friend, Benny was weird, Benny is not presented in this movie and the scene is not in the movie. it keeps the fact that Corrupt wants to kill MJ, but it still makes you scratch your head. wen Jody writes a letter to the character of Miss Jones explaining what happened to them after the words do not mention what happens to 2 other main characters MJ and Lisa. the film showed the horror and poverty of the ghetto - which plagues the lives of Latinos and Blacks in all its breadth - was a good part of the film, even if the film of the projects has been reused thousands of times. and the scene where Miles kills his brother Latino by crashing at full speed (not wearing a helmet) and meeting with my Latino brothers' car would have killed him. the film was similar to the Urban Menace movie and half of the actors were in both films and in the production team. it was ok tho. but I, being poor, love movies by hood, but if you don't like others like me, don't look at them. The only thing that saved me from going out is that it reminded me of the first movie I made that was made with 100 dollars, and my love for the genre. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel Purez
