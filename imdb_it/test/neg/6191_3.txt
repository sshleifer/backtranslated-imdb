Pepe le Moko, played by Charles Boyer, is a sort of international criminal mind sought in countries across Europe, and to remain free a lot of holes are made in the Casbah, a mysterious part of Algiers where even the police are reluctant to go, up to a senior officer he is sent from Paris to capture the Moko once and for all. For the Mokos, even though the Casbah allows them to stay out of police custody, it also becomes a kind of prison at the same time - a place where it cannot leave, because the moment it does, it knows it will be arrested. <br /> <br /> Boyer's performance was good and I can see why he was an Oscar nominee. Capture the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and at the same time very elegant. The film itself, unfortunately, was rather disappointing. A number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent, of which I will mention two. The first was the idea that the police would not enter the Casbah. This was clearly stated at the beginning of the film by the local commander, and yet the repeated references in the film suggest that the police actually entered the Casbah. So neither Commissioner Janvier's suggestion that the police would not come in, nor Inspector Slimane's statement (also a fairly good representation of Joseph Calleia) that they could enter the Casbah, but they didn't seem to make much sense. I also found it hard to believe that the Mokos - the hardened criminal mind that he was - could be quickly swept away by Gaby (Hedy Lamarr) to the point where he entertains the local population by singing love songs and then leaves the Casbah to find it, essentially to surrender. I understand the irony of the last scenes, of course, given that Pepe leaves the freedom of his prison (the Casbah) only to find true freedom in his capture (because he was shot and killed by the police). I just found it impossible to believe that someone like Le Moko would fall into a trap. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking for Boyer, and to a lesser extent Calleia, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. 3/10
