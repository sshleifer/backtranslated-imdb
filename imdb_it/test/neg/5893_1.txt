It was full of holes in the plot, inaccuracies (didn't the stopwatch stop for injured players or the loss of helmets in Texas football games?) And not so much redemption (So your father slaps you?), Do something right for a time and then he will love you and make it worth it). <br /> <br /> Either you make the film about a team and its search for a championship OR make a film about a player within a team and his personal struggle, but instead, this film tried to do all and approached more than a couple of meters. The book has probably shown the whole story much better; the film should have selected an element of the story and stuck with it. <br /> <br /> Instead, the film went from a character dialogue to a game flash and then to another dialogue character months later without really telling you who the people were or why they were important - the QB calls its own brother to take care of his mother - whatever happened with that? Why was the mother consistent at the end of the final game, does that mean she is no longer mad? His only redeeming quality was the soundtrack. Buy this and then watch the highlights of SportsCenter while Iggy Pop plays in the background.
