Shopping, sunny skies, beaches, boarding school for rich teens and perfectly happy finals. Welcome to the life of Zoey Brooks and her friends. Zoey Brooks is played by Jamie Lynn Spears, the self-proclaimed actress who got her fame by becoming the younger sister of international pop star Britney Spears. With his adorable blonde wig in season one and an attempt to hide his monotonous country accent, it is confirmed that Nickelodeon really went to dogs with nepotism. When Kristin Herrera, the actress who played Dana Cruz in season one, left the show, all hopes were won because she was the only decent actress. The female casting is a complete shame, but the male casting has potential for teenage media. If they continue to pursue Jamie Lynn Spears as the image of perfection, many people will have to lower their standards. Hopefully, they will soon discover that you can't make a career out of nothing. Jamie Lynn Spears is useless for acting, singing and anything else he tries for that downward spiral that calls for a career. No wonder why she is a self-proclaimed actress. Critics would surely proclaim it as something other than that.
