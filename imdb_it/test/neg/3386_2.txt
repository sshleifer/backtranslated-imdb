I've heard some good comments about this film as very gory and scary, but it's neither one nor the other. Obviously the writer wanted to make a scary horror film but at the same time inject adolescent comedy for the young target audience. Fear and comedy rarely give good results, the same goes for MONSTER MAN. <br /> <br /> Not very funny, neither scary nor overly funny on ANY other level. <br /> <br /> Carving out 39 years of age I saw my share of horror movies. I've seen good and terrible ones, but the crop of films released these days is so frighteningly mediocre that I get bored watching them. These days the acceptance of bad films like this is what really annoys me. Let's face it, they produced a lot of crap in the 70s, 80s and 90s but they were considered as such even then. Today they are considered as "good entertainment". - Bollock!
