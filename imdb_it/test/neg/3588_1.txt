The only reason for FC De Kampioenen's existence is its local popularity. It has caused this sitcom to function for over 15 years (and continues to count). <br /> <br /> He takes care of an amateur soccer team with the "amateur" accent. Each plot deals with the same topic: a misunderstanding that takes ridiculous (and predictable) proportions to be solved at the end. <br /> <br /> The show has been running for over 15 years and the production probably decided not to change a winning team. Which means the show has had minor changes over the years (plus a couple of replaced actors (almost all of them left alone instead of being thrown on the show)). Humor hasn't changed a bit over the years and was already outdated when it was first broadcast. <br /> <br /> I guess you have to be Flemish to get this, and over 60, to enjoy such an old-fashioned TV program like this.
