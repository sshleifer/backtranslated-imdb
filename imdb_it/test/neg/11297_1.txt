* Hannibal SPOILERS * Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is back ... for a film parody! He is now in Italy, appreciating our food (including people like Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini)), but returns to the United States for Clarice (Julianne Moore) and even scoring with a former victim, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman). <br /> <br /> Let me tell you, this film is not worth discussing with Silence Of The Lambs and Manhunter, because it is really, completely, absolutely, totally BAD. <br /> <br /> I mean, is the scene near the end with Ray Liotta's skull being opened and he forced to eat part of his skipped brain? WTF? So why was HELL all so annoying (including Clarice)? And why does history continue to go anywhere? I suppose this is the "teen" chapter of the Hannibal series; terrible, stupid, bloody for God's sake and totally embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Don't watch it, especially if you love any of Hannibal's other films (SOTL, Manhunter, Red Dragon, Hannibal Rising). <br /> <br /> Hannibal: 1/10.
