If this is the best of Finnish cinema, I would say that those big euros of taxes spent to support "culture" have been lost here in a horrible way. Paha Maa is the worst kind of example of trying to make a Finnish "European film" for a large audience. I'm sure they wanted it to be all at the same time state of the art, intelligent and moving. The result is disgusting. <br /> <br /> To make it short: - The story is pretentious, naive and not credible. The same goes for the characters. I can imagine them making a film about creating a film in which "everything would turn into t *** and people would be hurt and feel, you know, very badly inside, because even the Finns are so depressed and even themselves - estemare is so bad ", which leads us to the fact that ... <br /> <br /> - The film is full of clichés, especially of" Finnish mentality ". The way in which he treats people's problems and their causes could be obtained directly from a normal women's magazine or from a book on low-cost bull psychology. ("We feel so bad inside!") I'm sure they also looked at some Kaurismäki, to find out what it's people like about their films, they completely misunderstood it and invented a boring and depressing story about people going through all of them s ** t types for no other artistic purpose than perhaps social pornography. It is a shame that they have thrown Tolstoy here. It's just a sign of trying to be smart. And not to be. <br /> <br /> - I think the worst flaw, however, is the complete lack of vision and depth. The film is highly original. It is also frustrating to watch endless suffering and suffering without any real revelation. I can go through this kind of mind ** ck if the movie is funny or ends up being an elaborate joke, or better yet, something sublime like for example. von Trier's Breaking the Waves. There were none in Paha Maa. In reality, however, I started laughing at one point because the turn of events was again too predictable, exaggerated and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Who does this shit? And who likes it? I hope they pretend.
