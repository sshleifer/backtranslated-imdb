Shortly after the release of this film, Salman Khan delivered a 6-year imprisonment. (Read on to find out why I'm mentioning this.) <br /> <br /> And I breathed a sigh of relief. I wasn't happy that he got prison for something that was a celebrity, but I was happy, that meant that there were no more Salman Khan films, no more his histrionics and nothing more than an act of acting (read Overacting). <br /> <br /> This film made absolutely no sense. <br /> <br /> The scene in which the child belonging to a family makes a rocket that has been activated by the voice. According to the film's script, he chased anyone. But in the end he finds only Salman Khan Bare Chested. Well, that's what happened. <br /> <br /> The Rocked is activated in another stupid way and you must have a .001 IQ to believe it. Then he chases Salman Khan, who was on his jet skis and the chase continues unless he has finished with all the possible stunts he could show to a senseless audience. (As far as I'm concerned, all those people who gave this film 5 and more, unless they are paid to do so.) Another breathtaking, incredible scenario was at the end when all the arrangements on the wedding are done and Salman Khan with Govinda in Disguise arrives and interrupts the marriage with another of those highly unwanted songs. Later, even if everything is ready and ready a simple confession of govinda and Katrina Kaif to the father and to Bingo of Katina. It's all right and Govinda is getting married to Kartina .... <br /> <br /> This made me wonder if convincing was so easy because they didn't do it and they tortured us for so many hours and wasted my money . <br /> <br /> This film must be avoided and I don't even think it has a scene to watch. The plot is too disconnected with characters appearing nowhere and eventually disappear .. for ex Choota don ... What a waste of characters. <br /> <br /> After this film I made a promise that I would not watch Salman khan Film for the rest of my life unless an Oskar wins ... (hahahah ... which means I would never watch )
