At the beginning of the film, Ramgopal Verma says "Sarkar" is his tribute to The Godfather. This looks more like an insult. It pales terribly compared to the classic Coppola. Although no one expected Ramgopal Verma to fill Coppola's shoes, the film created many expectations and buzz. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan plays "Sarkar", a character who automatically draws instantaneous comparisons with Supreme Bal Thackeray of the Indian political party Shiv Sena. Abhishek Bachchan plays his son Shankar who returns from abroad and is involved in Sarkar's politics at home. Just like Al Pacino in the original Godfather. <br /> <br /> Like most Bollywood fares, accidents and characters are overtly simplistic and lacking in any kind of solid foundation. Quick calls and sudden announcements turn the film from one direction to another. Abishek brings in the clumsy politics of the Mumbai underworld, the connection of crime like a duck that takes water. Amithab Bachchan as Sarkar should look magnificent and powerful, he ends up looking old and clueless. Most of his acting is focused on constantly looking at different things around the film set - the actor in front of him, the floor or some other random direction. <br /> <br /> However, Kay Kay behaves extraordinarily well as the offended older son Vishnu. This is what Zakir Hussain does as Rashid, the Dubai smuggler who wants to set foot in Mumbai. This actor has an extraordinary presence on the screen and can send chills down your spine with the only way he looks. The moment you enter the screen, you want to run and hide it under the bed. <br /> <br /> Despite all its obvious flaws, the film did well at the box office. The buzz and the cast of the big stars obviously help. Even Verma manages to keep your interest even if moderately towards the next half of the film. He is actually doing a sequel to this, which I'm sure will be more than the same rate.
