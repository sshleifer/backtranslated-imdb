Could not agree more. The book is one of Dean Koontz's best novels and this film is a total parody. I saw about half of it then threw the ribbon in the basket in disgust! I have no idea what the idiot director was thinking of doing this piece of shit, but I'd rather hit the eyes with a sharp stick than watch this useless movie again! Everything about this movie is simply wrong. First the main character changed from a former marine to a high school KID. WHY??? According to the love of his life in the book he becomes his mother in the film! I bet Freud would have something to say about it! LOL. The dog is pretty cute and the best thing about the movie and completely marginalized by everyone else! Even a main character who helps them in the book betrays them in the film. There is really nothing good to say about the film except that at least it's relatively short at about an hour and a half. If someone hasn't seen the movie yet, do yourself a favor! READ THE BOOK! It is much better than this useless waste of time!
