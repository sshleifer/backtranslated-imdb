I mean, come on! Now my compatriots have started doing westerns! Is it not enough that our cinema is already disgusted? Now you need to infect movies in English with Polish and meaningless acting? Please stay away from this movie, don't waste your eyes. A 5 year old child could make a film that makes more sense. I come from Poland and I am ashamed that this title can actually be looked at by you. Please, I beg you, I DO NOT watch this movie and, if you do, DO NOT judge Polish and Polish films based on what you see there. We've had some good films in our story and we've had bad ones but this - it's nothing worse than I've seen in my whole life. Keep away!!!
