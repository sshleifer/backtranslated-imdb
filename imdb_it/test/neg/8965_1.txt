This film is really incredible, in every sense. I couldn't believe what I was seeing and listening to, and I didn't believe it anyway. Hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but it was ridiculous. Being a hillbilly myself, I know how it should sound, and it's not the Kate's Back Bay accent. The only thing I found more amusing was the fact that the guy who played Charlie Chan so many times, Sydney Toler, was chosen as another of the hillbillies, with an accent to match. Maybe it was a joke, come to think of it. I can't think of any other reason for such a special casting. Well, maybe this. I noticed that Natalie Schaefer, Lovey Howell on Gilligan's Island, appeared in this Broadway play. Can you imagine which part could have played?
