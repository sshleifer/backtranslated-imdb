The director infuses this film with false depth by repeating a gimmick throughout the film. EVERY single shot in this film is 3 times longer than it should be. You could easily cut out 1.5 hours of this distressingly long 2.5-hour movie without eliminating: a word of dialogue, an image, an event or some movement. <br /> <br /> This was one of the most free films I have ever seen. The other reviewers have called it pretentious, which is an understatement. Humanity is a pseudo-intellectual garbage designed to be anti-Hollywood, so the Cannes judges can assert their independence from the Oscars. <br /> <br /> The author of IMDb states: "Unlike Hollywood movies - which usually force the audience into overdrive - this forces the public to slow down and look at some of the most miniscule and trivial features of life in great detail ". You should be catatonic to look at some of these images for so long and move slowly around these characters. This is not real life unless you are heavily medicated. <br /> <br /> Finally, I heard that Schott√©'s portrait was a sad rip-off of Peter Sellers's masterful "Peter Chauncey". Use the same facial expressions and positions. It even has gardens! In many respects there are parallels between these two films. The main difference is that "Being There" moves and is not based on shocks and tricks to create a meaningful experience while questioning various things we take for granted in life.
