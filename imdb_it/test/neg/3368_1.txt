Please, if you're thinking of renting this movie, don't do it. If you are thinking of watching a couple of downloaded clips, don't do it. If I had my way, no one would ever have to read this summary. <br /> <br /> The acting, despite being one of the highest points in the film, was still pathetic. The manager was probably a sadist. The witty liners were something you would expect from a highly paid, anti-social 7-year-old eating chips for breakfast for breakfast. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is that it tries to be a movie like "Evil Dead 2" (don't associate these 2 films in any case) as it's so ugly that it's funny. But he also tries to be fun at the same time, and fails so overwhelmingly in doing so, that your sense of humor is left too paralyzed to do anything, but unleashes your vomit reflex in a tool to save himself. <br /> <I could go on a lot more, describing how horrible it really was, but I think it would deprive me of my will to live just to keep thinking about it. If you need me, I'll be trying to get myself boiled so I can feel clean again ...
