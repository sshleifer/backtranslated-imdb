This film was horrible, simple and simple! The animation scenes had absolutely terrible graphics. It was VERY clear to see that this movie had about the budget of my shopping bill !! The acting was just as bad .. I saw better acting in pornographic films. I would love the time and twenty minutes of my life. Actually, I registered on IMDb just to avoid other people being sucked in to watch it like I did. Don't get me wrong though, I love science fiction movies! This seemed more like the intro of a video game :( I'm glad I spent just one dollar to see this! The plot reminded me of the pitch black film, A prisoner on a ship in outer space flees. Goodness ... what We'll do it ??? I wouldn't even let this play against the background of my house while I was cleaning! In conclusion, here you can do better.
