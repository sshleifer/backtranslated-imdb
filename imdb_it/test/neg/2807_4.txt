As mentioned earlier in other comments, the main problem of the NVA is that it cannot decide what it wants to be, a slap of the cheapest type or an honest parody of the East German army. There are a couple of moments that are quite moving, for example when one of the recruits returns from Schwedt's army prison with a completely destroyed personality. But in the end, Leander Hau√ümann focuses on childish humor. No wonder the film failed at the German box office because historically it is not true of the real situation in those training camps and led by an actor who unfortunately is not able to give a nuanced performance. <br /> <br /> However, there is the photographic work of Frank Griebe who - as always - does a great job. If it hadn't been for his beautiful images I would have judged the film much worse.
