This film must be ranked there with Ed Wood's films. A terrible script and a bad and bad acting. <br /> <br /> A quarrel with machine guns in front of the windows; minutes pass before someone gets hit and nobody has a cover - a window never breaks. You would think that after such a fireman the big U-Haul truck could be riddled - not a scratch. <br /> <br /> Make CIA agents and government contractors = scream = Top secret information in a standing cocktail celebrates with hundreds of people around. <br /> <br /> There is no actor you care about; all are superficial and fundamentally unlikely. <br /> <br /> A 747 linked to Hawaii flies from Los Angeles and crashes twenty minutes later in the Pacific "... in 100 feet of water ...". Little time passes when the hostess announces to the other five passengers that only two hours of air remain; on a 747? <br /> <br /> The next day the rescue teams show up and surprisingly the six passengers are still alive. <br /> <br /> A film that starts out mediocre and goes from bad to worse. <br /> <br />
