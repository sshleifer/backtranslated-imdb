B. Kennedy tried to make a sequel by exaggerating and amplifying a gargantuan left-wing western (not left-wing like the sequel to G. Kennedy, which came after this). <br /> <br /> Is this the worst film of the two sequels ?? very ugly. It's a slap. B. Kennedy made the amplification ?? but without having the genius for that. Hundreds of peons, hundreds of Mexican messengers, hundreds of women, a desert, arid landscapes, a bigger storm. <br /> <br /> Everything in this clumsy sequel, funny only in a strange way, is false. <br /> <br /> The film itself is very ugly. Brynner, who did the best part of the first film, doesn't look good at all in this. <br /> <br /> Rey plays a priest; will be a political leader, Quintero, in the next sequel to the franchise. <br /> <br /> It is true that when you have so many characters you may not need a very interesting storyline; sometimes. For example, Brynner meets McQueen; then they choose other "cronies"; or, B. Spencer meets Coburn; etc. It's fun to see where and how they will meet the rest of the crew, etc. But you need at least these different characters. Unfortunately, Burt Kennedy's episode is not very good. <br /> <br /> Return of the Seven (1966) begins with a bullfight. Vin and Chris meet there; decide to save the third survivor of the original Magnificents ?? Chico, which belongs to a huge group of 300 peons kidnapped by Mexican bandits. We discover the name of Chico's lovely wife, she is Petra. Should Chris set up a small army again ?? and here we have a discussion of Dozzina Sporca ?? Chris chooses his men from the convicts. Another member of the commando is a womanizer, who will take care of the wives left without a husband. Sexual humor is particularly unpleasant and unpleasant in this film. He tries to look smart and spicy; it is simply rough, stupid and gross. <br /> <br /> The choice of members of the small army was one of the greatest joys of McQueen's film. Unfortunately, in the first sequel there is the most memorable of the three crews gathered together under the name of the Magnificent Seven. <br /> <br /> Robert Fuller makes a terrible "Vin", Oates is the whitening womanizer. <br /> <br /> In this fake gigantic attempt, a Mexican revolutionary leader has a gigantic plan, kidnaps 300 peons and uses them to build a village and a church in the memory of his lost sons. (Needless to say, this crazy Mexican revolutionary is not up to the role of Wallach in the first film.) B. Kennedy bets exclusively on the field and on the best things: ugly landscapes, a thunderstorm, a gigantic flash, a desert. A huge battle between the emancipated pei and the revolutionary vaqueros. Obviously, Return of the Seven (1966) has completely abandoned the common sense of McQueen's film. <br /> <br /> What is particularly shocking is that this sequel arrived fairly quickly after the original film, yet everything has changed in the meantime the way of doing westerns. <br /> <br /> Both sequels seem strange.
