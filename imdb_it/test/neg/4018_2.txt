When you're used to Lana Turner in the Postman Always Rings Twice, and compare it to this low budget, low talent, low quality movie, well, I'm just embarrassed for Ida Lupino "singing" (more like talking) and non-piano playing scenes. When the first non-singing scene started and all the people stared at it flat, I was sure they would all roll their eyes and start going off or at least talking to each other (Stink, let's get out of here). Actors are flat: emotions deflate. And Ida is a genuine spoiled bi-otch - only a 100% turnoff. This was how Betty Boop on conscious sedation encounters a gas stationer nowhere in the US. The story was flat, the music was flat, the acting was flat, his chest was ... it didn't matter. I felt sad for the rest of the actors. Perhaps if the right actress had been given the main role, and the male actors had more emotions, then the film could have had a chance. Sorry for offending those of you who thought it was out of this world. I wouldn't mind if he stayed out of this world.
