My father insisted that I should watch this movie with him and I'm sorry I wasted my time watching - I want an hour and a half! The little "funny" movie is about Elder Don Ameche who lives with his son, Tom Selleck. It turns out that Ameche is not only "forgetful" as he was told, but he has dementia (it seems very similar to Alzheimer's). And, since dad is so often "out for lunch", he runs into so many problems again and again - almost like the adorable BABY'S DAY OUT tyke. The problem, however, is that you know that BABY'S DAY OUT is all fantasy and that the child will be fine. Also, you're not laughing at the child for a deformity or illness. But, in this case, you're encouraged to laugh at a man who is slowly losing his mind - and where is the humor in this ?! If this film had been more successful, then the producers would have made movies having fun or people with cerebral palsy or a meat-eating virus?!?! There are many people who should have felt ashamed for making this film.
