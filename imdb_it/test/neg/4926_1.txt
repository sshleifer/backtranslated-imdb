2 May: someone clicked on 11 NO and then proceeded to make 15 more on my previous 15 comments: almost as funny as this turkey! <br /> <br /> May 1: <br /> <br /> As I write this, I'm still very impressed by what must be the funniest thriller I've ever seen. I have an important case of giggles, but I'll try to calm you down. (It's a little hard to write when the nose spills and the mouth sporadically ejects saliva on the keyboard.) A couple of young women who have just returned from a vacation take a ride on a shuttle bus. A couple of young guys join them. But the bus is not really a taxi service: it is a vehicle of kidnapping. (Don't giggle!) His driver was part of an organized "white slavery" gang that kidnaps young women from airports, and they've been doing it for five years. (Don't laugh.) Five years at SAME airport, without the police or even the FBI noticing. (No giggle, please.) Apparently, dozens of women disappear in the same place for years and years - yet no one notices a trend. Is the FBI incompetent? The world of "Shuttle" seems to be composed of three types of people: easy interceptable captors, stupid / comatose / invisible FBI agents and omnipotent psychotic gangsters (who hate sexy blonds with a tattooed back). <br /> <br /> the driver was barely on this mission alone, yet he did it for - I repeat - FIVE years, without being killed or lost one of his limbs. (Stop laughing ...) Did I mention that the driver is immortal? Should I talk about it? We all know that psychopaths have immortal DNA. You can stab them, bounce them repeatedly against the walls of a bus, gently caress them with a hammer, plant nine-inch nails in their ears ... Hell, you could stick a grenade in the mouth of the Hollywood psychopath, and he'd still run away with just small scratches. No, the driver is not Satan or even a minor demon, but just a normal Hollywood psychopath with better survival skills than the biggest and meanest cockroach of the sewers. <br /> <br /> The basic plot: a boy loses all his fingers to one side in a stupid scene. (A magic bus that reads and obeys the mind!) Passengers try to escape. They fail. They hurt themselves. They are sullen. They fight. They try to escape. They fail. They hurt themselves. They fight. They try to escape. They fail. They hurt themselves. They try to escape. They fail. They try to escape. The robbers manage to snatch the driver's gun! Alas, they do not kill him because the Pacifism of the Golden Hollywood Gandhi Rule does not allow him to do so. (No giggle.) One of the other passengers appears to be part of the gang! (Stop laughing.) He is played by an actor who studied in Rob Zombie / John Travolta School Of Over-Acting and Silly Mugging. Threatens rape. Later, one of the girls hit him with a crowbar on his head, a dozen times ... very difficult. Only a few seconds later he regains consciousness. Yes, survive. (Immortal, remember?) He is killed a little later. (I have no idea how, though! It's not supposed to be musty.) The kidnapees argue. They try to escape. One of them runs away! Alas, psychopaths are all too alike in their powers to not re-capture their prey. The game starts all over again: passengers try to escape. They fail. They are sullen. They fix the void. They hurt themselves. They try to escape. They fail. They get hurt ... <br /> <br /> You have the picture. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I think a drugged, heavily disoriented, drunken snail would have easily escaped these kidnappers. There were so many opportunities. At some point these bumbling psychoses (remember: FIVE years!) Even send one of the kidnape to a grocery store! Leave a message to the police. Anyway, yes ... you guessed it: this fake fairytale US city has no police. <br /> <br /> And just as you thought the film could not be more stupid - not even if Luc Besson and Brian De Palma joined forces to help out with the script - it does. The girls are kidnapped to be sent to some remote island (?), And this is achieved by transporting them as goods. Apparently, this fictitious America has neither FBI, nor police, nor border customs. However he has immortal criminals with more luck than twenty lottery winners. A blonde had a billionth chance to kill the driver, yet she failed. How come the victims of these silent thrillers NEVER try to defeat their immortal opponents once they've thrown them on the floor and injured? I think I answered it myself: they are immortal! So why bother trying, he must have thought ... <br /> <br /> So, because one blond was killed in gas and the other was boxed and sent alive (complete with a litter box for cats and the funniest Demi Moore primary school photos)? Could it be the tattoo? I think they killed the nicer one, but it's just me. Was his tattoo ugly? <br /> <br /> Could it be that I don't care? Why should I look for logic in a film made by imbeciles (for imbeciles)? Also, how can I think well when I'm laughing so hard half the time ?! <br /> <br /> Of course, being a 21st century horror / thriller, the mobile phone does not work ... Perhaps this invincible gang controls not only the FBI, the police and customs, but also the satellites in the space. <br /> <br /> Do I have to explain it? There are much easier ways to kidnap people. And the much smarter people who should make movies. Give an idiot a camera and he will lay an egg every time ... This kind of answers is the eternal riddle he came before: the egg or the director with the bird's brain.
