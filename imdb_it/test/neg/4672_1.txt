I like action movies. I have a softspot for "B" gestures with wrong dialogues and wooden acting. So, I'm destroying my brain to come up with one of my guilty pleasures that was worse than this blockbuster. I can't. You would be forced to put together a bigger piece of cr * p of this vehicle Bruce Willis. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is the story (and I use this term freely) of a "Super-Drillers" team "Flying to destroy an asteroid before it destroys the Earth. Realistic? Not really. But who cares "It's an action movie. I'm not blasting the premises. <br /> <br /> Minor spoilers: <br /> <br /> The film begins with a couple of scenes designed to introduce the threat and the characters. Bruce Willis is the leader of the team that lasts from nails and spends his first piece of time on the screen chasing Ben Affleck with a gun for the unforgivable act of sleeping with his daughter.For some reason, that didn't make me laugh. It was forced, like everything in this movie. <br /> <br /> The team is called into question because they are the only people in the world who can drill the asteroid.Okay, I'm ready to accept this premise if we leads to action - the alleged meat of the film, other attempts at humor, with each character coming out for do something crazy and nutty before exploding. Again, lame. In the end, they take off. This is where the movie really upset me. They come to the rock and get to work. You would believe it, nothing works and everything has a suspense countdown !!! Whoah! Ten, nine, eight ... one - Oh, surprise surprise we saved the day again !! <br /> <br /> It didn't even make me start the camera jerky. When I saw him in the theater I thought I was going to get sick. I can only assume that they were trying to cover up the huge holes left by the insipid exhibits by cutting away at a different pitch every few seconds (and this from someone who grew up on MTV - Mr Brief brief attention himself). <br /> <br /> Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse ... wait - there's a fabricated tear-down ending that was attacked so as to make the rest of the movie a virtual Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Summary: The jokes were not funny. The plot - well, I said I'd let it go. The acting was very bad. Really bad. Even Billy Bob couldn't get past the script, which was worse. Camerawork - again, badly. (I didn't even mention the stupidest love scene in the history of cinema - think of animal crackers). <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10. (I'm giving Steve Buscemi half a point, who makes me smile against my will and another half point for the times I was able to look pretty Liv Tyler and trying to ignore his acting) This is by far the worst movie I saw at the theater. .. never.
