Asia Argento is a sexy and beautiful woman who likes to run naked which is not a bad thing in itself, but, when her character talks about all the guys she has served, and to see her with Michael Madsen and an Asian boy in the present of film, it made me feel like I needed a condom for my eyes to watch this movie, as if a disease was going to rub me or something. <br /> <br /> The film looked like it was going for a love triangle / drama / action / ??? plot, seemed to just go anywhere and anywhere at the same time. The acting was great, the plot, not so great. The director must at least choose a genre and practice, practice, practice, before trying to do something as complicated as this, because obviously they are not very good.
