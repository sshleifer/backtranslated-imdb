I wish it were "Last Dumb Thriller". But thrillers are like that. They are like children: numerous, illogical and often annoying. They desperately want to be taken seriously, but what is there to take seriously about a child's behavior or a thriller plot? Having seen this particular child - I mean ... the thriller - I understand why the reviewers call it "a hitchcockian thriller"; they could also have called it "idiot" because that's what "hitchcockian" means in the film dictionary (look for it, if you don't believe me). Even the soundtrack of the old school Hollywood is a mistake: it doesn't fit in a movie from the 70s and makes it look fake. Also, how dare they steal De Palma's idea of ​​stealing from Hitchcock ?! History is absurd. Scheider's wife is killed and her killers are never a problem. Instead, his former employers first follow him and later decide to kill him. Why do they decide to kill him? No explanation. Perhaps because the FBI is an obscure and obscure organization ("X-Files") that is very happy to bring down its former employees for pension fund reasons. Or maybe it's because it's fashionable to want to kill Scheider in this film; everyone seems to follow him. And while the poor unconscious spectator is trying to understand the mystery by assuming logically that there is a greater conspiracy, in reality the murderer is ... Janet Margolin! Yes, the woman occupies Scheider's quarters; what he briefly mentioned was "depraved". Why does he go after Scheider just when his wife was murdered and feels paranoid - and followed by his former employers - and not a few years before or a few years after his wife's murder? A pure hitchcockian (look for it again in the dictionary, in case you forgot what it means) coincidence. And what do you think of that brilliant motive of her ...! Her grandmother was forced to prostitute herself when she was a 15-year-old virgin just landed in New York, and then seized by a group of horny Jewish men, one of whom - tah-dah! - is Scheider's grandfather. As a result, Margolin played a prostitute in her spare time (among other things) to kill all the descendants of the men who so cruelly disfigured her virginal grandmother. How hitchcockian (look for it) is that? The finale then shamelessly parades the Mount Rushmore scene from "North By Northwest", except that the love interest is a killer and she is not saved. <br /> <br /> The film also offers some doubts / off-kilt dialogue and some not-so-great acting. Check out the foolish and obvious way in which Napier follows Scheider to the cemetery. Let's not forget that the legendary Napier plot stretches out towards the jacket and holds the hand very suspicious - but it wasn't a gun! How brilliant! Napier in the tower: now there is another set of illogical behavioral patterns. J. Demme was, is, and will always be a director without style, without style, and the man who directed "Philadelphia". Let's give him another Oscar!
