When The Spirits Within came out, all you heard from Final Fantasy fans was how awful the movie was because it didn't look like Final Fantasy. This is a different story, for better or for worse. Family settings, characters, music, history and the most important action scenes should thrill fans of the original game. The problem is that it is not really a good movie in its own right. <br /> <br /> Direction during combat scenes is often sloppy, changing the corners of the camera ridiculously quickly in an attempt to make the action more frenetic, but only serves to make the scenes confusing and confusing. <br /> <br /> The CG itself is exceptional, but I can't say it's the best I've ever seen since Spirits Within had much more details on the characters, although I have to admit that the Advent Children characters moved much more naturally. <br /> <br /> The plot is practically a black hole. It is a huge deus ex machina designed exclusively to bring Sephiroth back for a final fight. Old characters reappear, but they have no other purpose than to please the fans. The development of the character is non-existent and the film does absolutely nothing to solve one of the threads of the plot left hanging after the end of the game. But it's full of clean-looking fighting scenes with spells, spells and limits, which is probably what the fans wanted anyway. <br /> <br /> In the end, Advent Children is a very flashy, but totally mindless action film that serves more as a side story for Final Fantasy VII than a real sequel. <br /> <br /> By the way, don't think about hurting my feelings by voting Not Useful. It makes me feel just superior knowing that fans / fans resent my objectivity so much.
