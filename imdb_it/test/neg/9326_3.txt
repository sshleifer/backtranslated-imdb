Once again, I was deceived by seemingly intelligent reviews that made seemingly intelligent comments about an obviously lousy movie. I actually put on my shoes, went into my car, burned expensive petrol and went to the nearest rental site AFTER reading the reviews and paid the $ 4 required and changed the rent for this thing. I'm telling you, this is not worth the tiny kilo-calories spent to raise your index finger to change channels on a TV remote control. <br /> <br /> I gave him a few more minutes after seeing all the telltale signs of a pile of purebred dogs. These presented as clinical symptoms of a director who is a. going senile o, b. he is only marginally interested in the film he is obliged to create. I've seen a similar deterioration with the series of ridiculous caricatures of John Carpenter in recent years. <br /> <br /> Here are a couple of scenes as incriminating evidence. The priest is having a disturbing dream ... presumably an omen of malice coming from when it seems that hell has decided to open the archaeological element that houses the demon. The dream is a silly collage of disconnected images right outside the Twilight Zone movie. A hull ticking through the darkness of the scape of the dream that implies, what ?, the unfathomable mystery of Time? ... a big deal! A disembodied head, painted in demonic traits with grocery store quality Halloween makeup, darts back and forth in a frantic frenzy. Every time I see this effect, a big and big rip from Jacob's Ladder, it pisses me off. This in itself discriminates a film almost instantly. <br /> <br /> The entire accumulation of the archaeological excavation is in itself ridiculous. Everything is so obvious ... so tired and overwhelmed ... the only possible answer is boredom. At some point in the excavation, the priest comments that he has found the statues of the Angels that surround a sarcophagus ... they are all pointing towards the crypt with their weapons. He asks himself "Look at these surrounding statues ... It is as if they were holding something ... something!" This should create tension ... critical mass ... but it doesn't even come close! How can there be suspense if you treat the public like a bunch of morons that have to EXPLAIN the suspense as you go along. The images are too exploited in the first place, but the added comments only add insult to injury in my opinion. Shortly after, the tomb is "decorated" with the remains of the soldiers placed there to guard the main atrium (another shameless shameless of The Keep, btw). Who, to shout loudly, did the make-up effects for this movie ??! The blood actually had that rosy quality that could be seen in the Tromaville movies of the 1970s. At this point I almost convinced myself that they simply forgot about make-up and had to go to Wal-Mart in the interest of time and money. <br /> <br /> DO NOT listen to enthusiastic comments about this! I will keep a suspicious eye also on Schrader. Looks like it might be time to hang up his gloves. Perhaps a close friend will offer a gentle admonition to quit while there is still dignity in memory of past films.
