PLEASE?! If it's technology and what man does to kill others and ourselves, I think I missed his point. Because I came out feeling that Reggio was relying on the footage of the cold war space age and had NOTHING again to add to the dialogue about technology fears. Paths of 1 and 0, which denote technology, mathematics and science - DONE that. Does anyone out there see The Matrix? And studies on the movement of people on the move? Have you ever heard of Edward Muybridge? At least he uses exact clips of Muybridge's photographs of human movement studies. <br /> <br /> This movie was derived, and the score is just enough for Philip Glass to sound like EVERYTHING he did in the last 10 years ... Avoid this movie at ALL costs !!
