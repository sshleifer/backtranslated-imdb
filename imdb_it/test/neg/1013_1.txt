Deanna Troi naked! <br /> <br /> Richie Chuck's brother (from "Happy Days") with a reverse mohawk! <br /> <br /> Death Wish 3 has all this and more, including a clever scene where the character of Chuck Bronson installs a device similar to a mouse trap that undermines a punk when he opens the window. <br /> <br /> Chuck also places a board with a pile of nails on the floor next to another window and smiles when he returns and sees prints of blood taking away. <br /> <br /> All I can say about Death Wish 3 is that it's one of the most "serious", most incomprehensible movies I've ever seen - loaded to the hilt with chaos, and almost zero police response, despite the use of military weapons to mow punk from the score. <br /> <br /> As I understand it, Bronson disowned this movie, but he happily cashed the check from Golan Globus. <br /> <br /> If you like quality movies, avoid this, but if you are looking for a cheap type of "Jackass" thrill, take a look.
