I don't mind a bit of adult humor, but this feature was definitely dirty. The first 10 minutes consisted of Pryor cursing a boy who took photographs, followed by my even more swear words. I don't know what happened in that last 5 minutes because I left. After seeing it, I never looked at Richard Pryor the same way again. And to think that in reality he continued to host a show for children. <br /> <br /> If bad words and tasteless, dirty and unpleasant jokes make you laugh, then you'll probably like it. But if you're an "old-fashioned" guy, then don't worry.
