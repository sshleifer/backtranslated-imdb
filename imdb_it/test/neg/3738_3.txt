Famous singers have always had trouble penetrating movies (cinema is littered with failed attempts), and one can continue to speculate on why John Mellencamp never became a great actor. Instead of taking small parts in sincere projects, Mellencamp dives into the title role in "Falling From Grace", which he also directed, and the results are just as inconvenient and inconvenient as that title. The story of a famous singer who returns to his hometown among the sticks, opening old family wounds, boasts a script by Larry McMurtry, but the meandering film does not proceed anywhere slowly. The supporting cast is decent, including Kay Lenz (which is always nice to see), Mariel Hemingway and Claude Akins (who share the one very strong scene in the picture). As for John's acting, he doesn't seem particularly comfortable, despite the apparent efforts to make him look at home; he seems to be closing the camera most of the time and never connects with the public immediately. * 1/2 from ****
