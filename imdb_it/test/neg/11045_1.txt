Please don't blame Korea for this bad movie. I'm in Korea (please excuse the bad English). It saddens me to see these films that make Korea seem obsessed with blood and sex. It saddens me even more to see animal killings and hear Americans say that this is Korea. We don't eat live animals !! So please stop excusing the movie for his crime by saying it's culture! There are scenes with the man who eats live animals and non-Koreans think it's normal. No, it's disgusting for us too. The director is a misfit, a sick individual obsessed with murder and sex with family members. I wish America and France would stop glorifying this evil man who is ridiculous in his own country. Please watch any other film from Korea, which will give you an idea of ​​how truly artistic we are. This movie is rubbish.
