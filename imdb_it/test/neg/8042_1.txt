Schieder delivers a semi-credible part as President of the United States with Maria Conchita Alonzo as vice president. The film sucks. with so many holes in the plot it is surprising that they have glued it to the film on which it was shot. Relegated to HBO late night hours, this film is not worth seeing. 10 minutes in it, you're wondering why it was written. 40 minutes, you're wondering why you're watching it. Save the effort and watch a new version of Hee Haw or something. Something is better than this clunker.
