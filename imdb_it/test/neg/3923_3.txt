It is said that there are some people out there who actually ADMIRE the Monogram movies. Well - why not? Monogram Studios lived with a sort of basic Cost Plus; cost, more than enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of robust muscat every now and then. Sure, they're cheap. But let's face it: they are rough, fast, Philistine, vulgar, but hilarious. They have no claim. They are designed to divert the audience to the bottom of a double bill for about an hour. What if John Wayne galloped across the Wild West along a road lined with telephone poles? This is not art, it is entertainment. <br /> <br /> Take this movie, "Flight to Mars". At the beginning, when we meet the characters for the first time, a man could suddenly introduce his partner, avoiding any boring subtlety: "Professor, this is my girlfriend and assistant, who is a missile scientist and a beautiful woman. but he is more and more impatient with me because I am always taken by my scientific work, perhaps you could steal it from me, marry it, give it to the children and the picket home I crave, if necessary I will die on this journey to see its dreams come true. like a little rough. "Save a lot of time writing and shooting, don't you? This is what people mean when they say a narrative is "fast". (This was shot in five days). Why should we mention these things? I mean, what the hell is this, a cheap science fiction movie or Henry James? In reality this is a particularly well-financed example of a Monogram movie. It is in color, first of all. "Cinecolor" to be precise. (You can say it's not another "color" you would recognize.) And look at the cast. The female lead can be eliminated, as usual with Monogram, but the male leads are certainly up there on the list B. Cameron Mitchell is the reporter, yet he managed to become the male protagonist, who, come to think of it, never did it really. And Arthur Franz as the chief pipe smoker scientist, the pride of Perth Amboy, New Jersey. And - for science fiction fans - how about THIS pair of aces: both Morris Ankrum and John Litel! There is really not much sense in describing the plot in detail. The five crew members crash into Mars where they find an underground civilization inhabited by organisms whose evolution was isomorphic with ours, up to five fingers and skinny girls in short skirts. And they learned English from listening to our broadcasts. American broadcasts, that is, judging from their speech. They are led by a sinister cabal that attempts to hijack the spaceship, build many imitations and colonize the earth. They can't. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not very special. The men go around a couple of spare parts, wearing black costumes with stylized flashes that open on the chest and scarlet hoods that swell behind them. Their names consist exclusively of English phonemes - Alzar, Terris, Ikron. The Martian ludome that falls in love with Arthur Franz is called Alita, with an appendix of Indo-European diminutive, and he already knows what kisses are. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found it as snappy as it should have been, but also boring. The story is that of any serial Buck Rogers of the 1930s. Once the Terrans and the Martians meet and it is established that they have a common language, and that the Martians have a sinister program, it is so. In two hours, even an indifferent screenwriter could turn it into a story of Nazi spies in World War II. The plot is made by numbers, the dialog box has no spark, the acting is pedestrian. <br /> <br /> However, fans of Monogram productions should enjoy it. After all, Jean-Luc Goddard, the French opposite egch, dedicated "A Bout de Souffl√©" to Monogram, so they may not have been so bad.
