The original "Psycho" (1960) is widely regarded as the best work by Alfred Hitchcock and certainly, in my opinion, is one of the best films of all time. The choice to film a film shot from a remake is therefore a bit disconcerting. <br /> <br /> The cast in the original was impeccable, so the cast of this remake had a lot to live on. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates was not a good choice for leadership. It's too beautiful and not as convincing as Bates. I can imagine actors like Mark Wahlberg or John Turturro doing a much better job in the role. Anne Heche as Marion Crane does a worthy job, but continues to compare her mentally with Janet Leigh. Julianne Moore is a much better actress than the one she shows here and Viggio Mortenson simply walks through her role. The best of this new cast is William H. Macy as a private investigator. <br /> <br /> Although director Gus Van Sant has an acceptable job, he can't create the suspense like Hitchcock. And why did he change the scene in the basement of the house? In the original, the atmosphere is dark, damp and closed, while in this version, it takes place in a bright environment like a laboratory. And I think the black and white photography of the original has a distinct advantage over the color version. <br /> <br /> Perhaps another flaw could be that many viewers have seen the original and know what will happen and when. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if it's not broken, don't fix it. <br /> <br />
