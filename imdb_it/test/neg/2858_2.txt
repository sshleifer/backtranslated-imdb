I was really disappointed after seeing Pinocchio's Revenge the other night. I had a good inclination that would have been a bad thing, but I didn't think it would be as bad as it turned out. A wooden puppet of a murdered boy falls into the hands of the lawyer's eight-year-old daughter. From there, it is a murderous journey for anyone who gets in the way between the puppet and the child. We've already seen films like this, such as the Child's Play series, which is still much better. However, it was nice to see actors like James W. Quinn and Todd Allen. Both worked first with Kevin Tenney. In any case, I encourage viewers to take a look at "Night Of The Demons" and the original "Witchboard". These are titles that tend to bring out the best in Kevin S. Tenney.
