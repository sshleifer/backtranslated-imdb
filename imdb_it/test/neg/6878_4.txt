I never intended to see Venom, but I took it on the cable. It has good elements. Louisiana's swampy atmosphere for one, something we will unfortunately not see in movies due to Hurricane Katrina. It is based on an interesting concept, a normal man full of evil spirits. His confrontation with his son could have been interesting, as was much of the film. But as it tends to happen in Hollywood, an interesting idea goes down in a familiar direction: <br /> <br /> Eliminate all the characters except the good girl, starting with the black guys. I'm a fan of Agnes Bruckner, but the other characters, the aforementioned son of the villain, CeCe who must become a voodoo priestess, are more interesting. And for the love of God, only once would I like to see the virgin killed. We all like the easy girl, why can't she live? In this case it was Bijou Phillips, and we love it. <br /> <br /> The ending made no sense considering what had been established about the invincibility of the villain. All the carnage and atmosphere, and it leads to nothing.
