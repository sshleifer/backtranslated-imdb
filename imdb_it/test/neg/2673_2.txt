This film is very bad. In fact, the only reason I gave a 2 rather than a 1 is because it made me laugh. Without giving anything, a man's head actually explodes in this film. He was so pathetic, I laughed. I don't think the scene was meant to be fun but it doesn't make sense. Complete nonsense. The original Halloween is such a beautiful film, it's a pity they had to go and make a stinker like that.
