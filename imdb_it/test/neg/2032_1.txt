This was the most uninteresting horror film I've seen to date. The premise is clearly forgotten after about 1 minute. The acting is terrible. The scariest thing about this movie is when the two guys kiss, suck! What did the film festival judges think when they gave this junk a "best film" notation? The only reason I didn't shoot this film was to see what NOT to do as a director, and if the subtle storyline could really continue as it was. I was not disappointed by this last idea. There was not even a bit of nudity or blood to keep the children interested! Also, I thought it was awful to use about 3 minutes of "Resident Evil 2" in the movie ... Should it be filler? because it was the most appealing and interesting part of the film.
