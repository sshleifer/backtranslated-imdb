Because I would never have seen this movie until the end. Although there are some, but not many, funny moments in this film, I can't understand more than 15% (the fictional English couple in the included 3rd story) of what people were saying. Three stories, none with a real point, with only some of the most miserable and lifeless people I could have imagined and a load of vulgar language. He didn't find it funny, he didn't find it funny, he didn't find any sense. 4/10
