I recently saw this movie on The Sundance Channel and it interested me from the start. However, it seems like it will always take forever where it wants to go and in the end, I felt a little cheated. In a nutshell, Noble Willingham (of Walker, Texas Ranger Hunger) plays a boat salesman who starts being harassed by telephone by a man who claims to be his son. According to the mysterious caller, Willingham has a small dark and dirty secret that hits his son and he (the son) is having fun reminding him of it. I won't ruin anything for anyone, but for me three things kept me from really enjoying this movie. One, the film has a more vulgar language than Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino and Glengarry Glen Ross combined. 99% of it is vomited by Willingham himself. It didn't take long to take me out with constant four-letter words. Two, I simply couldn't believe that someone would answer the phone many times, especially when you know that a stationary caller is on the other side of the line. No matter where Willingham is in the film, whether at work, at home, at a diner, etc., The phone rings and he always answers by vomiting poison to the "son", and then hangs up ONLY TO ANSWER WHEN THE CALLER CALLS IN TEN SECONDS! How many of us would do it? Now I realize that we probably don't have a movie if it doesn't keep replying, but I couldn't suspend disbelief on that particular topic. Three, and this is the smallest of criticisms, why is the director so opposed to showing us the "Corndog Man" (a.k.a the caller / child)? Most of the time it's just a voice from the redneck tone at the other end of the phone. I could have lived with that if other things had gone right, but since they didn't, it's just another one to attack. I give credit to the film for being an original idea and to keep my attention with suspense from the beginning but that's all. Show it, if only once. However, if you're like me, you'll say "Triple K Marine!" in sleep for a night or two after you finish watching it.
