Unfortunately the producers don't know when to leave them well enough on their own, or they are in recycling to the point that every piece of trash that Hollywood generates is ready for rendering in Alpo. It seems that every science fiction adventure film has to endure a sad list of follow-up films, and Robocop is a tragic example. The first film, under the direction of Paul Verhoven, was a wild and fashionable race, even finding time for a little social commentary on what the dark side of bio-technology can transform us. This film has none of this, apart from perhaps telling us that drugs are bad for you and could make you do things you'll regret when you're sober. Robocop 2 lacks the vision, the deeply disturbing vision of what we are becoming, and instead clumsily accompanies us by boat on how ruthless the drug traffickers and their victims are. Social commentary is damned. This is really a bit big for me. If you don't care about anything except SFX, go to him, my friend. Otherwise, don't waste your time with this sourdough cake, and preserve the pumpernickle with its high weight, precisely measured, just out of the oven. It's that simple.
