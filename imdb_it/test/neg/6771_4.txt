I know we shouldn't expect much from an independent low budget film. But the underlying idea is healthy: an attempt to open America's eyes to the intimate relationship between the government and journalists that they should keep an eye on. But somehow the documentary aspect of it takes away its drama. The protests during the 2004 Republican convention in New York were not so convincing as to make a documentary about it. This type of compelling protests belong to the 1960s era. <br /> <br /> It would have been better to stick to a dramatic format. Perhaps a slow accumulation in which the young journalist's eyes are gradually opened to conspiracy.
