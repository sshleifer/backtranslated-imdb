This is simply terrible. I regret every second of the 80 minutes spent watching this dreck. I think it should be a comedy, but I don't remember laughing a lot, except in some glaring inconsistencies and obvious mistakes. <br /> <br /> An unattractive middle-aged man named Lester meets rich, unattractive middle-aged women through solitary hearts, and then kills them for the money he needs to fuel his addiction to game. This is the whole plot, and it's really all that happens. Along the way there is an attempt at intrigue when Lester starts getting calls from a mysterious stranger who insults him about knowing his secret, but it's so poorly implemented that you might not realize what really should happen. The sequences in which Lester kills the rich widows are all quite brutal but also apparently dressed as comedies. A sequence has a woman bludgeoned with a wooden pole and then pushed into an oven. He is depicted very cruelly, but is played against the music of broadband waltzes, with Lester making faces and adopting comic poses everywhere. Another scene killed the victim while constantly singing shrill opera songs ... you have to see this to believe it! Actually - you don't have to see it at all, in fact I strongly advise you to avoid this flop. Fulci does not seem to know which hat he is wearing and there is no evidence of anything of the charm seen in his previous career. One sequence seemed to me particularly unhappy: the revelation when Lester suddenly realizes that he has no shadow. Fulci seems unable to think of any visual representation of this phenomenon on the screen, so from this point on he simply films the actor as normal, shadow and everything !! And so the whole corner blows totally. Either he had zero budget for the effects, or he just didn't care enough to invent a way to prove it. Whatever it was, it should give you a taste of how disgusting the whole project is. I couldn't even understand most of the movie, and certainly there was nothing on screen that was worth looking at half the time. Even the finish was as flat as a pancake. A real disaster.
