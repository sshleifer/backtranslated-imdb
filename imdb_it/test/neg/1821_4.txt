Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson give good results with Southern / New Orleans accents in this detective movie. It's worth seeing for their scenes - and Rickman's scene with Hal Holbrook. These three actors have the task of entertaining us, whatever the film, apparently. The plot for the film shows the potential, but one has the impression of watching the film that was not pulled out as it could have been. The fact that it is cluttered with a rather uninteresting subplot and mostly uninteresting kidnappers does nothing but confuse things. The film deserves a vision - if only for fun performances by Rickman, Thompson and Holbrook.
