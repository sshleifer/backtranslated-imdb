"How many ppl know about this?" ... "Let's continue like this!" I wonder at least that some new dialogues can be made or not? The film is a really poor copy of the original. Bruce Willis probably made this film while he was half asleep. The way he looks at Richard Gere's face with his cold-blooded look when they meet near the harbor ... oh my god! it scared me to death. Because he kills the major Koslova and his companions are not yet clear to me. Another thing I couldn't understand was the poisonous solution he put on the machine (what the hell was that?). <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is tense and the apex is boring. Another funny thing was the death of the Russian in the club. I fell from the chair laughing when I saw that scene. Also, what was that gay boy thing ... what was the purpose of serving? I think the film is made too fast to be easily understood. You really have to think about what the hell was in the director's mind. LOL. <br /> <br /> And the best scene, after all, was Richard Gere trying to grab the pillar between two fast moving trains. must have forced someone to lose his head if not in contact with the pillar.
