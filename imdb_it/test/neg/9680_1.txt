I think Hollywood should seriously consider never doing another "Biblical" movie again, if Noah's Ark will be the norm. Apart from the horrible, utterly trivial acting of the entire cast (Voight and Steenburgen are undoubtedly the day it was accepted to make this film), the timeline has been completely reorganized. I also lost the part in Genesis about the pirate fight on the bridge of the ark or the peddler who arrives in his rowboat. Hello? EVERYONE else was dead except for Noah and his family according to the Scriptures. God stacked the lumber and added plans to build the ark when Noah questioned how ?? I also don't remember reading anything about Noah's wife who constantly tormented him during the 40 days, or Noah who wandered around with glassy eyes and dazed all the time. The screenwriter obviously had little knowledge of the book of Genesis, or simply did not care that his abomination of a story took him completely in jeopardy.
