As other reviewers have noted, this film is a cross between stories (stolen from) that we have seen before. In particular, it looks like Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter inserted in Mad Max. Remove Clint's cigar and replace it with a cigarette; take the horse off and bring him a high-tech bike, and voila, an updated tramp. In this film, the "hero" is even more brazenly a "savior" of a highland drifter. Now our hero has long brown hair, suffers a wound to his left, and his entry into the city is preceded by a request for "salvation" by the surviving inhabitants - a fairly transparent reference to a "Second Coming". I saw the film on a hot and humid morning. Sleep was impossible and at 4:30 am, there was nothing else on TV. So the film served its purpose. While not original, with characters that are almost comic caricatures, the film is still quite funny ... at least at 4:30 am.
