Fans of Rutger Hower Don't DO IT - it only plays a cameo in this movie and this is IT. This movie loses one more point for that scam. I think Rutger Hower has a total of about 2 very short scenes and 2 very short subtitles. <br /> <br /> The female protagonist of this film is far above this poor material with regards to appearance and talent: she is fantastic, this film is a dog and she is wasted. The story is of a lawyer who hopes for that collaboration one day when the company is sucked into having to charge the Boss's niece across the country. They have several encounters on the road with various wacky and this is the vehicle for a variety of skits and the guy who played Napoleon Dynamite was thrown into the mix as a side character for good measure. <br /> <br /> This is a journey in which extreme circumstances put our repressed hero to the test and slowly melt away a little at the end of the film, ah it's not a great love, yadda yadda .. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you want to see a hot girl being annoying with a fool in a truck for an hour and a half.
