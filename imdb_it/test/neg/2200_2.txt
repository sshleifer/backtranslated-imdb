This is basically just a stupid history of chases, almost identical to millions of other chase stories in terms of acting, suspense, plot, dialogue, characterization (or lack of it) and rhythm. <br /> <br /> The only area in which "The Net" diverges from traditional hunting films is in its material: Computer. Unfortunately, the writers haven't clearly understood the differences between a pocket calculator and a Cray! <br /> <br /> Computer beginners should not watch this movie because it will make them paranoid about computers. Regardless of what Hollywood tries to tell us, it's not so easy to erase someone's identity with hacking. There is still too much paper documentation in the world, and there was even more in 1995. <br /> <br /> The pro-computers shouldn't even watch this movie. I mean, a magic virus that can melt the whole PC when you press "Escape"? Please. And the whole virus, including the fantastic multimedia effects that dissolve on your screen (what does it mean EVERYTHING?) Can adapt to a single 1.44mb disk? Yeah whatever.
