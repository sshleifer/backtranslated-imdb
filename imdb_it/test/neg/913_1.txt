people, have a clue! I mean, the writers don't have one, so I expect you ... this show is a pale imitation of the 60's show that you can laugh at! and the sixties show is the one with the cheap special effects, and it's in B&W for Chrissakes! Yet the mood and script of the old show are MILES in front of this braggart. Get HiP children! if 98 Degrees or Brittany told you to watch it, you would! You know! Just bypass them and tell all your friends that you were "IN" with the "scene" BEFORE it became too good!
