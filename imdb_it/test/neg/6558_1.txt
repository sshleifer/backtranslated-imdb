Welcome to the Outer Space floor 9 of the Star Trek movies. Come on, trekker, admit it. This film is so bad, so incredibly inept in every department, it has become something classic. <br /> <br /> The Shat offers the worst performance ever made for celluloid. "BOONES! Hi, Bones" brilliant! This is not just Ham: they are many big pig farms in Kentucky! <br /> <br /> The "special" effects. It should be done under the trade descriptions act for using that term. The Enterprise is a piece of cardboard moving in this film. Really! Even the Star Trek TV show was better. <br /> <br /> Bones, Spock and The Shat sing! Yes, Spock sings Row Row your boat. After struggling on the meaning of words !!!! "Capt. Life is not a dream" Poor Leonard Nimoy, he must really want to strangle Shatner for this. Could The Shat not have given us his performance as Mr. Tambourine Man, or harmonized with Nimoy on Ballad of Bilbo Baggins? Surprised. <br /> <br /> An aspect similar to Sean Connery plays Spock's half brother. Just because they couldn't get Sean Connery! Uhura does a fan dance! It would have been sexy in 1966. In 1989 it is like watching your drunk granny embarrass herself at a Christmas party. Cat Woman Jumps on Shatner's back! Shat turns her around a few times as a WWF wrestler, and tears her to pieces. Yayy The Shat! It seems that Connery 2.0 is a bit of a Vulcan rebel. Which explains why Spock never mentioned him in 79 episodes of t.v and in 4 films. Apparently merciful McCoy killed his dad, BUT AFTER HAD FOUND A CARE. Tell me this is not hysterically funny. <br /> <br /> The 11-story Enterprise suddenly grows another 400 decks for an escape sequence in an elevator shaft. Spock's anti-gravity boots also incredibly support Bones and The Shat. You should also have used them on the humpback whales of Star Trek IV! Shatner meets God! Or the one that claims to be God, but I assume it's really kind of alien. God looks a bit like Charlton Heston in The 10 Commandments. Sean Connery the 2nd invites God to share his pain and dies promptly. Or something. God punishes Shat to question his identity. So Spock kills God with a photon torpedo. I would like to know what Jehovah's Witnesses do about this scene. <br /> <br /> The Shat, after killing God, promptly return to his chant with Spock and Bones. Overall now, Row Row Row Your Boat .....
