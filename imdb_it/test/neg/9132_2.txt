I was very disappointed with this movie. The director showed some talent in his other efforts, but this seemed to be full. There may have been a deep meaning behind it, but I seem to be nothing but a director who has access to some toys. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend his other jobs to people, but certainly not this one. As I watched it, I kept thinking that it would resume after a slow initial period, but it never happened. At the end of the film I was neither entertained nor moved nor did I think of things in a new way. I could only say to myself, "What was it?" <br /> <br /> There were some really amazing parts of the movie, but not enough to deserve it again.
