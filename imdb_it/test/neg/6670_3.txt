As I write this, Norman Wisdom is a very confused old man who spends most of his time watching over cackling and shouting old catch phrases to his increasingly suicidal nurse. <br /> <br /> In fact, when you read it, he will probably join the afterlife and the obituaries will record a career of nearly 80 years of hysterical prodigies by the likeable funster with the crooked checkered hat. What most of these obituaries won't remember is how Norman Wisdom had already committed a form of suicide in the late 1960s with this baffling, yet strangely irresistible, end to his film career. <br /> <br /> Are the signs disturbing from the wide ?? "Tony Tenser presents" the titles. Are you scratching your head ?? "Where did I see that name before ..?" Well, on the titles of many of the cheapest British movies, the poorest of the 70s, so take your pick. <br /> <br /> Then he says ?? "A Menahem Golan Production". Oh dear. <br /> <br /> From what I could understand, what follows is a combination of Confessions from a vacation camp and Last Tango in Paris. Sponsored by the Southport Tourist Board. <br /> <br /> Norman Wisdom is very versatile in being Norman Wisdom (or a variation of that) here. Even in garbage like this, it's never out of shape and somehow keeps you looking through your fingers spread apart while paws and dribbles on a Sally Geeson (clearly crazy). Tony Tenser and Menahem Golan were among them responsible for some real cinematic horrors, but the bedroom scene in the filmic atrocity is reborn. Sally plays the role of a lobotomized sex toy very well, by the way. <br /> <br /> I wonder if any of the crazy young cats that populate the scenes of this movie can think for themselves in a moment of silence "Umm? old Norman + sex + hippies. Let me get out of this mess! ! "I suppose it was a payday for them. <br /> <br /> To feel sorry for The Pretty Things though. They probably thought "Yes, this will do for us what Blow Up did for the Yardbirds" <br /> <br /> And so Norman's old career as a man is over. I froze his little balls in Southport. <br /> <br /> I went there once. It was a depressing place.
