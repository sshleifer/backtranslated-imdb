The perfect 6-step recipe for a half-boring film: <br /> <br /> 1. Take a burned-out ex-cop, with a negative attitude, but also a sensitive touch (concert pianist with a domestic cat); <br /> <br /> 2. Add some cool retro gadgets like a pounded Porsche 356, a roaring motorcycle, a heavily patched leather jacket and a pair of cowboy boots with holes in the soles; <br /> <br /> 3. Mix in a couple of positions "free spirit" eg. an elegant apartment by the sea and a dedicated booth for an office, <br /> <br /> 4. I revive it with "deep" socio-romantic themes like a divorced, traumatized ex-wife who eventually remarries, a secretly admiring maid and therefore forgiving, a pair of ex-cop-just-one-of-those-is-really-a-complete-jerk and a best-buddy-get-iced-over-a-suit-suit-full-of - illegal - $$$; <br /> <br /> 5. Let it simmer for about 90 minutes in a "frantic" sequence, though not necessarily logical or coherent internally, of mediocre action scenes, moments of low-cost tenderness and cracks from wise essay; <br /> <br /> 6. Serve with a comfortable pillow to sleep everything or something a little more interesting (don't worry: even the yellow pages will do it!).
