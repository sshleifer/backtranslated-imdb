Unfortunately, this film is typical of the decantation of a good movie of numerous sequels. Universal made several serial monster movies in the 1940s, which were pale imitations of the original. The intelligent Egyptologist Imhotep has been replaced by a Frankenstein who drags his legs in mummy wraps, which shows no signs of intelligent life. This film is funny in the commercial but if you saw The Mummy (1932), you will be disappointed.
