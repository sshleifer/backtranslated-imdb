The Lifetime channel aired in October but I just watched it now. Is it still the old eternal triangle ?? Dave Ford (Matt Long), a Connecticut boy, has a brief adventure with his best friend's girlfriend, Emily Darrow (Emmanuelle Chriqui), on the eve of his departure for law school in New York, he thinks of her for the the next five years is not making contracts and summaries, he runs them again when he returns home after his father's death on the eve of a grand exam five years later, and lets himself get involved again in a romantic way. But director and co-writer Matthew Cole Weiss is at the top of the list, framing it all in a flashback as Dave confesses that he killed Emily, her husband and another of his lovers in front (here's the spoiler) a lesbian cop who is also a flame of Emily. Weiss exaggerates the "flanging" effect with which Dave can see fragments of his previous life before his eyes even before he is dead, cutting them even while Dave and Emily have sex and ruining soft-core porn shots that also give some films for life otherwise rather shoddy, at least a bit of public appeal. I could not help but reassert myself to James M. Cain and how much better he wrote women like this in his classic thrillers (all adapted to the hit films) "The Postman Always Rings Twice", "Double Indemnity" and "Mildred Pierce" "Furthermore, it doesn't help the film to end up with the bad guys (actually the bad girls) triumphant and the decent hero, if naive and stupid, who seems to be on the way to the lethal injection table or Actors who play the people that Dave and Emily are cheating on are both nicer than them, but even though this film went straight to the US, there were some hollow spots on the soundtrack indicating where the words swear are been turned upside down, so I assume this has had a theatrical response somewhere in the world.
