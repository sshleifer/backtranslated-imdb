Frankly, I didn't think there was anything humorous about this movie. He was really lame and badly done without any plot. Surprisingly, I got a little laugh at the beginning with the Malcolm X terminal and that was all. Seriously Soul Plane has also made the worst movies as Gigli looks like an Emmy winner. This film isn't really worth seeing unless, of course, you were as blind as Johnny Witherspoon who played the blind in the film (another sad character). I shuddered at most of the stereotyped lines and ruined Tom Arnold and D.L Hughley, throwing them into this movie. This film could be summarized in one sentence. Nashawn wins $ 100,000,000 and creates his own airline, sex, drugs, homosexuality, more sex, drugs, did I mention sex? If you could classify this film in negative integers, however, the beginning was fun and takes this movie to 1/10. Do the pfft "t bag"!
