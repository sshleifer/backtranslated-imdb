After a while I realized that my IQ was slowly decreasing. Frostbite is one of those pathetic films where nobody, and I mean nobody, is even trying. I rooted the perverse hero to die inside that garbage can (how did he manage to fit in there, anyway?), Traci Lords, the queen of B's ​​movies, was horribly unattractive and snatched my friends away by not showing her boobs only once. <br /> <br /> The "characters", even if I freely use that term, are such exaggerated and one-dimensional people that they might even have used cardboard cutouts. The "jokes" (I also use this term freely) are simply hilarious. A boy's fart causes an earthquake. Roflcopter! Our "hero" gets a head acupuncture from Traci Lords. Oh God, I can't breathe! The blind man repeatedly uses the word F! This is too much!!! <br /> <br /> Say what you want about acting, but I thought that Adam Grimes did a great job doing a snowboarder with mental problems. Apart from this, the only source of value for entertainment is boobs. I think I counted three, maybe four pairs during the whole movie, scattered over maybe five minutes of screen time. It's been five minutes that it's worth looking at 83 minutes of garbage. Don't look at this. Watch Barb Wire with Pamela Anderson - at least there was a lot of nudity and action in that trashy movie!
