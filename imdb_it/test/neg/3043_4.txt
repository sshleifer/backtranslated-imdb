This film had the potential to be a good high school thriller. Instead, we had a festive bored for a whining and spoiled babysitter. The problem was that there were too many unnecessary things. A fight with the boyfriend, casual friends who are killed. It was obvious that they were just killing time. The main character was bland and uninteresting. Camilla Bell had no emotions during this film. She was there. Another problem was the fact that the killer was not a threat. The children survive, so it is obvious that they will let Jill survive. The only reason this has come to four is because the last ten minutes (when the killer finally gets out) are really exciting. <br /> <br /> 4/10
