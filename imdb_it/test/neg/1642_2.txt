I mean, you just have to love the Italian film industry. Someone invented a post-Doomsday action movie ("Road Warrior") and the Italians have been busy bumping over each other for years. Then another made a hit movie with the barbarians ("Conan") and the Italians were busy ... eh, see above. <br /> <br /> In addition to countless other variations of the theme (one of my favorites is "The Barbarians" by Umberto Lenzi played by the Paul twins, the Ator series was created. And this, the second, is probably the worst (or rather, it depends on your point of view.) Ator is called into action by his old teacher, who has discovered a kind of nuclear energy, this obviously must be protected so that it does not end up in the wrong hands. daughter to Ator, and after some complications Ator, his partner Tong and the girl return to the castle, which has since fallen to a malefactor (obviously, an old "classmate" of Ator). Somewhere along the way the heroic trio forgets the plot and eradicates some giant snake worshipers for the sake of it (not before some virgins are sacrificed.) Just in time before the madman loses patience and kills the wise teacher our heroes remember no their duties, they invent the hang glider and the grenades and save the day. <br /> <br /> Included: terrible acting by all participants (especially O'Keeffe), incredibly hilarious "special effects" (you just have to worship the scene of the snake fight, which must be a kind of homage to "Bride of the Monster", badly managed fighting scenes, numerous errors of continuity (Ator flies on two different hanggliders during the climatic battle, look for this, just an example) and a general lack of understanding of the concept of history (men of the caves, "civilized" barbarians, builders of castles, all thrown into a movie). <br /> <br /> If you are, like me, devoted to bad movies, this is the one of the series to see, you will probably end up ROTFL. As for the records: the third part of Malta's film is actually quite watchable. <br /> <br /> Considering the other efforts of Joe D'Amato, this is probably his most amusing film, given that he certainly couldn't make horror movies or horror movies. But I firmly believe that it was all by accident. <br /> <br />
