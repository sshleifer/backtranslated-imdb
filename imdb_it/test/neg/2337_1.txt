Some directors take 2 and a half hours to tell a story, David Lynch takes 2 and a half hours to reconstruct scenes with "clues" and its brand strangeness, but there's never a story. No plot No character progression (unless you find the illusion revealed as a "progression"). It amazes me how anyone can call Lynch's "trash art", but if beauty rests in the eyes of the beholder, so be it. Lynch's film and television work in the 1980s turned out to be "avant garde" and "alternative", well. 20 years later, the work as "Mulholland Drive" is released as a 2.5-hour piece of David Lynch's masturbation. It's embarrassing. I finally saw the movie that takes my first place as the worst ever. At least the people who churned out "Godzilla" and "Rodan" were not passing them off as "art".
