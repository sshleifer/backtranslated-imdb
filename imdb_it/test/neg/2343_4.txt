Schoolies is a useless exercise ... Go to the Gold Coast, get drunk and have sex. Perhaps worthy but not highly intellectual ambitions. The plot is as simple as a few sentences assigned to each character and no one is helped by the cliches published here. <br /> <br /> Something that could help is the casting. Everyone looks too old. These characters are presumably innocent who embark on their own in uncertain steps towards adulthood, but they all seem too old to be credible in the role. <br /> <br />
