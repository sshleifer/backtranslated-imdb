It seems that every time a mainstream movie company wants to make a kid's movie, it only focuses on one thing: sex. Don't get me wrong, I'm not an idiot, but the fact that these people seem to think of blowing me up is all I care about is highly offensive. Take The Convenant, a film that relies so much on you that you find the main attractive characters that you think can handle without a plot and / or a script that wasn't written by a six-year-old. This is essentially The Craft with (presumably) hot guys. And yes, that's it. It bored me to tears. Even my friend, who usually makes us shoot crap movies, hated him. It's really incredibly ugly, to the extent that it can be really fun. I would have laughed if it weren't for the fact that several other women in the cinema seemed to be enjoying themselves. They were accompanied by many elusive-looking boys who had curled positively and died when the boy (really clich√©) on the boy's kiss happened towards the end. Watching them scream was really the highlight of the movie. I don't think the mainstream, Hollywood cinema, will release good films for teenagers (or indeed for anyone), so I think I'll give up. Unless you are a teenager who likes Pussycat Dolls, the Paris Hilton is "hot" and looks at MTV as a kind of desolate land. Life is hard when you are fifteen and like the art house. :( P.S. Someone should have told the director that not all teenage girls would find members of the boy group "totally HAWT LOL !!! 111 !!"
