The bad news: the Canadian version of Beast In The Cellar published by Maple Pictures that I saw was of poor quality. Dark and faded, it seemed to be nicknamed randomly from a VHS tape. It even jumps at some point due to some missing frames. <br /> <br /> The good news: this film is so bad that the poor quality of the DVD has little penalized my visual enjoyment. This horror film fails to create tension and lacks fear. It's a horror film without horror. While the scariest films have a limited dialogue, Beast In The Cellar is a gabbest, so much so that a character will repeat something we have just heard from two other characters. Presumably, the whole chat chit acts as a filler for a low-budget, unimaginative movie. Unfortunately, dialogue is not big enough to deserve a watch.
