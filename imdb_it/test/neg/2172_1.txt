Why do I hate him? Let me list the ways: <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Mary Pickford but a 32-year-old woman playing at age 12 is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> There is a fight scene where children throw bricks at each other and is considered fun --- and goes on for 15 minutes <br /> <br /> Strange as none of the children not even remotely injured <br /> <br /> The title cards contain a lot of racist and ethnic insults <br /> <br /> For a "family" movie the fights were WAYS too violent (I liked them when Pickford was punching him with a kid!) And the humor was just stupid> <br /> Seriously, 40 minutes I gave up and turned off. The insults, the racism and the kids throwing bricks at each other came to me. Also, there was no sign that I could see. The only thing worth seeing in this film was William Haines, who was a leading man in the silent era. <br /> <br /> Simply painful. To avoid.
