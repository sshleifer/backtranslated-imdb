Copy the cats they copied this movie from a 1974 Hindi movie called "Call Girl"! "Call Girl" had an identical plot. The way the protagonists fall in love, then they rebel and the climax is the same in both films! "Call Girl" is better than water, at least from a narrative point of view. It wasn't as painfully slow as water! Water on the other hand does not progress at all. The goal is perhaps to make the public supportive with Kalyani forever! Are Indian filmmakers better than being big photocopiers these days? Well, they call it "being inspired". In their language it is: "to be inspired (without any quotation!)"! :)
