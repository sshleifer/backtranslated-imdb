If you appreciate your life in any way, shape or form, you will do yourself a courtesy and you will pass from this seemingly "interesting" movie on the DVD rack. <br /> <br /> I know what you're thinking, "I saw the preview and it looked GREAT!" However, the careful buyer, I fell into the same trap. One of my friends expressed reluctance to watch this movie, but I forced her to sit down. Oh, how sorry this decision is. <br /> <br /> Like most horror movies, the film cheerfully starts in a sunny Mexican town where two couples are drawn to an ancient Mayan ruin by a holiday companion. Upon arrival, they are disturbed by the appearance of two people from the jungle who are almost oblivious to their shouts of greeting. As if this weren't scary enough, the tour group puts aside the growth of large plants and declares an unused path consumed by wildlife as a perfect path to their destination. I guess it wouldn't be great if they used rational decision making at the time, but, well, that wasn't that good anyway. <br /> <br /> After a bit of sixsome (the resort-goer brought a friend) he stumbles upon the ruins and immediately their doubts are dispelled by its beauty and its history. That is, until the frantic and tribal peoples emerge from the jungle armed with revenge without reason in particular, shouting in indecipherable language. Since they are brutal verbal assaults relieved by a calm and patronizing language - don't ask me - but nevertheless, the cast still tries, without success, of course. Suddenly, the sixth member of the track, Dimitri, is pierced with different arrowheads by the Maya and all hell breaks loose. A gunshot ends work and the horrified travelers quickly retreat into ruin. <br /> <br /> Now, if there's ever been a storyline for this movie, it's over here. The introduction took a maximum of 20 minutes and unfortunately it was the best 20 minutes of the film. At the top of the ruins, the by-now-foolish realizes he is stranded by homicidal locals and making countless good decisions, one of which is to use a withered rope to lower one of their members into the bowels of ruin. Needless to say, the adventurer is seriously injured and therefore trapped between the ruins and the two girlfriends are seriously injured trying to save him. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film continues without plot, without real horror, just blood and blood, as shown when a girl tears a plant that grows inside her, spurting out streams of blood and then again when her legs of someone they are cut, only to have the same plat inside the girl strangling him later. <br /> <My only satisfactions in this film were watching the attraction of Jonathon Tucker, playing Jeff McIntire, who becomes more and more distressed and distressed and sitting long enough to ascertain that almost all the cast dies of a horrible death horrifying. Their simulated grief seems to be an adequate compensation for the time that this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> It is said that the ruin is an ancient house of dangerous spirits with an evil carnivorous plant to keep away and consume unlucky visitors. Unfortunately, I haven't received any warning from screaming bloodthirsty plants and the only evil thing about this movie that I'm really horrified about is the writer.
