Superhero Movie (2008) is the most recent in the long series about "parody" movie films that I despise so much. I wish this movie could be the death of the genre, but I know it's not horrible enough to put the last nail in the coffin. <br /> <br /> If Meet the Spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel in Hollywood movies, the superhero movie is probably near the top. Unfortunately, Meet the Spartans was actually miles under the barrel, and this movie can barely do it. <br /> <br /> Superhero Movie has a decent cast of C-list celebrities. He has Drake Bell (the boy from Disney Drake and Josh), Leslie Nielson (Airplane!), Tracy Morgan (SNL and 30 Rock), and some others scattered everywhere. Although it has the power of the star to light a 40-watt light bulb, the film fails to use any humor. <br /> <br /> This film takes about 80 minutes, most of which is dedicated to following Spiderman's storyline, and not a single joke is fun. I didn't laugh or giggle or smile all the time. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. Do not even think about it. For the love of cinema, just skip it and maybe it won't come out with another. <br /> <br /> ... oh, who am I kidding? They will probably go out with another in the fall.
