Without really being the worst science fiction movie ever made, or the worst I've seen, "Time Under Fire" is still far below average. The locals and the first 10-15 minutes are not so bad, it starts as an X-Files story, combining the mysteries of the Bermuda triangle with time travel. Soon elements of other genres (too many) mix, but the story never starts beyond the level of interest of a TV series. Soon, "Time Under Fire" quickly degenerates into a series of clich√©s, not only mixing together too many genres but also being unable to create something memorable in suspense or special effects that would help viewers remember the movie until tomorrow. Acting is bad, and rhetorical lines in the script don't help at all.
