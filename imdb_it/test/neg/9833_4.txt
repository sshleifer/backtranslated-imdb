I have noticed that many films that have been published in "Mystery Science Theater" have received a lot of low marks on IMDb. However, some of the films featured in the films weren't so bad and it's not fair to evaluate a film that was given the "MST" treatment - with the hosts making funny comments during the film. Now I'm NOT saying "The Girl in Lover's Lane" is a great movie, but it's not bad enough to deserve its current IMDb score of 2.1. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Bix and Danny. Bix is ​​a veteran tramp and Danny is a younger boy who seems to have no particular reason to roam the country. Once they explode in a small town, Bix needs to save Danny again and again because Danny is rather naive - a nice way to say he has the intellect of a tomato. <br /> <br /> Along the way, something happens to the casual Bix - find a nice young lady and find the temptation to stay drawn to him. And, in a strange subplot, Jack Elam plays a super-creepy sicko who wanders around the city scaring everyone - but strangely, the police don't seem to pay much attention and nobody does anything for him. Ultimately, however, when Elam moves on to a girl about to fall to Bix, things are pouring down. <br /> <br /> Overall, while not at all a great film, there were many interesting plot elements in this film - enough to deserve a score higher than 2.1. The biggest negatives are a simplistic conclusion to the mystery that occurs near the end and Danny's total stupidity once too often. Considering the tiny budget, however, it's a small watchable movie.
