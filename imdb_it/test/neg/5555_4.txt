Some may remember seeing the film Juno a scene in which Ellen Page has a moment of praise for Suspiria by Dario Argento, her favorite horror movie. The character of Jason Bateman then asks if he has ever seen a Herschel Gordon Lewis film, and that he has a copy of a film (I forget it at the moment) and shows it to him. At the time I saw Juno, I had seen Suspiria and some Silver movies, but not Lewis. Now I understand that this is not just another of the "in" references of the pop culture of Diablo Cody, but something that in reality is an indicator of the tastes of the characters and, perhaps more subjectively, how to judge them according to their tastes. In other words, the reputation of Herschel Gordon Lewis is maintained some years after he has finished making his gore films - and is that of a Schlock-Meister, neither more nor less. In reality, less. <br /> <br /> It is interesting, therefore, to take Silver as a basis for comparison, because both filmmakers approach, at least in the case of The Gore Gore Girls and, well, any image of Silver, similar material. Where Silver is extraordinarily aware of his art, making sure that the public wraps up in whatever little story there is for the power of the camera movement, music and style, Lewis takes the easy way to reach an audience, which it is with an immature script and (putting it lightly) not very bright direction. The Gore Gore Girls reveals a director who is not interested in entertaining his audience in a truly compelling way like a horror movie, but as a side-show or a brothel. He is not able to direct actors worthy of being believed, he lights up as if it were a porn movie, and for each of them a witty or funny one-liner there are ten that stink or are too smart for half or not smart enough. <Br /> <br /> Having said that, perhaps as the best substantial thing to say about The Gore Gore Girls, a mysterious film about a detective (the second Sherlock Holmes played by a little funny Frank Kress) and a journalist (the maniac Amy Farrell) investigating a series of go-go dancers' murders, is that she acts as a model for innumerable images in Troma style. Perhaps this is a weak praise, however, and actually the best thing that can really be said is that Henny Youngman - "Take my wife, please!" - has some scene and steals all of them without having to try very hard. It's sad, since it could be the kind of image that could entertain at an incredibly bad level. But even on that point one can laugh more at embarrassment for the production, some of the actors (that is, the guy who plays the cop, my God) rather than for a pleasure of guilty enjoyment. <br /> <br /> Even the gore itself is a bit of a disappointment. At the beginning it is thought that Lewis is at least working to this end, showing that these women are killed in crazy, vicious and exaggerated ways. But with the killings everything goes on more than necessary; I don't mean this in terms of shock value, that's good for that. But there must be something else to make it really "stick", which showing the faces of dissected women and hollow eyes is fine if you're 12 and seeing this as one of your first "horror" movies. It becomes, I dare say, boring. Dangerously boring for such a "bold" film. <br /> <br /> This was Lewis's last film until 30 years later, an apparently worthy swan song came with a sequel to a film he previously made took him out of his retirement from the film and work in writing books on how to do it in business. However, any experience he has had on this occasion is not shown. It is not a failure, but it could have been, and is simply ... schlock. Take or leave.
