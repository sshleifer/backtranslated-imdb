I, like many, believe that the 1989 epic Lonesome Dove was one of the best westerns ever produced, perhaps THE best. And, realizing that many sequels (in this case a prequel) are certain to disappoint, my expectations were low. Comanche Moon met this expectation with his marginal direction and acting, the scarce cast and frankly, a horrible script. <br /> <br /> Lonesome Where he created the western heroes of Captains McCrae and Call thanks to the incredible performances of Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones. Before living in Lonesome Dove, we believed we had bravely fought to free Texas from bandits and wild Indians during their rank-and-file years. <br /> <br /> If I had only seen Comanche Moon, I would think that these two bone heads were a pair of incompetent and cowardly idiots. In Lonesome Dove, Call and McCrae allegedly chased Blue Duck across Texas and never managed to capture or kill him. In Comanche Moon, a blow to Call's heel convinced him to settle down and raise cattle. There was not a decent fist fight or a shootout throughout the miniseries. The best shot was the sucking of McCrea who beat Inez Scull, a fun scene but out of character for McCrae. <br /> <br /> Where was McCrae's intelligence and charm? Clara's love for McCrae, a drunk and a drunken and beardless womanizer, was completely unlikely. And Maggie's love for Call, a dispassionate and grumpy loner, defies logic. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was excellent, superior to the original. The credit goes not only to HD technology, but to the director of photography. The Comanche Moon miniseries was better than anything else on TV for three nights, but unfortunately it's not saying much.
