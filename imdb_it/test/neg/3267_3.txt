When I saw this movie for the first time, I didn't know the title. I realized that he had Chevy Chase with the same name he had in Caddyshack, so I had the idea that he was Caddyshack 2. At the end of the film, when I found out it was Caddyshack 2, I was disappointed. They could have done better. Dan Akroyd thought he was bad. The whole story was ugly. Call this movie with another title, but don't call it Caddyshack 2. Give that great movie a bad name. Jackie Mason's daughter looked like her wife when I first saw her. How old is this girl? Damn. How about making this movie a little believable. I thought Chevy Chase was good.
