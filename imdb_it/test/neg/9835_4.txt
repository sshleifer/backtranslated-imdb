The Girl on Lovers Lane is a weird little low-cost movie. On its surface, the film tells the story of a tough tramp by the name of Bix (Brett Halsey) who spends his time searching for a boy named Danny (Lowell Brown) and the girl, Carrie (Joyce Meadows), whom Bix meets who would like to look for it. Nothing too interesting happens (Bix goes out with Carrie, Bix gets Danny out of trouble, Carrie's father drinks a lot, etc.) Up until about 10 minutes before he enters the movie when Carrie is killed. His father blames Bix, drags him out of a cell and nearly hits him to death. Now their roles are reversed and Danny must save Bix. <br /> <br /> Until I read the reviews on IMDb, I thought maybe it was just me reading more about the relationship between Bix and Danny than it really was, but I see now that I'm not alone. It was quite obvious at the beginning that Bix and Danny had more relationships than are seen in a 1959 film. The homosexual nature of their relationship, although not expressed openly, is still quite obvious. Their way of living and sleeping, Bix's reaction to finding Danny in bed with a prostitute, Bix's inability to engage with Carrie, and that phone call eventually when Danny tells his parents he's "bringing a friend home are some examples of moments that lead to the inevitable conclusion that there is more to their relationship than is initially the case, I'm sure they exist, but I can't think of any films I saw in the 1950s that scream homosexuals like this loudly like this. br /> <br /> As for the movie, I don't know any other way to say it, it's boring, as I wrote earlier, not much happens for 90% of the execution time. they're pretty good at giving The Girl in Lovers Lane a lot of a spark. The lonely exception is Jack Elam. His crazy Jesse is the only character interesting enough to be worthy of being seen, the biggest problem I've had with the movie was with the motivation and logic of the characters. Is Carrie Kille d and Bix immediately blamed? What about the crazy Jesse who is persecuting Carrie probably all his life? Does anyone think of asking Jesse where he was that night? Did your father see Carrie annoy at the restaurant, yet he never thought that the damn Jesse might have something to do with his daughter's death? There is not much logic there. And Jesse's confession? Danny grabs Jesse from the lapel and that's all it takes to force a confession from Jesse? Really tough guy, eh? Why should he confess so easily? And after he confesses, does anyone think of taking it? It is incredibly nice of Jesse just to stay still and not run away. In any other reality, he would never have shed his courage and run like a rabbit if he had been touched for the murder. The fact that The Girl in Lovers Lane asks me to accept these ridiculous actions from the characters is something I'm not willing to do. Overall, I'm giving The Girl in Lovers Lane a 4/10.
