You know, I have no idea what everyone's teenage life was like, but this doesn't reflect the people I knew and walked around me, let alone myself. And in case you were wondering ... NO..we weren't pristine / clean / Pat Boone guys like that. (If ever there was such a thing !!!!) <br /> <br /> Look, I'm NOT saying that being a teenager is easy. The best, actually the BEST movie for teenagers of this period is "Fast Times at Ridgemont High". Now those children I knew and who were as realistic as then (and maybe now). <br /> <br /> This was crap. This was a low rent version of Fast Times and even then it didn't do much for me. It took a few moments, but not enough to recommend it, or even to say "that's how it was for teenagers in 1982". I could not relate to myself. The protagonist girl (the girls) did nothing for me and, please, if they really wanted to maintain virginity, they would, in which case, this film would not have been made. Pure shit and a bad base to be left behind like a time capsule cinema for teenagers / young adults in the early 1980s.
