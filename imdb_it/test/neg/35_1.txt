Maniratnam, which in India is often compared to the most important filmmakers in the world and is considered a genius in the cinema, has once again demonstrated that it can only make images visually good, without offering food for thought. pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very ancient art form. <br /> <br /> Even if I don't want to complain and paint myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful films made around the world, still every thoughtful and those who are a little educated in the film can understand that his films do not contain innovative naive plots, contains no persistent effects and, mostly, contains a ridiculous ending and a VERY melodrama, seen profusely in Indian films. <br /> <br />, Maniratnam has successfully confirmed my disgust for his films once again. <br /> <br /> Sorry for those who claimed the opposite on this board. My suggestion for you: WATCH SOME BEAUTIFUL CINEMAS MADE IN THE GLOBE.
