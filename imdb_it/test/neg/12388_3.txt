Oh, Yawn. Not another film in which men are all pigs and women will even get the abuse they have suffered. The only difference is that, in this film, everyone is a pig or has a mush for the brain. I hated this film because of the moral question of why it is right to send a man to prison for life for a murder he did not commit. It is a more immoral act of its abuse and its deviance. This film shows all the situational ethics of bad writing. I saw it in the CBC "Best of Britain" series. If this is the best in Britain, it's no wonder the British film industry is in trouble. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot of this film was David Tennant, who plays his despicable character that I will probably spit out the next person who speaks with a Scottish accent. Kate Ashfield tries to play the victim, but in the end she is immortally devious as the character of David Tennant. They deserve each other. <br /> <br /> In the category "Mushroom of brains" there are parents who see nothing wrong with the obvious Brendan psychotic. British policemen are made so incompetent that they are unable to distribute traffic tickets. The British Police Union should denounce the creators of this film for defamation. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth the electricity needed to run your DVD to watch it.
