I voted this review better than it was horrible because I liked seeing Buffy's Jonathon in something new - even though it was the same role. <br /> <br /> First of all, the concept is nice for a short, but not a whole movie. The writing was forced and forced. I have the feeling that the film suffered more during editing. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Amanda Bynes always seems to have her eyes crossed - even when she isn't trying to do it. She's not funny at all. She always plays a sort of maladjusted girl who triumphs at being herself - ironic, considering that Amanda always seems to be a caricature. I would really like to see you in something serious. I really want to give her a chance, but is she always engaged in these trite roles where she squirms and makes faces and somehow is a good thing? <br /> <br /> Finally, the entire "I'm a Dork" segment was robbed by Revenge of the Nerds. There was nothing in this film that was unpredictable. <br /> <br /> Too bad, shame, shame.
