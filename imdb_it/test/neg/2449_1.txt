Before seeing this masterpiece I never imagined that a devastating and hatefully contagious virus could be defeated by the use of Lutheran prayers ... and "erbs". Ralf Moeller's performance is gigantic; incandescent realism. I was so inspired that tomorrow I would fly directly to Zambibwia to break the pesto and gather my hands for the prosperity of the third world. God bless this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I will have to look at Troll 2 and Anus Magillicutty only to believe that it is possible to devise a more obstinate cliché dialogue. He is so tortured that taking a cheesegrater to your knuckles may be preferable to sit on. The only subtlety he manages to achieve is in his subtly disguised racism, while the poor islanders turn to a useless stupid collective prayer that reaches nothing until the übermenschlich, the Teutonic hero wrapped in Moeller's underwear, with his direct line to Yahweh, he can provide a blood sample to which the Yankee scientists who blow the horn can work and save the unfortunate natives. This movie sucks.
