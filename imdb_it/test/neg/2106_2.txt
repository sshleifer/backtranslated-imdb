Really, really terrible. I don't even know where to start. This is a perfect example of a film that doesn't know what to do with itself. I'm not even sure I can assign a category to myself, except I'm pretty sure it's a slap in the face to everyone, everywhere. Even the unborn. Sometimes I thought I was looking at a parody or a kind of farce. Sometimes, just a bad movie B. But I kept hard for porn, which, I'm afraid, is almost (but not entirely) non-existent. <br /> <br /> Someone suggested to skip to the end. I would definitely define that emotion. The last five minutes are intense and certainly contain some of the best movies / cgi you have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood would be proud.
