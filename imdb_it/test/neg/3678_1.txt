I can't remember the worst movie I saw. Total waste of actors and audience time. If you prefer to sit by your TV and think about when this movie will end, then this is the right movie for you. Perhaps this film has been recorded making people believe that Moscow has a mysterious past. But I have to say that I don't expect anything else from Rade Serbedzija, but I expected more from Vincent Gallo. The film lacks plot, character, development, epilogue. The film Eire is about underground tunnels and how they are mystics. I must be right there is some effect of the camera, but even that is too poor. Overly and Over are the same images. Total waste of time.
