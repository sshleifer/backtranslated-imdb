When one of my friends advised me, deliriously how well it was filmed, the basic themes and the general greatness of the film, obviously I expected an incredible film, at least funny. <br /> <br /> The two hours spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time. <br /> <br /> I understand that this film is destined to be surreal, but also in surreal films, there is something that drowns it, even if it is only the minimum. This film, on the other hand, felt forced and fake. A lot of shots weren't necessary and watching it made me think that the director was trying to be artistic. <br /> <br /> The acting was poor and the relationships between the characters were not sufficiently developed. Maybe it's just me that I miss something that others might see, but I didn't even realize there was some kind of attraction between Dae su and Migo, before they started taking them like rabbits in the middle of the movie. Then again, maybe this movie was just ugly. <br /> <br /> I am not against violence in films, but in this case, almost everything was not necessary. During all the fight scenes I felt lulled by how painful it was all. <br /> <br /> And the plot? The word ridiculous comes to mind. I would have enjoyed it if I hadn't wasted two hours of my life following this little thought and ridiculous plot. Despite all the flaws in the film, in the end, I was expecting something interesting to conclude. I will not talk about the ending, because I don't want to "ruin" the film to those who haven't seen it. Except that the metaphor "Either a rock or a grain of sand, in the water they sink like the same". cannot be used as an explanation for everything. <br /> <br /> The entire film was made only for the value of the shock and the value of the shock. I just hope that sooner or later people will stop being so pretentious and recognize a bad movie for what it is. I have seen many other great Korean films and it depresses me that people have acclaimed Oldboy as the best.
