Don't be fooled by the plot, as described on the cover (at least the Swedish version). The story on this seems rather interesting, with speculative suggestions. Nothing can be further from the truth. This is the saddest cinematic experience I've ever had ... It is clear and flawless and should not be sold or rented to anyone. If you still think the plot looks intriguing, think about this: phones can move, run and kill people like any other appliance. He can throw you, persecute you and chase you. PLEASE DON'T LOOK AT THIS FILM, it's a disgrace for the horror genre ...
