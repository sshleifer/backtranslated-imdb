This film was pure garbage. Not the worst movie ever. If he had to be shot down, the acting was good enough to get the job done but the script was SO out and so stupid that one thought, "Where did my life go?" Even Vanessa Redgrave ~ whom I love (and that's the reason I saw her) was wasted. Absolutely wasted. He didn't even leave an impression. The director was so distant that no character left me much of anything, but to see Redgrave leave nothing behind. His part was nothing. She was good as a bad boss, but she was like that. Depth and give depth to small roles ~ see Venus and Atonement. I wouldn't waste my time and I was sorry I spent $ 5 on this movie ... I wanted it back. No return. Skip the movie. It will only bring you pain ... and boredom.
