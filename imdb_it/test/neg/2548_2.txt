I rented The Matrix Revisited with a friend of mine. We both loved The Matrix and we both love cinema, so we wanted to see what was happening behind the scenes of The Matrix. It turns out that The Matrix Revisited tells you almost nothing about the art of cinema or how The Matrix was created. It's basically a huge spot for The Matrix, a movie that the Matrix Revisited target audience has already seen! <br /> <br /> If you really want to know the process, the problems, the stress and the detail that went into making The Matrix, look no further than the bonus features on the original The Matrix DVD. There are things they show in those documentaries that I didn't even realize they had to be made or made. Matrix was such a difficult and demanding film that it deserved more credit than an informative and interesting "documentary" like an MTV special.
