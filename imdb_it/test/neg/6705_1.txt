Although "The House of Adam" is meant to be a mainstream gay movie; that Anthony (John Shaw), who is a curious homosexual and a big cutie-hunk and Adam (Jared Cadwell) who is openly gay, and a second one in the background; that there is a whole minute of wonderful, convincing and naked love (sorry, no fronts) between Anthony and Adam 41 minutes into the movie (which alone can be enough for many of us) --- despite all that (to which I give a thumbs up), "The House of Adam" is a horrible movie from most movie standards. A big thumb down. <br /> <br /> The acting skills of Shaw and Cadwell are at the same time sophomoric or otherwise they really suffer from bad script, directing and editing, or rather their lack. Their love scene is still convincing, and could have more to do with their being truly into one another, considering the rest of the script and acting. <br /> <br /> Self-coding of director-screenwriter Jorge Amer (Bonus Feature) regarding his film-making abilities is off the wall. <br /> <br /> So the script and its lack are a thumbs down. Overall, the acting is disappointing with the slightest exception for Shaw and Cadwell. Alexis Karriker like Nina could have been the best except for the limitations expressed above. By far the worst ever, and unbearable, the acting was by Thomas Michael Kappier as Albert Ross, Anthony's father who didn't even have the quality of acting in elementary school. It really represents a colossal casting failure. <br /> <br /> The actors who play the new cabin owners are worthy of really bad nominations. <br /> <br /> If only production, editing and post production were as good as the trailer, this movie would have been something else. The trailer features a series of scene clips that prompted me to rent the film in the first place. This, and the hope that this film centered on murder, was supposedly played prominently and touted in gay film festivals. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is a big thumb down. <br /> <br /> Is it worth buying / renting it and watching it? Only if you have an irresistible yen to see the naked love scene and a few minutes of semi-convincing dialogue between Anthony and Adam. Or if you really like watching bad movies.
