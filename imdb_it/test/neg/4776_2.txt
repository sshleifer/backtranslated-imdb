The film started on o.k. A couple of tourists on vacation in Mexico have fun deciding that they should go on an excursion. They discover some hidden paths and end up and this huge temple as a fortress. Angry villagers show up and try to dissuade themselves from climbing, but because of the language barrier people get hit and tourists end up climbing the stupid thing. The plants are bloodthirsty evil and the villagers do not come close, so they protect the temple so that tourists cannot get off. There are a couple of scares in this film, but nothing really makes sense. I mean they are PLANTS! Don't worry about buying or renting d.v.d. Wait until it comes out on the cable.
