I chose this movie from the local Family Video for sale for $ 1.50, which was probably the first sign that it wouldn't be good. Looking at him with 2 friends, neither of them even wanted to finish him because of how horrible this movie was. I, strangely enough, could not stop watching it. But this film is definitely a textbook case of how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple and sounds great: Chuck Norris has nightmares about a serial killer who put behind bars. The serial killer runs away and his nightmares start to come true once again. Serial assassination, Norris, round kicks ... this sounds like a great movie. <br /> <br /> And some are quite good. The flashback scene in which a man breaks a ladder with his teeth is intense, a scene where a van crashes from a cliff and is crushed is incredible - and I learned how to get out of jail using nothing but chapstick and dental floss dentist. But there is a lot wrong with this film. <br /> <br /> One: the editor is a moron. When you do an action or suspense movie, you need to keep the energy moving. There are too many scenes that are not crucial to the plot left in this film, slowing it down and distracting it from the general story. At least 10 minutes could have been cut and the pace improved and the film would be slightly better. Two: The sound guy is a moron. Apparently someone tried to film most of this movie in an area where you can't get a decent sound, so most of the dialogue is dubbed, killing the stereo and not standing in line with mouths. Furthermore, the music is too dramatic in some scenes. Three: The casting director is a moron. They chose Billy Drago as a psychiatrist. Billy Drago is a great cult actor (from Brisco County, Hills Have Eyes and others) and would have been a serial killer or a bad guy. His character is so wild that Dragon's abilities are wasted. Four: the writer is a moron. Two stories are in this film: the hunt for a serial killer and the love story between Norris and his pregnant girlfriend. Every time I saw that woman on the screen, I wanted to take my eyes off. And sure enough, he never understood the other plot, making his story completely useless. <br /> <br /> Will I ever see it again? Could be. But unless they get this movie back at least a dozen times, you should never. Not recommended.
