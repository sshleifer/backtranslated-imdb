This film is horrendous. Acting is trivial and ridiculous. If you know something about Rugby, the action of the game is boring. In fact any episode of Power Rangers contains more realism than this movie. The "action" consists of no more than one pass and a shot of a guy who lands on the test line or is dealt with without the ball and frantic strokes of who knows what. It is impossible to say. There is nothing of the excitement, the skill and the construction of the score that the real Rugby contains. As for the haka, this is a bunch of yanks trying to imitate a tradition they know nothing about, just like the white Rasta character who should have been left out of the movie. The next time there is a Rugby movie, we can only hope that people who know Rugby do it.
