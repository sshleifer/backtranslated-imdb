I learned little of meaning from this film that I didn't already know from CNN and the New York Times. (And I didn't follow the Enron case obsessively like others.) The film did a terrible job explaining which Enron business was able to be able to raise its debts before it began to hide its debts in the entities created by Andy Fastow. He also significantly underestimated the role played by Arthur Andersen and Vinson & Elkins in validating the practices that were later judged illegal. Nor has it gone as far as he could have explored what "investors" - all those prominent bankers - thought they were doing. With the 24-hour cable networks, Discovery Channel and History Channel, documentaries have proliferated. I've seen many in the last year that were better than this.
