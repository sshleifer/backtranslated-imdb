This sequel to "In the Heat of the Night" will suffer in inevitable confrontations with its infinitely better predecessor. Instead of sounding like a theatrical film set for television, "Mister Tibbs" seems suspiciously like a TV movie set in the room, with a grainy photograph, cheap opening titles and sets that look like made up of plywood. The murderous sequence has a glaring error of continuity: the camera shows two hands suffocating the girl, then a shot of a hand reaching a statuette, then a shot of the girl who is suffocated with two hands again, and finally the statue which comes down for the fatal blow. Solving the case should be simple: find the only guy with three hands! But the poor production values ​​cannot completely obscure the considerable merits of this film: namely, the performance of Sidney Poitier as the cold detective determined to follow the evidence wherever he can lead, even if it involves a friend. Martin Landau is also convincing as the preacher-activist-preacher suspected of having brutally killed his prostitute girlfriend. In addition to being haunted by the case, Tibbs is in conflict regarding his family life, but here the problems of Race and Tibbs are absent, which barely conceal a sense of social disdain. So is the complex murder that made "In the Heat of the Night" so compelling.
