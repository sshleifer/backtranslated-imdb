It is a pity that many other detractors of this film seem to be influenced by previous prejudices. (For example, anger towards gay characters, thinking that French thrillers are bad, etc.) I admit that I don't know the novel, but as a film, after about 45 minutes, I was turning my eyes. I hope to be able to explain my complaints in writing eloquently enough before I get sick of spending more time on this film in the 2 hour duration (2 hours that seemed to me 3) don't get me wrong, I can sit for an hour and a half-silent movie, a '3-hour epic, I have little attention, nor am I so tired of the MTV generation that I cannot appreciate a thin and slow film. here is my complaint shopping list. first of all, the ending. yes, he had a scooby-doo-esquire, the character explains everything in the end. now I really think about this film, this was necessary .. the film had so many twists, emotional revelations, new facts that emerge and are discovered .. a reviewer said it well: "yes, it's a very logical story, but without the essential background (their childhood stories, the relationship between the 3 parents, the relationship between the two lovebirds and the son of the Great Man), it does not seem right I felt cheated "I won" I threw too many spoiler here, I could name specific revelations that I thought weren't necessary, but according to the reviews here, there's a lot of people who really seem to love this, so I don't want to give anything. Personally, I can't stand soap operas. Turned out, for me, they canceled out any impact that the final revelations could provide. In the end, seriously I didn't care! There weren't necessarily gaping holes, it looks like it could make a great book, in WRITING it's perfect Logically, but if I were to believe that this is REALITY, something does not fit the pieces that were haphazardly inserted. too often I have heard crucial characters that we have never been able to know and that have been thrown to further complicate the plot, increase the excitement and develop the mystery. the acting I had no complaints, the direction, eh, not bad, but the plot, and in particular its development, was ABSOLUTELY missing. I'm sorry for those who felt that this was a perfect thriller, but I couldn't get into it. I gave this 3 simply because I don't want to seem completely unfair, and had moments of slight intrigue and excitement. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER MAJOR * and I have to mention it .. but when the father is making his revelation to alexandre and JUST when you think the plot could not fit into another turn .. "your father has not 'They die in a hunting accident' ... I NEARLY DIED ... when the father was developed or even mentioned in the story? !! you are serious !! like the already complex plot that involves characters from all the families and their the relationship between them was not enough !!? the protagonist NEEDs another emotional bag more than it has already been fed?! sorry I had to throw in such a spoiler, but this bothered me as much as I was ever bothered in ANY film.
