The adventurous exploitation of the mush in the jungle genus. Luckily, the poor sound is obscured by poor audio. And it's terribly talkative about a movie about people who don't speak English. There is no adventure to be found here; is a jungle adventure with cliffhanger and a wild animal attack that happens in the flashback. <br /> <br /> Three pale teeth roam the African wilderness and encounter warrior-hungry tribes of amazons. These wild women have come out of the Stone Age only to invent makeup, shoes and armpit hair removal technology. Despite their desperation for "hus-bahnd", the ladies insist that they will fight men and burn the weakest. <br /> <br /> The only thing of interest, as if there were any questions, is the assortment of young women dressed in animal skins wisely designed like the 1951 swimsuits. Lots of wrestling and ballads bad mix with 50s strapless wetsuits. No appreciable nudity or violence. On the other hand, you could hum the catchy native song for days.
