Elderbush Gilch was a big disappointment for me. I had heard how beautiful it was, how important it was. It just didn't hit me. He had a line of demarcation, as well as some Native American sadistic and moral characters who are decidedly offensive by today's standards. While most of D.W. Griffith's films have depth and intelligence, this is more like an image of the formula program. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed seeing Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh in the role of pre-birth of a nation, plus some scenes from the battle scenes were pretty good. According to the future cameraman Griffith, Karl Brown, the public was standing on their seats and cheering once the cavalry came to an end. I did not hear anything. And believe me, I'm looking at Griffith's first works at the Biograph. This film is no longer what it used to be. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film is that, for all its flaws, it has many of Griffith's touches. He manages his main actors quite well, besides the scene in which the Indians are encircling the cabin, he remembers the climax of Birth of a Nation, a far superior film that would have sent shockwaves throughout America a little over a year later.
