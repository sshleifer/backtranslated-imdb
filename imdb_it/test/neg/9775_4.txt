This horror story takes place in the Namib desert in Africa. A Canadian systems analyst, Zach Straker (Scott Bairstow) is sent to a job for a diamond mining company. Even if he hates field work, he finds himself in a truck with an open desert rescue unit that fights sand flies and lashes the sand. Four diamond finders have been found ... all that is left of their scattered bones is discovered. During a long and cold night in the desert, a monster that changes shape makes its appearance. Zach and his colleagues are terrified when their truck is blocked and the members of the unit are dying horribly one by one. There is no character development; not to mention the dialogue to talk about. The desert set in its own way is beautiful and without giving anything ... the creature is as old as the sands of the desert. The cast also includes Rachel Shelley, Warrick Grier and Patrick Shai.
