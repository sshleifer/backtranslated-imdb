Lower the film and slowly move it away. The acting rivals a high school opera, the plot is trampled and the production values ​​are slightly higher than in the community theater. The goofs are so abundant that it becomes a laugh. The rooms are changed, the dead move, the dogs are used for the wolves, the men struck point-blank with the .45 caliber guns are able to walk and ride snowmobiles, buttons and buttons without human touch ... this is a film baaaaaaaaaddddddd. I almost fainted when I saw the average score. There is no accounting for taste. By the way, there is no nakedness.
