I'm not quite sure what to say / think about this movie. It's definitely not the worst in the series (there's still "Halloween 3"). The style is very different and focuses on other elements than its predecessor. Try to explain why Michael Myers gets scared for Halloween and starts slaughtering it. Well, all that Michael Myers stuff was cursed and the evil cult was a pretty neat effort, but I didn't buy it. None of the other episodes of the series attempted to provide imaginative explanations. <br /> <br /> The film contains a lot of blood. In reality it is a carnage. If you have not seen the other Halloween movies you will probably like this for its blood content. But for a real Halloween maniac this sequel may be too different to be seen as a good example. The suspense has been turned into terror and carnage (explosive heads ..., you understand the point). <br /> <br /> The ending (theatrical cut) is simply horrible. Michael is stabbed with a needle, then beaten with a pipe, then stabbed again, this time with more needles, then beaten a little more until the slime comes out of his head (where does this green stuff come from?) . Basically it is nothing but junk worth $ 5 million. <br /> <br /> But there was one good thing: Michael's mask! <br /> <br /> Dedicated to Donald Pleasance, a true dishonor. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
