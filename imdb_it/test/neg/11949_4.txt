As much as I like Catherine Zeta-Jones, I asked myself again, why redo a good movie? This version lacked the tension and passion of Mostly Martha. It was a real rip-off. Maxime Foerste was more convincing than a wounded child who healed with love. I couldn't believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck held this role. Unfortunately Zeta-Jones should have found another that he could own (he has other roles he owns). Sergio Castellitto was as good as a vulnerable but joyful Italian. Aaron Eckhart seemed without passion in comparison. This version was pleasant but insignificant. <br /> <br /> The love between Mario and Martha was perhaps predictable but satisfying. The therapist added some interesting color that didn't seem important. I liked it when he finally said he would come back but the movie was finished before he came back. I have Mostly Martha at home. Once in a while I revisit it.
