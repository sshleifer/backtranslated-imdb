As a child, this movie drove me crazy. As an adult, I couldn't stop laughing. <br /> <br /> I didn't have the pleasure of watching this movie via MST3K. I took it, however, on a late Saturday afternoon, when there was absolutely nothing in the theaters, and there was nothing to do except to rake the autumn leaves. I thought, this had to be better. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The film has some very good elements; a mystic who entertains the water, a beatnik painter, a couple of idiot ranch hands, an old history buff and an "evil wind". Um ... I mean ... evil head. An evil head that, as soon as the systematic hypnotism of every single present is complete, will seek its evil body. <br /> <br /> The whole story takes place in an evil "ranch" that apparently neither cultivates the crops nor increases the evil cattle. <br /> <br /> Like everything is declared by the mystical resident as "bad", or you roll your eyes horribly, or laugh at your divided sides, depending on your mood. Myself? I laughed until my face watered. <br /> <br /> I remembered this movie affectionately as one of those that really scared me as a child. But some children are afraid of Santa Claus too ... no? Anyway ... if you're in the 50s horror field, then this is definitely a movie you can't miss. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good storyline, this movie has this. It is the height of drama and the total innocence of time that makes it so horrible. The acting was simply BAD, but it still had good elements. Perhaps you consider a remake ...? <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 4.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
