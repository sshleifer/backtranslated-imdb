The series has finally hit the bottom with this bad fourth episode, which was (thank God) the last one. None of the three sequels has done justice to the original very funny, but this particular film is nothing but a shameless attempt to exploit the name of the "Magnificent Seven" and the musical theme of Bernstein. The production values ​​resemble those of a TV movie and the characters are forgettable and indistinguishable: in the parts "II" and "III" their names were not remembered, here they do not even remember their faces. Lee Van Cleef was an inappropriate choice for the role of Chris, but no one could have replaced Yul Brynner in our minds. Do not waste time.
