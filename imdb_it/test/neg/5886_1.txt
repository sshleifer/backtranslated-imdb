Baby boom was bad enough, basically making a series of every nightmare of heterosexual men is worse. Yes, I've seen some that have always made me feel better after a bad day, reminded me that it could be worse. Guy was successful, single (intelligent man), and attended celebrities from singers to actresses, then his cousin mistake made him fall his biggest mistake. In reality it would certainly have been a foster, I'm sure, it was definitely a chic series. Oh, and what's all about winning on the baby change, most of the time it's probably an extra doll at that age is nothing more than a prop however. <br /> <br /> In any case, I'm glad it didn't last more than a year
