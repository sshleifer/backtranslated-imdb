You can't really blame the director for glorifying Che because the industry is all about money. Most of the stories you hear about this "freedom fighter" are the triple absolute manufactured by the Cuban communist government after Che's death. Che was a lot of killer shit from day one. Here is a list of the great things he has done for Cuba 1) Performed thousands of innocent Cuban men, women and children to satisfy his lust for power. <br /> <br /> 2) Destroyed the economy of Cuba and good reputation with the rest of the world. The Cuban peso was equal to the US dollar. Now it is practically useless. <br /> <br /> 3) Continuously failed in all things concerning diplomacy, economics and the army. He never passed his first year in medical school, and it was only in a real battle, in which he surrendered with a fully loaded pistol. <br /> <br /> 4) It has taken over the largest estate in Cuba for set up for itself. It had a Yacht, a custom 60-inch TV from America, a swimming pool and a view of the Ocean, just to escape the materialist lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Cuba today is an absolutely indigent country, and you have no one except Che and the Castro brothers to thank him If you go to Cuba today you will not be allowed to leave the tourist areas if you can get out of what you should see, you would find slums, beggars and prostitutes. br /> If you think that something of what I am saying is false, then go to study: compare Cuban exports from 1950/60 to those of today, talk to the surviving people or who had parents in the so-called Cuban "revolution" '60: Read all the reports of murdered innocents, read the reports of people who served under Che and Castro's command and fled because of what an evil and disgusting human being has been. <br /> <br / > And please, please, always remember to read or watch EVERYTHING objectively. Stop taking everything at face value and THINK IT.
