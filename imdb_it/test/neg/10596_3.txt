The DVD's cover explains the premise: "Three problematic boys are in prison" and "prepare to do in time until Captain Greer offers them an agreement to work for him - undercover". The film opens with the definitions of the words "Mod" and "Squad", so you won't have to look for them in the dictionary. For a visual definition of "Cool", look for photos of the original trio: Michael Cole (like Pete Cochran), Clarence Williams III (with Linc Hayes) and Peggy Lipton (with Julie Barnes). <br /> <br /> Black One. A white one. A blonde Once defined as fantastic. <br /> <br /> The three that make up the Scott Silver version of "The Mod Squad" by Aaron Spelling are Twentomethings: Claire Danes (with Julie Barnes), Giovanni Ribisi (with Pete Cochran) and Omar Epps (with Linc Hayes). I can't do much with the given material. The portrait of Mr. Ribisi is the "farthest", which means that he descends more from the original characterization. Ms. Danes is the protagonist of Josh Brolin (as Billy Waites), who appears to be in a re-creation of "Marcus Welby, MD". You won't believe the great Michael Lerner who dances with Mr. Epps's "Linc". He explains: "I'm not a fairy, I just like dancing!" and requires "Spin me!" <br /> <br /> *** The Mod Squad (1999) Scott Silver ~ Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, Omar Epps
