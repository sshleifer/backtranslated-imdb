The peace and beauty of Koyaanisqatsi was a powerful affirmation of the natural world. At Naqoyqatsi, we are assailed by synthetic, competitive, violent and digital images - the destructive constructs of our culture. <br /> <br /> Some freedoms are taken with the images, with posterization, distressing and very slow motion. The connections between the sequences are inscrutable, if there are any. Naqoyqatsi is defined at the end of the film, a missed opportunity to place images in context. <br /> <br /> The film is hard to watch, the quality of the movie is not uniform, and its most saving qualities are its theme and the hypnotic soundtrack of Philip Glass.
