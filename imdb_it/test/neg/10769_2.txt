I read almost all the books by now and saw the music production in two different languages. I absolutely loved everything I knew before. But lately I've run out of resources to support my fantasy. I still have a couple of books left, but I'm in transit or sequels that I'm in no hurry to read. So I got an idea - Sink me! There are movies I haven't seen! So, I have to watch them immediately. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes of these series were ... acceptable. In fact, I quite liked the variation of the reason for the complaint, however different it seemed. It all went downhill from there, though. Chauvelin was too ... crazy? And, dare I say, too old for this role. Not nearly that dark and charming figure with his terrible o-o. (And what was that with the random bed scene that represented him? It was too disturbing - it wasn't his only love Mrs. Guillotine, and his only interest - his work, and his only obsession - Sir Percy ?) Marguerite ... The most beautiful woman in France? The smartest woman in Europe? I do not think so. Although, whatever forced her into Sir Percy's studio, I have no idea. And all that my Lord Tony has done to deserve this death? Yes, every member of the League has sworn his life to Sir Percy, but he would never have endangered any of them and he would have escaped like a coward when his dear friend runs the mortal danger. And if in some way he had to cry his companion, he would have done it, cry, not just go on as if nothing had happened. Which brings me to another point, Sir Percy. His interpretation was very terrible. He was neither a slacker nor a valiant and elusive hero who is a master of transformation. Nor did he worry too much about ties (his pronunciation of that word made my ears bleed) and with his own hands he had never killed anyone. So what was this with him walking randomly and slaughtering people? <br /> <br /> The costumes were too flashy even for that period of time. This is post-revolutionary France we are talking about! Not pre-revolutionary. People in such clothes stand out quite easily in the crowd. It was all alone ... gah! <br /> <br /> Although, I must admit, after seeing other parts my opinion changed slightly. Looking at it as a separate work, independent of the Scarlet Pimpernel series, was tolerable. Only your other average hero in the mask. But for what they tried to pass it, it's still miserable.
