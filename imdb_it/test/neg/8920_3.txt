Steven Seagal is a thief who specializes in stealing new drug dealers, giving the poor and the unfortunate ... ah, Harlan, Robin Hood. Anyway, Harlan wants to go straight for his girlfriend, Jada (Mari Morrow), so he hires a job as an armored car driver for a Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe, wasted on a role he signed). Max intends to have the millions for himself and his unscrupulous associates, with the intention of using the charger, Bruno (Robert Miano) to bring him the money, but Harlan has other plans. Escaping the police, hiding the money and leaving Bruno (who had a loaded gun pointed at Harlan's head threatening to shoot him if he didn't drive) after avoiding capture by ramming a huge dump truck, Harlan faints. Accused of police murder among other things due to the damage caused by high-speed chase, Harlan is imprisoned and many want to know where the money is. Harlan joins an inmate, Ice (Treach), a leader of one of the many prison gangs, who explodes with the project of finding Max and eliminating every member of his corrupt entourage. Soon the DEA agent, Rachel Knowles (Sarah Buxton), joins this scenario thanks to her boss, Saunders (Nick Mancuso), who claims that drugs are involved. Even in the plot, Harlan's desire to save a closing children's hospital was injected and Jada has mysterious dreams about Max. <br /> <br /> Seagal and Treach divide each other by talking in gangsta , while Buxton spends his time trying to help Harlan, discovering the possibility that his boss is in league with Max. Mancuso's character is a strange duck, allowing Rachel much freedom despite the threat she is making to her career. Tighe shows up for about five minutes, which is a shame. Seagal's Harlan escapes the prison and finds every rich member of Max, inevitably discovering where he is after breaking some skulls, breaking some wrists and breaking some bones. Treach talks in his rapper speech and Seagal tries to respond to him in kind by providing some involuntary laughs. As one would expect, many people are affected and Seagal does not break the sweat. It's interesting to see Seagal in prison, among the detainees, helping Treach out when a group of "Eses" plans to take him out.
