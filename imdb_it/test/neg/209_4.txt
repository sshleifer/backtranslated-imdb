Dillon, Fishbourne, Reno, should have collaborated for a much more intelligent effort, because this slips into the B category and could have been done with unnamed actors and a much smaller budget, since anyway, 2 armored trucks and one wasted the warehouse not could be coasted too much. Since the writers failed to come up with an intelligent robbery plan, they targeted the dramas of the situation, but there wasn't much to exploit there either. Fishbourne and Reno bring nothing to this film except media interest, they are just expensive advertising. Dillon is OK, but this was a walk in the park. The main character's choices, Ty Hackett, are rather uninspired and the final, with the "reward", is quite childish. Waste of time, money, actors and so on.
