Technically I'm a Van Damme fan, or I was. This movie is so bad I hated myself for wasting those 90 minutes. Do not be fooled by the name Isaac Florentine (Undisputed II), I had high hopes for this, depending on what I saw in (Undisputed II), buddy .. was I wrong ??! all the action fans wanted a big comeback for the classic action hero, but I guess we won't be able to see him soon, while our hero keeps coming with those (going-to-border-far-city-and -kill -the-bad-guys-than-comeback-home) movie I mean for God's sake, it's 2008, and they insist on making those disappointing movies at every level. Why ??!!! Do yourself a favor, skip it .. seriously.
