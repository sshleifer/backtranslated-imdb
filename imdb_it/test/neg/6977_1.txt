Sitting in a large armchair with a huge book in his lap, the one and only Bela Lugosi looks into the camera and, with a terrible vocal expression that sounds like he is making fun of a reading by Shakespeare, sloooowlyly sings: "Man's the continuous groping of unknown things, drawing on the endless flow of time, brings to light many surprising things (giggles), surprising?, because they seem new (Lugosi's now protruding eyes, with raised eyebrows and mocking mouth, continue) but most they are not new, the signs of the times "(cue a visual lightening, accompanied by the sound of thunder which then continues to echo for 86 incredible seconds). <br /> <br /> And so begins what is arguably the worst movie ever made. This "film" almost escapes the description. Said in semi-docudrama style with an invisible narrator who explains the plot ... as it is ... the story revolves around the vicissitudes of a man named Glen (Ed Wood, Jr.) who disguises himself; hence the reference to Glenda. The film has no real structure. Instead, it mostly consists of a random assortment of cartoons that could ... or might not ... relate to Glen or the reason for the disguise. A long sequence consists of an unknown woman stirring on a sofa, followed by a man who whips a woman into what we would now call S & M. <br /> <br /> Then, in the strangest moments, Bela reappears, for no apparent reason, and he fancies more foolish dialogues, such as: "When he makes a mistake, because he does well, and when he is right because he makes a mistake, he pulls the rope, he dances to it". Eh? <br /> <br /> About 20% of the images in the film consist of archive material, accompanied by a VO that refers to the motif of the plot, but not to the images. So, let's see the videos of: lively city streets, highway traffic, a thunderous buffalo herd and a playground full of children. But it gets worse. In a cross-dressing film, we have 58 consecutive seconds of footage of a furnace that produces hot steel and 84 consecutive seconds of WWII battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Even the simplest objects are messed up. In one scene we see a newspaper headline that reads "Man Nabbed Dressed as Girl". Under the title, which was clearly pasted or pasted, the article talks about ... taxes. In one of my favorite scenes, a woman comes out of the screen: "airplanes, because it's against the will of the creator", with a voice that sounds like it's just a helium inhaler. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the Lyle Talbot exhibition, the acting is uniformly hideous. Production design is poor; (but you must love the sticky background). The assembly is poor. Most background music is only suitable for 1950s style elevators. Black and white cinematography has too much contrast. And the costumes resemble something that comes from a thrift store. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad as to make "Plan 9 From Outer Space" like "Citizen Kane" by comparison. I don't know how anyone can make a film worse than Ed Wood's "Glen Or Glenda". But fortunately he has Bela Lugosi. Every time he opened his mouth and stared at the camera with those big bulging eyes, I nearly fell to the ground laughing.
