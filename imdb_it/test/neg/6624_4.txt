People don't seem to agree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time. The same kind of people who see a movie with Carrot Top on the cover, who surfs in a daring office and continues to watch the film with high expectations. Is Carrot Top fun? Obviously not. Was this film something special? Obviously not. It was a stupid movie and everyone was so simply based on what they know about Mr. Top. Movies like this, or Kazaam, or Killer Klowns from Outer Space, and pretty much all the films in which Pauly Shore has ever been are not meant to be taken seriously, and therefore, should not be considered among the worst films ever made. You can see them or expect a stupid movie that is hilariously bad or you are six and sincerely believe that Carrot Top is fun. <br /> <br /> Please, if you are ready, know that Carrot Top is delayed and you want to watch a serious and annoying movie write a serious review ... don't look at this. Choosing this film is like choosing a 5-year-old child not to know the alphabet.
