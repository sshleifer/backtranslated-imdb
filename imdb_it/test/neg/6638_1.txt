"Chairman of the Board" is a ridiculously stupid film based on the popular comic strip Carrot Top (also seen in spots 1-800-COLLECT). He plays a surf inventor who comes across a man who has a flat tire. Top helps him and a few days later he finds out that the boy died and gave his company to the comedian. Even if someone else was playing Carrot Top, he would still be bad. The jokes (which are constantly rigged everywhere) are terrible and the idea of ​​a romantic "twist" should have been discarded. DO NOT LOOK!!!
