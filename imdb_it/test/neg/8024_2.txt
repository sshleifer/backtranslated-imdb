It's weird ... one day before I saw this movie I saw a documentary about Leni Riefenstahl, so the kind of confrontation came automatically ... of course there's nobody :) <br /> <br /> This is the movie is weak in every aspect ... acting is not convincing (especially the one who plays Simona ...) and unnatural ..., editing in confusion and always leaves a taste of unfinished shot, the music does not fit, the story does not it flows, it becomes boring and the film comes out much longer as it is ... oh, and the characters are not shown very well, in reality we can't say much about the girls (except what you see). .. The film also tries to shake with an explicit curse (which is very ridiculous :) <br /> <br /> So ... 2/10
