A lot of books by Alistair MacLean have come to the big screen. Some of them (The Guns Of Navarone, Fear Is The Key, Where Eagles Dare) have been translated quite well; some (Breakheart Pass, Ice Station Zebra, The Secret Ways) were quite passable; some (River Of Death, Bear Island, The Way To Dusty Death) were quite rotten. Caravan To Vaccares is another film based on one of MacLean's perennially popular bestsellers, but alas, this is yet another one that deserves to be added to the "rotten" list. Populated by uninteresting characters who find themselves in uninteresting situations and escapades, Caravan To Vaccares is an absolute failure, both as a thriller and as entertainment. His only semi-redemptive qualities are: a) which is filmed in very attractive Provence locations, and: b) Charlotte Rampling looks absolutely charming (with scenes completely bare for the start) as the main female character. <br /> <br /> Disoriented American who discovers Neil Bowman (David Birney) is traveling aimlessly through France when he meets British photographer Lila (Charlotte Rampling). They decide to go with each other and during their wanderings they meet the mysterious nobleman Duc De Croyter (Michel Lonsdale). The duke persuades the couple to help him protect and escort the Hungarian scientist Zuger (Michael Bryant), who is wanted by various shady parties because of some information he is carrying in his head. Bowman and Lila's secret is the fact that Zuger has discovered a secret formula for using solar energy as economic and economic energy. The Hungarian desperately needs to get his formula in New York, but have his weapons been tracked to catch him ?? presumably so that it could be brought back to a cruel and tortured criminal lord in revealing his priceless secret, which they can then sell to the highest bidder. Bowman and Lila find themselves and their terrifying fugitive fleeing the French countryside from their deadly adversaries. <br /> <br /> The film looks terribly cheap and amateurish, almost like an independent film with a very low budget made by a non-professional cast and crew. Yet a good sum of money has actually been thrown into the film, and everyone involved has done a much better job at various points in their careers. Therefore, it must be assumed that the film is bad simply because it was written, recited and directed with a clear lack of attention and interest. The rhythm is mortally slow, and the plot points become so laborious as to force the viewer to make too much effort to keep up with the story. Birney's performance is not engaging and does Rampling only cause a stir due to her nude scenes ?? the character himself is a real bore, and the actress seems rightly bored by it. For those who manage to remain faithful to the film to the end, there is an unusual scene with some deadly rodeo clowns and a fierce bull (!) Which, although not particularly exciting or well executed, is at least different from the norm. Caravan To Vaccares is a very disappointing film in many respects, and once again a strong novel by the prolific author suffered during his on-screen transition.
