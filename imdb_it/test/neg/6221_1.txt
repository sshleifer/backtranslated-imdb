I love musicals, all of them, from the joyful Oklahoma, to Pigny Porgy and Bess, to the moving romantic "Damn Yankees". And I know most of the songs, sometimes singing them spontaneously, with a crowd or humming them alone. <br /> <br /> In a "real" musical, as differentiated from this vaudeville show, each song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment It is an expression of sadness, regret, love, joy or exaltation, a natural extension in which only words fail. So, in Guys and Dolls, "My Time of Day" describes the adventurous life of Sky Masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman. Each song in this brilliant specimen of the genre creates a mood, or develops a character, creating a phantasmagoria of the place, made absolutely credible by the self-revelations of the song. <br /> <br /> For this Broadway Musical lover and their screen adaptations during the last half of the 20th century, Mama Mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel distortion of the genre. There, the songs of these musicals have advanced the often elaborate, often delightful lines. While here, the songs, simply gathered from a collection, only interfered with the shaky premises of the film. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most of those spectators who are turning this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of 20th-century musicals. They have no idea of ​​the magic performed by the writer and the lyricist who can transform a ballroom into a person we know and love, as obtained in "Sweet Charity". <br /> <br /> Let me apologize for the arrogance of this review. Perhaps another day, another mood, I could have entered it and not been so critical in this review. <br /> <br /> But I can't help but imagine what Richard Roger, Oscar Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and many others could have done even with this silly premise. I think about it, while the memories of seeing this movie are fresh, and I can't help but mourn the great loss.
