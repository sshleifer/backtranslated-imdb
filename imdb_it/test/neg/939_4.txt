A quick and fun matinee hobby to discover that attracts the young misfit of us all. It actually works as a vehicle for Justin Long that subsequently broke out on our screens in the fourth Die Hard via PC vs Mac, Dodgeball and The Break Up. He's funny, serious and young - a great career in advance. <br /> <br /> A city worth attending a college finds a fake website Bartelby (Long) invented to deceive his judging parents and descend on the 'college' as it was a short-lived Facebook party . Lewis Black summarizes anarchist philosophy as a substitute Dean - Long's delinquent friends provide support for subterfuge and the consequent appeal to the greatest traditions of education and friendship (Adam Herschman deserves special mention for his ever-flamboyant slapstick contribution). Well executed, feelgood and immediately forgettable. 4/10
