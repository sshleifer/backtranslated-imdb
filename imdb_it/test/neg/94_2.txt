The most positive points of this film were the credits (text style) and some moments in the recitation of Ice-T. The plot; two rival gangs must fight it, the secondary plots of betrayal, power and change are very logical plots but in this case painful (a lot) to cross. The decrepit scenario, which added a slight credibility in the places and questionable lighting, constantly distracted by any interest / identification with the characters (the brightness of the actress' forehead / nose was blinding, not to mention other scenes with the same problem). even at the halfway point of the film I wanted to know more about how and why it occurred in contrast to what was happening on the screen. A disappointment if you've seen Ice-T in other roles. Congratulations to other actors / actresses who seemed to enter their roles despite the weak direction; Corrupt's side kick and the other restaurant worker.
