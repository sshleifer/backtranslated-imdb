I had the privilege of seeing this powerful Broadway game with Kathy Bates in the lead. I only saw another show in the 70s and 90s that had an emotional impact like this show. I couldn't wait for the comedy to be turned into a movie, but I was very disappointed when I learned that Kathy Bates wouldn't resume her role in the film - at the time she wasn't very well known on Broadway and the producers must have wanted the power of the star I suppose and instead I launch Sissy Spacek. Sissy did an adequate job in the lead role, but she didn't live up to Kathy Bates in any way. I love Anne Bancroft but she seemed too young for this role. The plot of the film was true to the game. Anyone who has ever thought about suicide should watch this film to realize the devastation of those left behind.
