In yet another miserable attempt to make a quick Hollywood take on one of the greatest television masterpieces, Peter Segal has created a monster. Out of context, if Brooks' work was not known before the vision, the film would be a lame and big budget film that is not sure if it wants to be a joke and a stupid comedy, or just a normal action movie with nothing to Go ahead. However, like a young generation Y'er who recently spent two months obsessed with Get Smart's sixties TV show, this film pained me from the moment I walked in and saw Steve Carell kill the part. The background, agent 99 who obtained plastic surgery and 86 as an analyst who was previously pathologically obese, overwrite the complexity of the original duo and paint a flat boring re-evaluation of them. It seems that the writers, incapable of being genuinely funny both in the dialogue and in the situation, have retired to limping assemblies for the famous lines of Don Adams, flashbacks to the fairy camp, references to the part of Carell in the office in the corners of the style cameras interview they have, and a female chauvinism that falls to the surface. <br /> <br /> For those who have seen the original, the authors of this film thought they would include some memories. They mention Herbie, Fang (now an insignificant little furry dog ​​that Carell craves), the shoe phone, the cone of silence, and his classic red car and the doors and phone that introduced the show. Classical music is back, but now everything is updated, generally for the worse. Cone of silence is now a strange blue telekinetic force field, the control headquarters is right below a museum that preserves the Control past. The film lacks any random creative technology, and replaces it with crossbows in Swiss army knives. A lot of "humor" in the film is Carrel hurting himself, or another character who gets hurt, whether it's a wagon that spends two minutes accidentally shooting with the crossbow, or being punched by guards safety, or vomiting on the plane. In the original, Smart would have insulted a great enemy, attacked him unsuccessfully and tried to contact him before he was pulverized. In this, he attacks without success and is punched. It seems that the writers did not understand that humor had been established through dialogue and not by useless violence. It's like they took the names from the show and cut everything that made it good in the first place. <br /> <br /> The poster hides Carell's face beyond Hathaway's. Similarly, the film moves away from anything that could make it good. Intertwine classical music with dramatic action and romantic music in big-budget films. While the original fed on a campy atmosphere, this replaces quality with massive doses of CGI explosions and sound effects. I really couldn't wait to do it, since I finished the original series only two months ago and it was ranked in my five best shows of all time. However, this was a big disappointment. The credits say they collaborated with Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but in all the things I read on the internet, they were largely left out of the writing process. In conclusion, if you want to waste your money in a cash-in with little value and no respect to its namesake, do it. But be prepared that the journey is not as you remembered it. PS: I almost forgot the humor of George Bush. They mention "Nuculor", falling asleep with the fine arts, the President works for his vice presidents and appreciates the way to face real problems. If you're listening to the same jokes you've listened to 3-4 years ago in a form of big-budget movies, drop your money here.
