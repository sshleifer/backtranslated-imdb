Alain Resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world. In one of these there is a sort of operatic brothel in which a rejected architect attempts to manipulate a group of happiness-stricken people - only his attempt fails to be a real target, the woman pissing behind. In the same unfinished castle that he built, a group of teachers seeks love in a more modern story, as a woman ineffably believes in the role of romanticism and the cynical anthropologist tries to teach her a lesson by putting her with the biggest idiot the group . Meanwhile, a group of children fantasize an adventure similar to George Melies of a prince who rescues a struggling girl from the swamp creatures and then kills the evil king, bringing the kingdom of love. The two main themes? Life is a fairy tale, and life is not a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> Which sounds better than the movie actually. Resnais is the kind of director in whom the concept is often good or bad, but exposure is what matters; here, the concept is great but the film is definitely painful to watch. Horridly off-tunes songs, sparkling characters without an ounce of size, backgrounds of a disgusting pastel - instead of giving your inner child an ice cream cone, Resnais drowns him in a bucket of icing for cake. Add some French philosophy and get a strange mixture of witches, one that has no problem with bubble bubbles and trouble, but it's pretty wrong in the stomach until you want to regurgitate it. <br /> <br /> Resnais is an exceptional director's risk, and even at its worst we see that he is experiencing something that may not work with full clarity of action. In I Want to Go Home, he manages to overcome annoying characters and mind-boggling sets by showing real change and having a moment of silence to catch his breath. Here he plunges directly into a fantasy that does not reflect fantasy, but only his reference wallpaper. The biggest problem is that he somehow managed to make a film more flamboyant than a pop video from the 1980s, and more kitsch than Hollywood's Golden Era musicals. The fantasies are beyond the infantile and naive, but the film (with nudity and swear words) is definitely intended for adults, a goal that it has definitely missed. <br /> <br /> However, it strictly adheres to its theme and never reverses. If nothing else, this film is awesome simply because it is unscrupulous. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
