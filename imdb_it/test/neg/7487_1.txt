I thought it was an extremely ugly movie. All the time I was watching this movie, I couldn't help thinking over and over again how bad it was, and how much it had dropped to $ 3.69. The plot was so nervous. They did a great job at the beginning explaining who was in high school, but after that they never really explained anything. Was it a supernatural thriller? Was it a normal thriller? Apparently you can decide for yourself, because they haven't seen the need to explain. I basically understood what happened, I think. What I was confused about was all previous, what was the bloody nose deal, the phone calls, etc.? Is this guy back? Did his wife channel "Carrie" or something? Who knows? You certainly won't do it after watching this movie.
