I had to watch this for my Canadian film course and was told that it was considered the "best Canadian film". When I saw it, I didn't agree, considering I saw better ones. I understand that there were Canadian themes and messages, but the fact that the characters and the plot were so disconnected with me (as a spectator) didn't really make me worry about what the movie was trying to tell me. The plot was too dry. The characters did not have many positive personality traits, but this is to emphasize the messages, not to tick off the spectators. This film shows some of the history of Quebec. It is not a very interesting film; certainly not worth being put on such a tall pedestal.
