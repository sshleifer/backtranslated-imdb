Armored <br /> <br /> The best part about driving an armored vehicle is that if some bum approaches a red light asking for money, you can shoot him in the face. <br /> <br /> And while the armored guards in this thriller do not use their protective power to eliminate the wandering population, they are using their position to shovel their employer. <br /> <br /> When newcomer Ty (Columbus Short) finds a job with an armored trunk company, he feels like he has found his destiny in life. Unfortunately, however, when he finds out that his colleagues (Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Laurence Fishburne) are plotting to take the $ 42 M expedition, does Ty have to fortify himself? and the funds ?? inside the armored truck. <br /> <br /> A boring caper with a strenuous plot and telephone shows, Armored is an absolutely forgettable film. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, if you really want to take millions, it's much easier to dress up like an ATM.
