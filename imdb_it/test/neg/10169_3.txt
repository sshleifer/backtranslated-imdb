An owner of an antiques shop in New York, played by Joanne Whalley (Valerie Alston) is placed on a jury of the US district court, in a trial against a well-known mafioso Armand Asante (Rusty Pirone), and most of this slow-paced film revolves around Pirone's attempts to convince Whalley to acquit him from murder, threatening to kill his son and herself. The result is a lot of action, involving gruesome gruesome crowd blows, intertwining with Willam Hurt as an intermediary. Much of this silly and disjointed mess surrounds Hurt and Asante's obsession with Whalley, classroom scenes we've seen over and over again and an ending that is unbelievable. 3/10 is probably easy with this waste of time.
