OK, I was bought some Christmas ago by my brother-in-law, who took me to see "Get Shorty" in the cinema, with which both were "uber" hit. And I saw both helpless and being cool one after another. I read reviews of people who hadn't seen each other and thought this movie was good enough ... I just think it's another way for movie companies to cheat the paying customer. All I have to say about this movie is WTF? After almost 10 years Chili Palmer had become a pussy .... The script was pretty much the same, they joined Travolta and Thurman after the success of Plup Fiction, they threw a couple of big stars (plus a warehouse full of nothing) and I thought that would have been good ..... The character of Vince Vaughn was just annoying, although I am a fan of both him and Rock both actors were very used and unrealistic. Basically I'm glad this was bought for me as a gift, as if I had paid for it, I would have been very annoyed.
