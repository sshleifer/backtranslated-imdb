May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> An innocent caravan park or perhaps "Compton", the white guy from Los Angeles, is witness to a terrible childhood tragedy linked to drugs and violence. An unprofessional but dedicated policeman tries to knock down a high-end "sophisticated" club ring just to be fired and chewed by drug lords' lawyers. The plot thickens as more and more people return to seek revenge and justice with a predictable ending. The only memorable part was a Ron Jeremy walk-on. <br /> <br /> If I were in a movie theater, I would have asked for a refund. I'm sorry for the poor actors in this movie. It was simply horrible and painful to watch. The worst part was the cinematography, where the director continued to flash within the same scene, so the sound would not have been up to it. And NO was not a codec or DVD problem, but an intentional technique. Ughh. Two stars
