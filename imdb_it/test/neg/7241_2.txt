If I still had 5 I could find it scary. It is (I imagine) a low-budget film. The acting is not good, but it could be worse: the shooting and the special effect are horrible. The plot is thin and not worth dwelling on. Too much time is used in the boring scream scenes. The chases or fight with the aliens, remind me of the children who fight with scary masks. Some wounds with blood and body parts - I would have scared a 5-year-old child, I imagine. Apparently scaring people in the film. <br /> <br /> It is far from reaching anything like the movie Tremors. <br /> <br /> This turns out to be an "accident" and we see alien ships close to the ground. Wondering if someone will make a sequel ...
