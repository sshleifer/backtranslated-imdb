This is a great example of what happened to Comedy Central after Dave Chapelle left. Here's the problem with Carlos Mencia. First, his birth name is Ned Holness, and he was known until he was 18, when he changed his name to Ned Arnel Mencia. He was born in Honduras, although he behaves as if he were Mexican. He also grew up in the United States. I might be able to forgive all that shit, but ... <br /> <br /> He was caught stealing material from other people. Joe Rogan was his most vocal critic this way. The Stereotype Olympics was an idea that snatched a couple of DJs from Miami. He stole jokes from Bill Cosby. He stole George Lopez's material in his special HBO (13 minutes). He thinks what he is doing is so original, but Dave Chapelle and Lisa Lampanelli clashed in the race for years before this idiot (among others). <br /> <br /> This show will crash and burn. The word Beaner cannot last long before it becomes old. He hasn't done anything new since the first episode. <br /> <br /> "Do you want to hear a joke? A Beaner jumping over a fence! This is fun for 3 Seasons!" Not. <br /> <br /> Horrible.
