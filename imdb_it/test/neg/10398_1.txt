This demented insult to the left trivializes Dante's great work, distorts the genius of the author from any recognition, inserts hateful ideology, incompetent satire and moral political comments in every imaginable place, and deserves a place in the eighth circle, tenth Bolgia with rest of the counterfeiters. Sandow Birk has reserved a seat next to it. <br /> <br /> Falling hell with Republican political figures, Fox News helicopters and Christian conservatives is a work of literary sacrilege, not to mention extreme liberal prejudices. It is, however, not original, boring and banal. Nothing in Birk's unworthy and heretical review is at least relevant to the original text or is in any case fun, entertaining or enlightening, despite its complacent claim to the contrary. <br /> <br /> I could have eaten a reel of videotape and PUKED a better movie. I regret the two hours of my life that I lost looking at this insult to the very concept of poetry. Calliope will cry forever.
