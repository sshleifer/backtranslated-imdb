ATTENTION: I recommend to all those who have not yet seen the film not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> If you're going to watch this movie DON'T! I warn you ... this film is TERRIBLE boring and fundamentally terrifying, not in the kind of horror film, to watch. I exchanged this Piranha movie for another Piranha movie and when I noticed that I made a mistake I decided to watch it anyway. I wish I didn't have it This movie is so horrendous and so intolerable in every piece of material that I couldn't find out to let anyone know that this movie was halfway. First, this film should be called A Boring Talk About Wilderness instead of Piranha. Show only the piranhas ONCE! At the same time, the way this movie sounds so bad, I only slept in the thing for 20 minutes. Finally my mouth was wide open and I stared grimly at the white screen. It is a VERY badly directed and badly turned piece of trash that I was afraid of having brain dysfunction after seeing it ...
