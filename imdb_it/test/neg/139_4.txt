When I was young, I got up early every Saturday morning not to watch cartoons, but to activate the local channel for what was called "Kung Fu Theater". It was not as if these films were works of art. It was not as if these films all came from China, Japan, Korea or any other country in particular; if the story had to do with the fight ?? whether it's a sword or a fist? and if the fighting didn't resemble anything that happened in an American gym class, then it was pretty good. It wasn't as if they were really very good too. They were just fantastic action films with incredibly dramatic music in which the hero collected his revenge on a whole series of villains, and then the titles went on. <br /> <br /> "Sword in the Moon" is very similar to these films of my youth, probably a bit of a return to the theme theme given a touch of welcome muddying the characters enough to make it increasingly difficult to tell bad from the good. <br /> <br /> Yun (Cho Jae Hyun) is known throughout the kingdom as "the human butcher". He kills quickly and mercilessly on behalf of the Chun dynasty, the chief bodyguard of an emperor who spared his life and the life of his men in exchange for his service. However, an equally ruthless rebel and his adorable companion appear in the country and begin killing imperial ministers, and Yun agrees to find these rebels and kill them. His task becomes a personal discovery when he learns that the two rebels are Choi (a friend from his past) and his former love, Shi Yeong. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Sword" does not have much stands out from the other action films. Some extraordinary cinemas are almost entirely wasted on a poorly fitting montage of parts of the film put together so roughly that it's hard to believe that what inevitably led to the film was what anyone intended. While the atmosphere and history tend to gravitate towards a dark mood, the tone is almost sacrificed for the endless flashback parade, as each of the main characters is given a healthy narrative arc. What should have been a simple and fast action movie is weighed down by too much personal luggage, and the film suffers. <br /> <br /> I read that this film marks Korea's first real foray into the world of art-house action pieces like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". Next time I would strongly suggest that the producers would attack a little more "martial" and a little less "art".
