A real yawn and a bad movie even for the Chan series. I like a good Charlie Chan movie or even a reasonably good movie, but this falls far less than the brand. Charlie is enlisted to help understand the murder of a scientist working for our government when someone at home stole plans for another power. The mystery is very pedestrian and the acting is not much better. The only thing that saved me in the film was the presence of Mantan Moreland as Birmingham Brown. It gives the film some comedy and has some pretty scared faces, but after that the collections are pretty scarce. Benson Fong is here as Tommy Chan and mates with Chan's daughter of all things. What about Sidney Toler? It's pretty decent, but it looks like he's trying hard to bring the movie. What I noticed most was the way the film was shot. Chan Phil Rosen's director, of whom I generally prefer most of his works, uses many long shots without action (like Charlie's initial walk into the house from the outside). Why? The film only lasts 64 minutes to shout loudly! Shots of the genre tell me that the director had to fill in the time because the script was even weaker than he was used to. This is probably not the worst film of Chan ever made, but so far it is the worst unfortunate that I have unfortunately.
