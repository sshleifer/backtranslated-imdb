The film has so much potential that it has not been developed. Mark Hamill gives a good performance and also Bill Paxton. The scenery is beautiful and the ultralight aircraft are clean. The problem with this film is that the story is very underdeveloped and the plot is not going anywhere. The film makes you almost fall asleep at certain points. I give him 3 stars out of 10 for the flying scenes.
