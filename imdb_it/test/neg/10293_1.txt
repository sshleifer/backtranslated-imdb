I went to the cinema to see a preview of this film without knowing anything about it. Recognizing the name of Jennifer Lynch and seeing the certificate 18 I realized that it could be disturbing. Actually I found the film a farce. I found myself giggling incredulously through parts of it. The acting is atrocious: Bill Pullman and his ridiculous trembling face. But I almost pity the actors because the script doesn't offer them any chance of a credible interaction between characters. After a shocking accident (there is a lot to "try" and shock the viewer in this film), you see 2 characters sharing a beer and talking about the weather. Everything has been overrated, or thought he was smart when it really was obvious! The performance of the girl's character named Stephanie was the best thing about the movie. Quiet and intense. I could not really recommend this movie to anyone. He is violent without points, ridiculous characters, bad acting, bad script and simple nonsense.
