After I saw it, I concluded that it was very likely a chicken shot; later I found out that Keira's mother wrote the script so that it would almost confirm it. However, a chicken shot can have a certain charm for men; this does not do it and it really seems to not do as well to women (looking at the poor box office revenues). One element on which I believe both sexes agree is the stupidity of the scene in the film, so an analogy is made between the pain of childbirth and the pain of a limb that is amputated without anesthesia. Although men do not suffer the pain of childbirth we understand that it is a painful process; however it is a natural pain while an amputation certainly is not! Women understand it even better. I suspect some women were trying to make a bad feminist statement. In fact, a lot of things in this film are in bad taste. Even though films are known today for having a bad taste, this "really" excels in that department. This may have been a good film showing the struggles of Dylan Thomas during World War II; and how strong was the feeling towards the men who somehow managed to avoid giving military service. Keira's mother writing scripts tries to show how this feeling was used against Dylan, but in reality it confuses him. Instead we get a movie about how two young mothers unite; a type of. In a way. Maybe. Somehow. Of note is the fact that a soldier (the husband of Dylan's wife's friend) is sent home after serving the fight; yet it is not clear if the war is over !! Likewise many things about this film are not clear; and although I have said that I will do it again, it seems to be the central reason for this mess.
