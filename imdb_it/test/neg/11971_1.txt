I can't believe I let myself rent that piece of trash! The acting was so poor, my grandmother could have done better. The fists thrown in the movies weren't even remotely close to the character that the Scarecrow was throwing down. The film has become a task to watch! <br /> <br /> So this group of baseball athletes decides to go foolish, even after they didn't have to take orders as a coach. So of course they go anyway. They decide to tie a loser to a post with the so-called "Scarecrow". When the loser's best friend finds out, he and his girlfriend go to save him. <br /> <br /> The child is discovered to have diabetes, and is hospitalized, while the athletes head for the beach the next day. The scarecrow finds them there and kills them all practically. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you don't really care. However, the Scarecrow ends up having a connection with "Diabetes Boy" and the boy begins to finish the work of scarecrow once he has killed the scarecrow. Yes, it's really very vulgar. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was full of bull sh * t. Sooner or later the only ones who live (naturally) are the boyfriend and girlfriend who are the main characters :) The evil is then transferred to the boyfriend, and he kills himself to break the curse so no one else will be hurt. Touching hey? No, don't waste your hard earned money on this, I give it a score of one since it's lower, otherwise, it doesn't even deserve much.
