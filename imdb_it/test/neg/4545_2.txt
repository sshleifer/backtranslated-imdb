As expected, there is a good reason why this film is so obscure and unknown despite having to do with the ever-popular premise of the zombies and starring the queen of the 1980s movie B Linda Blair, or: it sucks! "The Chilling" is trying enormously ?? too difficult ?? be a story with a deep and concrete background, while it should have been just a light horror film full of blood on frozen zombies. It takes an incredibly long time before something remote interesting or significant happens. There is a lot of drivel on cryogenics, which I learned in my physics class is the study of products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures. So, of course, in this film a group of people are studying the behavior of human corpses when it's frozen. Needless to say, this is extremely boring, until two obtuse night watchmen decide, during an electricity outage, that it is a good idea to put the cold metal-built cells on the outside at a storm. The coolers are struck by lightning, of course, and the bodies spontaneously disintegrate and come to live to go on a homicidal zombie fury. "The Chilling" is a horror film without smears and surprisingly (by the end of the 80s, at least) without even a quarter of its potential. All the painful attempts to create an atmosphere of suspense and eeriness fail tremendously and I can't think of any reason why zombie attacks should be so bloodless. Even despite the low budget available, they could have done better. Set pieces, make-up effects and costumes are pitiful. The research laboratory, for example, looks like an adequate apartment, while the zombies could not appear less threatening with their green faces and clothes wrapped in the film. How Linda Blair managed to get involved once again in this embarrassing low-budget horror film is a complete mystery. She is attracted by the bad B-movies as bees go to honey.
