Volcano is set in Los Angeles, where a small earthquake has just hit the head of O.E.M. (Offcie of Emergency Management) Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones) decides to cut the holidays and enter, once there he sees that all is well but then he goes towards the epicenter of the earthquake where seven underground workers were killed by a fire or an intense heat of some kind. Mike is not sure what to think, so he leads geologist Dr. Amy Barnes (Anne Heche) to try and explain things, unfortunately a huge underground river of molten lava was released after the earthquake and burst into La Brea Tar Pits sending the lava pouring into the streets of the city swallowing everything and everything it touches in flames. Mike, his men and emergency services have their jobs cut trying to stop the river of lava and save as many lives as possible ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Mick Jackson this was the second great disaster of budget revolving around the idea of ​​an erupting volcano in 1997 with Dante's Peak (1997) released two months or two before Vulcano and while Dante's peak is almost no masterpiece, at least it is slightly better and more plausible than Volcano. The script here is a total nonsense and is not based on reality at all, underground lava rivers that seem to appear and then disappear just as quickly, various characters standing a few inches from a river of lava but who are not affected by heat (when that boy is on the train that the metal seats around him begin to melt, but he stays perfectly in place, although I know that human skin is not as heat-resistant as metal, is it?) and it happens all the time, helicopters that flying clouds are ashes (in reality it would be impossible), a simple block at the end of a road will stop the flowing lava (what about the other roads and other directions?), managing to blow a perfect trench in a street and then to blow a huge building up to make a huge dam and when Kelly sees the lava heading towards his car it comes out like anyone else, but then for some reason it stays there and watches two firefighters burn at death and waiting for his father to save her even though this stage caught fire, despite all those concrete blocks put together to make a barrier in less than twenty minutes the boy does such a good job, not a little molten lava succeeds to filter and charge even more like that massive building that falls on Tommy Lee and his daughter still look good both later. Even the characters are terrible, even though they weren't as common as usual without a love story between Tommy Lee and Anne Heche and the minimalist city official trying to shut down Tommy Lee and Anne Heche before the event labeling them as alarmists. There are some badly written and sometimes embarrassing moral moments as Los Angeles joins, the Negro and that semi-racist policeman warming each other and eventually wishing each other well and that kid to end when he says "everyone looks the same" he is a bit shivering and it is definitely a nosy attempt and trying to say whatever color we are we are still human beings and we can all get along in times of crisis as it brings people together. That being said, I think Volcano is one of those bad guys that is a good movie, that entertains and moves at a decent pace, but don't expect anything rooted in reality or any human drama. <br /> <br /> I imagine that a film like Volcano can be seen as an update of a catastrophic film of the 70s such as The Poseidon Adventure (1972) or Earthquake (1974) but with a huge budget with modern effects. About the effects are good but nobody stands out much and even the set-sets are surprisingly forgettable, of course there are some impressive explosions and an OK river of lava flowing through the effects of Los Angeles, but little else. Generally Volcano is not very exciting and, sometimes unintentionally funny and completely ridiculous, it does not work in the way the producers expect. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of around $ 90,000,000 it has opened to just under $ 15,000,000 at the box office, it looks okay and there is a lot of fire, but nothing stands out and Volcano is a pretty movie forgettable overall. Shot in Los Angeles, I think most of the places described here have been shot in their real places. The cast goes through the movements with terrible dialogues and ridiculous scripts to face, Tommy Lee Jones deserves better. <br /> <br /> Volcano is a disaster in both directions, it's a disaster-themed film that has brought disaster to some extent. It's worth it for some involuntary laughs and the ridicule of it all, but it's nothing exceptional and I doubt I'd ever see it again.
