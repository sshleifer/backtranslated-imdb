Comedy? What's so funny about watching an ugly alcoholic deadbeat taking 6 sessions (the moment I turned him off) on anonymous alcohol? He started with a sad script of grumbles and mutterings and drunken slurrings. Served with the lashes of the Hollywood religious "God will Save you" redemption drivel Another reviewer mentioned Tea Leone's "Sassy dialogue" - well, I could see almost an hour of this boring movie and I haven't seen any more - in fact my eighty-year-old grandmother has more amusing comebacks than the character of Tea in this garbage. Tea is more mushy and shows less emotion than Keanu - in fact one wonders if she is not dependent on something either - maybe her botox is so wooden? Save yourself from being killed by boredom from this movie.
