It hurts to see this movie, it's really ... I wanted to like it, even to enter. Shot obviously for little money, I looked over and said I enjoyed the inspiration. Unfortunately, although I enjoyed the film at that level, the acting and editing were terrible, and the last 25-30 minutes were a severe terror. A 95-minute film shouldn't drag. The evaluations for this are good so far, but I fear that friends and relatives have had a voice. What was with those transitions? Dear Mr. Editor, have you just purchased your first copy of Adobe Premiere and your main goal is to use all the silly transitions that come with that silly program? Anyway ... some better actors, a little more passion and some more engaging editing and that makes a decent movie.
