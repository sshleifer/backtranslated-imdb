When I went to see this film it was already a forced choice, since my original intent was exhausted. what was the purest terror then, this film is so ugly that I could hardly stand it. the story is not worthy of note, a gay goalkeeper forming a gay soccer team to play against his old heterosexual team who - discovering his sexual orientation - gave him a difficult time. Loaded with clichés of unbearably old and abused gays, the subtle plot perfectly matches the senseless dialogues ... it's absolutely surprising that actors like dietmar bär or charly hübner waste their talent and their time in this nonsense. 1/10
