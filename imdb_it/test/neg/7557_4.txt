Ken Harrison, a young sculptor in his thirties, is seriously injured in a car accident. End of the story. <br /> <br /> "End of story", that is, in the sense of "the end of all physical action". Not in the sense of "end of the film". Ken's life is saved, but he is paralyzed from the neck down. When he discovers that it is unlikely that he regains use of his limbs, he decides he wants to die and asks doctors to stop the medical treatment that keeps him alive. The rest of the film is essentially a long debate about the rights and errors of euthanasia and the right to die. <br /> <br /> Ken's main antagonist in this debate is his doctor, Michael Emerson. Although the case against euthanasia is often presented in religious terms, it is presented here in purely secular terms. If the dr. Emerson has profound religious convictions, these are never expressed in the film. However, he passionately believes that death is an enemy against which it is his duty as a doctor to fight; allowing a patient to take his life effectively would be an abandonment to that enemy and an abandonment of that duty. Ken is therefore in a "Catch-22" situation. He must be able to prove that he is healthy and rational enough to make the decision to end his life. Emerson, however, believes that the desire to die is in itself a test of madness and irrationality. Ken's dilemma can only be solved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss as Ken and John Cassavetes while Dr. Emerson shows their points of view with skill and sincerity, but this cannot hide the fact that "Whose life is it anyway?" it just doesn't work like a movie. Once the filmed versions of theatrical performances were performed in a similar way to theatrical productions, but in the seventies and eighties this was often considered unsatisfactory due to the differences between the two media. When the films were shot, therefore, the general tendency was to "open" them, filming both on site and on studio sets, taking liberty with the playwright's text, often making significant changes to the plot and also introducing extra characters. br /> <br /> I've never seen the work of Brian Clarke, but I suspect this is a story that would work better in the theater than in the cinema. There is very little physical action; most of the action consists of long discussions around a hospital bed where the main character lies paralyzed. This plot does not lend itself to the "opening" device, and the resulting film is very static, dominated by the speech at the expense of the action. Although it is well written and there is good acting, I am surprised that a film has ever been made on a topic that is not very cinematic. 4/10
