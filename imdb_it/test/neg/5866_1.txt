I start, all of this comic book of episodes, of Stories, Script, an animation is for me the stupid, more tender and annoying comic strip that Walt Disney Television Animation has ever created and realized, I'm so happy that it's Toon Disney (2006 ) and the Disney Channel will stop broadcasting it in the United States starting this May 2008. <br /> <br /> Believe me it is a wise choice to skip this new and black cast of a cartoon, if you look at it Don don't say not to warn you. <br /> <br /> Your inside for A boring and lower right Time boring and confused, I hope and pray that I have never seen even 1 episode of this comic Buzz Lightyear Of Star Command. If I could, the part of my brain should be removed by the fact that Remembers looked at it, yes it is and it was so bad.
