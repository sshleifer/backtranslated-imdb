It is unlikely that anyone, except those who love silent films, will appreciate the lyrical photographic work and the busy (but irritating) summary that accompanies this version of 1933. Although the sound came into general use in 1928, there are no more of fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman, unhappily married, who deserted her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods. <br /> <br /> The most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband who gives the young man a ride in the city, proceeding to drive normally until he realizes that the man is his wife's lover. In a frenzy of jealousy, he drives at full speed towards a level crossing, but changes his mind at the last moment, losing his courage. It is probably the most tension-filled scene in history, otherwise decidedly slow and obviously artificial. <br /> <br /> HEDY LAMARR receives the type of close treatment pronounced by Marlene Dietrich from her discoverer, but her beauty had not yet been refined by aestheticians as they were when she was transported to Hollywood. His performance consists mainly of looking sad and gloomy as he mourns the loss of his marriage with only short glimpses of a smile when he finds his true love (ARIBERT MOG), the handsome young stud who recovers his clothes after a naked swim. > <br /> The swimming scene is very short, photographed with discretion and not all the apparently generated heat is worth. The love-making scene, later, is also artfully photographed with that kind of lyric photography evident in almost the entire film - so cleverly. More is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism - and this is the kind of thing that has made others say that the film is a sort of lyrical masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Not so. It is disappointing, primitively crude in its sound parts (including the laborious symphonic music in the background) and certainly Miss Lamarr is fortunate that Louis B. Mayer saw the film and based on that, he gave her a career in Hollywood. He must have seen something in his work that I didn't do. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work. The strident scene of the "workers" at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where no one is needed. He can't finish the movie on the right note.
