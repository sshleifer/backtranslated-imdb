I have to say I'm not a big fan of Troma movies. Sure, I've only seen three (or four including this), but two (Blood Sucking Freaks and Mothers' Day) are widely considered the best, which leads me to believe that everyone else isn't worth seeing. This would certainly be the case with Graduation Day, which is a version of Troma on the popular 80s slogan. Although the film is never particularly bad (given the type of film), it is never particularly good; and in the end, all I could think of was "why did I bother to look at this?" However, the plot sees some girls dying on a track, and soon after; more people start dying. Of course, there are some possible suspects; but it's really hard to worry about everything that happens. Of course, in terms of slasher; it is the blood that is most important, and given Troma's track record in which the red material is concerned, I expected buckets of it. There are some scenes of decent killings, and some of them are bloody; but it's never very shocking, which really makes another drastic slasher based on a celebratory event on the American calendar. It is worth noting that there is a small role in this film for the squalid queen Linnea Quigley, but the rest of the cast is not worth mentioning. The direction, the plot and its execution are all very trivial; and I'll say it unless you're a big Troma fan or someone who wants to track down every slasher ever produced; don't worry about this movie
