This film reminds me of B's ​​old films, but not in a positive sense. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first scene I thought it would be a parody of one of those early SF movies. The terrible acting, the plastic props and the remarkable visual effects gave me that impression. <br /> <br /> But no, the film is really so ugly. The plot is a total nonsense, the effects are below the level of a television production; assembly is also a disaster. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me at the theater was that I wanted to know the end of the story, although I was pretty sure it would be silly (and it was). <br /> <br /> There are better ways to spend time and money.
