If you loved the 1960s version of "The Time Machine", don't waste time; as with "The Planet of the Apes" last year, this has been "reinvented", and not for the better. And, just like with "Planet ...", his leading actor is sadly miscible and leaden; Guy Pearce, a terrific variety actor, is wrong about this role, giving a one-note performance that arouses zero sympathy; he is so severe and serious, and lacking in awe for the (presumably) incredible things he sees that you don't believe for a moment that he is experiencing them. Worse still, whose idea was it for him to look like David Spade's and Calista Flockhart's in love son? A handsome actor, here he is disgustingly thin, which is, believe it or not, a great distraction. Frankly, the man seems seriously ill and is cruelly photographed. It absolutely shares no chemistry with anyone on the screen, a direct result of a performance that is out of sync with that of anyone else. Sadly, even with a real protagonist this film has no chance that it is fatally weighed down by a totally inept director - entire scenes go nowhere and are poorly realized - and a script that is completely inferior, dispersed and sometimes incoherent - Not for a single moment you care about no one in this movie, just because there is NOTHING in terms of character development! In the original, you had to KNOW the Elois, so therefore try for them and experience the terror of the Morelocks; here, as the film repeatedly emphasizes, they are nothing but sheep and act accordingly. Unless you are a member of PETA, the frightened sheep are HARDLY the fun stuff! <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba does the best she can, in her film debut, but like all the others in this mess, in particular Jeremy Irons (if he is the leader of the Morelocks [that look like the discards of "The La") mom comes back "], so why does it seem to be Edgar Winter's lost brother?) IS COMPLETELY WASTE. Also wasted was the money spent on the endless "special" effects, which disprove the $ 70 million spent on the film; they are uniformly dull, obvious and unconvincing. And then there is the appearance of the film: poorly photographed, his artistic direction and set designs are just "there" and his costumes are typical of design. There is no original thought or idea expressed behind or on the screen. Above all, it's not even funny! (Filmmakers use the now ubiquitous Orlando Jones as "comic relief" but, as usual, Jones is irritating, and how does his electrically driven character survive in a seemingly powerless world?) <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an empty matter, lifeless, boring, sterile and confused: have they not already JUSTIFIED "the planet of the apes" ??? (At least THIS was lucky enough to have some strong performances!) <br /> <br /> * SPOILER! * The final insult (beyond a tremendously terrible, not to say comfortable, ending)? Not only do BARELY present themselves to the changing figures of the clothing store, but they also make the machine of the same time an anachronistic, sumptuous glass-n-chrome bore! (If "The Sopranos" had a time machine, THIS is exactly how it would be.) Pathetic ...
