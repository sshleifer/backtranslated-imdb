This film has good intentions, at least in the message "don't be afraid, no matter how hard it is. Fear will kill you in the end" is a good message, but the container is so imperfect that the message is crushed by bad acting, complete lack of credibility in feelings, dialogue that is transmitted as if it were read aloud, stereotypes instead of breathing, living people. <br /> <br /> Misuse of effects like slow motion to compensate for a complete lack of credibility in acting and therefore, a lack of emotional strength ... <br /> <br /> The suicidal part of it still reminds me a low-budget film of the 1990s, when lesbians seemed to have (at least on celluloid) an absolute inability to live a good, happy life and a tendency to get caught up in exaggerated dramas that often involved separation, death or prison. <br /> <br /> If he focused on the benefits of living life based on how we feel about it (and not how others think we should live it), it would have been less dramatic, more stimulating. But it does not do it, focuses on pain, on loss and leaves the message only to a theoretical ideal. <br /> <br /> I can't see how this movie can be inspirational for anyone who wants to get out or overcome fear and rejection <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a really cool movie about overcoming fear and of the courage to live what you hear, back to the magnificent "Desert Hearts" (even better: read the novel!)
