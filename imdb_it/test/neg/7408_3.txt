I'm not sure what it is, but there seems to be some curse when it comes to the elusive Bigfoot movie. There is not yet a film that intelligently approaches the subject, nor that it creates any real suspense. Both "Legend of Boggy Creek" (1972) and the first film "Sasquatch" (1978) became minor cult classics, but neither was memorable. Both films were aimed at a family-oriented audience, preventing them from trying to scare anyone. "Harry & The Hendersons" (1987) was the first big-budget film to use Bigfoot, with a terrific creature design by Rick Baker. However, they too chose to aim for a younger audience, but this time as a comedy (as "Bigfoot" did in 1995). I have been waiting for some time for someone to approach the topic as a thriller, perhaps in the vein of "Jaws" or "Predator". When I saw it in my local video store I thought my dream had come true. Boy, I'm wrong! Lance Henriksen plays a billionaire who leads an expedition in the Pacific Northwest hoping to find his daughter while aboard a small plane when he crashed into the mountains. The premise is interesting and looks promising. The truth is that it never creates any real suspense. I never really cared about any of the characters, as each of them was very two-dimensional and rather bland. Even the always reliable Henriksen seems to be calling his performance. Every time he appears on the screen he looks bored. It should be like there is no action to talk about for the first hour of the film. As for the creature, where do I start? I thought we would have had a fantastic looking monster that ran through the woods, but instead we got this bald one (yes, I said "bald!") Man with black skin like pitch and spots of fur here and there. Imagine a cross between "Swamp Thing" and Chaka from "Land of the Lost" and you'll get the idea. Nothing like the artwork on the cover, I assure you. The rough editing and careless direction also add to the confusion half of the time when everything seemed out of sequence, while the other half of the film was constantly consumed by these long, slow fades (which made no sense or had no purpose). They even stole the entire infrared P.O.V vision from the creature in "Predator", which seemed too stupid and out of place to be effective. Perhaps all this shows that Hollywood should simply forget to try to make more Bigfoot films, as they still have to make one that works. So far everyone has been scary as an episode of "In Search Of" 3/10
