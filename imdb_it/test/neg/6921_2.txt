From time to time some topical debates raise some interesting opinions from the public, unfortunately there is always some desperately sad person who seeks acceptance that will put an end to any interesting debate instantly by getting up and saying the proverbial "Everyone should get along and love each other "as they know they are guaranteed to get applause and affirmations, because no one would dare to disagree. <br /> <br /> Well, are the same people who marked this film as good, why did they do it? INSECURITY. However, that is all I will say on this subject. <br /> <br /> The film starts off quite interestingly, so you hope it builds, and if you settle down with a couple of glasses of wine and some cheese like me, then you'll give it even more than a possibility simply because you can't be bothered to move. <br /> <br /> But then daydream, you enjoy, your mind moves to other things, why? because even the director did! he took his foot off the gas, and then he made "ooops" to compensate for it accelerating hard, but then he moves again, and you still do it, the story slows down, the plot thins and almost disappears, you ask yourself too same 'so what happened again?' While you are meditating on your screen, you will show Nick Nolte around with some supposed purpose, but you have long been worried about what he is doing and will appear as nothing more than a screen saver in the background of your day dreams. <br /> <br /> Michael Moriarty, who plays John Converse, has an incredible ability to speak without moving his lips or in fact his face, a bit like a ventriloquist, must have gone to the Nicolas Cage school of facial expressions without expression, or was attacked by the Phantom Botox injector. <br /> <br /> Weld would have played Marge Converse on Tuesday, but instead played Mia Farrow perfectly. <br /> <br /> In all there are hundreds of thousands of movies to watch, so leave this one to one of the last, see that I just wasted an evening watching it when I could watch or do something else, learn from the my mistake, the nights of rest are precious so do not waste one looking at this boring story, do anything else, brush up on that old game of Cluedo, practice the evening for the day or argue with a loved one, cut off the nose, cut unused files on our laptop, it will be the best time to spend what ever you should choose.
