I recently saw this movie because I'm a big fan of Kinski. But, my god. Do not get me wrong. I love this guy. But in this film his whole acting is simply a refusal to work! But fortunately it is not the only one to blame. First of all, the complete plot is totally weak when it comes to gunmen looking for a murderer while Kinski is locked up in prison for a crime he didn't commit. That's all. All the dialogues and characters are so ugly that you scream. But maybe it's the fun of it all. If you know Kinski's Biography, it's obvious that Kinski didn't care about those movies at all. Especially all his Italian-Western roles. He just took the money and that was it. again, this whole movie is totally weird. Only for fans of the genre.
