Wow. So my boyfriend and I went to the cinema to rent a movie. I like silent films of horror, so I looked at the variety of terrible films they had to offer while searching for Michael Moore's "Sicko". Then I found the worst of all (as I will soon discover). It looked nice on the cover and the description on the back looked pretty decent. The fact that there was an IMDb quote about it as a review was proof that it would be bad in a good way. So the night after we put it in the DVD player and from the first five minutes we were so incredibly confused. <br /> <br /> The film is completely inconsistent, with temporally badly positioned jumps from the past to the future that let you ask for an important 'WTF?' The plot does not have a sort of coherent story - in addition to the vague allusion to a local myth about a murder, but this really only comes into play in the film in the last twenty minutes. So practically for the first hour you are in: random and confused time jumps; inconsistent plot; parents who do not age; bad acting; bad dialogue; a boy who magically changes hair color; and a series of hateful characters for you to get bored! <br /> <br /> The film moves so slowly that it is a task to actually have to sit there and watch. I'd rather wash the toilets, honestly. Do not worry about it.
