*** Possible spoiler but probably not *** <br /> <br /> The game is called donkey kong but donkey kong is not even in it anymore <br /> <br />! Diddy is gone too! <br /> <br /> The first Donkey Kong Country was one of my two favorite Super Nintendo games of all time. (The other is Super Mario World) <br /> <br /> The second Donkey Kong had at least diddy kong and good levels, <br /> <br /> although sometimes it seemed more like a pirate game. <br /> <br /> However this is the worst of the lot! Does not have the feeling of <br /> <br /> the original or the second, the enemy's appearance is stupid and the levels are even worse. It doesn't seem realistic anymore! I did not like his game unlike the last two, the first had good background music <br /> <br /> and the second was not bad, but the music on this <br /> <br /> game it's horrible! <Br /> <br /> A lot happens in these days that the movies, the shows and, sometimes, the video games <br /> <br /> that start fantastically, end up being ruined by a stupid sequel! I am sad to say that I feel that donkey kong as a saga is not so nice <br /> <br /> now that it has Donkey Kong 3! <br /> <br /> Should have left it to the original or MAYBE the 2nd.
