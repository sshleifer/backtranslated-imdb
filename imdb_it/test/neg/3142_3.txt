I rented this film from a local library without having any preliminary knowledge of the book on which it is based or the film itself, purely based on the possibility that it is one of those rare and neglected gems that can be discovered from time to time and really have fun. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this is not one of those movies. I'm not sure whether it's a film driven by sentimentality or worse, a deliberate program, but some elements of it have made it impossible to dive. It should represent a community of immigrant workers in difficulty trying to cope with the difficult realities of their lives. This is a good premise and could have created a compelling story, but the execution made me alternate between being irritated and amused by the ridiculousness. <br /> <br /> Here we have a community of simple agricultural workers who emigrated to the United States in search of work and who is abused and abused repeatedly by evil white men. And when I say evil - I mean evil. All the whites in this film are sinners, racist, sadistic, abusive demons whose only purpose in life is sexual depravity intertwined with the exploitation of poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it were not so involuntarily grotesque and therefore hilarious. <br /> <br /> The portrait of immigrants is also an example worthy of exaggeration, except that it goes in the opposite direction. Immigrants are saints, clean and could serve as ointments for boo-boos and ouies from around the world. I couldn't help laughing when I saw these "field workers" who allegedly dug in ditches all day with their notoriously clean clothes and chisel cuts cut by a top-notch hairdresser. A little restraint and a more impartial hand at the helm could have made this film much better by evoking some intentional emotions rather than sarcastic giggles.
