I'm a big horror fan, especially the Spanish horror. This film has had so many chances to be good. It's a wonderful idea, a vigilant ghost nun, like most of what came out of Jaume Balanguero's mind. Even the visual and sound effects were pretty good. But everything was shamefully ruined by the bad direction, the terrible cast and a painful script (exhibition, exhibition!). Sin. Perhaps Balanguer√≥ should write and direct himself a remake ... <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I don't really understand why this should be spoken in English by actors who can't speak English (and when they do, they do it so badly which makes their performances even more false). If you watch contemporary Spanish horror films like El Orfanato or Rec, the performances are totally in tune with this kind of elegant ghost - and this is realistic, credible as someone like us, as real people, because that's the only way to where the horror reaches its goal. Unfortunately, everything failed at La Monja.
