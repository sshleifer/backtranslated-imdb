A bit strange as the comments for this film have gone downhill constantly, now I add mine. I think the script could have been saved with better acting and acting with a better script. Together, it was difficult to look at, and I wouldn't hesitate from these topics. <br /> <br /> Sigourney was the best part (I thought the relationship between her and her surviving son was pretty much the only new thing this movie offered to her genre) but she also lagged behind. I can't blame her, who knows what shots were left on the cutting room floor by the director and / or publisher. The whole movie had an "okay, it's good enough, let's move on" feeling, when I know that there was more to be extracted by the actors and the script, that it had good jokes and some interesting themes. <Br /> <br /> I don't think this is considered a spoiler, but a perfect example is the scene in which Sigourney marches towards the alleged home of her son's tormented and has this look on her face and I thought "it's the face of someone who is exaggerated with what it's like to see someone living in a mobile home "and surely, the next blow, he wanted to surprise us, I'm sure, bully lives in a trailer rather than in a nice house, like his. <br /> <br /> As many other posters have pointed out, there are MANY top films with equally airy scripts on messy families that best hit the notes - "Celebration" is probably the last example I saw.
