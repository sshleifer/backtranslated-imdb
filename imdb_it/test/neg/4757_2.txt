From what I understand, Fox was embarrassed by the fact that they had released a PG-13 Alien / Predator movie not long ago. It was not well received in any way. <br /> <br /> I'm not really sure where to go next, since they thought Anderson was the best director for the franchise and that they had produced a true science fiction gem, Fox turned to his little but knowledgeable group of monkeys for answers. <br /> <br /> These monkeys were not at all veterans of writing science fiction films, but they had seen the remake of Burton's Planet of the Apes and House of the Dead. <br /> <br /> Their first task: to hire actors. Fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save money. They hired fifteen television actors shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> Now, the script. The monkeys wanted to save a little budget so they could write the movie themselves. Leaving aside important aspects of the two franchises was the easy part. Thinking of great new lines for the general public to remember for years, it was more difficult. They banged their heads for a while and invented a truly award-winning script with cliche characters, idiotic decisions and gaping story holes. <br /> <br /> Fox was so far satisfied with the results, but he wanted to see what the centerpiece of the film would be: aliens and predators. The monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget, so they decided to wipe out the big robotics used in the otherwise terrible original AvP and go with the Man-in-the-suit alien seen in old movies. The actors who played the aliens had difficulty entering the seeds because they were not properly sized by the monkeys, so they waved their plastic heads throughout the film with honor. As for the predators, the monkeys decided that a predator would be enough this time (again, saving on the budget) to fight the hordes of aliens seemingly sprung from nowhere. <br /> <br /> But what about the effects, ask? Come on now, people. They could be monkeys, but they clearly knew that CGI would play a key role in the film. Without immersing themselves in the budget, the monkeys used a standard Final Cut program and cut and pasted some very beautiful fire and spark effects. Putting the red and green filters on the camera lens provided some excellent Predator views. <br /> <br /> The setting was something the monkeys thought about for a long time. If this was to be on Earth, in Colorado, they had to make it realistic. This was the moment when they admitted to making a mistake. See, the monkeys did not have proper training in this department, so they thought about turning off the lights in the city and running the movie in the middle of the night and in the rain was the right thing to do. They simply forgot people like to see creatures instead of looking at the shadows and raining the whole movie. To add insult to injury, the monkeys unintentionally filmed all the incredibly close combat scenes so that no one could see what he was fighting or who he was. But still, a beginner's mistake. <br /> <br /> The score. Fox told the monkeys to make the movie R-rated. It was easy. Without showing how many injuries or deaths actually occurred, the monkeys used to show the carnage after the fact. It was simple: the spectators had the blood they wanted and the monkeys didn't have to film most of the action scenes involving that violence. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors originally had questions regarding the script. Why does a blue liquid the Predator have an infinite amount of magically disintegrate what it wants and nothing more? Why is a former prisoner driving in a police car for the entire movie? Why did monkeys forget to show an entire body of aliens? Why does a watch have a more memorable role than any of the main characters? The list of questions continued to grow but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Fox was enthusiastic about his work. So excited that they opened the film nationally on Christmas day and even spent some advertising money the week before it came out. The monkeys had successfully made another episode in these beloved franchises. <br /> <br /> But some ask, what ever happened to the budget that the apes forgot to use? They directed him to their next movie: Aliens Vs. Predator against Hulk Hogan. They knew the public would be upset by the title, but have since released this statement: <br /> <br /> "For people - don't worry about our next film, it will be rated R and will have violence." <Br /> <br /> And everyone lived happily ever after. The end.
