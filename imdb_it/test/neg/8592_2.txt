When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it would be a rally, because it presented my favorite actor of all time. It gives an exceptional performance, although it is quite obvious that it did not have to put more than half a finger to life to make the role work. He is the only good thing, unless you are involved in explosions and in the hero trash of American heroes who work in dreams (which they are not). <br /> <br /> I don't understand. How can this film get away with being so naf. That bit with the boy who was saved, I mean, come on! You can't tell me that he would have been saved without the fireman with the glasses (I know for sure it would have been dark in there and you can't see for more than a couple of meters) and no breathing equipment suffocated after 2 minutes!). This movie was just ugly, OK? <br /> <br /> Why Robert? WHYYYYYY <br /> Sorry if this is your favorite movie.
