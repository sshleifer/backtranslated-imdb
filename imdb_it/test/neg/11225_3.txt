I found this film to be preaching and unrealistic. Try to be a film that shows children struggling with the system, but doesn't even present a positive solution. I guess I don't really feel for children. I am totally able to understand what their defects were and I know how scarce the state of the schools is, but I found their solution and the way in which the outside was faced to be a large group of friends. If you come on TV, don't waste time. Look again at the short circuit for the 235th time.
