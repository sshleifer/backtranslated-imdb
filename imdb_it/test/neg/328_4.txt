I bought Jack-O a few months ago in a Blockbuster video store, and at the moment I didn't expect anything exceptional from this. After seeing it, I realized that not only did I get less than I could have bargained for, but also much more. It seems strange, I know. And this is. But it is perfectly appropriate when one considers that the absolute strangeness that is "Jack-O" <br /> <br /> The film follows a boy named Shawn Kelly. Somehow, through ancestral ties, he is marked for death by the hand of a demented, sickle wielding a pumpkin man. This pumpkin man was killed by Shawn's great-grandfather, uncle-cousin-etc, and now that the villain is risen, Shawn's death is apparently crucial to his hellish revenge revenge. However, a lot of "horror" comes from the fact that Jack-O makes his way through the various neighbors before beating Shawn to the end. <br /> <br /> I am not so much here to discuss the plot as I am to determine who can find some value in this film. I can honestly tell you that Jack-O is one of the worst movies in the history of the time. Acting is impassive (except when it should be), the script is apparently a first-rate group project and the production budget should not exceed $ 150. Some of the most laughable death scenes are performed in this anti-thriller, and they're all a lot more fun when you realize that director Steve Latshaw looks really serious in his film. <br /> <br /> Yet I enjoyed the film heartily. I can call it a terrible horror movie, yes. But I can also say that I enjoyed watching it with my friends, and I saw it several times from that fateful first vision. Many people (including some of my friends) will find this film intolerable and unnecessarily time-consuming, and that's understandable. If you're like me and you like incredibly bad horror movies that you take seriously, you'll find Jack-O an instant classic, which is also understandable. <br /> <br /> That's why it's so hard to evaluate this movie. If you evaluate the quality of Jack-O as a movie, I wouldn't give anything. In fact, the study owes me stars. Yet if I was worth it it is on the basis of pure enjoyment, I would give it an 8 or a 9. I will give it a 4, then be somewhere in the middle. I advise everyone to go out, rent it and form their own conclusions.
