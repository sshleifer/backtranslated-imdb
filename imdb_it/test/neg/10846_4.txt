This film is only striking for its banality and the use of clich√©s. Unfortunately it was obvious until the end. But don't be confused in thinking that he's finished with force. Just a little unexpectedly, although it's not worth looking at. <br /> <br /> From the taciturn and offended hero, to the German caregiver, to the expendable team, the characters were entirely wooden and obvious. The two FBI agents Smith and Wesson (Geddit?) Gave some hope of humor, but that didn't lead to anything. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of science fiction, but it's hard to find some salvific qualities in this movie. A turkey! <br /> <br />
