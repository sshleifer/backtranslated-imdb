OK, please believe me when I say this is a terrible, terrible, science fiction movie. It is so badly done that much of the film plays like involuntary surrealism and is absolutely a 100% waste of time. Terrible, but also somehow not very funny. I saw it as a double episode of "Recon 2020: The Caprini Massacre" and although "Battlespace" was an incredibly superior film, it's not saying much. The plot of "Battlespace" is so completely twisted that it is impossible to follow. The narration is cryptic, often meaningless, seemingly infinite and completely exhausting. Literally half of the film is duplicated scenes of the female protagonist, who looks like Brian Bosworth, walking in the desert. The film actually starts pretty well, but then quickly drops and somehow continues to deteriorate, minute by minute. Absolutely horrible and truly an absurd endurance test.
