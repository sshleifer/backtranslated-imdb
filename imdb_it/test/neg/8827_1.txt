In all the episodes, I've never seen any real action or drama or comedy. <br /> <br /> The plot is so repetitive. <br /> <br /> **** Someone gets something old and then someone else tells them a little about it and how much it is and who made it and where it comes from and how much it could sell and if there was of work to do. <br /> <br /> Sowhile I have seen 30 of these, I understand ... there is no drama ... no one ever loses a limb or life or is divorced or hit by a car or plane. <br /> <br /> There are no car chases or explosions - not even a horse race with old carriages. <br /> <br /> All those guns and swords and no one goes wild in a violent series of murders ... what does he give? No pexcos, no ax killers, bulky old Englishmen wearing jumpsuits in poor condition ... simply yap yap yap ... you have an old tea set and it's from Germany in 1602 - bla bla bla. .. <br /> <br /> I'm still waiting for someone with a time machine to go on the screen and ask, but no ... it never comes and the only thing that happens is that some English or woman needs some old things sold in Boston or China during the Ming dynasty - a big EFFIN deal. <br /> <br /> Can anyone ever abduct one of the contacts and keep them for a ransom? Aren't there alien spaceships that will cancel the entire plan? Who the hell writes this stuff as a series and expects us to stay awake? This is as fun as looking at dry paint - just with comments. <br /> <br /> There is no sex, no comedy or romance, no action, no suspense, no action, no drama, no mystery or martial arts. <br /> <br /> This show sucks! What happened to the supermodels wearing flip-flops and emitting lasers from a futuristic weapon? Antiques Roadshow - More like grabbing a blanket and a pillow and going to sleep show ...
