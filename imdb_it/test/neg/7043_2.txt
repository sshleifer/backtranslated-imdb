If you have enough time to kill and the DVD was given to you for free by your friend, but it could still take a lot of courage to watch this movie that doesn't have a good script or humor about it. <br /> <br /> On the acting front imran is frozen in time / acting, Tushar Kapoor was slightly better than Imran in this film Paresh Rawal was good at comedy was usual. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a university campus where Imran is a bad boy n Tushar is good, they pretend to be the opposite of their respective nature and therefore the story continues ..... <br /> < br /> Just watch it if you have nothing to do and the movie is running on your local cable TV.
