This film is full of sentimentality, of non-professional flights that make a driver like me shudder, and irrelevant material. Why introduce Rachel, for example? It has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to allow its "Follow Me" truck to run wild and crash into Dorinda's fence. This must be one of the most stupid sequences among the many in the film. Another is at the end when the plane (it is a B-26 or an A-26?) - both designations are used in the film) is left with spinning props and no wedges in place. This serves the plot, of course, but to reveal that it would commit a feared spoiler. As it stands, the plane would start taxing without control. The ending (again, avoiding spoilers) involves too many rumors - like the beginning of the sound films of the 1930s with all those final speeches. Here, Dreyfuss stutters again and again. The ending also incorporates other radical violations of the aeronautical protocol and a couple of improbabilities / impossibilities that I will not describe. What a boring and disjointed effort!
