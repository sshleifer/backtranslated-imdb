First of all let me say that this film is nothing spectacular. The cast is like the saved from the bell meeting, the monster is a badly dressed boy and as always; the army is useless. It would seem that the more training you have and the bigger your gun is, the more likely you are to die if you find yourself in a low budget horror movie. Apparently people in the film world have little respect for navy seals, marines and ninja, who get the worst. The plot is thin, a crazy cryptozoologist by the name of Dr. Pe√±a traps the Chupacabra. He then smuggled it aboard a cruise ship where two crew members got free. You can do your taxes and watch this movie and not miss a beat. The most noteworthy part that really makes it worthwhile revolves around the captains' daughter. Towards the end she goes all martial arts on the monster and kicks her ass. Let me understand, the monster wipes out the entire unit of naval seals, while using ARMOR PIERCING ammunition !! OK, it's a movie that can happen right? But here comes the captains' daughter who can't be older than 19 and kicks the chupacabra with frontal and side kicks. It was fun. They should get a medal for this.
