this film has no plot, does not play well, to be honest it has nothing, the same songs play the acting again and again and if you can sit there watching everything and enjoy there is something wrong with you. I wish I could give this 0 out of 10 but I can't so it must be a 1 that's generous! ice-t is not even a good rapper and, worse still in acting, every part of the movie is rubbish, I had this DVD movie without knowing what it was for the price of Â£ 1.99 and I thought I had taken a bargain, then I looked at the IMDb rating and didn't consider it, but after seeing it I discovered that the DVD I bought was a complete waste of time, money and electricity. if you have this movie there are two things you can do to sell it to someone who doesn't know it or burn it!
