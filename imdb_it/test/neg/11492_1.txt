the film is complete. I don't know who writes scripts for movies like this, but I'd certainly like to meet one and talk to him a little. perhaps the writers do not really know the situation in foreign countries in the present or recent past? or they don't care and write everything they think is interesting. <br /> <br /> a grand and everlasting formula with crazy dictator + 1 lone hero (an American of course) might seem like a good idea, but come on! we had such a tyrant in serbia (milosevic) who did many bad things to his people, but I simply can't imagine him screaming "shoot him, shoot him" with such a barbarous passion, as in the Middle Ages. maybe they wanted to show how evil he was, but it was a stupid idea. the impression would be much better if he did it in cold blood, as real monsters do. <br /> <br /> the list of nonsense is too long, but the funniest thing is: no matter how many national television stations there are in Russia, the Russian president looks at the American SNN (CNN) news ?? OMFG! <br /> <br /> give me a break! <br /> <br /> burn this piece of ruby ​​please! <br /> <br /> AWFUL!
