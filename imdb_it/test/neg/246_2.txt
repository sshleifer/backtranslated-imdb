The 2/3 of this film are recycled films from previous films, a fact that is unfortunately obvious even to someone like me who has not seen the original films. And somehow it looks like a rip-off even though I've never seen the stuff before. It's like that episode of every television series in which the characters sit around a photo album or something like that and you only see recycled footage of other episodes. I have seen some producers make extended montages of recycled films, but never more than about 5 minutes. This film is mostly stuff that had already been seen by the public, so it is possible to mount a case that is one of the biggest rip-offs ever to appear on the cinema audience. <br /> <br /> I got to see it in the theater, in a 16mm print, which is pretty good I suppose considering how rare this type of material should be in films these days. I consider the film to be about a semi-convincing Gothic atmosphere and involuntary humor, but that's all. The monster of the Aztec mummy looks good, it also has some mobility on his face that is better than most movie monsters of the period. But the robot is pitiful, although it is interesting that they have made the human face totally visible. It is a "human robot" or something like it explains a bit in the film. I think he's considered an android. So technically in hard-science fiction terms this movie should be called "Android vs the Aztec mummy", but I doubt anyone was too concerned about the technicalities here any more than they were worried about quality. In fact the film is so messy as to make the television look good. Even the dubbing from Mexican to English is lazy and weak - for example at one point the hero says "I could even start from the beginning ..." what kind of translation is that? Couldn't they at least tell him "start over from the beginning" so that it didn't sound repetitive? A publisher of a high school newspaper could have corrected the script for this film. It's the epitome of utilitarian film production, there's absolutely nothing in this film that doesn't need to be there for the film's basic commercial purpose. They made no other effort to make it than they had, and considering the large recycled material I doubt they actually spent more than a week making this film. <br /> <br /> Now I will stop posting on this the principle that I don't want to spend more energy on the commenting process than the creators of the film actually spent during the making.
