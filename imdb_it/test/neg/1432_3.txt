I saw this movie on video the other night and found myself snoozing from all this uninspired snoozefest. First of all, one of my biggest doubts is when films like this are characterized by horror movies. It's a thriller! do it well! It has no monsters or anything supernatural. It's just a film about a twisted serial killer (in reality there is a very small number of bodies so it's more like a serial torture movie and did a good job of torturing me). The basic premise of a man who attracts teenagers to his home of horrors through online chat rooms could have made a great movie, but we only see it to attract a couple of teenage girls through the internet at the beginning of the film. One of these girls turns out to be the daughter of a local detective and gets emotionally involved in the case. The film quickly changes from a potentially clever sado-masochistic thriller to a boring old cat and mouse between the incredibly boring detective and the psychopath Captain Howdy / Carleton Hendricks properly played by Twisted Sister writer / producer / frontman Dee Snider. The occasional attempts to poetically interpret the poems on the positive effects of pain and the like by Snider are ridiculous. If she is trying to get people to subscribe to these opinions through this film, she fails miserably and (unintentionally) sheds light on her. The direction of John Pieplow (whose only previous one was Jurassic Women, which I will let speak for itself) did not inspire and there was something wrong with the editing that led the film to be disconnected with some scenes completely unrelated to the film plot, unless the script is at fault (which is entirely possible). This film is a completely failed attempt in a thriller that tries to pass like a horror movie that is just a result that makes me boil at the sight of some graphic piercings. If you see it in your video store don't waste your money, but if you need something to laugh about one night and Strangeland is on cable, you can also watch. 3 out of 10
