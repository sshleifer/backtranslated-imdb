As useless characters, horrible and boring movies. Saved in short sex scenes, crazy witch, beautiful desert island and Brooks body. The plot is tenuous, the characters are superficial and unpredictable. That said, I was able to see everything, mainly because I was totally paralyzed by the trembling and the kind of hope that his character would eventually become good. The film was well shot, well directed, but maybe the casting disappointed in some way. Disappointing. Really summarized the review in the first line but this website requires you to write at least 10 lines. It would be better to spend time watching another movie.
