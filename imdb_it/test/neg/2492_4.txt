There are many other comments on how scarce this film is. What I wanted to emphasize is how this film took the biggest scientific project in history and made it small. The Manhattan project was an incredible achievement and it was enormous. Virtually all the silver in the country went to make the wire for electromagnetic separators. If there was a choice between two alternative ways of doing things, they did both. The first sustained nuclear reactor was fired under the stands of the University of Chicago football stadium with graduate students holding axes as a scram mechanism. It is a fascinating story that involves hundreds of places and thousands of people that this film seems to be reduced to a small group of eccentrics in New Mexico. The other thing I didn't really like was the huge moral debate about whether we should continue the project after Germany gave up. Ok, we have thousands of (especially) men who have worked for years to make a real boom. Does anyone think he didn't want to see it work? There has been some controversy at the moment if we were to use the device, but it was not that bad, clearly not the huge debate that this film proves to be.
