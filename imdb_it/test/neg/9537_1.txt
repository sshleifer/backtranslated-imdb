I like bad movies, but this thing is a steaming pile. From trembling cameramen to horrible sound and devastating acting, don't waste a second on this pile. The fifth grade could have made a better film and the first students could have written a better script. Do you want a real synopsis? Ugly chicks in neon bikinis that dance for too long. A bumpy plot made worse by the horrible acting. The sets at the venue weren't even passable. The church scenes take place in a dance studio, and oh yes - what is it with the two tap-dance numbers that emerge from nowhere? <br /> <br /> Oh, and the total number of bare breasts, which I couldn even save this movie - 0. Add this to the trash can.
