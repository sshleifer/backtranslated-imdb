This is a nice series of family moves that I'm sure most kids will appreciate, but with really not so much to please the adults watching the movie. The premise of the film is that the character of Belushi's policeman takes his retreat but is dragged into a case that leads him to become a private investigator. The plot of the film is so obvious that most children will definitely choose the ending before it happens. But in addition to this there seem to be narrative arcs and secondary textures that are forgotten as the film progresses. This is combined with a secondary plot in which the K-9 holder is exploited by Belushi. One to avoid I'm afraid.
