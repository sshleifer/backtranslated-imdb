One of Bolls's best attempts. Just show that if you do something long enough you just have to improve by chance. It is still not good but it is at least watchable that it is an improvement over blood. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry is that Farcry's story was not the strong point of the games while Bloodrayne had a strong story and therefore Boll had more chances to ruin it. <br /> <br /> The action in this film is actually quite good. Occasionally an exaggerated touch, but in a good way and deserves a watch just for that. <br /> <br /> Acting was pretty decent. Most of the actors are pretty good but it can be said that they don't take it seriously based on comparison with other performances. But the lighter atmosphere that this gives to the film really helps. <br /> <br /> Even though I think sticking a little more to the game's story may have made a slightly better movie, the changes made are quite practical and not big enough to make a difference. Especially given the game's plot, hardly Oscar won only one vehicle for the FPS carnage. I would have liked to set it in the jungle as it was an integral part of the game, but Canada does not have a large amount of Jungle and is at least set in a sort of rainforest. <br /> <br /> Because Boll feels the need to modify already programmed and professionally managed game plots that I don't know, but it does. And until he starts letting the source material speak, his adaptations will always be missing. Watch the movie for a laugh is good for this and maybe to watch during a party like party meat.
