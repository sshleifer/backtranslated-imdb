I can only imagine that this film was a failed experiment. Years ago, he would have moved the images accompanied by music. Later, it would have been added to silence. In the end it would have been Technicolor, Cinemascope or Imax. This film must have been a misleading attempt to introduce a new element into the speaking image. During all emotional scenes, the character stops in the middle of the dialogue and their inner thoughts are narrated as they look into the distance or appeal to the camera. This interruption is at least painful. Imagine these high-level actors trying to seem engaged while the narrative continues to focus. Painful. I have no idea who invented this, but it was the only time I saw it used, and for good reason. In each scene the actors were forced to roll their eyes, to twist their hands, or to exaggerate to such an extent, in reality I wondered if it was really a comedy. <br /> <br /> History is a hopeless soap opera that takes place over a couple of generations. Norma Shearer, disappointed by love, looks for a reason to live. She has a friend, played by Ralph Morgan, who loves her - but she takes it for granted. She is attracted to a doctor, played by Clark Gable, but is engrossed and not interested in her. He is satisfied with a weak person who desperately needs her. She marries him only to discover that there is madness in his family and he can never have a child with him. The doctor arrives who selfishly opens a muffin in his oven, only to find out later that he loves her, after all. The child builds trust in her husband that becomes a success, but realizes that it is really Clark who loves, after all. Confused again? Forget the rest, just look at a couple of episodes of "As the World Turns" and everything will become clear. <br /> <br /> If you're ever forced to watch this movie, protect the final scene. The rotations of the actors put Harold LLoyd to shame. It is not to be missed.
