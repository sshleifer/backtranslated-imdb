The gates of Hell opened and spit out this movie, and then closed it again. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie makes me appreciate other films I've seen, like all the other films. Nothing makes sense in this film. <br /> <br /> It would be really too long to talk about all the problems of the plot. Indeed, apart from a warning, it is not worth wasting part of the almost infinite space available on the Internet to write about this film. <br /> <br /> From now on, I'll check IMDb before watching any movie. <br /> <br /> Hot darn, IMDb forces me to write more about this movie. I guess I should warn you about Edison Force while I'm at it. But if you had to choose between the two, choose Edison Force.
