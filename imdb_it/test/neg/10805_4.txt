The movie Soultaker is essentially an old final destination in which several cars destroyed teenagers have their souls separated from their bodies and have to cheat the death that follows them ... The film has its moments, and its concepts, the idea of disoriented souls separated from their bodies is a very pretty idea ... If this movie had been redone with some good actors / actresses and some fantastic special effects, it could be extremely impressive ... As for the film, I recommend watching the movie Version MST3K, the pure version may be too boring to sit on, unless you love bad movies watching Martin Sheen's brother ...
