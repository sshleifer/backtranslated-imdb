The jealous husband holds the car dealer hostage, while Williams afflicts the spectator with his wear and tear consumed at every turn. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Pay channel grist. An unusually bad script coupled with an unconvincing Robin Williams as a cunning chatterbox, a car salesman from Queens, involved in a hostage crisis at work. There are no laughs, the message (s) or morals are all wrong, and the film can never decide whether it is a comedy or a drama. Pretty well the cast behaves quite badly. When a film gets old so fast, you become a stinker. There is not much else to say except perhaps, avoid at all costs. Mediocre films like this are actually more boring and less pleasant than the most powerful bombs.
