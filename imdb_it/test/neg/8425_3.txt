After reading so many brilliant reports about "To serve all my days", I went out and bought it for Christmas. A waste of money, I'm afraid. I was looking forward to doing something in the same "Brideshead Revisited" championship and some of the few other great British television productions, but this is definitely not among them. <br /> <br /> The characters are too good to be true, wrapped in a very predictable plot and with the most banal and extravagant script I've heard in years. Yes, it has its moments, but they are very thin on the ground. The leading actor is interesting, especially for his disquieting resemblance to Anthony Andrews (Sebastian in 'Brideshead'), just darkness. But his undisputed talents are wasted on an unbearably self-important and fussy character. His modesty is attributed to the effects of his experiences in the Somme during the First World War. He makes the first episodes, focusing on his nervous condition, better than he does later with the squeaky, wealthy socialist. <br /> <br /> Women are absolutely incredible, as in the non-real. His first wife is annoyingly gooey and twittering, his girlfriend, the perfect sophisticated bitch, and the last woman a mix of politicians. The most interesting characters are Howarth (Alan MacNaughton) and one of the other masters, named Hobarth, I have forgotten the name of the actor. <br /> <br /> The high preaching of the script is typical of Andrew Davies, screenwriter, in his early years, and becomes boring within the first two episodes (this mini-series is 11 episodes long!). In episode 4 I just wanted to go through the devastated thing. <br /> <br /> The music is equally boring, mostly confined to a sloppy piano melody and a choral sung by the boys during the end credits. No expense has been spared on position settings, which gives some visual relief to an otherwise atrocious viewing experience. <br /> <br /> I like stories like this, as a rule, and I am very disappointed with the sweet nature of this series. If you want to see something compelling about WW1 and its side effects, there are many other much more refined vehicles to rent or buy. One that comes to mind is "The Unknown Soldier" from 1998. The characters in this Masterpiece Theater presentation are real and fascinating and move, unlike the two-dimensional puppets in "To serve them all my days". For films about men's schools, follow "Goodbye Mr Chips" or "Tom Brown's Schooldays". <br /> <br /> I know this goes against the general favorable view of this mini-series, but I highly recommend that you think twice before shelling out $ 80.00 for Acorn Media for their set of 4 DVDs, 2 discs of which on my set they had insurmountable problems with freezing and jumping.
