One of the worst movies I've ever seen! After seeing it, I go out like, what happened? I'm confused until today, can anyone explain that movie to me please? both the acting and the quality of the images are so bad, you will think that you are looking at the school project of someone made with a home video camera. First of all, I can't believe that some people could give 10 stars to this movie. Because, it's an incredibly bad movie! This movie is not scary at all! There are not even typical horror clich√©s. The plot and the acting of This movie was terrible. It's not fantastic, surreal or horror, it's just a bad Turkish movie. Finally there were many useless scenes and unnecessary characters. When I look at 'Gomeda' I fell into such a desperate situation, so sad for the young Turkish filmmaker. Please, please don't make 'cinema' like this!
