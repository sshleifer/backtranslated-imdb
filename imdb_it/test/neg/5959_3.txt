OK, so I recently collected a lot of vip and hardgore titles on DVD and I have to say this is one of the most disappointing. A more recent film than other titles in the Hardgore catalog, was a version directly on DVD. I've always been interested in the myth of el chokeberry since I saw a documentary about it as a teenager. however this film is a terrible down down on dythy the plot and the acting are terrible, it took me three years to watch this movie to the end. While the economic horror films of the 80s and 90s are good because of their budget and low-cost comedies, this film is not. <br /> <br /> before watching other titles in the hardgore series, boneyard for example is older but much better.
