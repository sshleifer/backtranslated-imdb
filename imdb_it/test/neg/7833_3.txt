A quick summary: almost inexistent musical soundtrack, poorly chosen, shooting in steady cam without the constant but with a lot of coffee and a hyperactive operator, NO plot, and nothing ever happens. The film passes from one dialogue to another, it sounds empty, it never reaches depth, it never creates the illusion of really being inside a web of conspiracies, and the fact that everyone has a relationship with everyone is just a boring excuse for show the main actress in nice underwear. (which, in combination with its rusty voice, is certainly beautiful, but on which not to base a film) The highest point for me is the opening scene, and the film is just degraded from there to a point where I wanted simply leave the movie 45 minutes into the story. I regret having opened it.
