Oh boy, oh boy. This film is something for lovers of "real" cineatique art. In reality it makes absolutely no sense. It's totally boring, especially because of the "anti-climax". All people behave more than strange and unrealistic. Sometimes it feels like sitting in a theater, because in dialogue the actors tend to face the camera (and therefore the audience) instead of one another. As I said before, if you're in those more artistic films shown in Cannes, do it. If you are not, it is better to leave this film alone, because you will be more than disappointed, and in the end you know you have wasted time - like I did. Two thumbs down ...: - (((
