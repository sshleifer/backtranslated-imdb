This is a semi-fictional memorial of an "international man" who has witnessed various political upheavals over the past 30 years. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that this film would offer a unique view of politics and war. I also hoped that it would be touching and touching. However, I was disappointed with this film. "Chico" seemed fragmented, with the main character, Ricardo, staying in a country for 10 or 20 minutes. As expected, no detailed plot could be processed in this time frame. His apologies that moved to another place were often explained in a superficial way. The result was a disappointing collection of fragmented clips shot in various countries.
