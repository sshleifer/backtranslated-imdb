If only I had read the review by Alex Sander (sic) here rather than considering the evaluation of over 6 from a selected choice of the audience of ignorant spectators, I would not have seen this profanation. Alien was a fantastic, dramatic and well done horror / science fiction film. Predator was a big science fiction / action mess. In fact, I only blame myself, since I saw "Alien versus Predator". It too has an average rating of over 6 stars by film connoisseurs who frequent this site. <br /> <br /> STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY FEAR OF THIS MAP SUSPENSES THAT IT IS RUINED FOR YOU. <Br /> <br /> From the beginning this film was ridiculous. No explanation was offered for passing the Predator ship / not overtaken by the Aliens. OK, so maybe they were throwing the aliens back to Earth to hunt them down and something went wrong, but how did this result in an Alien / Predator hybrid and why the rest of the crew didn't realize before despite the their great technology? The beginning was actually the most consistent and interesting part of the film, because we had an idea of ​​who was who or what it was and, perhaps, why. From that moment on it becomes really ridiculous. I always leave my disbelief above the screen door in disbelief before entering and picking it up while I go out. I couldn't here. <br /> <br /> A father and son are hunting in the woods. The damaged ship crashes to the ground (from the given point of view) I would calculate at least 10 odd miles far through a thick forest. The man and the boy follow you alone and find the ship and hug each other. Even at this point you feel very little for them, especially because the troublemakers of the face are almost comical rather than scary in their movements and actions and the father seems such an irresponsible, mute and arrogant muppet. <br /> <br /> A thriller-type scenario is introduced with an ex-cone who returns to the city near the scene of the accident to be met by his friend a little emotionless, boring friend of the policeman from the bus. When I say introduction I mean a weak attempt with disgusting actors and no feeling is played. A slasher / horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable boy who is beaten by the overly protective, crazy and bad type of Jock (non-Scottish American sportsman). By the way, the cute / not cute boy is the brother of the former scam. Yes, these brother directors are intelligent, whose name I will research to avoid any other shit they put out again. So a modern turnaround, oh, so boring PC attempt, the introduction of Ripley's credential type character arrives with a woman coming home to her husband and son. <br /> <br /> Guess what will happen next? I won't tell you much more about the actual (smiles sadly to himself about the disappearance of the narrative in most recent films) plot in case you have come this far and are not the brightest star in the Alien-filled universe. <br /> <br /> The Predator is stupid for the reasons indicated in the previous poster I read too late. Aliens are boring. The Predator-Alien is ridiculous. Action is sometimes a wild, gratuitous, disgusting absurdity. The hospital scene with pregnant mothers?!?! Oh, I was shocked, okay Shocked by how few people are going to take what? A scare? Any shocks? To titillate the pervert? What? If you really wanted to shock, titillate and frighten people who are not pregnant or waiting for fathers or who don't have souls, why not make Alien / Predator fuck naughty women and teenagers rather than kill them? The characters have no depth nor the plot. It is filmed and badly paced. It is acted by disinterested people, not that I can blame them. It also tarnishes two sets of rather interesting and interesting sci-fi characters. This movie was rubbish and if you have fun with it I really have to worry about you. If you haven't seen it then, please make your decision. <br /> <br /> PS Did I even mention the way in which trained soldiers are killed in about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive all the time?
