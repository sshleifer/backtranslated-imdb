Chris Ricci dozes his way through most of this, but then quickly takes on an air of boredom and disdain - just like I did when I looked at him. Without her, this would be nothing more than a cheap children's movie, but at least it adds an air of quality. There are few, if any, visually surprising and charismatic young actresses in the business world. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with this as long as you accept for what it is: an economic remake of Disney aimed at very demanding children. I could watch Ricci all day, so I'm probably not aware of many of the movie's shortcomings, but unless you're a fan of Ricci, a cat lover, or a very small child, I doubt you'll find it very funny.
