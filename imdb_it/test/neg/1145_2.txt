I'm a fan of some of the Vacation movies, but when a movie series goes from the big screen to the TV screen, you know it's crazy. Made for TV National Lampoon movies don't look good on TV. This film is another reason. <br /> <br /> I think many of us were thrilled when it came out, but we also had to face reality ... it's a TV movie. Randy Quaid is good as Cousin Eddie, but is better in a secondary role than the protagonist. Dana Barron sets the story as the first actor to resume her role as one of Griswold's children. It's just as pretty, but it doesn't help a subtle script. <br /> <br /> Why was this film made? It was probably because NBC recently gathered more years of X-mas Vacation presentation. There is nothing wrong with acting. It's all in the script. It's not so funny. People have to think before writing things like this. It's a Christmas movie that I don't recommend.
