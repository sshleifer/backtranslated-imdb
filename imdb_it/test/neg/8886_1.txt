We rented the movie and maybe the worst movie ever. The box they had in the video store had an interesting looking monster on the cover, but in reality the monster was a creature of the black mask of the lagoon. Terrible, terrible, horrible ... actually you may have to rent it, it's so ugly. Looks like you're watching a bice-o home movie.
