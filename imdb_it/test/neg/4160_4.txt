*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> I saw this movie last night at the screening. I already started to like Tim Robbins and to love science fiction. The first third of the film was very beautiful. The soundtrack was good, the cinematography was interesting, the vision of the director's future was nevertheless realistic and yet extremely interesting. I remember thinking to myself: "this is the smartest science fiction movie I've seen in a while". So they couldn't just keep it together. <br /> <br /> Although from the beginning, there were many other "rough" problems with this film (in particular the editing and later some of the writings / plot development), these problems were forgivable. They became unforgivable once the film lost all momentum around the middle point, and then the film became boring when you realized it wouldn't go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Robbins couldn't breathe life into his character, but he did the best he could. Her female counterpart (her name escapes me now) was good in her role. <br /> <br /> The main reason for the film's meander seemed to be that the directors could not decide whether to make a sci-fi movie or a futuristic love story. They ended up with neither. <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> Some videos: grainy, they seemed "21 days later" a few times. <br /> <br /> Very suitable for a futuristic film like this. <br /> <br /> I have dug some of the position shots. <br /> <br /> The music was beautiful. <br /> <br /> The vision of the directors of the future was realistic but still interesting and interesting. <br /> <br /> I liked the interactions with the other minor characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Some of the writings were interesting (soon). <br /> <br /> The girl who played Maria Gonzales (a name she doesn't remember) was good. <br /> <br /> *** UNDERLYING SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Some questions / comments: <br /> <br /> I heard that many of the futuristic things in this film were convenient for arrange a patchwork story. That is VIRUS. Obviously the virus that sent her to the end of the movie that made her physically "scared" by him was right there so that they could stay in another sex scene and then she could meet him uncontrollably for Code 46. Then they take away and erase his memory and the film ends. The classic "dream sequence" ends if you ask me. ties everything up very well if it makes everything a dream true? <br /> <br /> Was Robbin's character naturally as good as intuition or was it the virus? <br /> <br /> Why didn't they explore the myriad of problems surrounding the girl being a clone of her mother? This could have made an interesting story. <br /> <br /> At first I like the greetings of the whole world in everyone's speech. But it became intrusive mainly because their accents were not convincing. I understand, the future will undoubtedly be more racial and culturally more androgynous, but in the end it started to feel like an AT & T Global Networking commercial. <br /> <br /> If they were "out" how could they have been arrested for code 46? <br /> <br /> "Cover" has never been well defined. Sometimes it seemed as trivial as a visa, and at other times it was as vital as life or death. Again, the loose definitions allow them to use it to glue together disparate parts of the plot. <br /> <br /> Ok, I'm starting to get negative, so I'll stop. There were some interesting scenes and interesting things about this film, but this gave her only 4/10
