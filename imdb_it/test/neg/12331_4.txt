What about this movie? A married couple has more than just each other. After playing for a while things get more serious. We must make a difficult choice: to continue the old situation or to start all over again following the heart. Guess what happens at the end. <br /> <br /> This film seems to have a very low budget. But a good story doesn't have to be expensive. It looks like a game converted into a movie only by using different economic positions (at least a few other visible people) more than just the stage, in this the house. From the first minute future developments are as clear as water. Nothing unexpected happens. Sometimes you might think about watching a soft porn movie, in which case you know in advance that there is no story. <br /> <br /> I find this film disappointing, so this explains the grade (4).
