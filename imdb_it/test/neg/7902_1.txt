Wow, this is really a stereotyped and terrible rejection. I'm sorry for anyone who lost their money to see it. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure I didn't laugh once during this movie, I really can't believe they would make such a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I will now be more cautious when I watch movies late at night. <br /> <br /> this is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I'm not saying it's the worst movie in existence (although it could be), but I don't think I've seen anything so stupid and unpleasant in my life. makes the Scary Movie series look smart. <br /> <br /> 1/10 I would give a 0 if they would let me
