Critics have begun to call it the Oscar-winning club, understandably. What later Halle Berry won it for Monsters Ball, going directly to the diabolical Catwoman. Hilary Swank triumphs in Boys Do not Cry and follows him with The Core. Jamie Foxx takes a dive like a pilot in the boring Stealth after taking a gong for Ray. Now it seems like Hollywood star star Charlize Theron is bumping into her "monsters" Oscar with this one of the worst science fiction shows ever made. <br /> <br /> The film loses interest in the audience after only 20 minutes, which means the only thing that is really worth staying for is the fact that, despite the fact that the film is rubbish, Charlize Theron is still an exceptional actress who is clearly doing the best of a rough and laughable premise. Not only is uxon Flux ultimately superficial, but for an action film it is also very boring. It will be really interesting for comic fans and Horney teenagers who like the idea of ​​Theron running half naked for 90 minutes. Flux can really fail. <br /> <br /> Against the 2011 virus that kills 99% of the world population, and in the last city on Earth, Bregna, the survivors, about four hundred years later, in the year 2415, continue to live in the Goodchild dynasty , the name of the scientist who developed his cure. <br /> <br /> Not everything goes well in this utopia and it is not what lies beyond its high walls that protects its citizens from the endless jungle, but an unspoken and unwritten taboo that holds and binds this taboo unwritten that holds and binds these unfortunates together that lies within these walls of paranoia, conformity and indisputable obedience. Shot in Berlin and its surroundings, ironically, this is a story set against a totalitarian state, a fortified city, where its peoples are no longer able to reproduce, and its sinister and secret plot of how it sustains life. <br /> Flon Flux is the murderer who was assigned by the underground rebels to change the course of humanity, forever. This is the story of his struggle for justice, freedom and revenge. <br /> <br /> On Flux he combined disgusting narratives, pressing rhythms and truly terrible effects. It looks more like an unrealistic video game than a movie. The only thing that is fortunate to fail is that no sequels are in the works, Flux may just be the beginning and the end of what could have been one of the worst franchises in history, thank God for the picky box office takings of then. <br /> <br /> My final verdict on this really bad feature? There's really not a story here, only Charlize Theron leaping into a black dress like a hopper of grass. The acting is very woody and lacking in emotion compared to the other cinemas that are out there today. It's too much to be like an adaptation and actually it doesn't take much from the comic, which is what I expected, the only thing that was done halfway right that pays tribute to the cartoon was the flight of eyes in the eye scene. Avoid at all costs.
