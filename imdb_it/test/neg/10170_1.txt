This is without doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. And believe me, I've seen a lot of movies. The incredible turn the film makes - moving from an extremely negative film "Alien Lifeforms Earth Earth" with a bad acting, to a film that tries to spread an Archchristian "Judgment day is near, look for Jesus or if it will burn for 'eternity in the fiery message of hell' - left me stunned after being tormented for 85 minutes. Even religious Christians must be ashamed or angry by looking at their published beliefs in this way. I didn't know what to do with myself when I looked at the horrible acting that could have been done by 7-year-olds. Simply disgusting. I am not a Christian nor very religious. But if I had been, I would no longer have been afraid of hell. Rich Christiano has proven to be something much, much worse.
