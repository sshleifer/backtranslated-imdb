When you watch low-budget horror movies like I do, you get to where you can tell who was involved in making the film, as each director adds his own taste to the cheese. This is the case with Jack-O. When I saw this really terrible movie, I had the undeniable feeling that Fred Olen Ray was involved, maybe not as a director but somehow, and while I was studying it, I found out I was right. Only Fred and a handful of others could write something so pathetic, and this movie just blew Fred Olen Ray. Unless you like Fred Olen Ray (and God knows why someone would want to) avoid this movie. If you're about to rent a photo of Olen Ray, rent Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers, it's the only bright and shining star in the darky cheesey universe of terrible movies.
