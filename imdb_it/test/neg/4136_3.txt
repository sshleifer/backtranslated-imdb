I can only assume that the previous posts came from executives of the production company ... <br /> <br /> I attended the UK premiere last night. Zane and Brook participated (they probably knew I would be there) and they are undoubtedly stars, but what a turkey of a movie. I felt sorry for them sometimes, when the audience burst out laughing into what were serious "thriller" scenes. <br /> <br /> But maybe I missed the point. Perhaps an element of irony was expected. If so, pure genius. Otherwise, career genocide. <br /> <br /> Among the positive aspects, Zane always shines and Brook can actually act a little. As the other half said (as we ended the cinema, with broken ribs), they can be forgiven for this movie as they both look like good people! The screenwriter, however, should be abandoned.
