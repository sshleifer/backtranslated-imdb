I don't know which was worse, the spectators' spectacles or the stars of this film seem to be drugged. Do I have to believe that this woman raised this child for seven years, and never noticed that the child was a little dark? I have to believe that her mother, her father and her husband never once said, hmmm, does this child look a little dark? I have to believe that when the courts ordered the mother to see the records of adopted parents, Lisa Hartman had this wow expression on her face, when she told her mother, Christopher is half black! What ! Was it true, do you think? So not only did Grandma and Grandpa look stupid and stupid, they never talked about it once, but I guess we should look surprised and say ... hmmmmm omg he's half black! Absolutely stupid film, almost an embarrassment even to see it!
