When I saw the poster at the theater, I thought it was a "new line" of a horror story without a famous cast that was worth trying. But, after I entered, I wanted to leave after 20 minutes. There were many non-logical and logical flaws. For me, it's a film that isn't worth putting in theaters. It is not even worth seeing.
