Super Troopers was an instant classic. Club Dread, although disappointing for many, had its moments. Puddle Cruisers has fewer moments. I saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and I saw at the bottom that it was made by the Broken Lizard group that created Super Troopers, so naturally I collected it. I found only one scene to laugh out loud. A far cry from Super Troopers. All in all, I was very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you have an abundance of free time and really need to kill some time. However, it is better to play video games or watch something that could make you laugh or think.
