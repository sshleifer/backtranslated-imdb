I gave this film a 2 mainly because it actually has an ok cast but the film itself is just like that (insert unusually rude words that begin with the sixth letter of the alphabet), useless for me to feel bad that I voted for at the time his lowest grade was a three. <br /> <br /> Very predictable plot ... two nare-do-well musicians have no money and many money problems. However, when a friend leaves a bag full of money (which belongs to the drug dealers) to their care, obviously they spend it and then the "fun" begins. <br /> <br /> It is not an original idea in this film.
