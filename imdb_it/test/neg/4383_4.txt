When I was young, I was a big fan of Chuck Norris. I just started shooting all his old movies on video, so I can see them through the eyes of adults. I remember that I really liked this one in particular, and I thought it was one of his best. Now that I'm a little older, I can say that, although it's completely average, I still consider it one of his best films. In a play for him, Norris plays a policeman obsessed with his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer. Serial killers are all the rage nowadays, and people would like to think of them as an invention of all the 90s. On the contrary, it's nice to see where the current infatuation came from, in particular the action films (as well as the stem and the "stripes") of the 70s and 80s. While Norris' attempts at humor and any form of human compassion are crazy and laughable, nobody could kick someone over the head like Chuck. Being a big fan of Steve James, I can recommend this movie, same for the legend of the genre Billy Drago, in addition to seeing Mitch of The Blue Brothers in a supporting role. Not great, but it's better than anything Norris did in the 1990s.
