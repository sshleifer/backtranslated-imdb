1st seen 7/29/2001 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mark Dindal): frantic, frenetic animation effort of Ted Turner's animation group plays a lot like TV cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the field of funny characters but surely he has extremely unpredictable villains. I'm not even sure why children would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that children know very little or nothing. Poor effort at best despite the bad words on the box comparing it to Disney's efforts like Aladdin and Lion King. Do not be fooled - there is no comparison in history or quality.
