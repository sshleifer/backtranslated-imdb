I come from Romania ... so I apologize if my English is not so good. <br /> <br /> I have just finished watching this movie and I must say that I am extremely disappointed. I've always liked Wesley Snipes movies but this is terrible. I'm sorry I spent over 3 hours downloading this movie. There are many mistakes in the film. For example, the stadium in the film is not Lia Manoliu. The name of the stadium is Ghencea. The name of the football team is called Steaua Bucuresti, not Uli. The stadium scoreboard is not able to show graphic images: video reproductions, live images, etc. It's a simple board that can only show letters and numbers. The opponents of Uli's team (Seaua) are displayed on the scoreboard as Din (probably from Dinamo Bucuresti - who is Steaua's main rival in the Romanian football league). The images of the football match come from a match between Steaua Bucuresti and Poli Timisoara (my favorite team and my only love - look on the internet and see why). Police cars in the film are not done correctly. There is not a single dark blue police car in Romania! They are all white! The "error list" can go on and on and on ... but I'll stop here! In short this film is horrible. It's not worth hiring it, it's not worth buying a ticket to the cinema, it's not worth downloading it! I honestly regret that Wesley's cuts have played in this film. A previous film of his ... 7 seconds ... also shot in Romania ... it was OK but it's terrible!
