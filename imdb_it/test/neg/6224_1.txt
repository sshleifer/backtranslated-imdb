There is no better way to describe the HORRENDOUS experience than to look at Mamma Mia: Hitler must look up, saying to the pseudo-director Phyllida Lloyd 'You monster, what did you do?' <br /> <br /> Everything about the film is wrong. As soon as?? Mistaken! Even its success, which is inexplicable. I can understand when those disgusting parody movies, like Epic Movie, make their least bit of money and turn profit just because they are cheap (of course they are!). But when something like Mamma Mia makes $ 450 million worldwide, do you think 'what the hell is wrong with the world?' <br /> <br /> And to think that we have Meryl Streep, one of the greatest living actresses in the world, inside? What was he thinking? "I need money," she could say. Well, sell one of your grandchildren, that too would be less embarrassing. It's not like Meryl is good at a disastrous piece of, err, "film". It's also disastrous! When he sings, even if he has the voice, it's ridiculous. Worse than his only Pierce Brosnan. It was James Bond. Now he sings Abba in a purple spandex during the closing credits of the worst movie ever. Really? And when I mention Abba, not that I have anything against the band and their music. Even if it doesn't help them when the actors begin to sing (badly), to dance (worse) and the extras join them (they jump out of nowhere! Often!) To present one terrible musical sequence after another. You want to cry when the music starts. And I love musicals! But this is the first of its kind in which PRAY for current silence. <br /> <br /> I could go on. The list could go on and on. You could write a Stephen King novel with the complete list of errors in this film. <br /> <br /> To summarize: go see it! Really! You must be a witness to understand !! And since it's already a huge success, who cares if he earns a few dollars more? And you don't like that you're selling your soul to the devil. Meryl did it before. For the whole of humanity. And now the world must end, because we have committed the extreme evil and must be destroyed.
