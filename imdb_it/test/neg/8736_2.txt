"A research scientist is experimenting with human DNA in an attempt to create the perfect human being: his work has reached the point where it can take a human fetus and accelerate its growth to that of an adult in a few days. Creation is a (spoiler omitted), but the side effects of the process (spoiler omitted), "according to the synopsis of the cover of the DVD. <br /> <br /> "Embryo" opens promising: "The movie you are about to see is not all science fiction, it is based on the medical technology that currently exists for fetal growth outside the womb, it could be a possibility tomorrow or today ", according to dr. Charles M. Brinkman III. Right. And, Dr. Joyce Brothers later appears at a party with Roddy McDowall. <br /> <br /> First, we see Rock Hudson (as Dr. Paul Holliston) lighting a cigarette and driving recklessly (look at that speedometer!) during a storm; unfortunately, it hits a dog. Mr. Hudson brings the injured dog home. Learn that she is pregnant and can save the life of one of the puppies, thanks to her experimental knowledge of fetal growth. What is actually reduced is that Hudson uses an experimental drug to grow the embryo, so that it can survive outside the maternal uterus. The dog, "Number one", grows rapidly in adulthood, and is inherited as a mother. <br /> <br /> Hudson lives with his sister-in-law Diane Ladd (as Martha Douglas); since his wife Nicole, also a doctor, died in another car accident. Ms. Ladd seems more emotionally stable about Nicole's death than Hudson's, who survived the accident that killed his wife. Things start to get scary when Hudson's dog shows a level of intelligence far above any normal dog. Thus, Hudson decides to use his accelerated embryo growth on a human being, Barbara Carrera (like Victoria Spencer). <br /> <br /> Hudson and the cast do their best; but the "Embryo" plot is an absurd nonsense. If you remove her silly opening and closing scenes, the valiant characterization of Signora Carrera works almost; it may have been a bigger star if it offered better films than this. The childish end suggests a following; but, fortunately, the idea was interrupted.
