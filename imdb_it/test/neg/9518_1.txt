I couldn't wait to see him at the Sydney film festival. I left the theater, like many others, before the end credits because I couldn't listen to it anymore. It was badly shot, the sound sucks, and the acting was worse than an episode of The Love Boat. Now I know why this film was unable to find an American distribution company to publish it in the United States. This cry of low-budget secondary school production.
