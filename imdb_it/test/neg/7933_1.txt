** Maybe spoilers ** ** difficult to ruin this thing the more it is, but in the event that ** Gee's I don't see how anyone might have liked this re-creation !! It was like a show "made for T.V" and still rather lame for that. A lot of fake snow, bad acting from the best stars, bad deeds and that crazy pine forest in Detroit. What the hell??!! I didn't really think this would be a great movie, but I was hoping to be entertained. No, we fell asleep halfway and had to finish it the next day. I could have jumped the rest easily (but then I would have lost those great pine forests!) I'm so happy I got lost in the theater! Bad enough to have wasted $ 3.50 in the video store. And I'm a lover of cops, action films and dramas. This was a very smelly 1 out of 10 stars. Give me the original every day !!
