I just saw this movie for the first time after buying it on DVD <br /> <br />. This is an economic attempt to cash in Conan's two films. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film does not seem to have the same budget as the Conan films and therefore some sets and effects are not as bright and some scenes seem hasty. <br /> <br /> Nielsen is okay, but unfortunately he is unable to act if a gun is placed on his head. <br /> <br /> Arnie's supporting role seemed to be done as a favor to director Fleischer, who also directed Conan the Destroyer. Maybe Arnie wasn't sure he would continue acting in films like Predator, Total Recall, T2, etc. <br /> <br /> Some of the talisman's female guards at the beginning of the film seemed to have struggled to lift their swords and the looks on their faces suggested that they would have a lot of fun making this film. I couldn't be so jovial if I was fighting for my life. <br /> <br /> All this aside, this film required very little concentration to watch and was pleasantly fun. I've seen a lot worse. Two stars
