Ok, so I forgot to look and I caught only the last episode, thinking it was the first or the second. Honestly, I thought CM would have had at least one other bet to resolve plot points. The Rangers got stuck on the plains ("We'll have to eat horses"), first thing. Little Newt is private, for another. What an end to the downer! But my biggest complaint, esp. if this was the ending, it is that the episode had no suspense, no great climax, no dramatic confrontation. The last fight between Blue Duck and Buffalo Hump was also badly organized. The whole episode had a terrible pace, which is what drives a Westerner. Steve Zahn was watchable, Karl Urban (a Johnny Knoxville player) played Call like a man with a terminal trismus case. All the winking looks and jingling spurs and protruding chin. And the Rangers? They talked big, clean up Texas, then wandered aimlessly in the middle of the city, getting drunk. And how nice of Hal Holbrook to give Val Kilmer his Mark Twain wig and mustache! The Austin set was like the fake Rock Ridge of Blazing Saddles, all facade. I admit that I was attracted to the plot, but this is mainly due to the fact that there were many things I couldn't get thanks to being late in history. If I had looked from the beginning, maybe I wouldn't have reached episode three. Now I have to go look at Silverado to clean my palette.
