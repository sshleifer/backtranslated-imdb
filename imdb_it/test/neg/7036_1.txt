one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but extremely funny (not on purpose though). Every scene that contains something to do with; planes, romance, screenplay or acting are battered. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to all riders, it's so bad you should burst out laughing at one point in the movie (see also Airport 79: Concorde, for the same reason). <br /> <br /> Anyone else, avoid this movie like the plague (except for B-movie fans, of course) <br /> <br /> have fun
