It is as if the editor and screenwriter only had 40 minutes of real time. This should be a remake of a Chinese film, which is obviously far superior to this junk. It is clear that a Hollywood mindless dress or writer has decided that this film would be a hand, man against man, instead of letting the story take place with the personalities of the characters that were built in the first 40 minutes. At this point in the film, the characters do not behave like normal people or even their personalities. It makes little sense. It is quite clear why this film failed. It's not absolutely credible and it's not good, it started with the promise. Don't be fooled.
