The only reason I rented the movie was to see Jeri Ryan! OMG was the most boring and useless film I've ever seen !!! LIKE HIM !!! I really mean, give me a break! After Voyager, I hope you will be offered better roles !! <br /> <br /> If I were one of the last people on earth, I would NOT live in a dessert trailer again !! This is just a bad movie !! The thing about the Indian tribe and how they confronted it every 10 seconds has really gotten old. Poor Jeri, better luck next time!
