and in general, in the end you will have to look for this little gem. When I describe I Changed My Sex, or Glen Or Glenda as it is better known, I must echo the thoughts of Andrew Smith, who struck the nail on his head when he wrote "If you haven't seen any of Ed Wood's other films, this it's a completely disconcerting experience: if you've seen one of Ed Wood's films, this is still completely disconcerting ". The film is both exhilarating and tragic, but it moves with a strange rhythm that leaves no doubt that its author knows and intends every word he utters during his run. Wood, bless him, had some of the highest directorial ambitions, wanting to promote peace, understanding and even acceptance in the 1950s of all time. When Tim Burton recreated a vision of Glen Or Glenda of the studio executives for his biographical film, he showed executives who laughed and said that this was to be a provocation. More than fifty years later, there are still people who fight only to have the kind of respect that the "normal" takes for granted, so I say that it certainly isn't. <br /> <br /> No, the real comedy in Glen Or Glenda is the absolute ineptitude that Wood exhibits in composing his message. The directors often use repertoire material when they find some suitable for their purposes and can be modified to fit their movie. Ed Wood used indiscriminate film recording, and Tim Burton's biopic celebrated the fact with a scene in which Wood, played by Johnny Depp, bets he could make a whole movie out of the repertoire. Unfortunately, the real Ed Wood died before he had a chance, but Glen Or Glenda is the closest he ever got. IMDb says that twenty percent of this sixty-four-hour film is a video, and it's never hard to guess which video. The footage of the busy highways, the planes flying high, the poor lightning effects, the soldiers doing their thing, are all used randomly, sometimes repeatedly, and often have only a loose connection to the story that Wood is trying to tell. If Wood had been able to sit down and think about what he was trying to do for a while, you can't tell what kind of heights he could have achieved. <br /> <br /> Wood himself appears in the film as the character title, a confused transvestite who imagines himself as a woman named Glenda. Apart from the bold way he tries to express his opinion, Wood makes a horrible woman. Finding myself on the margins of a company that thinks it is "disabled" and being "cured" on its own, I have sincerely found myself hoping for the best result for Wood's character. However, to express his point of view, Wood weaves the stories of two other transvestites. One of them takes the extreme step of enduring a sex change to become a woman, the other finds himself so disinherited that he fears being arrested again so much that he commits suicide. The scary thing about this film is that if you have changed the transvestism and replaced such deprivations as my position on the autistic spectrum or things like schizophrenia, very little of the film would also need to be changed. That's how the small company has learned since Ed Wood was a boy. <br /> <br /> The other significant personality of Glen Or Glenda is Bela Lugosi, which Wood has worn in the film. Speculation varies depending on Wood's motivations, but the accepted theory is that Wood wanted to help revive Lugosi's career, and he would do anything to achieve this. With the exception of taking his time to carefully build a good movie, that is. In Glen Or Glenda, Wood makes use of Lugosi which was best described in Flying Saucers Over Hollywood as "bizarre". Lugosi plays an advertised character as The Scientist, but he comes out more like an almighty puppeteer. People who haven't seen Ed Wood's films before the biopic will think Tim Burton invented the speech "watch out for the big green dragon sitting on the threshold of the door". If anything, Burton was holding back on what a bizarre speech he used to describe the Woodian dialogue. Nothing can prepare you to see the speeches in their original context, not even the exhilarating mockery of Criswell during Plan 9 from Outer Space. <br /> <br /> The observant types will also notice the presence of Delores Fuller, Wood's girlfriend at the time. Once again, Burton stages his reaction to seeing the script for the first time, while the film portrays it as accepting and far-sighted. I can't help thinking that Burton's portrait is more accurate, since Fuller seems extremely uncomfortable with his role. He only appears for about fifteen minutes, but his birth seems so mechanical, so lifeless, that he somehow manages to seem less talented than his cast mates, if possible. If Wood's direction were better focused in this case than usual it is difficult to determine, but if the supporting cast's ability to leave the stars (with the obvious exception of Bela) in the dust is a guide, then it should come as no It is surprising that Fuller can only appear in a very small role in another film by Wood. Who continued to write a number of hit songs tells you that he made the right decision to stay behind the camera. While Wood appears again in front of the camera, it has never been more than a cameo, a walk-on, or a bit of bit. <br /> <br /> I gave Glen or Glenda one in ten. I usually attribute this evaluation only to films that are so bad that they become fun. Bold and well-intentioned as he was, Glen Or Glenda adapted this description to a T.
