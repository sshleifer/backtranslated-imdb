Detected by Troma (which is my favorite movie company) Unspeaksble is a messy horror movie that can be interesting but very dark and twisted. <br /> <br /> Inexpressible starts with a family in a car, they run into an accident that leaves a dead daughter and a deformed mother. the father eventually goes mad and cuts prostitutes. He sees his daughter in other people. He kills for her. Meanwhile his deceased wife is raped by his ordained. These are sick people! <br /> <br /> Inexpressible tries to be sick and disturbing and manages to do it as a good horror movie is not. Most of the Troma movies have a sense of humor for them, but still this is not.
