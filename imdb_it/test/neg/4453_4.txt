This film is strange; you have the impression that the creators of this snooze-fest spent more time in local bars than on the set. Indeed, it is a surprise not to see the name of Harry Alan Towers in the credits; certainly it has the flavor of one of its tax-shelter productions, but here the motivation behind the project seems to be for everyone interested in enjoying a prolonged stay in Provence. Despite the fact that the film takes place throughout the region, Les Baux and the area around it are defended almost everywhere. <br /> <br /> David Birney is a remarkably colorless hero, as Michael Lonsdale says at one point "you're a walking clich√©". What Lonsdale is doing in this is anyone's hypothesis. For some reason, the most interesting character, played by Rampling, is put aside, while, regardless of the book, he should have been the central figure because he clearly has the ability to bring the film (which would have been boring anyway, but to At least we would have had more than something nice to look at). <br /> <br /> All in all a useless affair that is worth looking at to see how an action movie can be without action.
