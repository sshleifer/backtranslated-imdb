How can SOMEONE give something higher than a '1'? <br /> <br /> I thought that "Manos, the Hands of Fate" would forever be the worst movie ever to impose itself on my optic nerve. In fact, I didn't think it could be worse. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. "Galaxina" is that rare film in which EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT of it is painfully painful, distressing, blinding. How many times have you seen a movie and commented "Who the hell LIT this thing?" From lighting to the soundtrack, from effects to the script, from acting to cinematography. . . Well, EVERYTHING, this movie is absolutely unbearable. It's so bad I couldn't even say it for a while if it was the worst comedy or the worst drama I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Too bad to be ridiculous. I'd rather eat a plate full of broken glass than put it back.
