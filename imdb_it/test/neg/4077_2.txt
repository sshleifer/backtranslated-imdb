I mean, I went to this movie with my expectations too high. I thought it would be fun because it's the sequel to Bruce Almighty that was really fun and he sees Steve Carell being an excellent comedian, but boy, he sucked. <br /> <br /> The film is advertised as a sequel but in reality it has nothing to do with the original since the only people who resume their roles are Morgan Freeman and Steve Carell but the character of Steve he is completely different, he is no longer the jerk who was in the first one, he is a good boy here. The story is different and the actors are different and it's not fun. <br /> <br /> All the actors involved (Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Wanda Sykes, John Goodman, Ed Helms and even Jon Stewart in a very nasty cameo) have talent but none of them seems to use it and it seems there is in the movie just for the money. <br /> <br /> Now the plot is obviously modeled on Noah's story but there are so many things wrong with it, I don't know where to start. I imagine the big problem is that in all those around Evan he thinks he's crazy despite all the things that are happening to him, a huge white beard grows in two days, he gets help from animals all over the world, he builds a giant bow in few weeks, in real life people will not make fun of these guys, they would say that it is the new Noah. <br /> <br /> Even the special effects are good but what the hell is the biggest wave of movies I've ever shot in Evan Almighty? They really had to waste such good special effects as a filler for this lousy movie. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey seems to be a smart guy since he stayed away from three of the worst sequels ever made, Son of the Mask, Dumb and Dumbered and now Evan Almighty. <br /> <br /> This was a huge disappointment and Tom Shyadac should be ashamed of himself.
