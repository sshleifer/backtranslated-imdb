Imagine a film the exact opposite of Lawrence of Arabia, instead of having an all-male cast, has an all-female cast. Instead of being set in the arid deserts of Arabia, it is set in the lush metropolis of New York City. And instead of being one of the greatest films ever made, it is one of the most useless, boring and forgettable. <br /> <br /> The film is about Mary Haines (Meg Ryan), a perfect wife and mother, the envy of everyone else in the social circle of her high society Manhatten. She is portrayed as a woman who carries the weight of the world on her shoulders, although she needs a life as a nanny and housekeeper to cope with her only child. But I don't want to be too hard on her, Mary does all this while taking a liassez-faire attitude towards the fashion design work her father gave her. This idyllic lifestyle cannot last forever and things start crashing in a very real way. <br /> <br /> Mary's husband betrays her and her father fires her for not working hard enough. It is quite naturally upset and breaks a little. <br /> <br /> Mary needs to recover, however, for the sake of her impressionable young daughter and for herself. It does this through rehabilitation, hair straightening and designing its own clothing line; although surprisingly for this type of film, not a montage. Maria is successful; her daughter loves her, her mother loves her, her friends love her and her husband decides he loves her now. He decides to take back his traitorous husband after realizing that it was his fault if he cheated, since he didn't do enough on him. <br /> <br /> Films are a grace that does not go down "all men are bad" path.
