The only reason I voted for this film as 2 is because Channing Tatumis is beautiful, but the whole film lacks emotion and was boring to watch. I usually love a beautiful love story, but this was just a waste of time, I didn't shed a tear even though it contained sad content, but it wasn't handled very well. I'm not a film critic, but I only advise the girls to really avoid it unless the only reason you're watching is to see Channing Tatum that the rest of the movie is rubbish and if it wasn't inside (not that his acting was good ) I would have stopped looking much faster. It's a real shame, because if the right actors were chosen for this film, it could potentially become a real tear-jerk. .. If you are looking for a good cry or a movie for a girly night in ... give this a miss!
