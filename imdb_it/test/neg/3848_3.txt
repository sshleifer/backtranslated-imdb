Just to save you $ 3, or whatever it costs to rent a movie at your local video store, and the distressing now and, however, this movie is a simple plan. Go to a friend's house, talk to him about renting The Pest for you, look at the first 30 seconds or so and then find an excuse to leave. The opening sequence is really fun, definitely worth watching. Unfortunately, the other 99% of the movie is horrible. Without the shower scene at the beginning, this is one of the worst movies of all time.
