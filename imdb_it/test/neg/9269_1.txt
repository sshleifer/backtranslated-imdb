It is difficult to decide where to start. I bought it for a few pounds and Iv's worst worst ever. The back of the DVD had no images and a few summary lines, this should have warned me, but I usually like bad movies for a laugh, so I decided to try it. The film consists of three stories, each of which revolves around someone who was on a particular bus at one point (he never made it clear what the meaning of the bus is or in what city it is set) <br /> <br / > POSSIBLE SPOILERS (as if there was something to ruin) The first story is about a man who is persuaded, from a car, to whatever, against the wishes of his wife. The car is a bit like a demonic Brum and takes over his life. <br /> <br /> The second is about a faded man who never cleans his fridge and grows a monster of bacteria. <br /> <br /> The third of a woman who goes to a dating agency, only to find that her date is not so normal. <br /> <br /> Among these, we are treated to blows of the bus (or a bus anyway) while a narrator agitates on a load of garbage on relationships (in reality, it is as if he were in commission for having called 'relations') <br /> <br /> The film actually has no saving features. The acting, the costumes and the little Spfx are all disgusting. There isn't even an attractive member of the female cast to admire. In short, this film is a disaster.
