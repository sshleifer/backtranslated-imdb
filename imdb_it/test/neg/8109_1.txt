There may be some SPOILERS AHEAD but I doubt it. I have no idea how the script of this one got past the shredder. It's horrible. Completely unwatchable. I stood there for 45 minutes (about half the execution time) and couldn't stand it anymore. I was a fan of Elijah Wood in the 90s (see "The War") and I learned to enjoy the changes of Mandy Moore from sparkling wine to serious this year (see "Chasing Liberty" which is surprisingly fun). I saw pieces of "Run Lola Run". So with three contacts that I liked should be fine. It wasn't. No one gave a good performance. Wood's Jones was flat. For an aspiring writer he had almost no imagination (his violent fantasies seemed robbed of "A Christmas Story" and his lustful were - eh, a cross between boring and alarming). Powerful is absolutely unlikely from the first second and I only know that she should have been "THE FAMILY" by reading the box. Speaking of the synopsis, anyone who has worked on that job has made the film fun, bizarre, romantic and very funny. Whoever that person was, he or she should have been employed to rewrite this script. Halfway, I didn't care about any of the characters anymore. Moore's Lisa is an aspiring actress who is bubbly and a little conniving (for no apparent reason), but her ridiculous theatrical period (which should be fun in the presentation) is on par with the rest of the script. A happy and romantic comedy is supposed to end up in this turkey - given the material of the character they had to work with, I can't imagine it. Save your money. Tell your friends. DO NOT watch this movie.
