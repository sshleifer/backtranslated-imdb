This seemed very similar to CHILD'S PLAY movies except much worse. A lawyer tries to save a criminal, convicted of killing his son, from execution. She fails. The lawyer's daughter then finds a puppet that the killer has buried with her son and is immediately attached to it. Then, after many people were seriously injured, they find the little girl who secretly talks to the doll saying that she didn't hurt anyone. During this film I found myself wondering 'why am I looking at this cheeze?' over and over. The end sucked so badly that I went to watch the Disney cartoon version soon after and slept with the light on.
