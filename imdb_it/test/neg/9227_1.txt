Jungle terror is a real find. If you've seen it, you're one of the lucky few. It's hilarious! <br /> <br /> The story is about a plane crashing in the middle of the South American jungle. The scene of the accident must be seen to be believed. Everyone dies in the crash or is subsequently eaten alive by crocodiles. Only a young blond boy survives. A neighboring tribe takes the child to their village and they (all the males) worship him because of his golden hair! I'm kidding you NOT! In the end, there is a lot of struggle between the natives and the man in search of possible survivors of the shot down plane. All the while, the child sits on a throne and his blond hair is surrounded by a golden halo and cries relentlessly !! It's a hoot !!! <br /> <br /> Very obscure and contains very questionable subtitles. A must if you like dark movies, it's so bad.
