All I can say is that this movie is made for Lifetime Channel on TV, which means that there are no solid characters, no particular style, weak acting of all kinds of sex suggested but no breasts and tits (because boy, would it be just catapult the movie into the depths of Sleaze, right?) but the highly simulated sex, well, that's fine. <br /> <br /> When I watch these films I have to ask myself, when will these types of TV channels and their advertisers ever grow? I think these companies are really behind the times. They have no idea what is in tune with the younger generation and if they knew he would like us to change. The central point of many American television channels like these seems largely to regurgitate the same cleaned and disinfected garbage, like a generic film assembly line. I guess it works for them ... or at least it was. I'm not sure of the future though. <br /> <br /> Don't bore yourself to death like I did. Search for real TV movies on HBO, Showtime, IFC, Starz, etc. Any channel that puts an effort into their work and doesn't have to ask a priest what they can or can't show.
