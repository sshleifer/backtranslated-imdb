Even the MST3K could not make this painful, long, and ultimately the mind-bending drek fun or funny. While the worst movies on their own are hilarious, this is one of those few videos that uses the word bad in its literal sense. <br /> <br /> The element that makes PAINFUL so to look at is not the lack of history, but the fact that SOOOO is very involved in the first half hour is absolutely ridiculous and difficult to follow compared to a motorway while you drive without headlights. <br /> <br /> The hero of the film, Ator, is nothing but a feast for the eyes of this literal energy-sucking film. Dressed in a strip of fabric and with "pectorals like melons", as Joel says, it belongs more to a fitness magazine than here. <br /> <br /> I would advise him ONLY to die hard, and I mean hard followers of cheese. If you have an enemy, recommend this movie. If you can, I recommend you. You should be able to get through anything.
