Reading the book I felt attracted once again by Castle Rock (Needful Things is the last part of the Rock trilogy), and the plot was a variation of the story "The demon comes to a small red village" as King likes it . The characters were all described with loving details, and it was a good horror both psychological and bloody. The film on the other hand is horrible. The interactions between characters and the intelligent plot are over, and replaced by a story that tries to be exciting but lacks a mile. If you haven't read the book, then you could enjoy this, otherwise avoid it at all costs, as in most of King's books.
