About twenty years ago, Charles Bukowski was a hero of mine. I blindly accepted the image created by intellectual types and seen in various films. Of course, I never had the chance to meet the intellectual types who prescribed Bukowski as a hero. They could usually be found safely behind the counter in hipster video stores and record stores. These people barely spoke and when he asked a question, he usually grinned and nodded in a vague direction. They were useless when it came to identifying a specific title, but their shelves were always full of strange and unique titles. To be included in the secret club of low-waisted trousers, I thought I had to abandon my bourgeoisie to grow and marry counter-culture. <br /> <br /> My introduction to Bukowski began with the film Barfly, a movie from the late 1980s that starred Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunnaway. I was a fan of Rourke at the time. He also embodied a sort of modern, modern male anti-hero, a dark intellectual type. At that time, this fascinated me. The Barfly hero makes a mockery of the convention. A tramp from the mid-1930s, who lives without constraints, does not answer to anyone, - Oh - and to be recognized as a genius by a snobbish and hot woman, the icing on the cake. Later, I read Post-Office and Hollywood, and later Bukowski commented on his experience with the film. Now, let me quickly move on to the latest film based on the book by Bukowski Factotum, one I read and appreciated. Bukowski takes the form of Chinaski in this novel. I often wonder where Bukowski ended up and Chinaski started. 20 years after Barfly, the fiction film Bukowski is still the same. I saw about an hour of the film and I have not yet seen the signs of cracking the facade. That's why Factotum Bukowski was my hero. Chinaski is beautiful (played by Matt Dillon). His hair is clean and neat, in style, but not over the top. When Dillon smokes and writes, he looks cool. Chinaski switches from one job to another, ignoring and / or fighting with various leaders. He holds two floozies, one of which lives with him, goes out, only to return with a small repercussion. Chinaski is his man and we never see him emote. James Dean is a sterile, one-dimensional archetype of 30 something. Factotum is up to the viewer. He does this by addressing the idea of ​​a man (a writer) without consequences. A poor man who suffers because of his art. What could be nicer than this? Now, let's say there are some truths about Factotum, as the events took place. What the public lacks is the pain that surrounds Chinaski's existence. Perhaps the point of this film, and most of the films, is that for 80 minutes, we need to escape from the world that is full of consequences and pain and take over an anti-social womanizer, who smokes, talks, drinks with detached coolness. One who rejects the conventional behavior of work and family. My hero was Movie Bukowski. Long ago, it would have worked. It was easier then. Now, I still have to claim a hero. Things are not so easy. The logic of low-waisted pants and cinema reproductions of counter-culture icons offer no solutions or even questions.
