This movie is rubbish, it looked very funny in the previews, but I didn't laugh once in the whole movie. Do yourself a big favor and don't waste your money on this, don't waste anyone's money on this. I gave it a 1/10 believe me that I would have given less if I could have. I am a 15 year old boy and I thought it was rubbish if you want to see a good movie come out and see Jay and Silent Bob respond.
