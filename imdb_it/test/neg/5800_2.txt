this film has no plot. A boy was supposed to move in with his grandmother, and everyone thinks he's a loser and he has to redeem himself. but what happens after everyone finds out who they live with? they have a big pot party at their grandmother's house. the climax of the film did not even refer to the rest. the entire plot was introduced a few minutes after the end of the film. I can see how it could be related to the supposed story - that Grandma's VG abilities redeem it - but that it simply wasn't there. <br /> <br /> However, the film was fun to die for and clearly based on the lines. <br /> <br /> "Her pussy has the smell of the great depression" "She just sucked her first titty ... yes for 13 hours" "It's for you ... I think it's the Devil"
