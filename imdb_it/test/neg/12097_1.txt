To start with, the script is immitative and crazy. The characters are superficial and formal. The plot has arbitrary reversals and no sequencer. Baldwin's direction is terrible: these actors could do better on their own. The beats and the beats fall flat. The scenes shot are awkward and incredible. Baldwin goes as a wise brave hero, but spends most of his time in power struggles with women, particularly with the suppressed caricature of the tunnel team who always asks and denies reassurance. The conductor suffers from an absurd incompetence, not being able to effectively employ a gun from which he came. Anomalies: a hooded man grumbling with guns throws himself through a car, surprising people. The next time we see them, they are doing business sitting at their seats, talking, eating, reading, knitting. In the metropolitan areas of New York, people sometimes get on the train to make a musical or dramatic number --- maybe that's what they thought "happening" was.
