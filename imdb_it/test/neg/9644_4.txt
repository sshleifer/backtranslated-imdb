... at least during his first semester. Had he started with the three naval companions and focused on the naval action scenes, it would have been a much better and narrower film. The second part of the film was worth it, especially for the action sequences and close-ups of the ships of the early 20th century, but it's like a dull toothache. Also, don't watch this movie just because Ginger Rogers is in it. It has an important role, but it is small. <br /> <br /> The film begins by showing three friends from New York who work in the tourism sector and also in a good competition for the hand of Sally (Ginger Rogers), a candy saleswoman who sings along the avenue. The first world war broke out, the three companions seem completely indifferent to the fight, but enrolled in the navy anyway. One of the three with the least civilian industry (Bill Boyd as Baltimore) ends up with the commanding officer for the other two (Robert Armstrong as Dutch and James Gleason as Skeets). To make things more complex, Sally fell in love with one of the three, but she has no chance to tell him before the three go to war. <br /> <br /> The film is a little more interesting on board the ship, mainly due to the close blows we have of the ship itself, and also because the chemistry between the three companions is credible. However, James Gleason at the age of 49 seems a little long in the tooth to be a swabby, especially when the sign at the recruitment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible. <br /> <br /> A real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with the slightest care is the design costume, or, I should say, the lack its. In the scenes of New York, just before the First World War, we all dressed in the fashions of 1931 and all those who drove the cars of 1931 - no effort was taken to bring this film in a period. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you look at the few scenes with Ginger Rogers in them and in the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission, you have seen everything here that is worth seeing. The rest is padded.
