If you like watching movies because they are cute, you should agree with this. If you like watching movies that start with a good guy trying to catch a villain, then reveal clues about the motives of each in the movie, jump. At the end of the film, I still didn't know why Stargher had killed women like him. When you create such a ritual serial killer, it would be nice to know where the rituals came from. In Dreams it was a rather similar film with a serial killer who was not the best, but at least the reasons for how he killed the girls were explained. They also hinted at a dark background for Vaughn's character, but they didn't explain, in fact he didn't say why Lopez's child psychologist was much better suited to this task than the rest of the people interviewed, he didn't give much explanation for the problem of the small child, etc. If the rest of the story is compelling, I don't care about details as Stargher provided all the fancy electronic equipment and the underground chambers or because the FBI wasn't checking to see if he owned anything other properties or had access to out-of-place places while waiting to see if the whole thing that came into the murderer's mind would work, but I like to have a sense of what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer when he kills in such a complex way.
