The real problem with this story is that there is not much history for the story. There is virtually no plot to talk about. Widower buys an electric grandmother for her children. A child resists his electric grandmother. So he finally accepts it. Then the children grow up and the grandmother leaves. Really, very little happens. It is much more than a premise than a story. <br /> <br /> Also, undressing it is schmaltz, and you have a story that you had already done before, and better: The Lonely. The same basic idea: initially the person cannot accept the love of a robot, because it is only a machine, so in the end he gives up and adores the robot. The biggest difference is that The Lonely is much more powerful, since it is the protagonist that we, the public, foolishly returned to reality and forced to remember that in the end the robot is just a mechanism. <br /> <br /> I also find the story highly incorrect because the electric grandmother is simply * too * perfect. It is not just "human", it is * super-human *. She is * wiser * than a real person, has no trace of mechanicalness for her, and makes marbles appear out of nothing. Frankly, it's really irritating to think of being a car.
