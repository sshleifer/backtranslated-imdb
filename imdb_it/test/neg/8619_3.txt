Although this was set to be a showcase for some kickboxing and sword games, "Vampires: The Turning" (VTT) could have aspired further. Because he doesn't even aspire to be a good vampire movie, VTT can't give any punches he might have tried to make. <br /> <br /> Using the idea of ​​an 800-year-old Thai vampire was interesting, but the story about the offspring he wrongly created (and which he now has to wipe out) actually reminds me of Gizmo and his situation in " Gremlins ", and it's not a good thing when it comes to a vampire movie. > <br /> Stephanie Chao is attractive and does the "good" vampire very well, but her lack of grateful accent when you realize that she's an 800-year-old vampire. Added to that, when she tells Connor that she is "a young soul", she does not provide the line with much of the weight one would expect from an "old" soul. Attractive but not credible. <br /> <br /> Meredith Monroe was more credible in her role but, for an "Dawson's Creek" alum, you'd think she'd have more screen time. The question of whether Amanda succumbs and "turns" is the most compelling reason to keep watching this film, and you never understand it. You make fun of it, but in reality you never get any kind of development from the characters for that plot device. It's a cheap way to listen to your audience, people. <br /> <br /> If you want something that is a good vampire movie, go find Lugosi's "Dracula" and if you want a sexy vampire movie, you have dozens of Hammer's gestures with much more strength than this. In the end, if you want good or sexy, this is not the right place. This is simply forgettable.
