This was one of the biggest pieces of shit I've ever had to look at. I mean, seriously. How would someone else feel if he were in the role of Woody Harrelson and his wife was also CONSIDERING that it would be a good idea to sleep with the other guy even for a million dollars. After all, she was the one who talked about him in bed and said how nice it would be for them since he could build his house or anything else with that money. Woody never fully accepted it until he convinced him. How can you trust her? Who the hell really thought that if they were married? I don't care how desperate they were. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life. So, turn it on her. Apparently, he had no right to distrust her, other than the fact that his wife had just slept with another extremely rich and handsome boy. Oh, wait, then you should apologize to her after she asked for a divorce so she could be with the guy she slept with. Of course, Woody has no right to say something to her or be wary of her especially after he still has Roy Hobb's card in his wallet. Then, at the end of the film, he is apparently so in love with Woody again and he misses so much, that he won't leave Hobbs until he has made an incredibly stupid story to try to suggest her to leave, and she beeps thanks Hobbs ?? ?? You are making a fool of me? Was he under contract like his sex slave or something? I mean what does the beep mean ?? Oh and wait for me to get better. She binge passionately kisses him before leaving the car. Yes, she's not a whore. Oh, thanks for letting me go, let me go out with you for the last time for good. Smooch smooch, smooch although I am still married to a boy I left for a rich boy. I've never seen such a piece of shit in my life. How the hell should we feel good after that horrible ending? What was this movie supposed to represent? Nothing came out of this! This was the most useless film I've ever seen in my life. Two desperate pathetic people. If I were Woody, I'd tell her to drown herself in that body of water that they were close to. Apparently, he had no respect for himself. What the hell was thinking about Roy Hobbs taking on this horrible role. I want to vomit after seeing this. This film was so ugly, it was seriously ridiculous. I want those two hours of my life that I lost watching this piece of ****.
