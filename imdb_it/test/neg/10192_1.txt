Christian propaganda ... A lot of bravado ... <br /> <br /> This is not SciFi, this is ChriFi (Christian novel). The film started in OK, but took a sharp turn to the Christian right. From that moment on everything concerned god, jc, the holy bible and the devil. UFOs are actually just demonic deceptions for tricking people into believing there is another intelligent life in the universe. Satan's idea is to make you think that there could be more life than what is in the Bible. <br /> <br /> Kidnappings could be used to explain abduction. People left behind believed it was an alien mass kidnapping, instead of taking all the Christians to heaven. No reason to repent if its aliens. The deepest message in the film is that if you don't believe in god and you have jc in your life than you believe in anything and your life has no purpose.
