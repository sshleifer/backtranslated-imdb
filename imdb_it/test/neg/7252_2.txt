I don't think the number of grossly and strategically contained errors in this turkey can be beaten. Everything in this mess was done for cheap soldiers and looked really stupid. Examples: at the beginning the 2-star general receives a strategic advice from a lieutenant and accepts it without reservation. The map used by the Lt. shows enemy positions but apparently they have only a single narrow valley to use to advance on the battalion (even if the map shows a dozen others). The rearguard takes a position from which they are clearly identified by the enemy and exposed. They hit our heroes from the ground but this superior firepower makes little difference. A single enemy tank advances towards the end (initially called "armored division"), driven by a solitary infantry point (!) Which moves extremely slowly without cover, exploring the area, then returns the tank when it considers it safe to proceed - a more bizarre scene. Soldiers take shelter in a cave. All around them there is ice and deep snow, but in the cave there is no courtyard from the entrance, a deep puddle through which they repeatedly gather - their feet last a few minutes before they freeze. Later the survivors pathetically ford slowly and their chest high across a river to return to their unity. Remember that it is a deep winter and the ground is frozen. Yes, yes! <br /> And so on. They shout commands to positions on higher ground, lay mines close to their position and warn each other not to step on them (!). At the beginning, the merit is given to a soldier who had received the Congressional Medal of Honor. Was he blind, or did director Fuller ignore him? Really the most inept soldiers I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> One of them hits the injured leg with a bayonet and eventually pulls out a piece of splinter, without a groan or a moan. Announce that this should qualify him as a surgeon. This was fun
