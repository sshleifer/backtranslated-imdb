I gave "Airport '79" only two stars because it's a really bad film. No one who has anything to do with it deserves any praise (except Charo's Chihuahua, who does a good job in his role.) This doesn't mean that the film isn't worth watching. It helps if you have a buzz, but this is not essential. <br /> <br /> A'79 really looks like an initial version of "Airplane!" Each scene has a set-up and a payoff and the scenes follow each other as if they were totally disconnected. One of my favorite recurring points is that passengers, crew and aircraft can go on, whatever happens. Are you a journalist and a strange boy is killed in your house in your presence? Does the killer chase you on the roof of the greenhouse? No problem. You can still take that early morning flight to Paris ... no need to involve the cops. Your plane misses an unmanned "drone" missile, four heat-seeking missiles and a cannon fired by an unidentified phantom fighter, making beatings, an engine-less dive and a crash net landing without thrust reversers in the process? No problem, we will have the mechanics who check the oil and will reach you in a few hours. It's really funny. <br /> <br /> And I admit that there is a bit of the anarchist inside of me that comes out when passengers pay no attention to cabin assistants. The highlight is when the assistant tells Jimmie Walker that he will have to put away his saxophone (God avoids me from a flight sitting in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) Before take-off. Jimmie basically says "No". Later in the flight, the sax is damaged during a barrel roll and Jimmie shows up at the next leg of the flight with another sax that he will not put away. This aspect of the film is simply fun. (A passenger actually obeys the overseer. When Charo is told he can't take his dog during the flight, he leaves the plane. Of course, this is because you can't have a good view of his bottom and his boobs while he is sitting.) <br /> <br /> In summary, a terrible movie, but terrible enough to be a bit funny. Unfortunately, the directors and the cast deserve no credit for this, as it probably wasn't intentional.
