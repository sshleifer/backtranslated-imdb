I really wanted to love this movie, but after a funny opening in a few minutes I almost broke a smile. I agree that there was no chemistry between the two protagonists and the other characters were cliche ridden. The script completely wasted the talents of Bud Tingwell and Kim Gyngell. <br /> <br /> However, it must be said that there was a lot of laughter around me and even a smattering of applause at the end. Maybe I could not identify myself enough. I'm glad I bought cheap tickets.
