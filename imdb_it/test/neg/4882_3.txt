I think I win the "bargain" contest for this film, since I took it as part of a "Martial Arts Movie Classics" DVD collection with 50 films for $ 20, which means I paid something like 50 cents for the chance to watch the movie "Black Fist" version of a film released as "Bogard". <br /> <br /> For a simple film of "revenge", "Black Fist" is not bad, although it is obviously hampered by a low budget. One of my informal "practical rules" for watching a movie is that if the main actor is better than his production and script, the film automatically gets at least three stars. This is certainly the case here; Lawson has a certain presence and a certain charisma, and probably deserved a better film career than the one he got. <br /> <br /> The choreography of street fighting (the apparent reason for the film) will never impress anyone who has ever fought in a martial arts school or who has just been punched in a school brawl. I only spent about two years learning basic kung fu, but even I would never have fallen for the front kicks, arm levers and round fists displayed here. But the atmosphere is good - dust and blood and crowds screaming, and the actors give a sensation in the fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> Less credible is the plot. Dawson's character, "Leroy Fisk," is portrayed as a shrewd and astute young man who seeks work as a pick-up fighter in illegal and unauthorized street games. Yet is he surprised and indignant when he has to pay the police? Excuse me, but I grew up in small Iowa and even * I * knew (watching "Hard Times" with Charles Bronson) that cops have to be paid for this kind of action, and that the fighting kids need the repairers to get their games and that the fixers were worth the money. So you have to watch this movie with a kind of intentional suspension of your critical faculties to accept it as a "black brother who is repressed" movie. (Even most of the other non-black fighters in the stable are hit in the face for the same deal, yes?). <br /> <br /> The film suffers from a lack of attention. The director obviously didn't have the budget to film some of the scenes he needed, so he had to fill in the gaps with some pretty ridiculous exposure scenes (The scene "I won it, I ate it and then I killed it") it just doesn't work) along with dubbing and editing that are awkward and unconvincing. This is especially true with the whole romantic perspective that seems to have been filmed as an afterthought. This is a bit poor considering that the death of the death of "Fisk's wife" should fuel his desire for revenge. <br /> <br /> But once the film moves from the "rising young fighter through the lines" to the theme of revenge, it takes a little steam and plays with a little more conviction. I'm not sure the final reward is worth the accumulation - Roger Ebert calls this kind of thing "a long trip for a short day on the beach" .. but he manages to tie things in a fairly satisfying way. <br /> <br /> If Sylvester Stallone had made this film with a real budget and the same cast, die sets and costumes, and himself as the hero, people would have hailed him as the next "Rocky" , which goes to show how circumstances and chance can ruin the dreams of aspiring directors. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing once for various shots and decent lines and for watching Dabney Coleman embarrass himself in a role that is below him.
