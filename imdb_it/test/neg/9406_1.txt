Another entry in the sub-genre Pacino-As-Mentor. You know the drill: young hotshot with a hubristic flaw (in this case, Matthew McConaughey, trying to start a career in flagging by sticking to Pacino's belts - hey, it worked for Keanu and Colin, didn't it?) deliciously corrupt (Pacino, natch). Young Hotshot learns from Father Figure all the details of a lucrative but degrading career (this time it's football handicap). Father Figure shows off the young Hotshot with money and prostitutes and power, but we all know that this decadent state of affairs is on a collision course with dissolution and despair. . . that is, until the young Hotshot finds his moral center by rejecting the figure of the father and everything or almost everything he represents. (Clearly, Stone's * Wall Street * has basically set the ground rules for the subfield of Pacino-As-Mentor.) <br /> <br /> Furthermore, we intend to bring these Pacino films of the last days as a parallel to reality . Once again, you know the drill: Living-Legend Actor demonstrates its undisputed superiority compared to a young inferior actor. The latter can endure and smile during the process, but must recognize that he will not get any of the good jokes, much less will have the opportunity to chew important scenarios before the finale. Now it must be said that there are actually two good films in the canon Pacino-As-Mentor: * Scent of a Woman * and * Donnie Brasco *. In the first case, it was still a show for one man; in the latter case, Pacino had met his game as a thief of scenes in the person of Johnny Depp. However, those two films were serious minded, not just a showboating exercise in the interest of showboating. Pacino became damn sure that his younger co-stars in the movies from * Brasco * are not even remotely charismatic like Depp. By the way, none of this speaks very well of the Living-Legend actor. Like his contemporary De Niro, Pacino has spent the last 10 or 15 years resting on his laurels. * Two for the Money * is the worst example, even worse than * Devil's Advocate *, which at least had the virtues of presenting a naked Connie Nielsen and being chronologically prior to this film. Well, this is what happens when you're crowned King too damn soon - just ask Marlon Brando. Frankly, I saw one of Al Pacino's too many films with the same plot - and the same exaggerated as the star - to be more charitable. Did I say "none of this speaks well"? In fact, it's humiliating for everyone involved, including the paying public. Nobody will accuse Matthew McConaughey of being a Shakespearean actor, but neither does he deserve the second-fiddle role of this intolerable old show-off, with the further implication that he, McConaughey, will never be up to the Grandezza What is Al. <br /> <br /> I have not lost space on the details of the plot. If you want a synopsis, IMDb provides a meaningless summary, although I think I have outlined a fairly complete summary in my initial paragraph. Basically, you've seen this movie before. Many times. The particular environment in * Two for the Money * is the squalid world (underworld, indeed) of sports handicap. Pacino runs an office of "betting consultants" - that is, intermediaries between you and your bookie - and even has a show of handicapped people on cable TV, co-led with many of his best boys. One thing the film was right was the sloppiness of this type of show. . . but one detail that was wrong was the constant use of the words "gambling" and "gambling". If you've ever seen ProLine or other similar shows, you will NEVER, NEVER, hear Jim Feist and his cohorts say the word "gambling". They ask you to call 1-900 to get their choices. . . but if you were, say, Mars, you would have no idea what you should have done with those choices. "Gamble" is the key word on TV shows with sports handicaps - strictly verboten. <br /> <br /> Gambling is against the law, you know. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10.
