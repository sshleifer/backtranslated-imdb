This film literally does not have a saving feature. The characters are one-dimensional, clich√©s, incredibly misogynistic and stupid. The script seems to have been cobbled by another 100 films, the acting is horrible, and a bit of "grossly" humor made me sick. <br /> <br /> Too bad for you, Gregory Poirier, to think NONE of this would be fun or interesting! <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've seen in several years.
