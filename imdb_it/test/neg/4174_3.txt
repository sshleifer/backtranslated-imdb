The idea for the film was not bad: a horror film shot in a corn maze on Halloween. The worst part was the poor camera work, the ten million puddle shots and corn, and the hour and a half long walk that this guy took in the maze. Oh, I'm sorry, the "corn". I took this film because it reminded me of a corn maze near where I live and I thought it was an interesting idea for a movie. But considering everything, it seems that your average Joe could take the same idea and run much further with it. Bill Cowell's acting wasn't all that bad, in fact I'd say it was pretty good. But the lack of talent of his co-stars did not help his efforts. Here is hoping that his next film is easier to digest.
