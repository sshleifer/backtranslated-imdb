probably the worst creature ever, boa vs python has been a million times better than this and it hasn't been much, bad acting, bad effects and guess which DVD is one of those with 3 hours preview before the main menu. probably the least scary movie ever, no blood or violence, people are stupid and continue to use guns when they have no effect on these animals, the only interesting part was the radioactive leeches which was quite strong, the name of the 'island is just a rip out of the Jurassic park boring and boring is not even worth looking at but I guess the stupidity of the characters is pretty funny, so it would be a good comedy movie but definitely not a thriller
