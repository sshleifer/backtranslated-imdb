This film was only for two nights on ITV1 .. dear oh dear. Someone really bought it with the strength of Robert Carlylse .. OK, I lost the start ... but what I saw was so bad that I thought, no ... I looked embarrassed at the stars that were inside. Nothing was based on reality, I doubt that things progress as they did in this film. Everything was poor for this film. OK, cgi .. but no reality. The notes gave the impression of a coat hanger ... sorry, I was not impressed. Yes, formulaic. I couldn't guess the end. From what I've seen the army got the upper hand, the people who did the heroic things didn't have time to do their thing, it just wouldn't have happened that way? It was worse than leaving the brain at the door. It was annoying .. like someone said .. yes, right .. of course it would have happened ... no !! The credits mentioned Quebec and Canada .. so it was a co-production, missed the third part in question .. I will have to check on this site. I'm usually not that critical, but that annoyed me.
