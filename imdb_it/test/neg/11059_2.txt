Audio: <br /> <br /> Seriously I've never seen a movie with worse sound. There are scenes where people walk through the grass, and as soon as you can hear them in their tracks. They have to do the microphone at their feet. <br /> <br /> You know how in some movies you forget a line, so they have to double it on a click of the back of someone's head. Publishers here weren't so smart. There is actually a scene in which the character of Shannon Tweed plays her line without moving her lips! <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure about their background sound that played live effects during shooting, because in many scenes the sound effects will be different or absent whenever the camera changes angles. <br /> <br /> I could write a lot more about how bad the audio is in this movie. <br /> <br /> Other nuggets: <br /> <br /> In this film, they probably consider the credits to be special effects because they seem so difficult to produce. The main title and the first names in the opening titles are in white text on a white sky and oscillate as if they had been carefully painted by hand on each frame. <br /> <br /> The reuse of extras in this film is incredible. There are about 15 rebels in the cast, and yet in a given battle thirty or more of them will be killed. If only the film was of high enough quality to distinguish which ones were dying over and over again. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to note that rebels are usually killed by explosions that are always between 30 and 200 feet away. There is a scene in which some of the rebels are escaping from their huts in the rebel base, and a hut shakes as the rebel comes out of the door. You wonder if the hut will last long enough to deal with the inevitable explosion. <br /> <br /> There is a blue helicopter that looks threatening like a pair of running shorts, but somehow it has an endless supply of missiles. When they show missiles fired from helicopter missile bays, filming often in unpredictable directions closely resembles large bottle rockets. They still manage to hit their targets with ease, which as noted above is always a distance very far from the rebels they kill. Notice the recycled footage of the pilot who presses the LIVE button to fire the missiles (because it is printed vertically, the first few times we saw it, we read it as the "EVIL" button). <br /> <br /> Known as the grenade launcher they use, it produces explosions identical to those created by helicopter missiles. It's also fun in many scenes as the leading actor is turning in a completely different direction than the group of enemy soldiers he's killing. And frequently, the characters shoot a disproportionate number of bullets at soldiers who are killed (such as when a short burst fire kills a large group of enemies). <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is really very bad. The plot was designed almost like a 5 year soccer game, and the editing is the worst I've ever seen. But honestly, sometimes it's fun to spend 90 minutes laughing in front of a group of adults who have genuinely taken part in such a terrible movie.
