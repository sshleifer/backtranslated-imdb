Target is the story of a special agent who, after executing the orders to assassinate the Turkish "terrorists" (note that this is one of those American films for boys who love nonsense national-patriotic shit films), returns home to find out that his ex-wife and two children are hostage. Charlie Snow has only a couple of hours to do what the terrorists tell him to get them back. <br /> <br /> This was by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And if it wasn't for someone I know (and probably wrongly) would take him out of the video store, I would never have seen this huge pile of trash to begin with. <br /> <br /> The movie sounds like any generic action movie story I've ever seen before. In fact, these are the kind of things that disfigure in variety shows, that's how bad it is. I had almost waited In Living the Color's "Homey the Clown" for Will Sasso of Mad TV who was making his impression of Steven Segal to go out halfway, to remind you that it was just an exaggerated action movie, but now the our characters are here to smash how ridiculous it really is. There were not even good fighting or action sequences. The way things are, you wouldn't even think someone was kidnapped, that there were terrorists or that something interesting was going on. <br /> <br /> Not only is the plot completely and completely uninteresting, the acting is so terribly made of wood. Just look at the part where Stephen Baldwin, as former special agent Charlie Snow, is talking to the kidnappers on the phone. They tell him they have his wife and they put her on the phone. He says "Charlie, help!" or something like that. And Baldwin responds "all is well, darling" in such an impassive way, you think I'm reading the script and trying to probe the words phonetically. I imagine that, although it is such a ridiculously bad film (one at the bottom of IMDb on IMDb - a list that should expand to at least 250 films and should contain almost all of Stephen Baldwin's films), someone with some talent might have at least I made the effort not to trap him so much. Someone. Anyone. I couldn't get over the fact that everyone seemed to be reading from a script. Save that is, the only person in the whole film who has any talent (and therefore shouldn't have been in this), Deborah Wilson's Mad TV. <br /> <br /> This was the capital cheese festival. What really embarrassing.
