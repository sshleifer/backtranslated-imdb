I first read about the Left Behind series a few months ago and made a mental note to verify it because I have an interest in how religion is used to control people in our increasingly hate-filled world, so imagine my surprise and joy when I found a copy of Left Behind: World at War in my local library, nestled innocently in the big action movies of the budget. <br /> <br /> Now as a film it is extremely poor. The acting came out of a primary school production and the "special effects" would have seemed dated in the early 90s. Being the third part of a series, the story would be incomprehensible to anyone who hadn't seen or read other Left Behind films, and even with my previous knowledge it was still rather ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Religious front, I don't think anyone who wasn't already full of the spirit of the Lord would find something in the movie to convince them to change their ways. How should you fear the Antichrist when he has a Russian comedy accent, and the worst of his powers are pitiful CGIs? <br /> <br /> However, my main problem with this film is the obvious attempt to try and convince people to believe that it is a big-budget action movie. After collecting the box and reading the text I immediately noticed something strange ... nowhere on the box was there a hint of the true nature of this film. For someone who doesn't know, it would seem to all intents and purposes that Left Behind: World at War was no different from the last Tom Clancey. Nor, on the copy I rented, did he say something that is the third in a series. <br /> <br /> Considering the whole premise of the series is that the Antichrist has deceived the whole world, I find it extremely hypocritical that the directors have tried to deceive me TWICE even before having the trouble! If you are so firm in your beliefs, then why not be honest? <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that, if it hadn't been a "Christian" movie with the built-in fan base that follows, I seriously doubt that it would ever see the light of day. If the Cloud Ten hoped to see the error of my ways and give me to God, I am afraid to say that I would die of boredom and / or laugh until I died before I had the chance.
