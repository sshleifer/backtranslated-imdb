"The Bone Snatcher" begins in an extremely promising way, with the introduction of a new original type of invisible evil and with the use of the location of the isolated sublime shooting of the African desert. While controlling the pipelines in the desert, three miners are attacked and killed by an apparently impersonal creature that devours their flesh and leaves only a pile of half-eaten bones. The crew of the expedition sent to rescue them discovers that the monster is a queen ant borrowed in a superior way and soon they find themselves trapped even in the disturbing desert. Director Jason Wulfsohn supports a respectable level of tension only until the nature of the monster is identified. Soon after, the film quickly turns into a normal creature-feature with all the characters leaving the survival race one by one. The second half of "The Bone Snatcher" is unbearably dull; with the inevitable clich√©s of the love story and a total absence of pieces of bloody murder. The characters are all unbearable stereotypes that act and say exactly what is expected several minutes in advance. Is there a novice who has to prove himself, the female with cerebral capacities apart from his captivating appearance, the hateful expert boy who eventually redeems himself through self-sacrifice and ?? last but not least ?? who could forget the black essay that refers to the monster using all kinds of voodoo names. Wulfsohn tries too hard to make his monster look like the outer space threats of "Alien" and "Predator". The ant has an infrared vision and crumbles when struck, yawn! The film actually benefits only from its unique environment and from the handful of unpleasant images of decomposed bodies. This may have been a modest jewel, but instead it is less than mediocre. To avoid.
