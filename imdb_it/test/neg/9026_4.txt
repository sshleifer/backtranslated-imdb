What a silly movie. Although it looks beautiful, it doesn't make much sense. On the one hand, the film suggests that Juana's "madness" was that she was just a woman ahead of her time. On the other hand, he has an obsession that is just outside the worst Victorian novel of the offended woman, and this seems like some sort of mental problem, like Miss Havesham in a castle. This film is what Elizabeth would have been if Elizabeth hadn't been able to overcome the sexual attraction of Essex.
