Have you ever had one of those nights when you couldn't sleep and just turned on the tube to see what was there? That's how I came across this tripe. For myself, it would have been better for me to throw and shoot for the 97 minutes I wasted on this movie. <br /> <br /> In his attempt to "be real", the characters in this film look like such stereotypes that the story should have been the premise for a Wayans brothers movie. The dialogue? Please! A white man seemed to be trying too hard to write this movie. <br /> <br /> The assembly was horrible. One of my "favorite" scenes involved a car chasing a group of narrow alleys. Cut to the chased characters, though, and they are driving through a park complete with baseball fields in the background. <br /> <br /> When one of our "homies" is filmed in this film, it bleeds miraculously through clothes that have no holes, which is more than I can say for the plot of this predictable load of ... . sodium bicarbonate. <br /> <br /> Independent films can be great even if they have a low budget and effects, but they still have to have cinematic integrity. If I could give him a 0, I'd do it. If you look at it, I hope it's on cable, because even the cheapest rental would be too much to pay. Actually, 97 minutes was too much to pay ...
