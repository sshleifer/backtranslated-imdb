I would be one of the few people to own a copy of this classic. But I don't own only 1, actually I own 2. It's so good. <br /> <br /> Well, when I say right, I mean bad. But I will try to do a thorough review. I've even seen "born a ninja" that one of the other reviewers mentioned here, to compare it to this. And a born ninja is actually worse, but not so funny. <br /> <br /> And it's always fun. EVERYTHING on this film is poor. EVERYTHING. The plot is absolutely embalmed (keep in mind that "you will have to keep me alive if you want to know where to find your wife"). EVERY sequence of actions is also filled. Our hero danton is more than a hero; can stab people with twigs, take 3 bullets in the heart 50 cm away without even bleeding, and tie a rope to the tree that, when an enemy tramples on it, ties a knot around the enemy leg, picks it up, and throws it 50 meters in a pile of ears. <br /> <br /> Acting is so bad that it is impossible to comment on it, but it should make you roll, especially jumping dantons off the ground and growling at the bad guy. ' Oh yes, and the bad guys: somehow, they seem to be resurrected 5 times each in the movie. Maybe it's just that there weren't enough actors, but in a film of this caliber? I doubt it. <br /> <br /> The "plot" talks about how Danton was a soldier in the Vietnam war, and now his colonel is hunting real people for training his mercenaries. The colonel simply recovers Danton, after which Danton answers. This is just the excuse for a Rambo clone, since most of the film is about Danton slaughter soldiers. And I can't really explain the plot because there's nothing else in the film. Rock anyway. <br /> <br /> What else could be wrong ask? Don't get me started. Hand bombs that go off at the feet of the actors because the explosion is the size of a game. Scenes where there are 5 people chasing Danton, then the camera cuts and goes back and there are 7. The way every time Danton charge the grenade launcher is on the same background even if it is in completely different locations. And the worst part is when Danton pushes plastic boulders over enemies, and an enemy is completely untouched by boulders, so he doesn't know what to do so he dies in half without even being touched. It's ridiculous !!! <br /> <br /> But fun. Very, VERY fun. This is one of the few films I can recommend to everyone, because if you don't find it funny, you're 1 in a million. And for the rest of us it's magical.
