The hip, distinguished physician James Coburn (like Peter Carey) comes to accept a position as a pathologist in a Boston hospital. Almost immediately, Mr. Coburn hosts the nutritionist Jennifer O'Neill (as Georgia Hightower). While sleeping with Mrs O'Neill, Coburn is awakened by an emergency involving a failed abortion: the fifteen-year-old who is bleeding to death appears to be the daughter of the hospital's great donor, Dan O'Herlihy (like JD Randall). Coburn does not believe that the man was arrested, the doctor James Hong (like David Tao), committed the crime; although, Mr. Hong admits to performing clandestine abortions on the side. While trying to free his friend, does Coburn wade through a plot plot? <br /> <br /> **** The Carey Treatment (03/29/72) Blake Edwards ~ James Coburn, Jennifer O'Neill, Michael Blodgett, James Hong
