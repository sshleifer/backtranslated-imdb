I can't believe that I got involved in this movie to realize a favor that my friends ask me at the beginning of this April 14th 2007. This film certainly a pain in the ass in the theater and badly boring, I didn't even feel the bloody impact of his "discouraging scenes" which I consider complete not being able to attract his audience. The worst has even stepped on me, because my friend failed to come to the theater on time because he was busy assisting her boyfriend in finding an appropriate place to stay for a night. I was not very disappointed by this matter, but this film is really a question for me, poor plot, useless plot, naively created and I don't know what to say anymore. <br /> <br /> The title is not, however, I suggest the shivers and horror that failed to entice us viewers, perhaps the beating of the animals could get more chills if the real situational game shows up in the theaters. Good luck to anyone trying to watch it anyway.
