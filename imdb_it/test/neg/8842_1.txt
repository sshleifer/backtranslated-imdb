I'm looking at all the good reviews on this movie and I'm starting to think of myself ... I'm going crazy ...? I can't see the beauty of a movie like this ...? Am I stupid enough not to understand the message that this film is trying to highlight? I don't know ... maybe one of those lizards came into my head and even ate my whole brain. The idea of ​​the film was not going anywhere ... I was sure it would have a foggy end, and of course ... it did! Nothing exceptional ... Not even the landscapes (I skipped that being placed in a mountain village at least the landscapes would be nice .. but no). Just a lame story about a crazy teacher and, of course, his crazy students ... now all grown up, each of them ... with their own fixed ideas. And boy some of those ideas were stupid ... like the story of the lizard, for example. In a moment I thought I was looking at x rows .. with the lizard coming into my ear and everything. No ... from my point of view this film is a waste of time (not to mention money if U pay for the ticket) The only part I liked was the acting of the "German" kid of the blue eye. .. He played very well and convincingly for his age ... The rest ... nothing! I read the previous review and I think the writer and director were both drugged when they came up with these ideas. Well, considering that there are many people who have enjoyed this movie ... I think of myself again ... Maybe I'm crazy. Council .. Do not waste time with this!
