Ladies and gentlemen, we can present the worst of all the Disney remakes. Although the name of this film is "That Darn Cat", it should have been "That Darn Teen" or "FBI Agent". The cat had no real scenes, the Ricci character was more annoying than funny, Doug E. Doug had no good jokes, even the cameo role of Dean Jones could not save this movie! The only really good characters were the only two mechanics in the city, but their scenes were short. In all, I'd say that if you're thinking about watching this movie, go get something smarter like a Barney video.
