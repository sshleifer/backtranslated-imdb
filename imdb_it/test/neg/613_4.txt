I became a big Carpenters fan and I didn't really like this movie. It seems to me that he focused too much on his anorexia and didn't let his true personality shine through. I wasn't too fond of the portrait of Cynthia Gibb; especially knowing that he had decided that Karen's anorexia was suicide, which clearly was not. Although his family wasn't big with kisses and hugs, I thought the film described Agnes (their mother) as a terrible thing. I found some scenes that were distressing in a sense, such as where you see yourself in a mirror that seems to distort it and make it look heavier; I thought the metaphor (so to speak) was quite effective. When the family plays billiards and talks about her divorce and she breaks up and Richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels that her fragile body was quite moving (which is probably the wrong word). <br /> <br />, I feel they needed to bring out its most bubbly and bizarre side - its genuine personality. Although the focal point of the film, there really was no point in understanding what would have led to anorexia (although of course nobody really knows), and it almost made it seem unfounded. The film was more poor-singer-with-anorexia in the story of Karen Carpenter, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I suppose they changed the husband's name / profession and all because they couldn't get his permission to actually include it (there were some bad terms there), but that whole look was inaccurate with the changes. In this note, I cannot remember the film that brings to light his lust for a family and for children, which has prevailed a great deal in his life and explains his romantic love story and the rapid marriage with his husband. <br /> <br />, it ends up as a low-budget movie made for TV that is not of the highest quality and can be disappointing if you are a huge fan who hopes to see beyond Karen's illness. I feel that such a legend deserves / deserves a better film as a tribute to an extraordinary person and a fantastic voice.
