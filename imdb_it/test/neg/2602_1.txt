You know what? Family Guy was born as something fresh, fun and original. The casual humor used to be fun. Actually I thought it was the best animated sitcom next to The Simpsons. After seeing the new episodes broadcast over the last few weeks; I'm sick of the fact that the show relies too much on casual humor to be funny. South Park was right about FG dead when they pulled up the Manatees and the idea balls. <br /> <br /> And watching the show itself, I don't understand why my parents like it so much; there is nothing exceptional. The "Intellegent" humor is fun and would have been more fun if the show was not based on chance.
