A friend of mine loves sticky horror movies, so I often see low budget things like this. This is, however, the first time I've been forced to write a review of one ... <br /> <br /> Simply put this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen! Even worse than Boggy Creek II! <br /> <br /> The entire budget for the film seems to have been spent in a short scene in the middle when Dr. Klaus is in this chamber thing and turns all vampires. <br /> <br /> The only good thing to say is that it was fun after some beers (but for all the wrong reasons).
