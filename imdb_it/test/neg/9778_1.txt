I wasted 5 dollars to rent this complete piece of shit. Dr. Zack is the most unfortunate main character I've ever seen. The film was full of EVERY cliché you could have ever imagined and it didn't even contain a single OUNCE of originality. There was the typical sexism portrayed by robust foreigners, all the boys had those 'too proud to take advice' attitudes that are stale like Grandma's Christmas fruit cake. The concept and the deaths were really fantastic, but they lose all news once the monster is revealed. (read the SPOILER at the end) Nothing else is revealed, however, the ending is the biggest cop-out you've ever seen. I predicted everything before it happened, including who would die and how. The dialogue is lacking, and this is a euphemism by far. There are mostly only random screams, fixed reflexes and heavy sentences. The actors are simply FUN! I don't want to talk about this movie anymore, it's making me angry. I just wonder if the director even looked at it when it was done. <br /> <br /> (SPOILER ALERT !!!! SAVE 5 DOLLARS!) The monster is just a group of ants that have "evolved" so now they need the bones so they can move, (it doesn't matter that this has no evolutionary advantage and the ants have killed anyone available, even if the film behaves as if they killed out of necessity of the lead idiot who kills the mother ant (a big blob thing) that destroys all others Ants. Nice cliché huh? It goes out almost at the end due to a sudden emotional attachment to the mother - something that overwhelms him.
