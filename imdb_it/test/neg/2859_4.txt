Pinocchio's revenge is not a good movie. Nor is it terrible. <br /> <br /> The acting was in wood at least on part of Pinocchio. The puppet had all 2 expressions. Like most actors, except strangely ... the secondary characters ... most of them were funny over the top. <br /> <br /> The special effects in this are rather "B" and, as I said before, the puppet has really played. <br /> <br /> The 2 best scenes in the film is the knife through the hand ... it seemed pretty good, I think they spent about 1/3 of the budget on that ... and the shower scene. .. WOW ... I think they must have spent the other 2/3 of the budget to talk about the actress who did that scene to do it. Awesome. <br /> <br /> Seriously this is a horror movie "b" slightly below average ... rent Chucky if you want to see puppets kill. <br /> <br /> The story had some interesting ideas, enough to keep me looking at it until the end.
