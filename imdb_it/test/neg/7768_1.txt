Absurd nonsense, superficial, materialistic. How do women (and gay men?) Can enjoy this junk is beyond me. No self-respecting man would ever want to be with one of these neurotic gold-seekers. What is even more worrying is that so many reviewers say they refer to the women on the show. If this is the future of women, Lord help us all. Showing your independence and being respected like men should not be the question of smearing your legs every three seconds with a different man. I think this degrades women and does not do them justice. But this review is not bad luck against women. Fans of this show say it's "hilarious" and "rival", but every time I saw this show, I simply struggled to stay awake. Despite the narrative of the woman reporter, nowhere in this show is there even something similar to something that can be considered a rational thought. So it's not fun and it's not informative, so why should you worry about watching it? One of the ten stars.
