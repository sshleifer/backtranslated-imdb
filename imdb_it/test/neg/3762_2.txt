I bought "Rocketship X-M" on a two-piece DVD with "Destination Moon". Now I understand why distributors have done this: no one who has ever seen this movie would have bought it alone. <br /> <br /> I can't figure out which school system the reviewer who claimed that RXM has "excellent his predictions about how space travel would have taken place ..." has been discovered. make a 90 Â° bend to the right and turn faster and faster until you reach the escape speed ... I don't think I remember from the Apollo program. No matter that the astronauts are weightless once the engines are turned off, gravity changes direction every time it passes through the hatch to the engine room. Go to the moon, but "miss" it? No problem, it's just a hop-jump (with a hand from divine providence) and you'll be on Mars! And OK, if you want to put life on Mars, given the state of planetary knowledge in 1950, it was a forgivable convention for the taste of storytelling, but can you make them look like at least a SMALL alien? These Martians looked like extras from the cast of "10,000 BC" I can accept some scientific errors, but this would not exceed the meeting with a pupil above the average level. <br /> <br /> And apart from the screaming story holes: 12 minutes before launch (as you are constantly reminded by the annoying PA voice that says "X minus so many minutes") the astronauts are giving a press conference! I guess the crunch of the time is why Dr. Eckstrom didn't take off his jacket and tie before he threw himself into space. And how close they were, even though they were planning to go to the moon and had gas suits for this, they brought hiking gear (and rifles!) In case they ended up on Mars. They are lucky that they landed everywhere, since apparently the method they had developed for landing was to have Dr.E look out the window and tell the "pilot" (Lloyd Bridges) to adjust the cuffs from time to time. Note to the designers of the XM-2: how about giving the pilot a seat near the window? <br /> <br /> The previous comments on the casual sexualism that Dr. Lisa (Osa Massen) had for the eyes likewise ruins them all by repeating her fuel calculations over and over, but hey was the early 1950s. He was there to fill his sweater, not a useful function. <br /> <br /> "Rocketship XM" is known to be one of the first films to say "ohmigod we will blow ourselves up with these atomic bombs here", but it can be seen that without even wasting 77 minutes watching a similar disaster. By the way, that message could have had a greater impact if there had been money in the budget for the royal series of the ruins of the city of Mars, rather than just opaque paintings. <br /> <br /> I can appreciate "good" bad science fiction, for the unique way in which the "future" used to look, and for the intrinsic (if condescending) humor that you can find when we look back at the naivety of the public 60 years ago, but this film must have insulted even then. "Rocketship X-M" is not even suitable for a MST3K style flash. Sometimes, evil is just ... bad. <br /> <br /> Does anyone want to buy a DVD? Used only once, I swear.
