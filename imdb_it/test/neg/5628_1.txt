Famous as the British film, which was to be distributed for free with a newspaper, the quality of this "thriller" by the Children's Film Foundation can be guessed from the abnormal number of votes of 10/10 and the large number of rave reviews from the timeless posters of publication and no other review of their name. Regular customers know what it means, the gullible may be scammed. If they dive into the waters of this, they won't last long before you drag them under. Technically unable to see the boom mike being fired or the reflections of the visible crew, everything goes on indefinitely in a memorable sub-DAVINCI code of $ 5 a day. The end is just offensive, but don't worry. It's not like you can get that far!
