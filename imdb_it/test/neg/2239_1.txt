Little Quentin seems to have learned the art of having cake and eating it. <br /> <br /> As usual, pure sadistic visualization can be explained as an ingenious and provocative way of putting violence on the public's face. <br /> <br /> Of course, Mr. Tarantino. Violence is Baaad. Sadism is Baaad. It is worth wading into it to make that point. How brilliant. <br /> <br /> The youthful part of the audience may not be smart enough to follow all the intelligent references to higher levels of consciousness, but I'm confident that they will see the light one day. <br /> <br /> Thank you for making our little world a little better. You deserve a medal.
