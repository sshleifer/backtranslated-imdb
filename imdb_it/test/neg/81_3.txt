Ok, so it would never have changed the world, and bombed at the box office, but Honky Tonk Freeway is one of those films I fell in love with as a child (the BBC showed it a few times in the 80s and I happened to have a high quality VHS tape in the machine - lucky, that!) and looked to infinity. I saw the DVD last night and, unfortunately, the weather was not kind to this aspiring blockbuster. Either that or I just came out of this kind of wide and crazy humor. Come on, when Schlesinger is so desperate for the laughter that gives us close-ups of novelty underpants with "funny" slogans, what can you say about the cast or script? <br /> <br /> Of course, it's ambitious, interesting, unusual and sprawling, but it's never fun as a laugh. I would describe it as a film for children with "adult" shades: you can easily show your kids this, despite the 15-year certificate. They will not receive references to drugs, so don't worry. I had a pleasant surprise when I realized that I had forgotten how catchy both the title song and the song "Everybody's Going Faster," by the truck's author, not to mention the city of Ticlaw's patriotic hymn. The entire cast offers commendable performances, the photograph is sharp and perfectly captures the mood of the various locations, and there is a real-time capsule on fashions, cars, gadgets (especially the drum machine mounted on the dashboard) , the interiors and references to pop culture - I was a little surprised to hear the bank's nut say loudly to everyone "I'm OJ Simpson!", especially now that Simpson's legal tangles have tarnished his sporting achievements. The hitch is, there is hardly any plot to talk about, it's too obvious to be witty and not fun enough to elicit many genuine laughs. I wish I had left this as a pleasant memory.
