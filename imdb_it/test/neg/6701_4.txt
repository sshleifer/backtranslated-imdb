Last night, I saw a screening of Badland with my cousin. We were a little excited to learn once we got there that the director / writer, the producer (his wife) and several cast members were present and that there would be a discussion and questions and answers after the movie. But once the film is finished and the credits have begun to run (and the film has not really been edited well enough and is too long), my cousin and I, without consulting each other, we immediately got up and left. We found out that when we started talking out we were both so angry that we not only didn't want to stay for discussion, we couldn't even watch the cast and crew that had been standing near the exit and who we were walking just when we left . <br /> <br /> I realized that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene where Jerry cut his daughter Celina's palm with a big knife so that her blood could be used to leave a false trail. It was inevitable to connect in my mind the physical pain he had inflicted on his body with the emotional pain he had inflicted on his spirit by killing his mother and two brothers in his presence, sparing her and taking her with him when he fled. I cut the palm of my hand before (by chance); even a fairly superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive, and it is very slow to heal if you do not keep it still because you continue to open it trying to make your life. But after a very short time, with only a thin strip of fabric awkwardly tied around the palm and a scene with a large patch, it was as if it had never been cut. My anger has reached its peak - I don't want to spoil this moment for you - in Celina's final scene. <br /> <br /> I got angry because Celina is by far the nicest character in the movie (the actress who portrays her is good); I was ?? and you cannot tell me that a good screenwriter would not know it immersed in feeling both his physical and emotional pain; and the screenwriter, treating Celina's emotional pain so easily and with such lack of respect, also treated me, the member of the audience, with ease and total lack of respect. <br /> <br /> Of course, the script has moments of tears for Celina, and a dialogue that tells us she's hurting, somewhere, somehow. But at this point, the audience feels so manipulated that we have closed. The manipulation begins very early in this film, when Jerry's family dialogue explains to the public that Jerry had psychiatric problems. Rule one, scriptwriters: give yourself some credit to your audience. Let them do a lot of creative work on their own. Tell the story; don't explain everything we should think and feel. We don't like it. <br /> <br /> Even my cousin knew that at first she had problems with the film, from a dialectical point of view, when Jerry and his wife had little to say apart from this, fuck, fuck you. Some couples are really in such bad relationships that the atomic bomb ends up being any other word out of their mouth. But it's like watching comedians who are very damned. Some of them are really fun; blasphemy is incidental. But some of them replace curses for humor, and this writer, to bring the metaphor to its conclusion, is not Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> This team of husband and wife has courageously chosen to face a terribly complex story with terribly complex characters. But it seems they have not understood that the meaning of a story, especially of a story, will vary for each member of the audience. Successful storytelling requires attention to important factual details, does not work desperately to interpret the meaning of history for the whole audience. <br /> <br /> I've been working with Vietnam veterans for five years, I've heard more stories than most and I'm always happy to see the published films that bring their stories to a wider audience. It is important, at all levels, that we listen to them. But I'm not at all enthusiastic about the fact that this narrator decided before the film also started what Jerry's story meant and continued to explain it to us with a very heavy hand. Next time, pay more attention to details.
