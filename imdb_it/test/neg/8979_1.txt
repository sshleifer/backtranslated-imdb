This is by far the worst British comedy ever, as it passed the first episode and the pilot is beyond me. The acting is weak from the main character played by Ben Miller in Sarah Alexander (from the fantastic pairing) through the cast. The plots / plot were little fun and very predictable using many ideas consumed. A very painful series to bear but sadly inserted in a crack between two excellent shows. describing it as Britain's answer to "Meet the parents" does a disservice to "meeting the parents" and is as cool as an old shoe that has a run around the family dog. Britain should have learned that scams from other countries never work by looking at the sad American attempts to do so.
