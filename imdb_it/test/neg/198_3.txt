When a friend criticized me for my first film (a bad videotaped business), I argued that I could grow up; Orson Welles' first film, indeed, was even worse. He challenged me that it couldn't be, so I pulled out the Criterion laserdisco from (I think) CITIZEN KANE and played HEART OF AGE. My friend lasted only a few minutes before giving the point. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of humor in this brief, but it is fundamentally as pretentious as (and perhaps a collegial response to) BLOOD OF A POET and other avant avant-garde film of the time. It is what it is: a succession of images with a vague theme and, unless you really like a movie of Welles (with heavy makeup, to boot), it's not really worth tracking it down.
