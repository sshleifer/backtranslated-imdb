This is an incredibly standard western, which features bad acting, a boring storyline and a silly action. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is perhaps how formidable this film is. It presents all the usual clich√©s, yes, even a fight with the bar and the film really has no surprises. It makes this a boring and weak western to watch, also because it is not so badly done. <br /> <br /> Obviously it is a small production and the film seems to have been shot in 30 days. Direction and editing can be called bad and all the action sequences in the film are incredibly stupid. Maybe it's almost a little fun to watch, for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> His story is not that interesting. It's a rather friendly western (so even without blood), in which for some strange reason everyone seems to be against the Younger brothers, who in this film are portrayed as very friendly good guys. The story becomes more foolish and more foolish as it heads towards its end. The Younger brothers really existed and were part of the James-Younger band, which also included the famous brothers Frank and Jesse James. Obviously they weren't as friendly in real life as played in this movie. It was normal that in the early 1940s there were nice characters. It wasn't really until the Spagethi-Western age that the main characters became real evil criminals. Strangely, the one who approached has always worked better than those early westerns in which the protagonist is on the side of the law. <br /> <br /> What makes this film original is the fact that it was filmed in color. This was something really unique for a 1940s western and still gives the film more. You can ask, because they shot this western in color. The film is still finished in the style of a black and white western western and I believe that this film would have been a little more believable if it had been made in black and white. <br /> <br /> could easily do without this western. <br /> <br /> 4/10
