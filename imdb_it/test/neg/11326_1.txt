Years ago, I deliberately watched bad movies. I somehow lost this. No gesture sounds true. No facial expression fits the scene or action. I've never heard such inappropriate music for a movie. At the final scene, I was rooting for the car to ride on that ridiculous kid - one of the worst child actors ever. <br /> <br /> Just a name I've ever heard of - Wilford Brimley. He must have been very hungry to take this part. <br /> <br /> UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES, WATCH THIS FILM !!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!!
