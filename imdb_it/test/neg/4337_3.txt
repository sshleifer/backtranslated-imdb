Ok, here's a really short review: this movie has played. I would just like to have a review that affirms this simple principle, but I must bore you with ugly words like "horrible", "clich√©" and "unwatchable". It's the kind of movie you watch when you're drunk or you're stuck on a desert island with nothing else to do. Here is the premise: the vice president is captured by a terrorist group during a hockey game and only Van Damm can stop the madness. Really, really terrible, but then again, I didn't pay to see it the first time and only my father felt the absence of circumference in his wallet after this movie. I hate the fact that he's a Republican and all, but then again he spared me the horror of paying for this piece of junk. Ok, now there is enough space to be recognized as a review, so I ask adieu.
