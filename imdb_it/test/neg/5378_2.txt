Ok, sure, this movie will never win an Oscar. Citizen dog this film is not ... BUT why every movie must be scrutinized? when was the last time you saw a funny movie, because it wasn't nice, but why was it stupid? does anyone remember roger corman, king of exploitation? <br /> <br /> well, I enjoyed it. I liked the cheese. enter without expecting to think and get ready to throw popcorn on the screen.
