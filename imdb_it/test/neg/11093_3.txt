With all the potential of a good film in its wonderful settings, cast and film, the lackluster screenplay of this film, the leaden rhythm and wooden performances have only produced a great disappointment. With decent direction, editing and musical score, this may have been a good movie, perhaps a dark version of "10" by Blake Edward, instead of a whining version of "Howard's Splash".
