I appreciated the beautiful scenery of this film the first time I saw it when I was 9 years old. Dunderklumpen is a nice guy for children in a trivial way. It reminded me of HRPUFFINSTUFF on Saturday morning, its Swedish backgrounds make it easy for the eyes. Don't expect older kids to be interested because live entertainment is beyond the times and most older kids will get bored. This is definitely a film with less than 10 years and a lot of memories for those of us who were small children in 1974.
