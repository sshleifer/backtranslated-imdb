This film was terribly terrible. Most of the film consisted of people running in the woods, walking in the woods or dancing in the woods. More than half, at least. Then two children who discover two "horribly mutilated bodies" in the woods, return to the woods the following night for a romantic walk. ????? There is no temporal continuity. his day, his night, his day, is really really the night, his sunset, his pitch dark, his day. All the forest scenes go on like this until you think you're losing your mind. really bad. The sheriff discovers a five-foot claw set in the dirt of the woods and theorizes that a very large alligator could have learned to walk upright. Really a silly movie without a real written motivation for the characters. It could be fun for small children, as an alternative to really graphic things.
