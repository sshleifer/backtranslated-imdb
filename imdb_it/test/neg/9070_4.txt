Interesting writing teams from husband and wife, Robert Wagner (as Joel Gregory) and Kate Jackson (as Donna Gregory), arrive in the spooky mansion of actress "Lorna Love" (actually, the silent movie star Harold Lloyd). Mr. Wagner and Mrs. Jackson were commissioned to write the biography of the silent film star. Wagner has a personal interest in the project, since his father was once the lover of the star. Mysterious events take place and Jackson must fight to save her husband from the spirit of the beautiful blonde, who is "perfectly preserved" in a crypt on the property; moreover, the wicked woman seems intent on owning her husband and killing Jackson! <br /> <br /> This is a variation of "Night of Dark Shadows", starring the original "Dark Shadows" alumni Kate Jackson, who knows and plays her part well. Robert Wagner lacks David Selby's intensity. Sylvia Sidney (in the role of Mrs. Josephs) nods to Grayson Hall. Marianna Hill is not a match for Lara Parker (or Diana Millay). Bill Macy (like Oscar Payne) is good at a part that would have been played by John Karlen (in a production by Dan Curtis). <br /> <br /> There are soft cameos by Joan Blondell, John Carradine and Dorothy Lamour. Mrs. Lamour's delivery resembles Joan Bennett, which raises the question: why hasn't producer Aaron Spelling had more regulars than "Dark Shadows"? <br /> <br /> Director E.W. Swackhamer was Bridget Hanley's husband; he worked with Mrs. Blondell in "Here Come the Brides" and with Jackson in "The Rookies". "Death at Love House" probably has a tighter plot than the movie "Night of Dark Shadows"; differs in the corner of the star of the film; and, in its final "Padre Eterno Fuoco", more closely resembles the plot of the "Laura the Phoenix" series of TVeries. <br /> <br /> **** Death at Love House (9/3/76) E.W. Swackhamer ~ Robert Wagner, Kate Jackson, Sylvia Sidney
