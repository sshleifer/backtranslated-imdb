I can't understand how it was possible to make this image. It is mostly, if not entirely, so inaccurate that the main character does not even resemble how history saw him physically. This film made me go online and read my books to make sure I remembered Nero's personality correctly. For God's sake, I have a book that lists Nero as one of the most evil people in the world and the film made me feel bad for him. I must say that Aggrapina's character seemed close to my understanding of her, both physically and psychologically. Even though the actors did a good job, the film was terrible and I'm sure I won't watch anyone else from this squalid team.
