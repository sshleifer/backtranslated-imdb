It's hard to be too hard on Brad Sykes, a guy who works hard doing what he loves, there is honesty about him that other microbannetti directors often seem to miss. Take a look at the tiny crew credits on Camp Blood, there is none of the usual thanks to all those who ate together with pizza, his Brad and his friends and that's all, no specious garbage. Jennifer Ritchkoff is not your mediocre horror heroine, but it is good enough for you to almost notice, Bethany Zolt looks like a star and Joseph Haggerty is so much fun to hurt. The Clown is certainly not a bad original horror film, but the design is good, Shemp Moseley has a good job bringing it back to life and the image nicely clashes with the rural background. Camp Blood is horror like a blue collar and simple as it is, it's not a good thing, it's not a bad thing, just a thing.
