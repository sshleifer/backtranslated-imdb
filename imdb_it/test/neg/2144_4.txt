BLACK EYE (2 outta 5 stars) The 80s action movie unimaginably filmed seems to have been made for TV ... only the occasional hiss and a subplot on lesbianism suggest that the film was actually made to be shown in the halls. Fred Williamson plays a former tough cop who becomes a hard private eye. He runs into a couple of murders and attempted murders related to a mysterious stick. There are some fistfights, a bullit-inspired car chase, a quite original elevator scene and even time for Williamson to face his girlfriend's rich lesbian lover (Teresa Graves). There is also a scene with Williamson bullying a poor old man by ripping up some precious old autographed photos in his souvenir shop. Yes, way to go, tough guy ... maybe you can find a cripple to beat later? Obviously it has the purpose of collecting the success of "Shaft" (this and about six thousand other films), this film does not have enough margin or enough originality to give a great impression.
