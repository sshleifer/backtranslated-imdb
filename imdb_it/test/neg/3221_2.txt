A friend of mine decided to rent this thing, fortunately it wasn't my money .. I mostly lost my time. A story that could have been interesting is completely wasted by incredibly bad acting and horrible editing / directing. Maybe it could become a classic because of all the strange over-acting :) (the character of Gary Busey for example) All the characters recited were actually the only thing that made this movie a bit interesting while they caught your attention for all the wrong reasons of course) in which the film itself fails miserably. In short: a waste of time and money <br /> <br /> 2/10
