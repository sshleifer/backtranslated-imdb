.... so why on earth would I see "Sex Lives of the Potato Men"? Answer: Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook. Vegas that I saw live and loved it. I think it is an intelligent and unique intellectual comic that manages to maintain extreme ostentation. Crook, I only know probably the greatest comedy of the last 10 years along with "Alan Partridge", "The Office". How Gareth was simply hilarious, and I was interested in how he would convert to another character on the big screen. <br /> <br /> OK. So the boyfriend and I went to the multiplex last night and the movie was a lot of fun, just because the mediocre meaningless dialogue and the lines of Ferris and Dave had been delivered with aplomb and enthusiasm by the talent of Vegas and Crook. They are destined for better things (they have already done better already) and I even believe that Vegas would become an honest and decent actor. The trivial scenes in which he says he misses his wife almost touched, even though the ** SPOILER ** stuck on the scene at the end where it was taken by his wife had to be lengthened, was not credible. And throughout the movie, Vegas seems to miss his wife 2 or 3 times. <br /> <br /> The film has become grotesque and grotesque, simply old, well, grotesque, when it came to sex. Not, I add, when it was shown on the screen. Tolly's free explanation of what was in his sandwiches and why it wasn't even slightly fun, and made me feel a little sick. Totally unusual was the inclusion of the character of Jeremy who took his nose off, before showing a close-up of the scarecrow on his finger. Only the fact that he took the nose would have raised a smile, he was a pathetic character and would have made him look as low as possible, but showing the snot up close was not necessary and it was rank. <br /> <br /> A scene that I thought was hilarious involving sex was Vegas in the trio. His conversation with the second boy has just highlighted the fact that threesome sex is never an endless ecstasy. Not that I knew ..... <br /> <br /> That's all I can really say. I will end with this, and this is actually my main criticism of the film. This should revive the British film industry. It's not a "Trainspotting" for sure ... it's not even a "Love Actually" (you should have a heart of stone not to vomit) and 3 million pounds could really have been included in a better project. 'Mike Basset England Manager' was a little-known British comedy and was released for less than 3 million. I just hope the BFC will learn from "Sex Lives of the Potato Men" and it won't become so free in the future. Even if the terrible reviews that this film is getting are just improving box office receipts. :-)
