I won't be too hard on this show because I liked the first season, but then things got worse. The concept is nothing special, just a girl named Casey who is trying to confront a new half-brother, Derek, and her noisy, raw family, while gradually forcing her princess standards to each of them. <br /> <br /> In season 1, the story was actually interesting. Then I liked Casey because he was intelligent, strong, independent and conservative. She was well educated and profound. I felt sick when he was harassed in his new school by his new half brother. She was a perfectionist, but not as annoying as the later episodes. Oh, and she went out with a nice guy, who is now portrayed as one of Derek's idiot friends. The season caught the real tension that the show's title was trying to capture. <br /> <br /> Now, I can't say the show really went downhill because the story is sometimes interesting, but now I'm rooting for Derek instead of Casey. Now, there is little or no interaction between the two brothers. If they interact, it is only briefly. Oh, and I don't want any Dasey fans in the face. People, it's called INCEST, even if they're half-brothers. My tolerance can only go so far, but this is not the point. <br /> <br /> It's strange. Derek, as an antagonist, has become more sensitive over time, while Casey, the supposed protagonist, is more neurotic and unlikely than before. I like how younger children get more transmission time, but parents are even more incapable than before. But this is not the biggest problem ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we are forced to see everything from Casey's point of view, with flattering and nauseating background music. It has become more stupid and more superficial over time. In one episode, he complained and wanted his boyfriend to be more chivalrous, so he deliberately threw the food on himself and blamed Derek. Now, what happened to being a strong and independent feminist? I didn't see much of the fourth season, but I heard he's dating a guy named Truman, who's an idiot and he's arrogant. Oh, I remember that fencing episode. She constantly reminds him that she doesn't like him, is scared to be "caught" by a sword, and eventually hooks up with him because she can "handle" him? What the hell? Why go with a guy like that in the first place. The first season Casey would have just punched him in his ... it doesn't matter. Or maybe that would have been my reaction. Oh, and she's a cheerleader. Not that it's a bad thing, but I think she fell in love with one of her studies. And in an episode of the dance, she cried because she couldn't find the "dress in her dreams" and wasn't completely satisfied until she became the queen of the dance. One thing I've noticed is that, as long as Casey tries to tell us his life, in the end things always go his way (she gets the guy she wants, Derek gets some sort of revenge, people love her, etc.) Derek is still quite immature, but I see he has really matured. I don't see why many people hate Sally. She looks pretty, and it's nice to see Derek in a serious relationship with someone he cares about more than "playing on the field". He's also treating Edwin a little better, and he's a good brother of Marti. <br /> <br /> The show is really like this, and I rated it low because despite the development of a character, the character I once admired has now become like a "fashionable teenage queen" that you can see anywhere in TV. But it was nice while it lasted.
