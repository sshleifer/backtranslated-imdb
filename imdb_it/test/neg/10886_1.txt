I can't say it in a simpler way than this, this is a terrible movie. I worked in the industry and made several (short) films myself, so my standard is pretty high but seriously, I absolutely hate this movie. I never made a comment on IMDb, but I hated this movie so much that I literally had to come and warn others. It's a piece of sh * t. The writer / director is an idiot who has no idea how to make / write a good movie and has the writing skills of a teenage teenager. The characters are not realistic (the protagonist does not think of taking the gun of the policeman is full enough of resources to improvise a Molotov cocktail? Please ...) and not even nice, I hated and cheered when she died. I don't understand what the director was trying to do with his redneck daemon idea, but it just seemed like sloppy writing and a cheap hoax without a real thought behind me. This is officially the worst movie I've seen ALL YEAR. Congratulations, Shiban, now you rank there with great success as Micheal Bay in the prestigious club "should not be allowed to waste millions of dollars to make a film". I hope you read this, really. And to the 163 idiots who voted for this movie 10 out of 10 BWAHHAHAHAHAh oh my God, I hope a redneck demon appears conveniently behind you and torture you.
