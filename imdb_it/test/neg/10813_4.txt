I totally agree. This is "Pitch Black underground" and a well worn plot. The best scenes I thought of were the divers who explored the caverns, crossing impossible underground passages, some of them beating the heart. The scenery was fantastic. If they had given up the basic "CGI" CGI graffitiers, the film would have been much better. All they had to do was never show monsters, but ask everyone, and follow Jack's descent into madness, and this could have been a high-level hitch-style thriller, perhaps a prize material. Acting is not bad. But those rubber bats reduce it to the standard rate.
