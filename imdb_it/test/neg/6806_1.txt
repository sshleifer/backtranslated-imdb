To enjoy "Fur - An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus", Stephen Shainberg needs the viewer to suspend all the reality and previous knowledge of the American photographer, Diane Arbus. Paradoxically, it is precisely the use of the name and knowledge of Diane Arbus for her life and her work, which leads this film to fail on a large scale. <br /> <br /> What soon becomes apparent with the casting of the beautiful WASPish and glamorous Nicole Kidman as the anti-glamor Jewess Diane Arbus, is that Shainberg did not get Arbus or his work (non-sentimental realism ) and seems attracted to Arbus only on a superficial level through his photographs of circus freaks. <br /> <br /> What follows is a kind of fantasy biopic of Beauty & the Beast with Robert Downey JR as Kidman's fictional love interest. However, it is not the banality of history that is the main flaw in this film, but the director's misogynist position that Diane Arbus, one of the most unique and original female photographers in the art world, was unable to formulate her own ideas about her work. While her previous film "Secretary" was a study of female masochism, her continuous portrait of the woman as a submissive completely spoils this film - and flies in the face of the courage, tenacity and fear of Diane Arbus's real life in exploring from only the Imagine an imaginary biopic about the life of the pop star Madonna with Guy Richie as his Svengali, the man behind his career, and you will have an idea of ​​how seriously the film is imperfect and imaginary: it can only work if not you have absolute knowledge of the subject, or simply choose to ignore all the facts. <br /> <br /> It is a pity because once removed any reference to Diane Arbus, this film could have stood up as an interesting study on fetishism and a good companion to the Secretariat. 4/10
