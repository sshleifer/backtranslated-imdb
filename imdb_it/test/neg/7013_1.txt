Lucille Ball tries to look 30 years younger than she was in this poor excuse for a musical. <br /> <br /> The film features some of the worst choreographies ever seen related to the constant threat that Lucy could enter a song with her bourbon voice at any moment. Lucy's total lack of talent as a singer and dancer sinks the film before it can begin and, apart from loyal Lucy fans, nobody will imagine it very much. Bad costumes and cheese sets don't help. Further proof that Lucy was not good at anything but doing stupid faces. <br /> <br /> Directed by Gene Saks.
