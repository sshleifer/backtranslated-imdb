Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart play a "romantic" drama about a strained chef played by Zeta-Jones, who ends up taking his niece with him when his sister is killed in a car accident. While out dealing with family matters, she is replaced by Eckhart. <br /> <br /> Unfunny maudlin story without chemistry between the leads (she's a dead fish and she's fine, but there's not much of anything). Looking at this, I wondered why someone wanted to see it since the character of Zeta-Jones was so unlikely. Come on, she's so obsessed with cooking and the best she does is cook for her therapist or talk about food. Ugh. I will not use any of the many word games that come to mind. I couldn't finish it.
