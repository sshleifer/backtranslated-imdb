I was hoping that Pulp would be an interesting film, but he was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> Pulp has a very small plot, and what never matters. It was a real struggle to keep watching it. When it's over, you say "eh? Is that it?!?". This is what you think after looking at it - why did they take the trouble? <br /> <br /> It's too bad since Michael Caine is a good actor. I was also hoping to see the great Lizabeth Scott in this, but she only appears on the screen for a total of maybe a minute. Scott is one of the greatest girls of film noir femme fatale and this was his last film. <br /> <br /> Oh well ...
