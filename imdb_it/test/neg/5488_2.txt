The story is: a troupe of actors of the turn of the century, along with producers and theater owners, have very complicated relationships. A resident playwright has written a psychological drama. He wants to get a good production on stage, but he can't help but convince a joint reviewer to revisit the production, and give a positive review. If his production does not go on, the crew will put on The Doll House, recently written by Ibsen. Many different relationships are explored among the main ones; none of them is interesting. But the involvement of the characters with one another leads to the drama of the resident giving the drama. <br /> <br /> This film is purely an excuse for the director and his friends to get together and put on a movie. The plots are inconsistent for anyone who is not a friend of one of the stars. The only reason I didn't leave the theater after about half an hour is that a fat lady was resting a full meal on top of her stomach at the end of my line.
