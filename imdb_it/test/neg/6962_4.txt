I approached this film with the knowledge that it was one of the worst films ever. I sat down to look at him with this mentality, and I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> It's not great. It's not even that good; in fact, it is rather poor. However, it's not as bad as I've been led to believe for a long time. It is rather inept, and, evidently as a cost-cutting measure, a great deal of repertoire material is put into operation, many of which have no apparent links with narrative. <br /> <br /> What it is, however, is an intensely personal film made by a man who evidently did not have the skills or funding to do justice to his idea. Before you discard _Glen or Glenda? _ By hand, examine your artistic skills. I, I'd like to be able to draw, but whatever you try to draw comes out like a stick. I would love to be able to sing, but all I do is scare small children. <br /> <br /> Wood had an idea, and unfortunately he didn't have what it took to make it work. However, this was an incredibly bold film for the Puritans of the 1950s, however exploitative or inconsistent it may appear at first sight.
