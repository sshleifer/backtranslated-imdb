The only reason anyone wanted to see this movie would be because of John Leguizamo. I remember the previews, and it seemed to be another second-rate comedy. But the fact that Mr. Leguizamo was acting, he tried to redeem it. His name, at the same time known or not, tried to sell it. <br /> <br /> I was rather disappointed with Leguizamo's performance. His days in "House of Buggin" "(a clone of" In Living Color ") were his tip-top. There is a thin line between extravagance and idiocy, and we will only say that Leguizamo has multiplied it. "Trying to be too outrageous and crazy about the camera. Actually, I'll say he tried too hard. The crazy humor poured into stupidity and the movie was ruined. I can't say I blamed it if you were given this opportunity." would you have tried to do it if you could, right? Your enthusiasm cost you dear Mr. Leguizamo ... <br /> <br /> Pest follows the tradition of any comic film, and plays the "race card", and more, no group is excluded from being funny, blacks, Latins, whites, Jews, Koreans, Germans, homosexuals and the blind are among those identified, once again things get too exaggerated and too much attempts to be falsified in a too short time The film resolution takes all five minutes p to clarify and return to normal. <br /> <br /> When you have a movie, and you're going to get around the plot and the reality for the sake of comedy, just make sure it's fun, or all you have is 90 minutes of meaningless movie. Which could very well sum up the "Pest" of Leguizamo ...
