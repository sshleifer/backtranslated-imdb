This film was so bad If someone who has starred in the film has read this, including the director, I HATE YOU! LOL, that blond woman, who was running away screaming through the forest. At least THINK, DREAM GIRL AND KEEP THE DODGY HEATY BREATHING !! and oh my god, if it was the director who fixed the cameras on this, then back to a normal job. No one wants to look at a scared woman's chin for all this. Don't even think about renting / buying or even having a copy of it within a 100 meter radius of your home as it can be harmful to the people you like. good movies ... When I got home, I thought that id had rented a pron movie with acting and camera style.
