Having loved the novels and stories of Stephen King for many years, I, like most reviewers, have been constantly disappointed by the film adaptations of his printed works. Some notable exceptions are "Stand By Me" by "The Body", "Carrie" by the novel of the same name and "The Shawshank Redemption" by "Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption". This film is by far the worst thing that has ever been produced with the name of Stephen King connected to it in any way. Not surprisingly, Mr. King has practically denied any connection with it. I feel that the thing that offended me the most in this piece of badly interpreted, low-cost and horribly direct junk is that they had the audacity to COMPLETELY change the ending. Don't waste your time and money in this fantastic bow of a movie! !
