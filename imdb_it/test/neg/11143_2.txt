Rather, he liked Flesh and couldn't wait to get warm, but he couldn't help but hear Morrissey take advantage of most of the "performers" here. Stumbling naked in a narcotic awe seems to be all that Dallesandro has been able to do in this feature - a huge and heartbreaking contrast to Flesh. His semi-erection in some scenes is the only indication that he could act; mostly it looks like something he did to buy drugs. Woodlawn is a revelation, it is the personification of the Lower East Side. But her is a show for a woman - she rarely engages with other performers but, it must be said, her scene of sex with a bottle of beer leaves Halle Berry permanently in the shade when it comes to cinema performances of raw passion. When he throws himself on a young aspiring lover, he is with the ferocity of a vampire. Two of the female performers, Andrea and Jane, have annoying voices that you will have to silence the sound to pass through their scenes. The fact that many of these artists committed suicide or were killed a few years later only adds to the air of exploitation. But they were probably desperate to still have Morrissey's camera in front of them. There is probably no worse way to spend a Saturday night, but at least it brings a specific moment and a vivid place to life.
