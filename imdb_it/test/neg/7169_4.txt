George Burns returns as the almighty joshing after enjoying a great success with "Oh, God!" In 1977, a cheerful fantasy made famous by a sudden need in the 70s to go from a thriller to a comedy-driven devil redemption (even if he made money, the original was more in line with the comedies "Topper" of the years 30 that with the return to the religious cinema of well-being Here, God appears to a girl (Louanne, who previously acted in a theatrical production of "Annie") and asks her to spread her divine Word, causing her nothing but adult problems in the process A particular film, family-oriented, seems quite warm, and Burns manages to sing with a nice burst of ironic jeers, but the script is half slap and half serious, with the adults of the piece thinking to put little Louanne away, all this makes God look more like a troublemaker than an old friend Louanne is another problem: a lively boy with small, withered eyes, is not trained to act and occasionalment and it looks awkward. Medium-budget production has a glacial, TV-film appearance, with a few graceful touches. The final scene imitates the climax of the first "Oh, God!" as it brings a melancholy feeling to the mix, which is welcome. It is the thinnest moment of the film. ** from ****
