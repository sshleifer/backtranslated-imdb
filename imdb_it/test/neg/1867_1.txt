All films that contain "silly sound effects" should be shot. If there is one thing I hate, it must be the use of a "whoop whoop whoo" when someone is hit in the head. The only movies I've seen are Ghoulies IV and Hobgoblins when I'm in the bar, and Pixie is hitting the guy in the red suit with a bottle of beer ... or rather, waving him with a bottle of beer because she never really hits him with it. Yes, Ghoulies IV sucks. But I have to ask myself, did they think they wouldn't move the so-called "Ghoulies" mouths when they were supposedly talking? Their faces are almost as static as the masks used in Trolls 2. Hell, I can make a better mask with construction paper, a little rubberized cement and a handful of glitter. This has sucked.
