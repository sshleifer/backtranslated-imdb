I'm writing this while watching the DVD. I grabbed the laptop and went to IMDb during the first song. I knew nothing about the film except that a friend said that the show had to be good. It also has a fair Netflix rating, so here I am. <br /> <br /> Maybe this worked on stage. But I have to say that the sight of dancing and singing completely naked choirs seems silly. And the lip that synchronizes with a pre-recorded score adds to the strangeness. <br /> <br /> Most songs and routines cover aspects of male nudity. This is my idea of ​​nothing, I'm sorry. The score, so far, is generic tuning music. Nothing memorable, or particularly melodic. Everything is for serving the texts. Which, I must say, seem to be written by a committee. Each song is essentially an extended joke. If the lines were ten seconds, they could work. These single minutes of several minutes do not. <br /> <br /> Now I'm watching the film by chapter - a few minutes until I get the idea. A little in the hope that one of them is different, or fun enough to keep me from going to the next scene. No. <br /> <br /> Ok. I finished. So here's what I think. If you have experienced or appreciated music theater for a long time, avoid this: it is not just quality. If, however, you are a twenty year old gay and you have never seen or heard a musical comedy, you may be entertained. Or maybe this would be your interest if you've never seen a lot of attractive naked men. <br /> <br /> ho.
