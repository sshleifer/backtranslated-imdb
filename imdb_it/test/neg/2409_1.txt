If you tried to make a bad movie, you couldn't make one worse than this. I can't imagine anyone paying a lot of money to see garbage like this in a theater. The thing that really makes you become hypnotized by looking at the whole thing just to be amazed to see how bad it could be. The saving aspect of this film was to see the words "The End"
