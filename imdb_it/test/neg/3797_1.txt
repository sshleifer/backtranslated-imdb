4 Oscar winners, Karl Malden, Sally Field, Shirley Jones, Michael Caine. Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle. 1 hour and 54 minutes of pure boredom, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a feeling of slacking of GOOD LORD, WHAT WAS THINKING? <br /> <br /> Irwin Allen was just trying to cash in on the popularity of the classic catastrophic original film with a script minus D, the actors were obviously just for salary, ... horror, horror! <br /> <br /> How crazy are the characters that are playing Caine, Savalas, Malden and Field? Enter a potentially deadly sinking ship 1. on the fire 2. Hot from the steam 3. Slippery from water and oil, 4. Boilers that explode every 5 minutes, etc., All for the sake of money? Greed? 5. They have very little equipment, not even a pair of gloves or work boots in sight, much less a grappling hook, a rope, etc. <br /> <br /> Stupidity! <br /> <br /> What were they thinking? <br /> <br /> Peter Boyle strives so hard that I just wanted to slap him! Stop that! And what's the problem with the bad toupee? Furthermore, there is no way to believe that his character was a World War II veteran. <br /> <br /> Caine, Field and Malden find all that gold and money and are happy - whoopee! We are rich! (We might not live to spend it, but hey ...) <br /> <br /> And yes, he's the great actor of Slim Pickens characters! <br /> <br /> Survivors galore! Even Jack Warden and Shirley Knight! <br /> <br /> The last dramatic subtitle on that scary plutonium has never gone anywhere, is it as if they had forgotten, a little? Lots of holes in the script. <br /> <br /> This film has a disease that the strongest pill could not cure. I'm surprised Alan J. Smithee's name wasn't in the script, I'd be embarrassed for writing this! <br /> <br /> Oh the madness, Oh humanity! Oy Vey! <br /> <br /> The Horror, The Horror! <br /> <br /> It's like a bad two-hour TV movie. <br /> <br /> At least the sets were made with recycled materials from the first film. <br /> <br /> The script had to be in the compost heap ...
