This is a poorly written, poorly directed, pure and simple short film. What is interesting and makes me look, to some extent, were the production values. Shot on video it appears, with a bad script and bad direction, one would think that it would also have a horrible production value. This is what the viewer expects when they watch a film that is terrible and filmed on video. BUT Not in this case, they spent some money and showed it. It keeps me very slightly interested to see what happens next, just to see! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst short film I saw looked like cheap Hollywood, even though it was shot in some sort of video format. <br /> <br /> Instead of spending the sum of money they must have spent on some pretty awesome set design, it would have been nicer to see a story better done with good direction. But then again how can we expect the new directors to do this when even Hollywood doesn't.
