What could have been something really terrifying, ends up being an incomprehensible and crazy film that even the filmmakers themselves probably didn't understand. If they had shown more about satanic ritual or anything else, it could have been more disturbing, but as it is now, this is a waste of time and brain cells. Is anyone else getting sick of the "kid who draws scary pictures with a pencil"? Could there be a bigger clich√© than horror? Probably not. I know, I know, it comes from a different country, and it's too refined and sophisticated for me to understand, so I shouldn't expect the "plot" to be fed to me by spoon, blah, blah, blah. Everything. I still say the shots of the cinema.
