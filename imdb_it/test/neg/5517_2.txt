If there was an EPA for film, then this film would get their most sincere approval. If we all recycled our "things" up to this point, we would never be short of anything. <br /> <br /> Funny how I was reminded of this film when I saw Starwars I: The Phantom Menace for the first time. At least Lucas didn't recycle his old video. <br /> <br /> This is a real disaster. But it's a real disaster. Cute in points (I liked it when the guy said "damn rocks"). And if you like explosions (even recycled ones) you will be filled. <br /> <br /> Actually, for a film obviously "without a budget", it turns out quite well. Acting is weak, but there is a small characterization here and there. The story is predictable, but it will lead you anyway. <br /> <br /> This is a type of film "everyone chases the child" that will probably attract the younger audience above all. I gave this 2 to 10. <br /> <br /> I recovered my old VHS copy of this movie. I don't think it's on DVD.
