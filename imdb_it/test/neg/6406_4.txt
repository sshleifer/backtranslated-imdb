There was a time when Joel Schumacher placed quite high on my list of favorite directors. Back in the late 80s and early 90s, when his name was linked to many great films like "The Lost Boys", "Flatliners" and "Falling Down", he was truly one of the most gifted directors of Hollywood. Then came the stupid "Batman" sequels, unfortunately, and later it seemed that every potentially sublime script turned into a giant mess in Schumacher's hands. Both "8MM" and "Phone Booth" could have been much better films and even the incredibly foolish concept of "The Number 23" should have been turned into a slightly more compelling and fun movie. Literally from beginning to end, "The Number 23" desperately tries to be a mysterious and disturbing thriller and therefore uses all the terrible clich√©s of the great book of film history, including heavy storytelling, flashbacks, messy structure, characters with more personality , numerous twists that become increasingly absurd and sinister. Nothing, however, is simply due to the sheer nonsense of the basic formula and the clearly uninspired involvement of the cast and crew. As much as you try to associate yourself with the protagonist and have an open mind about crazy theories, this still remains a film on a two-digit number and two-digit numbers are not scary. Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey in a rare non-comic role) is a bored animal trapper whose wife Agatha gives him a bizarre book for her birthday. The book talks about diabolical theories and strange coincidences that are connected to the number 23. Walter identifies himself almost immediately with the protagonist of the book (a squalid investigator who investigates a sad case of suicide) and begins to identify copious examples of the enigma in his private life. I did some research on Google and Wikipedia and, apparently, this numerological nonsense really exists and some people sincerely believe that most catastrophes and accidents are directly related to this evil number. Well, it's just ?? crazy! But hey, I'm not here to judge people's beliefs and fears, no matter how demented they are, and I can only share my humble opinion about a film based on a furious enigma. "The number 23" is not full of suspense, despite some sad pieces of the scene and ugly make-up effects, and never at some point manages to make you think about the role of numbers in your life. All the cast members behave below their normal abilities, but it was still a joy to see the beautiful Mrs. Virginia Madsen again in a relatively large production. Certainly it is not recommended if you are looking for a solid and creepy evening of fun thriller, but bearable and not entirely without merit.
