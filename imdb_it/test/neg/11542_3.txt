Just awful. It is almost unbelievable that, with the characters and situations provided by Dashiell Hammett, a mixture that is so tiring and without passion can be born. But this is the television for you - filler between commercials. The first warning signal sounds from the fussiness of the reconstruction of the period, which shouts "1928" in a type of banner. Flivvers and touring cars, fedora and waistcoats, cloches and speakeasy jazz (with strident play) - with all the attention paid to unnecessary and artificial details, important questions are ignored. <br /> <br /> Like narrative clarity, or plausibility, or competent writing and acting. The plot establishes one of Hammett's operative agents ("Hamilton Nash", therefore, whether it is called "Ham" or "Nash", we think of "Hammett" or "Dash") investigating a false theft of diamonds. This is how the young woman who presumably wears Dain Curse (the lacking charm and talent of Nancy Addison, who has returned to the soaps to which she belonged) is presented; she belongs to a cracked religious cult led by Jean Simmons and seems also dependent on "drugs"; there is also a mysterious gaseous drug that penetrates into the rooms .... <br /> <br /> But enough. Writing is never more a pawn than when it reaches the poetic or the high flight, and the parrot cast is the only way they know how: with grotesque overcrowding. Simmons is treated like a minor in old Hollywood, but the treatment with the great lady is not washed. Hector Elizondo for some reason enjoys a second billing (after Coburn) for a part to be dispensed. Other familiar faces go through, doing little good for their resumes. <br /> <br /> Actors are not even photographed to look beautiful; Jason Miller is a real scare, but even Coburn's extreme close-ups are merciless. Coburn probably won this role because, with a mustache, it bears a strong resemblance to Hammett. He needed more guidance than that; no one gave him the vaguest clue of how to interpret his character, or the tone of the story, or how the different threads of the plot mix (they do not, at least not in this story). So show his big Chesire-cats smile, whether he is asked or not. <br /> <br /> The Dain Curse is available on videotape, in a variety of lengths. For those foolhardy enough to "see for themselves", the shortest reduction is the gentlest cut of all.
