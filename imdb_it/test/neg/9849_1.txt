There are so many things wrong with this movie that I don't even know where to start. History is not cohesive with ALL. I guarantee that the average spectator scratched his head five minutes into the film. <br /> <br /> Here is what I remember from the film before I was bored in unconsciousness: an almost abusive father chases a little pre-adolescent sisters through a house, but turns out to be not so abusive. In the next scene, the girls are about 15 years old. They drive with their parents and hit a deer. The deer must have been explosive because their car explodes, one sister drags the other from the burning wreck. Then, the girls are drifting on a boat on a lake and make a huge plan to go to Kentucky (??) and start a new life. In the next scene, the girls are hitchhiking to a military base. And what a military base it is. Actually, it's more like a converted pig farm to look like a military base with many confusing extras playing "soldiers". The base commander's office is particularly impressive because there are random things like an AK-47 hanging on the wall and a sergeant hat mounted on a license plate (????) so the public is sure they know this is military office. Then a casual guy appears who pushes a motorcycle and the commander of the base orders him to go "in the city" to buy some porn magazines, and to make sure that the soldiers don't think they are in the "pink squad". Then our character takes a converted pickup to look like an army truck "in town" and loads a box from an anonymous "book store" with an inflatable doll next to the front door. The girls hide in the boy's truck when he stops making gas, and looks through the pornography store to find objects inside like "the anal invader". I suppose it's enough plot to scare most people. Apart from that, the sound quality is terrible and the film is full of trivial attempts at symbolism, like a radio preacher who talks about forbidden fruit during the scene where the "slutty" sister meets the main character for the first time, or how the camera lingers too long on certain shots to try to transmit a "message". <br /> <br /> If you ever see it for sale or rent or anything else, stay away. In both cases it is not worth it.
