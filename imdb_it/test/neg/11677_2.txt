It would be easy enough to make this movie funny: a girl called is shot in the front by a North Korean spy, but she survives. The bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her long for knowledge, as does sex. Unbeknownst to her, she moves away from filming with George W. Bush's cloned finger in her purse, a key that can unlock the power to use nuclear weapons. Just call it a romp, and at least some people will show up at the theater. I'm not sure how many have seen this four-year-old movie when it opened in New York last April, but I sincerely hope not many. It looks like a pink and playful film, but it has artistic pretensions and is really incredibly boring. Many Pinku films have been successful in their artistic aspirations in the past, but the aspirations of this film only make up the time they spend in atrocious sex scenes. And then the sex scenes aren't even good! I've seen pretty scandalous things in dirty Japanese movies. I've never seen this country produce something with sex so boring. The Spice Channel is more imaginative. The only useful thing in this film is the body of the protagonist, Emi Kuroda. Otherwise, this is pure torture.
