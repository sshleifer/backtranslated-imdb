I can't believe I actually created a 'season ticket' on my TiVo for this, apparently they had a good preview or something ... I can't imagine it anyway. After seeing about 5 minutes I thought to myself .. because I'm watching this .. It's definitely not reality, and some of the worst acting I've ever seen on television .. I'm totally addicted to reality TV and there's nothing true of this. ACTING .. (if you can call it that) is horrible .. The only ones who are almost 5% decent are the girls who aim to attract viewers to the show ... even if they need to be much nicer to save this disused train ... if they had more lines they will probably change their mind because they probably don't even have talent. This is obviously a very low budget production with seemingly very cheap "actors". There is no way to get a job in something else. Someone needs to refer these people to a job in the food service. Maybe they could do it. Oh, by the way, Parco P.I. no longer takes up space on my TiVo or TiVo seasonal pass list. Definitely the worst show I've ever seen.
