Chuck Jones "odorless kitten" is the comic that introduced Pepe Le Pew in the world ?? a type of. There are some key differences between Pepe that we know and love (or hate, in the case of some people) and the character of this cartoon. For example, the masked cat that Pepe loves lovingly in "Kitty odorless" is decidedly masculine. Furthermore, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the peak of the cartoon, his French accent falling when his wife and family show up. Pepe is not even the main character here, the attention that favors the putate cat who disguises himself as a skunk to frighten his enemies. For the most part, the plot largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon but Pepe's aggressive courtship lacks the usual jokes and straight camera addresses that make him such an exceptional character. Nor is it as beautiful as it would have become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, "odorless kitten" is a fairly ugly and clumsy all-round comic. Its main source of attraction comes from its concept that was original at this stage, before it became the model for every Pepe Le Pew comic strip that followed. This subsequent development has stolen "Kitty Odor-able" of any kind of impact and modern viewers seem like a rather boring short by Pepe Le Pew with a strange surprise ending. As a child I hated Pepe Le Pew. As an adult, able to appreciate his more sophisticated, verbal and audacious humor, I love the character and most of his cartoons. "Kitty odorless" makes me feel like a child again!
