This is a painful film. What makes it even more distressing is the time, effort and money put into a super-predictable script and action. <br /> <br /> It is a species of monsters, among other things, and a species of insects. Don't expect an explanation of the plot. There is nobody. It could work, if there was something interesting, or characters we might be interested in. There is not. Everything that happens to any person is as predictable as the other films on the Sci Fi channel. <br /> <br /> Don't try to figure out what some of the characters are saying. They speak nonsense, especially the boring leading woman, whose accent is a kind of British English that is harder to understand than any old British movie you may have seen. It's incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> A lot of money is spent on some fantastic sets and sets, and this is the main crime of this film, because it's not worth it.
