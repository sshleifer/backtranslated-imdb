To say! Dismal! Terrible! Ridiculous! Disappointing! <br /> <br /> Right, trapped in "The Cave" with several "hard" men and a woman or two, your being systematically killed by "Something" and you STILL can't hear NO bad raised words !! ! A 15 Cert 'here in England, and one could say! <br /> <br /> The egos of the "Macho Men" were just too many, I spend the bucket getting sick. <br /> <This film should never be exposed to daylight and ironically, be kept in the darkest, deepest hole in the ground and be forgotten forever. I have the feeling that this description is not the first time you crush his head from a hole in the ground. <br /> <br /> Just like the movie The Cube, it seemed like a good concept but it was only left down to the last post of, well right. <br /> <br /> This comment contains good spoilers, it's called The Cave. <br /> <br /> Thanks Bruce.
