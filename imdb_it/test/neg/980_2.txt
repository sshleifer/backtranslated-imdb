... but unfortunately no one thought of killing Van to save this doomed production. The only positive thing about him in the film is his beautiful singing voice ... too bad that the songs are mostly tasteless and mushy. Why do I hate Van so much? Well, for the whole movie it looked like he was doing an imitation of third-rate Soupy Sales - with a lot of grumbling, bad jokes and too much energy being spent trying to make everyone laugh. The worst moment of these moments was when he "taught" the class - these guys laughed at EVERYTHING he did. Hell, Van could read the phone book or show the autopsy pictures and probably laugh! Now Van was not the only negative decision of the film: it was only the most obvious. Of course, having John Gielgud (an adorable actor) playing an Asian was ridiculous as well as having Michael York play Peter Finch's brother !! The bottom line is that because of these crazy casting choices, the film was condemned from the beginning ... and the worst of them was the terrible Bobby Van. Now in real life, he may have been a lovely person and it is sad that in real life he died so young, but with the material they gave him here I just wanted to tear his tongue out to shut him up. <Br /> <br /> I also mentioned the songs - egad, those terrible songs !! Frank Capra's original LOST HORIZON was a subtle pleasure for everything - and not a single song and dance number in the film. So why did they decide to add a bazillion of songs that did nothing to help the film? They only served to make it look like a sticky mess - like the original DOCTOR DOOLITTLE in combination with LOST HORIZON. The end result is a badly sweet children's film - not one that can be appreciated by anyone over 8. <br /> <br /> Now, if you can remove these problems, you have the basis for a decent movie. After all, the plot is adorable and is still hidden beneath the whole goo. Peter Finch is particularly good (although certainly not the same as Ronald Colman in the original). But, considering that the original was an almost perfect classic, why worry about this sticky packaging. Who wants to wade the molasses?! <br /> <br /> By the way, this film was included in the book "The 50 Worst Films" by Harry Medved. Even though I didn't like the movie, it wasn't bad enough to deserve inclusion in the book. I think it was included mainly because it was such a big box office failure and because it was published only a few years before the book appeared. An excellent book - not just one of the best selections for dreck's "hallowed hall".
