National Lampoon's Dorm Daze is easily the worst movie I've ever seen, and I saw the Kazaam movie. Anyone who reads this that thinks this movie has been good in any way, shape or form, has no idea what a good movie is, and should never watch another movie again because they are really that stupid. <br /> <br /> It's hard to name anything that's wrong with this movie. First of all, the plot is everywhere and you can't follow all the many "misunderstandings" very well. The acting is nothing short of terrible, and the whole thing was hurt. Everyone who has worked on this film should never be in another film of any kid, ever again! <br /> <br /> It is too difficult to summarize this film in a couple of paragraphs, because it is so bad, but for anyone out there to read this please DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM !! If you want to see a good movie, go to anything else on television. The United States also has better films than this. <br /> <br /> _friend.
