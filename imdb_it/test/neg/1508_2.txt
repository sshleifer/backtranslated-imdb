Granny, directed by Boris Pavlovsky (who?), Sees eight friends live a night of terror when a psychotherapist dressed in an old rubber mask and a nightgown interrupts their party. <br /> <br /> They say you can Judge a book by the cover, but it seems that the same is not true for DVDs: I was in the mood for a REALLY bad horror film last night, and since the cover of Granny contained a faulty image of the titanic murderer swinging an ax, a terrible typography (they even use the Sand system font, a design called no-no!), And credits with absolutely no one I had heard of, I thought it would have been pretty bad. <br /> <br /> It was! <br /> <br /> When a film comes to just under an hour, it shouldn't take too long to get to the action; Granny, however, spends the first 20 minutes or so with her unlikely group of friends indulging in useless games and extremely trivial conversations. Anyone who actually is with the film long enough to start the murder (and I doubt most healthy people would worry about it) will be treated with several terrible amateur scenes, with a terrible acting and a surprise ending that is not surprising. (if you've seen April Fool's Day, then you'll guess the turning point before it is revealed). <br /> <br /> Granny is uninspired, not very exciting and almost unwatchable. To avoid.
