Most of the films I like are the art-house dishes and rarely appear in the top ten rankings at the box office. Having said that, I found "Northfork" absolutely incomprehensible. I have no idea what it was. Writing in the New York Times about a different film, Stephen Holden once remarked that some people seem to think they can throw anything on the screen and make it work like a fairy tale. I thought about this review several times while watching "Northfork". <br /> <br /> On a scale of one to ten, I gave a two.
