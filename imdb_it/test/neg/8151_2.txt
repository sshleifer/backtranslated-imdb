He gave two stars because the DVD cover was good enough to get me to buy this piece of horse manure. I paid a dollar for local DVD exchange and I want my money back. I have a couple of good movies (at least I think they're good) that have never seen the inside of a video store. After seeing this, I'm really insulted by this. Light years worse than anything I've ever seen, I can't even recommend it as a joke movie. It's so ugly, instead of making you laugh it makes you angry. How did this terrible film find any kind of distribution? I can only believe that it was self-distributed as suggested by amateur DVD authoring. For the producers of this "movie" to get out of the business, it is obvious that you have no talent.
