Los Angeles, 1976. The indie film brat John Carpenter, just out of film school and with a film - the budgetless 2001 episode of his class project called Dark Star - ends up under the belt of a gritty actor called Assault On Precinct 13. The story of an almost deserted police station under the siege of an invisible Los Angeles gang, was a minor success in the drive-in circuit and garnered little praise from the few critics who looked after it, but it has hardly ignited the world of cinema, unlike Carpenter's sequel. up smash Halloween (1978). In Precinct, Carpenter was still learning how to exploit his almost nonexistent budget by using lower level actors, keeping the action in the only infernal place and moving the film at a fast pace with a combination of editing, smart camera Nobody wants or need to be hungry in Hollywood, particularly if the catering account of the week on the 2005 version of Assault On Precinct 13 is more than the full cost of the original. This translates into a kind of laziness on the part of a director: you have a team of stupid unionists, a studio and a marketing company that are thinking about you for you. That's why twenty years after watching Carpenter's film I can still see every glorious moment, from the girl killed in cold blood while I was buying ice cream, to the incredible synth soundtrack. A week after Assault 2005, I remember Larry Fishburne's ping pong eyes and little else. <br /> <br /> "Forgotable popcorn actioner" fits perfectly on the top of the poster. It's New Years Eve at Precinct 13, a station that closes with a staff of skeletons to see in its last hours. On call is Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), an ex-narcot now deeply troubled and jumped on Jack Daniels and Seconol after his partners had been frozen in the opening scene; Iris (Drea de Matteo of the sopranos), a nymphomaniac with a thing for criminal types, and Jasper (Brian Dennehy), an old crunchy who scotch away from retirement. As in Carpenter's Assault ..., a bus with four heavy criminals is diverted to the District. All the mawkish eyes are on the gangster kingpin Bishop (Fishburne, still distraught from his time in the Matrix) who has survived a murder attempt by an undercover cop and plans to blow up endemic corruption in the criminal unit organized by Marcus Duvall (a tired-looking Gabriel Byrne). Soon the phones are switched off, the power lines are lowered, and both the criminals and the police find themselves heavily armed with a serious police arsenal and consumed with paranoia as they wage war against a task force of corrupt Duvall policemen exhibiting white ski masks, bulletproof vest, red infra-brazooka and other high-tech equipment compared to the Skywalker Ranch. This, it is expected we believe as the helicopters buzz on top of the police station firing rockets at Windows, is a covert operation to cover up Duvall's traces. He may even have pulled out billboards on Hollywood Boulevard. <br /> <br /> As in the recent remake of the seventies genre Dawn Of The Dead, Assault 2005 takes up the essential traits of the John Carpenter plot and, to quote the seventies, "does the same thing, man" . The main question is: why worry? John Carpenter's 1976 is a favorite cult among genre enthusiasts, but is hardly branded in the collective consciousness of the public. Carpenter himself was busy reworking Howard Hawks' classic western Rio Bravo in a tight and claustrophobic urban thriller for only $ 20,000. French rap director and producer Jean-Francois Richet, a self-professed proponent of John Carpenter's work, seems less interested in paying tribute to Hawks or JC - although the script is studded with references to cowboys and injun - and seems intent on squeezing in as much flash and firepower as the budget of millions of dollars can withstand. The result: some moments of tension with POV portable cameras, an unexpectedly high (and bloody) body count, a few twists, but essentially a class B urban actioner with a heavily inflated price tag. Regarding the control of the name, Carpenter, it is pure presumption on the part of filmmakers who do not pay. <br /> <br /> To Monsieur Richet, I say bon voyage, and I wish you good luck in your musical career.
