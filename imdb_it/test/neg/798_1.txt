I know that many reviews on IMDb are extreme, with critics praising a film to the end or doing it in an inarticulate way. I don't find this kind of reviews useful, so I didn't give this film the horrible review I'm about to read, lightly. The film is science fiction art-house of the worst kind dressed in a Hollywood blockbuster. The trailers attract you by showing you what looks like a cohesive plot, but in reality it's just a small part of a series of voluntarily baffling events that have never been correctly solved. I like films that challenge the viewer and I don't need to be spoon-fed, so my complaint against this film is not that it's too intellectual. No, the film is simply terrible. When the end credits are heard, you will feel the real anger of having wasted time with Cameron Diaz's wooden acting and his uncertain plot. To avoid.
