What a terrible movie. I can't believe I actually sat and watched it. A very, very, very, very, VERY pathetic effort, without any saving features. Hateeeeeeedddd ittttt! The so-called "racing" sequences are incredibly horrible, and the plot was so ugly, I forgot it. Part of the film was made during Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium, I believe, in 1988, during the current Grand Prix. I was there and I'm glad I didn't appear in any of the paddock scenes shown in the movie. It may have been good ... what a pity.
