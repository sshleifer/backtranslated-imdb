'Book II' is not a film, it is a sermon. This sickly, sickly and almost unbearably tedious shooting probably works as religious propaganda but has no entertainment value besides some of George Burns' lines. Louanne plays a young girl whom God (ahem) asks to set up an advertising campaign to get people to still believe in him. No really, this is the story. It is a load of lead from old cobblers that has too many self-justifying religious denominations, "explanatory" but almost no decent dialogue and certainly a total absence of anything that comes close to magic or charm. "Miracle On 34th Street" is not so. Suzanne Pleshette breathes a little life into this rancid puddle of quick cement, but the pudding-shaped script and the annoying Louanne's performance of trash quickly convey this character to the fiery depths of you-know-where.
