(This could have a spoiler) <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, I thought it was OK. The music was good and that sequence of bizarre dreams that I was willing to forgive, but the lack of looks in the main character and all the other characters didn't interest me to watch the rest of this film. (I know, absolutely vain.) The music was lively and perfect at first, I thought of a fake gothic novel. But, come on! Saxophone music for a 19th century film? Totally not right. This movie was totally boring and if you are looking to watch a vintage movie or an Austen don't rent Northanger Abbey! I give him 30%. 30% = one vote in default!
