This was intolerable. (SPOILER # 1) The protagonists avoid the useless revelation of agonizing truths to their loved ones, for fear that they will surrender to their status and assume the role of antagonists. (SPOILER # 2) Writers would have us believe that the exposure of multiple transgressions, by the offender, represents a threat and causes a retaliatory reaction on the part of the primary victim of transgressions. (SPOILER # 3) Until the last 15 minutes, I was anticipating a score from 6 to 8 out of 10; instead, it was like discovering that Lieutenant Columbo's dog is the real murderer. The story was not credible, and I don't think the best director in the world could have saved it without massive changes.
