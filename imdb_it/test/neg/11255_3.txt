This is a boring movie. The real villains are the clumsy adaptation (it's incredibly easy to say that the original material was a novel) and the script without spirit. <br /> <br /> On the credit side, considering the limited budget due to austerity during wartime, the appearance of the film is not bad at all. And the performances are, in general, OK, except for Phyllis Calvert, which is terrifying - a miracle considering the potential of great beauty, a pit in which it absolutely does not fall. Mrs. Calvert, with much less to do, is as accomplished as Olivia de Havilland in Gone With The Wind. <br /> <br /> The absolutely unbearable aspect of The Man in Gray is the terribly conceived representation of a black serving a boy. It doesn't matter that he is destined to be a sympathetic character. Played badly by a white guy with a black face trick, it is impossible to overcome this example of condescending racism. <br /> <br /> Grim.
