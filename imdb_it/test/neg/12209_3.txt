As much as I love the story of David Copperfield, I can't say I liked this movie. It was probably the second worst film I've ever seen. One problem I see is that the size of the novel requires a miniseries of several hours, rather than a normal film. It is simply impossible to capture a significant amount of events taking place in history in two hours. I don't like the thoughtful flashback format. He was disjointed and it would be impossible for someone who did not already know the story to be fully grasped. Also, I don't think the directors have correctly interpreted Copperfield's personality. The idea of ​​him walking on a beach that complains of his life seems inconsistent with the proactive and far-sighted nature that Dickens gave him in the novel. Agnes also annoyed me. He came across a home decoration rather than a strong woman. Dora was perfect, though. This film was full of problems, and I look forward to someone making a decent version of the screen.
