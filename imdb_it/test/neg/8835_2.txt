I have no idea how commentators might view this as a decent Western B. Or as one commentator said the plot was more cohesive than most. Nothing could be further from the truth! This film is a HUGE non sequitur! It is an affront to the noble western films of the 1930s. I have seen many of the early Lone Star and Wayne Republic westerns, and this is easily the worst. <br /> <br /> The villain is known as The Shadow - for crying out loud! Initially, The Shadow scheme is able to support open-body stage coaches. At the same time, his gang rustles up all the cattle in the area. Then they decide to go to the bank robbery. To do this, they need to shoot the city with a machine gun - no explanation of why it is necessary or how it got that toy too small! <br /> <br /> No single scheme is revealed in sufficient detail to suggest a plot here. The Shadow is obviously just a bad guy with all kinds of generally evil schemes. <br /> <br /> Send your instructions to your band through a fake wall safe. (Knock, who is there?) He is apparently clairvoyant, because every time his henchmen need to talk to him, they knock on the wall, the safe opens and - EARLY - it's there. (I can only imagine that he met them face-to-face and says, "I have secret and hefty instructions to give you our next bad deed - meet me safely from the wall and I'll give it to you.") Just because the Shadow requires that the safe communicates with its army of outlaws is, like most elements of this casino, never been explained. <br /> <br /> It has an elegant tunnel for the ol 'hollow stump on the other side of the road from which the observation point is located, several of its villains perform assassinations. He also has a hidden panel NOT in his secret den behind the fake safe, but in the main room. <br /> <br /> When not behind the safe, he hangs himself on his ranch without a cow, masquerading as a Matlock breeder. We learn that he killed the real owners of the ranch - two brothers - and assumed the identity. The daughter of the dead brother recently arrived from the New York School in New York (judging from her wardrobe), and apparently she never met her uncle, because he deceived her too! <br /> <br /> If you thought the bad guys were always wearing black hats and beautiful white hats, you need to see this movie. Here, the good guys leave all the hats in favor of the white straps that make them look like they all suffered head injuries before they were fired! It's like a basketball game on the pick-up truck - only that Wayne makes them tie bandanas around their heads instead of taking off their shirts. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the strangest of all is the ending. Immediately after subduing the Shadow Broker and his band, we jump far enough into the future to see Wayne and his wife (the ex-grandson) on the porch of their home. (It doesn't matter that there was little romance.) There, Yak is playing with Wayne's 3-4 year old son, dressed in Injun clothes! (Hiyoo, funny skookum!) <br /> <br /> No thanks to this nonsense, Wayne has continued to become a legend on the screen. Only a super star (packer or not!) Could overcome this entry in a film curriculum. Long live the Duke!
