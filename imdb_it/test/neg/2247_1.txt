I was discussing between this movie and 2012, but I chose Inglourious Basterds because of its incredibly high rating of IMDb. I must say now, what a disappointment. I was expecting a certain amount of gratuitous violence, but I also expected a lot of witty dialogue. I got a huge dosage of the first, but not enough of it. I felt short of The relationship between violence and plot is very important and I think this film is totally wrong. And the plot? It's credible or really fun. Save time and money. I can't believe what this assessment says for the bloody and violent tastes of the modern masses.
