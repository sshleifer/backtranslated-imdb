This film was a waste of my money. it was disgusting and disturbing. honestly, I would never recommend this movie to anyone. who thinks of a movie in which a girl blows her dog ?? seriously ... it was a waste of my time. I kept watching the movie, hoping it would improve and a plot would emerge, but it never happened. I will evaluate the film and F-. This film should have been rated R for its disturbing nature. I would never let children of any age see this movie. this movie sucks. this movie is horrible. this film was a waste of my time. I could have spent the night doing some time instead of renting this movie. this film was a waste of money to go to the store and certainly a waste of two dollars to watch it. practically, nobody should watch this movie. this film should be banned and burned.
