I give him a 2 - I reserve a rating 1 for Guy Ritchie and Woody Allen's films. We don't even remember what this film was about. The only thing we remember is a firearm scene in which the actors fall to the ground, roll across a corridor or something like that and then shoot again. It was like watching 80 years with 2 broken legs trying to perform "stunts". Also, when the characters were driving in a truck, the sound of the engine (or radio? Impossible to remember) would vanish completely when the actors were talking. <br /> <br /> And, like the others, we bought it for the cover of Sandra Bullock. very sad, very ugly.
