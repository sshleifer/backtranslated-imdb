Well, I fell in love. I saw the box for this in the video store and I mistook it for "Girlfight", which I had heard was exceptional. In my defense, the titles are similar and have redone the cover for the box so that it looks almost identical. In any case, to summarize, they obviously re-made the entire package / promo to capitalize on the "Girlfight" buzz / success. I took it and had a bad feeling when they started showing trailers for low-budget straight-to-video movies, and even worse when a music video of the main song of the movie, which sounded like elevator music, the film preceded the main feature. When I saw the first few minutes and Maria Conchita Alonso introduced herself, I knew I would fall for it. (don't get me wrong, she's a talented actress, but I knew she wasn't in "Girlfight", the movie I had the false impression I was renting). <br /> <br /> So, apart from me, feeling a little cheated and angry with myself for not looking more closely, the film was fine. The plot involves Belle, a young Latin woman who is the daughter of a former champion boxer. One of her dearest friends is a female boxer, who - and I could see all this coming long before it really was a drag - was seriously injured during a game with an average champion called "The Terminator", which looks like a version female of Ike Turner bigger and more pumped. Of course, Belle decides the only thing to do is become a boxer herself and avenge her friend. He lives with his caring but protective dad (his mother died of cancer when he was younger), who appears to be a policeman. His love interest, also caring and supportive but protective, is also a policeman who works with his father. Hmmm, both have jobs that put their lives in danger in the line of duty ... I ask what will happen? He starts training and meets a squalid manager who obviously pretends to take care of her but just wants to take advantage of it. The actor who hired resembles a very low-rent Cary Eweles and is so young that he can barely keep his whiskers. Even her acting was really, really bad. I won't even enter the plot any more because anyone who has seen Rocky, or almost anyone, knows exactly where this film will go and how it will end. <br /> <br /> This was not completely a terrible movie. Most of the acting was OK, and the lead actress was very good. There were good, strong female models of Latin role. The last fight scene made me a bit interested, even though I knew everything that would have happened much earlier. The actress who played "The Terminator" did a great job of being unlikely enough that I really wanted Belle to give her a kick to $, and had returned to Belle-again, although there were absolutely no surprises. My favorite moment (maybe the only time when I wasn't angry with myself for renting the movie by mistake) was when Belle slaps her bad manager after she shows her true colors, she yells at him and then walks away only to suddenly pretend punch and watch him shiver with fear, showing that she really is the only one responsible. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was really, really bad, my main complaint. One of their attempts to be witty was someone who talked about boxing saying "size doesn't matter" and the female replies ironically, "now where did I hear it before?" Other lines that should have a dramatic impact are "The doctors told me I could never walk again!" "Come on, you know you can trust me!" and "Your mother would have been so proud of you". I could go on and on. Nothing you haven't heard a million times in bad soap operas or movies of the week. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too bad, the directors made an effort, and I did the whole thing voluntarily ... but only because there was nothing else to watch while I was working. You could do worse (especially if you're looking for a movie with strong female characters) but you could do much, much better.
