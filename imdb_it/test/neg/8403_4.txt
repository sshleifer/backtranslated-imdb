A disturbing film, this, culminating, as always, with an intensely intimate meeting between a naked man and his young son, but in its confused structure contains a poetically imagined visual exploration of the innocence of an idealized amnesia. <br /> <br /> The plot follows two threads, the weakest of which is the gradual revelation of the conditions of Graham / Pablo. A wound through this, however, is a beautiful description of her condition, and her tortuous path to a partial awakening, guided by her relationship with Irene. <br /> <br /> The deal is the strong thread, while the specifications of the plot is carried by a seemingly attached series of characters: Graham's best friend, who can reveal the cause of his condition in a clunking flashback , his boss manipulator and his psychologist crazy scientist with comics: all those who have an interest in keeping him lost and addicted. <br /> <br /> The failure of the film lies in the conflict between the two wires. One is visual, tortuous and sublime, while the other is structured as an inept thriller, all the expository dialogue and unresolved schemes of symbolism. <br /> <br /> However, I liked Novo. He continues to flirt with the abyss of taboo and to slip away into something beautiful, like in the quarry, with the double bass player and the two women, when a setup for an economic pornography scene becomes a segment of peace and rejuvenation. I still can't get the tooth, though. <br /> <br /> Strange, clumsy and a narrative failure, but with an almost redeeming beauty.
