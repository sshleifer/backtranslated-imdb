The opening of "The Jungle" promises us a safari adventure with a science fiction element, but above all what we get is a travel diary with a lot of archive material and stuffing (and the odd leopard attack). The film is pleasant when you want it to be compelling, and tries to inject interest into the process with poorly prepared games between various wild animals (I had no idea that lions and wild boar were natural enemies in nature, didn't the great cats dedicate themselves to herbivores? , but apparently the producers knew more about it). <br /> <br /> As for the actors: Cesar does his usual great job of rocking his mustache, and Marie Windsor is reasonably credible as the daughter of the progressively thinking rajah (beautiful eyebrows, btw!). However, Rod Cameron is barely watchable as the hunter returns as the only survivor of his expedition. I'm sure he was in great demand in his time, but here he looks like a Rent-A-Center Bogart: raw looking, but without Bogey's range or timing. He spends the movie going back and forth from the stoic anger to angry stoicism, and every time the script tries to pull off romantic sparks between him and Windsor, you just have to laugh. That big, gnarled face is not a good vehicle for tenderness. <br /> <br /> The script is not entirely worthless, even if it makes some strange choices. At the beginning of the first act, the script gets into the habit of spending several moments in which the heroes decide to bring along the intelligent and intelligent mascot of boy and monkey, but in practice they ignore them until *** SPOILER ** * the monkey somehow gets a live grenade during the mammoth scene and accidentally jumps near Windsor. This is how Cameron can prove his courage by diving into it and saving his life at the cost of his own. *** FINE SPOILER. It is possible that the Indian version of this film (which in my opinion worked better than two and a half hours) could have given the child and the other monkey something else to do. <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes the film appear of its age ** SPOILER ** is the problem of woolly mammoths (the plot device that sets the safari in motion in the first place). When they finally appear, the way the scene is filmed, it is obvious that the "mammoths" (obviously elephants draped in carpets) are not really "attacking" anyone, or even move very fast, yet Cameron immediately puts himself to the test to wipe them out with hand grenades. These days, the idea of ​​destroying the last known specimens of a species thought to be extinct would be unthinkable, especially when all they seem to do is roll through the jungle at a leisurely pace. *** END OF SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> So IMO, four stars, which is good enough for a Robert Lippert production (normally Lippert's hack jobs rate two or three stars at best). It's not a shipwreck or something; moreover, it seems to mean well, with the rajah's daughter arguing for the improvement of the most repressive aspect of "traditional ways" and elements of the "mixed race" novel which was rather progressive in 1952. And there are some beautiful landscapes and exotic shows. Watch it if someone offers you to show it to you for free, but don't expect much if not an interesting historical chapter of the first fantastic cinema.
