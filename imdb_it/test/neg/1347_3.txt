This film could have been a decent re-make, and who knows what he tried (or tried the English lady). Assembling talented actors together with a successful and experienced writer / director should be a formula for a decent film. But the experience of the English lady - according to her IMDb biography - is exclusively limited to television work, and is evident throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that none of the reviews I read mention what I found to be the most unlikely of this film, and what prevented it from even reaching a part of its potential: it seemed and seemed to be made the television. To give some credit to the English lady, many of the jokes that simply did NOT work on a movie screen would have been fantastic on TV (and maybe a laugh would have helped). Much of the camera's use and lighting would have performed well on TV, but they looked awkward or weird on a big screen. If the whole movie had been chopped into a mini-series or a sitcom, I think it could have worked. But this is the cinema and unfortunately the talents of the English lady have not translated. I challenged so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors and writers that I felt like I had come out of the half shriveled theater! Meg Ryan is her usual, lively and cute (except for the horrible plastic surgery she had on her face), but where did she get the chance to use her talent ?! He made films in which he does not recreate his role as a typist and did them well ... but not here. Annette Bening simply seemed to go through the motions: such a great talent and such a poor performance! I liked the characters of other women but they were more caricatured than substance, and it was sad to see. What worked in this movie in the 1930s does not translate into the 2000s and no one helped the English lady get the changes and updates or the right subtleties. If only she (as a screenwriter, director and producer) had contacted some help, I think it could have gone well. But it wasn't. <br /> <br /> It's so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling that it's a waste of time and money for everyone! The New York comic I saw yesterday is appropriate: some film directors have a meeting and the caption reads: "Let's do a classic with worse than everything!"
