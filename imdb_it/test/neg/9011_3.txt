This film has a pretty decent premise - one incredibly present again and again in science fiction films, more spectacularly in "Alien" - and some decent interpretations of "him-man" from the male cast. The wife of the possessed astronaut, for me, is the weak link in the ensemble - she doesn't seem to know what to do with her face in many of her most important scenes, for which I blame the director Corman. <br /> <br /> Given a decent budget for props and special effects and a more focused and coherent script, "Blood Beast" may have been pretty decent. But the intrinsic cheapness of production design and the errors and gaffes of continuity undermine the procedure. For example, every time I saw the comatose astronaut lying on an "examination table" on the width of an ironing board, I broke the laughter, probably not the emotion the crew wanted to invoke. And the costume of the monster needed serious work; fern-covered parrots are neither scary nor convincing. <br /> <br /> However, the premise was strong enough that I hung up to the end only to see how the plot would be resolved, and the alien's motives were sufficiently ambiguous at first to think of it as an enigma. And the scene with the shot of the murdered scientist got a little fist, along with the development of the plot in which the alien claimed to have assimilated part of the dead man's personality. <br /> <br /> It's Corman. It's cheap, fast and slightly watchable if you don't think too much or you expect too much. What's more to say?
