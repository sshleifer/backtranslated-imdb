This film is overrated, to say the least. It's not good as a comedy, and it's not even good as a "serious" movie. The pace is too strenuous for the first, and there is too much disgust for the second. The only laughter comes from some of Bud Spencer's reaction shots when he becomes exasperated by his brother's behavior. Dubbing is excellent but full-screen framing is scary. (* 1/2)
