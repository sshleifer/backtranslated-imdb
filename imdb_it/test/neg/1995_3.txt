After being nearly killed by a large dog, a stray cat thinks to itself, "Why can't I be a skunk?, So everyone would leave me alone." He looks around the dump and has an idea: white paint, black paint and some Limburger cheese and some garlic ...... hmmmm. The next thing you know, we have the precursor of "Pepe Le Pew", even though in this cartoon, she's still a cat, she's a she, and only a skunk in disguise. <br /> <br /> Even the cat is enjoying and is taking full advantage of its new stinking smelly status. He is a happy and contented boy now ... until a real skunk (with the imitation Charles Boyer voice) shows up! <br /> <br /> I liked the cat wearing a Bugs Bunny dress. However, overall I have never been interested in these French take-off characters, finding the stereotyped dialogue exaggerated and not really fun, so I consider this only as "right". I make this a point, however, for morality at the end of the story.
