This show is the worst show ever! Norris and his family write it, produce it, run it, etc. Etc. The only reason I see it is because my girlfriend loves it. How many times can Norris fly air out of sight and land on an obviously blind enemy? No trees, no buildings, just whoosh ..... thin air. ALWAYS solves the case or is the best at whatever skill there is. No star ever gets glory. It's all Norris. It is really evident that Norris is terrible attached to himself and will not allow anyone to face him in any scene, no matter what the content. Terrible acting, terrible script, terrible series.
