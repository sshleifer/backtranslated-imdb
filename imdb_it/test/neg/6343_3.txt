I know these types of films sell tickets and make a profit for the directors, but they won't do it like a Vietnam movie. Vietnam was full of horrors for the men who lived it day after day. <br /> <br /> This film stars Gene Hackman, a Korean war veteran, who was in charge of training a group of Viet Nam veterans on their way back home to save a group of American prisoners of war detained in a camp there. These men include a former tunnel mouse, a crazy acidic sailor, a California surfer tanned blond and an inexperienced boy (Patrick Swayze) who just so happened to a dad killed in Nam. They train first in a field in Texas and once in Nam are discovered and lose all their weapons. I am able to find substitute weapons and continue on their way to free captured men. Most of the men are found and saved, but the group of rags is mostly wiped out. <br /> <br /> This film played like a video game in which you could understand what would happen next and who would pop out from behind what bush, and who was going to die and who was going to live. Vietnam I imagine was not like a video game ....
