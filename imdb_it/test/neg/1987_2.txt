This film tries to be artistic but appears childish as the first attempt by a student of a film school. Then he tries to be erotic, but he comes across clumsy as a virgin's first attempt. Finally he tries to be cruel and compelling, but aside from Kinski's performance - which is powerful but conspicuously misplaced in amateur melodrama - it's almost as compelling as the hand around a wet noodle (which is an appropriate metaphor considering how non-erotic this movie is). It features a blowjob scene that is even more obscure than ChloÃ« Sevigny's career-burying performance in The Brown Bunny. Run away now while you have the chance. Go find yourself a Victoria's Secret lingerie catalog instead - it's more artistic and more erotic than this tripe.
