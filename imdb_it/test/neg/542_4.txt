First of all, I just want to say that I'm a big Naruto fan. I love the stories of Anime and Manga. Furthermore, the first film has just confirmed that Naruto is all about great fun, great action, great story, ... But then the second film arrived. I was very publicized because the first film turned out to be exceptional. But it didn't satisfy me a bit ... The story was lame, the action wasn't that good ... especially compared to the Anime series ... the same goes for the quality of the animation. I found it very bad ... Could the story get some lamers ... ANY ??? Where is Naruto's kyuubi ?? Not once does he become a demon ... I mean ... COME !!! My advice is ... see the series (until episode 140, so it's just a filler) and then read the manga because it's still great. Ignore this movie and hope for something better in the future ... <br /> <br /> All and all I gave him a 4, just because it's Naruto ...
