I couldn't believe how terrible and boring this Hollywood remake was. It's so terrible. He easily places himself in my top 10 of the worst movies of 1998. The only thing he had was Bruce Willis, who should stick to action films, like a completely emotionless killer who would kill his mother for the right price But I'd rather hear Robbie Coltraine speak American for a week than listen to Richard Gere's sickening Irish accent. But this film is also unlikely, unconvincing, uneven, unexciting, unimpressive and Sidney Poiter lands in a trash role make a possible career return. One for the purposes of filmroll-footie entirely.
