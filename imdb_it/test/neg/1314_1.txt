You would have thought, given how much this exaggerated amount of garbage would have cost, that the budget could have extended to a decent screenwriter. Instead, they seem to have opted for a plot and dialogue of Hollywood catastrophic films "Paint by Numbers". The only cliché that seems to have lost was the cute Kid. But everyone else is there. There is the sullen hero, hurled by fate with his ex-wife and estranged father. There is the father and the rebellious teenager. There is the "professor who everyone thought was wrong until it was discovered that he was not" (recited in a terrifying way by the usual excellent Tom Courtney, apparently prey to some powerful drugs), plus the comic duo wandering the underground deserted. <br /> <br /> I sat down to watch this full of expectations. The cast is surprisingly well known. Yet in a few minutes it became clear how bad it would be. Stuff this useless should come with a warning. Something along the lines of: <br /> <br /> 'This film may have been made in Britain but was destined for the American market. It therefore contains tired clichés, serial characters, drawn dialogues and a so cautious and simplistic plot that even George W. Bush could understand it. "<br /> <br /> Avoid.
