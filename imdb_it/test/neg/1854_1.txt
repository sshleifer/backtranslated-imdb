It is difficult to imagine two actors of such class and experience as Michael Caine and Michael Gambon involved in such an embarrassing and inept film. The responsibility for this reckless production must be attributed to writer Neil Jordan and director Conor McPherson. I doubt I saw such a bad movie with such good credits for a long time. The comedian, Dylan Moran, who has left his mark as an irritable and incompetent bookshop owner on the television sitcom, Blackbooks, behaves very similarly here, except with such excess and lack of comic control to leave one writhing. It's easy to see how the story could have worked, because the situation is interesting and full of comic potential. A classical actor (Caine) tries to snatch the crowd (Gambon and co) with the helper of a fellow wannabe bumbling (Moran), with predictable results. It could have been and should have been good. Unfortunately, it didn't have to be.
