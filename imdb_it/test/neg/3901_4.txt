Don't be fooled by other reviewers. Although this film contains an impressive array of talents, the material they present leaves much to be desired. The 3 issues of Nat King Cole are rather lame and not even close to his later efforts, although he impresses with his way of playing the piano. 'Moms' Mabley is not a bit funny, although I remember her as a very entertaining guest on my youth talk show. In fact, the best performances are by a couple of fat boys who impress with a lively tap dance and a take off of Four Tops, and the jazz band itself, especially in the bassist number. The print itself is of very poor quality, and the wonderful Butterfly McQueen is completely wasted on the enveloping texture.
