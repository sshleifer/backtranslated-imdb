I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me, and we both had the same feeling about it: it wasn't terribly motivating, and it didn't even address the idea of ​​what a training program would be like, so that non-marathoners might have an idea of ​​what it would take for them to train and manage one. In fact there was almost zero technical information. I did not expect it to be a heavy technical instructional video, but when the information was close to zero, the film was not balanced and was not particularly useful to non-marathoners who were thinking about their first race. <br /> <br /> There were other problems. Some of the earliest images were people who collapsed near death while trying to run a race. Yes, really inspiring. Even the timing was difficult to follow, because it was semi-chronological, but the directors rarely gave you any good clues as to what point in time you were looking at. And they kept the information. See that Kantor has a wound, and you think he comes from all of his workouts, but then several scenes later finally undecided you because he tripped over a pine cone in his backyard. <br /> <br /> Some parts were very good, like the parody of a woman who challenged the race officials who wanted the race to be for men only, and the cover of a Chicago race where two of the runners portrayed before they were in the running for first place. <br /> <br /> On top of my head, I'm thinking of other chronological documentaries, like Supersize Me and Grass, where you always know where you are, and it seems to you that they told you everything you wanted to know. <br /> <br /> In short, it would not have been difficult to make a better marathon film, and as it stands I cannot recommend it to non-marathon runners to educate them and motivate them to try one, because I don't do it I think it will have that effect .
