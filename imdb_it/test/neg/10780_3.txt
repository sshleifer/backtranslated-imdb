If you are at home for a weekend, very bored and unwilling to move, with absolutely nothing better to do with your life for the next two hours, you might enjoy teasing this movie. The acting, the script and the general film production of this film are not so bad, and that is why it allows us to really sit down. This is definitely a movie that would show in the high school health class to teach the dangers of pre-marital sex. Or they might even show it to teach the dangers of very lousy music - that Brian Austin Green rock band is really terrible, I think this is a much bigger threat to the society of unmarried parents.
