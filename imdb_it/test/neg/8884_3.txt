I made this film here was good to various people. Plus I like Natalie Portman and Javier Bardem and director Milos Forman. Yet, after seeing this movie, I really didn't have anything to admire. <br /> <br /> First the acting was far below average. The performances weren't powerful enough to feel really shocked by what the Inquisition did. Javier Bardem performed well and was probably the only one with a Spanish accent. It's pretty obvious why this Bardem was the only one. Natalie Portman, who I think is a very good and promising actress, didn't really bother me that she was tortured. Like the movie there was nothing to admire about his performance. The Stellan Skarsgaard I like gave a very average performance, like the other actors who give a boring performance. This film was essentially about him since he plays Goya. Yet it didn't become what it needed to be to make this movie good. What about Randy Quaid? You just have to tease me. He who plays King Charles IV. Look who is very good at comedies, but who plays a king who describes the whole film for you. <br /> <br /> The direction was simply horrible in this film. When a film is a casino there are usually two people to blame: the director and the writer. I have the impression that Milos Forman did not really want his actors to accent Spanish. From the very few battle scenes here they have all been shown horribly. Even as a director he needs to give you the feeling of shock of what the inquisition did. After this movie I felt like I couldn't think of the event. To sum up, he turned the scenes wrong and misguided the actors. <br /> <br /> The writing that was also done by Milos Forman was just as bad or maybe even worse than the direction. There was really nothing memorable about the film, except one seen where Bardem gets the same treatment as Portman's character. Other then that the film did not give you the feeling of the period of time and at least could have compensated with a quote or two. <br /> <br /> After finishing this movie I was watching TV thinking OK because I should worry about all this. I'm interested in and I'm very interested in the story, but when films like this come in, it looks like the producers have robbed you of something good that could have been taken from the film. When the films are so ugly, we highlight many technical flaws in a film that were good. Like the accents I'm not sure people would have emphasized the lack of Spanish accents if this movie was good. <br /> <br /> The whole point of this review is just that I don't look at it.
