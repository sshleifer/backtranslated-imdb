What exactly is the point of pretending to "cheat" people on things like ski passes and pizza? I can't see a point. I wouldn't be smart or original and it seems extremely useless. <br /> <br /> Skyler Stone doesn't seem to be a real man or a cute boy. He has a very small charisma and anyone can do what he does in this show. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this piece of shit, is the fact that many of the phone calls are repeated, so not only are they apparently conning the poor on the other side of the phone, but they are also making the public angry who doesn't have enough time to read the "disclaimed" flickering around the screen for about half a second at the beginning of the show! <br /> <br /> Not only that, but he also claims that this is how he lives his whole life. What a lie Nobody could live their life like this and the fact that he said it's not just another scam to see his show, but it's also one of the most elaborate and bold pieces of success I've ever heard. This guy is a @ $$! <br /> <br /> What makes them think that going to all the problems, for example, writing and recording a song, making someone suffer a HUGE photo of you and two friends, taking dance lessons And is it really worth traveling to a ski resort just to get free ski passes and free food? what's the point of this? It's a lot of trouble to go for just a few ski passes and some snow. <br /> <br /> As for the "comedy", this is the bottom of the barrel.
