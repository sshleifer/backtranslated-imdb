A Lassie film that should have been "put to sleep" .... FOREVER. This is how I would describe this painfully collapse of a movie's time. So mediocre in every aspect that becomes just a boring, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've ever seen. Nor is it a goal as a "so bad-is-good" or "so-bad-is-memorable" film. The idea that Lassie becomes bad is intriguing but in reality it happens so little, and so slowly, that you feel your life slipping away while you're sitting there, watching the non-actors reading their lines on waiting cards of their poor salaries. <br /> <br /> It is an empty and empty shell of a film. Seriously, it's not worth wasting your or your child's time. Unless you are heavily medicated. This is all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Avoid, avoid, avoid! It will drive you crazy! Hahahah, understand? BARKING! Hahahahahahaha! <br /> <br /> Sorry, I had a difficult week.
