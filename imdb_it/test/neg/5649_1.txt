What else can I add? This is without doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen. A terrible acting, a crazy script, a boringly slow rhythm - even visible microphones hanging from the top of the screen. I could go on, but I really can't be disturbed. I watched it for 90 minutes before the sense of losing the will to live became too great for me. I can only assume that the first set of comments and votes came from people associated with promoting this insult to British film production. <br /> <br /> And worse, I had to buy the Mail on Sunday to get it :-) The only reason the DVD was not redistributed as a coaster is that it now takes pride of place in my collection of the 10 worst films ever. <br /> <br /> Definitely to be avoided.
