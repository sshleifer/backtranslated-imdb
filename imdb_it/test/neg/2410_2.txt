I really didn't know what to expect from "Future-Kill", but I certainly hoped it would be a little better than what I got. I knew the evaluation was bad and the reviews were unfavorable, but the illustration of the cover of the Subversive DVD seems beyond fashion and I can't resist. For a very long time (too long, in fact), this film gave the impression of being an unofficial Porky's sequel with fraternal, vulgar and offensive jokes. Five mega-dads, one of them similar to an exact young Jim Carrey clone, desperately want to become members of a fraternity, but their latest initiation could be a bit far-fetched and dangerous. They are left in the center of the city with provocative signs painted on their faces, simultaneously with the outbreak of a violent gang war. It doesn't take long before they confront Splatter, an apparently half-man and half-machine warrior who leads a band I never understood who or what they were. Were they a government experiment? Cyborgs? Terminator imitations from a distant future? Does anyone care? "Future-Kill" is a bizarre amateur film with a scenario that jumps from one subject to another without any form of logical or narrative connection. The plot borrows vital elements from great cinema classics like "The Warriors", "Escape from New York" and "The Terminator", but the end result is a gigantic Sci-Fi monstrosity. The costumes and special effects are quite pitiful and there is a truck loaded with cheap and free nudity. The acting is terrible, but I'm willing to blame the delayed dialogues instead of the cast members. One to avoid at all costs, despite the fantastic DVD cover. Resistilo!
