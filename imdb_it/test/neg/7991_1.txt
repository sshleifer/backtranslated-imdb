This film is a complete waste of time. I can't understand anyone sitting through this piece of trash. Oh, I would have loved it when I was seven. I think a seven-year-old child could have written it and directed it. <br /> <br /> There is no script, no acting, only crap. The best acting is that of the fighting cocks. I think I can whip these ninja and I'm not someone you would consider hard. Totally unconvincing and did not arouse the slightest interest. I was yawning and laughing at the end of the first ten minutes of the film. This is one that would distance people from martial arts movies. Great comedy, bad action movie.
