I watched this movie with no idea what it was in advance. I was intrigued for the first full hour. It was becoming a big thriller. A very talented cast and a good dialogue. Then everything collapsed for me at the sight of the first vampire. I couldn't believe my eyes. A great thriller was thrown into the toilet. The rest of the film from that point was absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> I gave him 4 stars for the brilliant start alone. I think he's a little generous, but I've been entertained for a while. I'm not a fan of vampire or zombie movies at all. If you are, you may not agree with my opinion.
