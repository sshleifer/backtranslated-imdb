This film is a real low-budget production, but I won't say anything more as it has already been treated. I rate this film as a low grade for the story alone, but I met the director the night I saw the movie and he gave me one more reason to hate the movie. He asked me how I liked him and told him that it was not easy to love. My main objection was the lack of foundation for the relationship between the two main characters, I was never convinced that they were close. I also told him that the scene where the main characters were presented while the children were becoming friends was too late in the film. <br /> <br /> He told me that the flashback scenes were not in the original script. Which were added because it felt like I did that the two main characters didn't seem close. He went on to explain that these scenes were not shot for his satisfaction because they were out of money. I agree that they didn't do much for the film. <br /> <br /> Another fact about the film, of which I was not aware, is that the actor who played the lead role wrote the script based on his personal experience. This is usually a bad move because some writers do not take into consideration the emotional reaction of the viewer. The story is so close to home that the writer makes too many assumptions about the public's reaction to his own tragedy. And the story is tragic. However, it didn't work for me as I never cared about any of the characters, let alone driving. What was presented were two evil people in search of gain, regardless of who gets hurt. When the character of Mrs. Young decides to abandon the ways of evil, it seems that she does it because she is ineffective, not because she knows she is wrong. If the film has a message, I suspect that only the writer knows about it.
