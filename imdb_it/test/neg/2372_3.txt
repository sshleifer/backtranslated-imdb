This is a comic version of "Strangers on a Train". It works pretty well. I am a strict grader, so the score 3 mainly reflects on the characters and the plot. The performances are extremely good, all of them. Of course, the two stars, DeVito and Crystal, shine more. Each actor behaves well enough to play. The comedy works at a level just below slapstick. DeVito characters work best when they are depraved. His character, played as a writing hack, would probably be more real if he was published and praised as much as most hacks are. His character would have, in real life, a great agent and multiple solicitations. The characters are one-dimensional, which is good in comedy. But the character of Crystals is not written very well. His desire to kill the "moma" all of a sudden doesn't make any sense. It looks like a pitiful attempt at humor. The pitiful attempts are not too frequent and the film runs fairly well.
