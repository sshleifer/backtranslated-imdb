MARY, MARY, BLOODY MARY is a good time killer. It has a uniformly attractive cast, the action is rarely boring. There are a lot of killings. And production values ​​are not bad. But in the end it sounds like a normal TV episode of the 70s with some nude scenes. The film is the end product of an "author" who tries to make a purely commercial film. There is little depth here and the film spends too much time with chases and action scenes. Except for the beach scene with the old, MMBM is almost devoid of any fear, suspense or terror. The director has very little understanding of the horror genre. <br /> <br /> It is watchable even if it does not leave a lasting impression.
