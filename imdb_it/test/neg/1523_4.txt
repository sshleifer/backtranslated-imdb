The first time I heard of Guest House Paridiso was in the ... bathroom "after having just seen Fight Club. A small round black circle was deposited in each urinal. When the circle came into contact with moisture ( to put it gently, it caused the formation of a color image, with the photographs of the two stars and the tag "You Pour Yourself Laughing". When you are finished washing your hands, the circle is dried and you are faded again in black, waiting to give birth to the surprise on the next "victim". Ok, maybe the joke wasn't terribly sophisticated, but you have to admit that it was innovative. In fact, I think I can honestly say I never saw anything similar in my life, and in these days of over a century of cinema and marketing, it is a real undertaking, a pity that the film that followed was not up to its promise. <br /> <br /> I hate doing a ride in the Paridiso Guest House and I am indebted to Rik Mayall (Richard Twat) and Adrian Edmondson (Eddie Elizabeth Ndingombaba) for many years of laughter through their captivating television series, both the invention of The Young Ones (1982-1984), Bottom's parlor games (1991-1995) , as well as solo work, like Rik in the New Statesman (1988-1993). In fact, this would have made a hilarious 45-minute television special. Unfortunately, it's a 89-minute movie. <br /> <br /> There is certainly a merit to be had, and I laughed continuously throughout the long finale, which falsified the Exorcist and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and got involved ... well, you'll have to see that piece for you. Yet often the rhythm is leaden and the sterile atmosphere is everywhere. The two stars (Edmondson takes the usual back seat, this time due to the fact that he directs properly) never enter the first gear, Mayall only sporadically shows the maniac that drives us crazy on the small screen. In fact, the presumption of the writers that we are already familiar with the characters leads them to be submitted to the public. The slight hints of depth seen in the series (Richie's effeminate, social climbing failed for example) are not present here, and instead we are left with parodies of parody. <br /> <br /> The accusation of Fawlty Towers makes the water pass, complete with a drunk and invisible chef, named for the waiter "Pasquele", who strangely rhymes with Manuel. Some of the ideas, a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a swing for children hanging on a cliff, are very, very funny, but in the end the frenetic pace is stolen, the two constantly look for a studio audience that is not there, and all areas of "dead laughter" patched up with incidental "comedy" music that would have been dated in a Carry On movie twenty years ago. <br /> <br /> The Paridiso brand of puerile, sadistic, perverse humor It's fun, and I'm sure it will make you laugh ... not as often as it should.
