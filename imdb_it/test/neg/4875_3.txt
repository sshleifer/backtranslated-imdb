This film is not worth seeing, at least not in a cinema. History is difficult to follow and understand (it starts with 10 minutes of something that happens 3 years earlier). It's hard to know if this movie is trying to be a comedy or it's just so ugly / weird that it sometimes seems that way. American sirens and lights on Swedish police cars are just one example. The acting of Persbrandt and Bergqvist is good as usual, but I think Jenny Lampa acts like Jasmin and is very poor. Zara Zetterqvist behaves quite well, she has never been seen as an actress in Swedish films for a long time. If you still want to see it, wait until it is released on DVD or appears on the TV.
