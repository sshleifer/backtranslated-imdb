Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll is without doubt the worst product of Western civilization. Monologues are both uninteresting and useless In the rare monologue that captures the attention of the public, it is quickly lost through excessively long repetitions and unnecessary additions (McDonalds' Hells Angels come to mind). I imagine Bogosian's one-man show needed a filler to give it a length that he thought justified the price of the shelter. <br /> <br /> I would rather sleep with my aunt and be hung upside down and drained of my blood than to see Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll again.
