This is one of Crichton's best books. The characters of Karen Ross, Peter Elliot, Munro and Amy are beautifully developed and their interactions are exciting, complex and hectic throughout this impressive novel. <br /> <br /> And about 99.8% of this was lost in the film. Seriously, the script AND director was horrendous and clearly made by people who could not understand what was good about the novel. I can't criticize the actors, because frankly they never had the chance to let this turkey live at Crichton's original work. I know that good novels, especially those with a sci-fi side, are hard to bring to the screen in a way that is as good as the original. But this could be the worst quality disparity between the novel and the film adaptation of all time. The book is really, really good. The film is simply terrible.
