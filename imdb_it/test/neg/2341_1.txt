Like most, I rented it after hearing universal praise. And despite EXPENSIVE bizarre and inexplicable moments along the way, I was very interested and entertained through 100 minutes of the film. Then the two women went to the "performance" late at night. The rest of the film (which is another 40 minutes by the way) is even weirder than the first part AND completely contradictory and unloaded on what I had already seen. Then the film ends abruptly. <br /> <br /> Disconcerted, I approached my computer to see if I could buy a clue about what had just happened. Nothing made sense, and I'm a pretty smart guy. None of these other users' comments made sense, even when they said "SPOILERS". I still have no idea what they're saying. Someone's dream? Not real? So what's the point of a 2 hour and 30 minute movie if it's "not real?" Or is it real? I am forced to make a choice. O: <br /> <br /> [a] The film is a brilliant work at MENSA level and I'm simply too stupid to understand it. <br /> <br /> [b] The film is weird for strange, and it makes no sense. Everyone who loves it is trying to save face and pretend to "get it". <br /> <br /> I chose [b]. Hell, I'm going home ...
