A frustrating documentary. The son of Louis Kahn, who saw his father only minimally during his childhood because he was a member of only one of the three separate families that his father had created, takes on the task of trying to learn more about his father through a exploration of his architecture and his life. It seems like a great idea for a documentary, but ends up being flat and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the main problem is that Kahn's son, Nathaniel, is not just one of the protagonists of the film --- he is also a director, writer, producer, interviewer and storyteller. Nathaniel seems to be too inexperienced that possibly too close to the material to function well in each of these roles. Also, while he looks like a pretty nice guy, he doesn't have a lot of screen presence, so the fact that he's the only constant in the movie wears out. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel also presents himself as an unprepared and amateur interviewer --- there are several places where an interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement and the camera cuts at a stroke of Nathaniel offering little more than an empty look and a kind of shy "uh-huh", as if he was a bit panicked that he should have found something to say in response. At times, I felt embarrassed to look at people who could say really interesting things about Kahn (or at least better things to do with their time) that seemed to realize that they were in the hands of an interviewer who would rely on them to direct the conversation. <br /> <br /> The dual role of Nathaniel both as a documentary filmmaker and as a lost child seems to do more to hurt the film than to help. It is felt that some of the interviewees are a little reluctant to really open up negative aspects of Kahn's personality and career, presumably because it is not clear to Nathaniel if he is trying to dig into the truth or simply want to hear good stories about his dad - - preferably those who will confirm his hope that his father is more important to Nathaniel and his mother than seems likely. His passive approach as an interviewer may stem directly from this conflict. The only person Nathaniel pushes is his mother, but those conversations tend to feel a bit like a bad teenage drama (aren't you ANGRY, mom?) And they don't offer much in terms of helping us (or Nathaniel) to understand Kahn or the loyalty he evoked from those around him. <br /> <br /> What the film desperately misses is the formation of an expert and independent hand, not to exclude Nathaniel, but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience. they have distanced themselves from the material, given more thought to what the respondents could contribute and, hopefully, cut out those parts of the documentary process that simply don't work, like the strange segment with the guy who claims to have seen Kahn die (which has made it look like Nathaniel was taken by a madman) or the whole business of lacing up with Kahn's first cousin, who had nothing to add about Kahn or Nathaniel. Too often Nathaniel makes us look up or near a building by Kahn, Buttonholi ng strangers to tell them that his father was the designer. (Ahhh ?? huh. Thaaat is kind, sir. Umm? I have to go now.) I understand why these things could be important to Nathaniel and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting, but this is one of those examples of when the documentary can be too personal. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, I thought the score written for the film was fantastic! (But, one of the strangest moments of the whole thing for me was when, during the tour of the Kimball Art Museum, the voiceover quotes Kahn as a comparison between Beethoven's architecture and the Fifth Symphony. Time? NINTH Beethoven's Symphony A mistake? A mistake? Who knows? It made me laugh. <br /> <br /> Kahn was a great architect and it is clear that he was an unusual human being and had an intriguing life history. good documentary about him. One is in tune with Nathaniel's search for the father he didn't know, but I'm not sure if THIS is an interesting story.
