Some people think of Sweden in a negative way: too clean, too clean, too serious, too organized and too northern. A people tortured by their own destiny and by their own religious history, which sometimes leads to depression and compulsive heaviness. This should not be a problem for a director, as for example the late Bergman showed us what can be cinematic as possible under these conditions. Bergman used his identity as a starting point and did not explicitly comment on this identity as such. <br /> <br /> Yet Andersson does the opposite: he only comments on this identity with which he dissects his people with bones: in his world Sweden is equivalent to hell on earth. But he doesn't take it anymore and for me this is not just art but simply annotation. Despite the exceptional amount of time spent making sure that this director has serious limits, he cannot clearly go out. <br /> <br /> Compared to his previous film Sånger från andra våningen / Songs from the Second Floor, there is also not much progress to be made. The intention was that this be more accessible, but the difference is minimal and the few scenes that try to please a wider audience are not the best in the film. The same absurdism and minimalism also apply, there is the one-shot camera position and the (lack of) action in front of this shot. Yes, the photos are well done, some of the scenes really work and the coloring and positioning are incredible. But is this an interesting film? Thinking negatively, this is the cinema that takes a step back. <br /> <br /> Andersson's background as a commercials producer transpires in the elaborate setup, but I find his films almost as empty as the advertising ones. There is a message about humanity, but it is trivial and without much depth.
