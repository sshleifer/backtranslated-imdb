Thomas Edison may have done a lot of great inventions, but WTF is this !!!! I'm sorry, but this movie is just awful. The plot is that this elephant walks for a certain point and is electrocuted. Ok, the image quality was similar to that used for toilet paper. I thought the first Charlie Chaplin movies were horrible. Okay, Thomas Edison may have been an inventor, but because he made this film he would have filmed a child who would feed and be better. People might say I'm getting tough on the times, but you'd like to try something like the one I said that Edison might have created the light bulb, but because he created this particular movie. Well, I might look like a complete hole, but look at this on Youtube and you'll see this abomination. I still can't believe this movie is completely horrible. All in all the worst short film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10
