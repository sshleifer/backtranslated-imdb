This film has delayed an economic film that tries to be a stoner film because the characters look for a dish but none of them is a smoker, just a pile of garbage. Thomas Hayden's church should no longer direct, especially this film which is a waste of films. The people who liked this movie gave good comments but from all the people here some are just retarded and don't watch movies, so they think that every bad movie is good, the actors suck and the movie sucks. <br /> <br /> I think many people will be upset because this film tries to look like the last herbaceous film when it's just the worst weed film I've ever seen, I hope people will stop the director from directing shit like this grass can't make this movie fun or funny.
