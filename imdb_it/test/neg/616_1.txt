With several actors named (Lance Henrikson, David Warner, Joe Don Baker), why was Jeffery Combs the protagonist? Henrikson would have been perfect for the lead role, like Warner, Baker or even others in the film like Charles Napier. The combs were uncomfortable in this, and they did a terrible job. Everything he did seemed fake or artificial. <br /> <br /> The script is poor. This means that if Lance Henrikson (or another) had the lead role, he could have saved the film (removed from my "waste of time" category), but it would have been a bad movie anyway. The screen was completely deficient. The director should have recognized him and helped the film.
