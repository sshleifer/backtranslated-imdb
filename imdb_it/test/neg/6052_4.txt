The problem with this film is that it is trying to compile a 6-hour movie in 2 hours. The result is clear. It seems too forced, unclear and too simple. <br /> <br /> The only positive side is the beginning. It explains well why and how Hercules was born. The rest of the film was ... just mumbo jumbo that was put together. It has the potential to be a great movie like LOTR if it's just not forced in 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Acting is not very convincing. OK, not everything is bad. But most of them are. The special effects are stupid and seem to be made ten years ago (even if the 1st monster is pretty good). In general, I give it to 4 out of ten for the reasons I described above.
