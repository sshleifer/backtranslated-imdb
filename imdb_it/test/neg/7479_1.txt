Seems to be a control freak. I heard him comment "lose control of the show" and tell another guest who brought live animals that he had a rule - "no snakes". He needs to hire a comedy writer because his jokes are lame. The only reason I look at it is because it has some great guests and groups. <br /> <br /> I saw the Craig Ferguson show for a while, but his show is even worse. He likes bull sh ** to burn time. I don't think either of them has a very long future on late-night talk shows. <br /> <br /> Daily also has the annoying habit of sticking out its tongue to lick its lips. Must do it at least 10 times a show. I like the Joe Firstman band. Carson Daily needs to lighten up before it's too late.
