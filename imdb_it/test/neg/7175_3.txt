This is a B-film-type fund from one of the rowdy poverty studies, Monogram, in the mid-1940s, the type that compiled a double bill. <br /> <br /> The only reason I looked was I had to see how JACKIE MORAN was in a starring role as a guy at a radio station trying to solve a murder. He played Phil Meade in GONE WITH THE WIND just two years ago and this was one of his last teenage roles. It's not Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> The script is as unlucky as the production values ​​and is full of trivial situations with a cast of uniformly talented individuals. WANDA McKAY is the receptionist who is "discovered" by a radio producer and SIDNEY MILLER is the nerd lover of the hero who is afraid of his own shadow. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it ended in an hour when the murder is resolved after a summary of all the suspects. Terribly overwhelmed, the only quiet performance of any interest is given by JON GILBREATH as Tex, the cowboy, but he bites the dust after an appearance too short. <br /> <br /> There are several songs, but all are forgettable, as are the lame lines and dialogue.
