This film was definitely boring. The acting was decent and the movie looks very nice, the soundtrack is definitely for Kenny G and Michael Bolton fans. Speaking of the soundtrack, I found it very ironic that a film about telling the truth and not stealing decided to use a song in his titles that was a BLATANT RIPOFF of "You Can Call Me Al" by Paul Simon - except that they don't recognize him at all. Isn't there something a bit hypocritical there? The scene where the main child he was imitating a game host was in was my favorite. 10 lines? Do I have to write ten lines on this film to include? What a repugnance, I don't think it's too right to force people to write more than they would just want to get it included!
