No serious spoilers, but some very minor. <br /> <br /> "Acacia", a Korean contribution to the ever popular Asian horror wave, concerns a husband and wife who decide to stay a while and decide to adopt a child. The child, who has a usual obsession with the dead tree in the family garden, eventually disappears when in the end the couple has a child and the tree mentioned above seems to nurture resentment towards the family itself. <br /> <br /> And that's all. The film moves at the rate of snails, with a delay of over 100 minutes with 80-minute material. It is essentially a subtle family drama with a creepy tree, and there is very little in terms of fear, just tree blows with strange mutterings that sound over the top. However, the idea that the tree is the child's mother is quite original, but it is not exploited to its fullest potential. This type of "Acacia" separates from much of the new wave to which it belongs: movies like Ju-On and Ring tend to do the opposite, and milk ideas bland until they are red in the face. <br /> <br /> The film starts going towards the end; however, the realization of the child's destiny and the parent's actions not only attenuate the previous curiosity of the story, but are revealed with such modification of the machine guns that it is difficult to transpose all at once. The final sequence is undoubtedly disturbing, however it seems too little late. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film does not seem to take too much of a ring, but with the "Renaissance film" that Korea is currently passing through, I couldn't help but feel that this film could have been a lot more.
