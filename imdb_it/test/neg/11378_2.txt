In a Farsesque key, Gaud√≠'s afternoons can be considered a mediocre exercise. Marcia Gay Harden and Judy Davis turned on a good cast (the bizarre character of Juliette Lewis's new age was incredibly taken from reality, I know an American girl who screams like her !!) but GA doesn't show much beyond her plot . <br /> <br /> Although the creation of a film is based on belief, there were some noticeable inconsistencies in the script. Two samples: pay 14 euros to enter the chapel where Cassandra and Frankie met, NEVER at 7 am, and you can't leave a terrace without paying the bill (they'll make you pay on the spot if they don't know you) or go down quickly from a taxis (Americans always recommend taxi drivers even if they don't expect it, but the sequences portrayed in the film are ridiculous). Don't believe me, reader: come and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> If you've never been here before, you don't care about all this, but good movies should be credible regardless of your origin. No one knows about GA here, and I will make sure it doesn't change in the future.
