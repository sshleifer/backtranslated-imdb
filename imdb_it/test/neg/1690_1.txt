this is a terrible adaptation of the story of Charles Kingsley. The animation is, to put it bluntly, terrible. And the songs are a disgrace to movie songs, especially for the song "high cockororim", which they keep repeating. I'm sorry for Jon Pertwee and David Jason, 2 of Britain's best talent, providing the voice for the depressing animation sequence. Bernerd Cirbbins does his best to perform in this horrible production, but fails. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs, even if it's the latest movie on this planet!
