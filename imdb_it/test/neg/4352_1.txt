This is the slowest "noir" movie I've ever seen. The very weak script only offers the opportunity for Jack Palance and Rod Steiger to perform exceptionally, lines created for a substitute audition. Both Palance and Steiger claim to be serious actors capable of representing their respective roles with power, emotion and drama. The story itself moves at an incredibly slow pace, mostly in a living room. The director obviously moved the actors into a rhythmic circle while distributing long exaggerated lines, to prevent the slow pace from becoming visible to the public. The action does not resume until the last ten minutes of the film. If you are one who is looking for more depth in a dramatic crime, this is not for you!
