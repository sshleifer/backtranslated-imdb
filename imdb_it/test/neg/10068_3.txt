While coming after three Star Wars, Krull and countless others, this film would appear outdated in the 50s ... 1 SFXs consist mainly of video game effects from the 70s such as bolts, etc .; annoying after a short time. You also have an SFX creature that looks like a poor level Harryhausen monster version. <br /> <br /> 2 sets are mainly ruins in the countryside, with papier-mâché temples and miniature cities or mansions that make the 1950s Japanese monster movies look perfect perfection. <br /> <br /> 3 Plot is extra-thin card ... Hercules must find the seven golden lightning of Zeus stolen from conspiratorial deities and zombie tyrants. <br /> <br /> 4 action consists mainly of a retarded and muscular Hercules (controls the variety of facial expressions) that fights the effects of cheap 70s video games. <br /> <br /> 5 acting awards go to Milly Carlucci (third sister Carlucci show-biz with Anna & Gabriella), who says it all. <br /> <br /> 6 SFX makes other films of Italian level II salads such as L'HUMANOIDE and STAR CRASH as masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Well, considering Ferrigno's main exploit was to impersonate a retarded green monster, with a whip and green espadrilles, we should be lenient. <br /> <br /> Watch it and forget it.
