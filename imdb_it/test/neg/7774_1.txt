I don't know if I should be amused or insulted by a drivel like this staged by "Lifetime: Television For Women" It should be renamed "Lifetime: Television For Shut In Drama Queens" because I have yet to see a movie that was not A tear-off boiler tear-off. This film was no exception. You know a movie will be bad when the biggest headliner is Tori Spelling, completely a creation of bad plastic surgery and a vicious privilege minus a real talent. All the others combined it into an incredibly bad acting and the plot was extremely stupid, as if someone could believe it. If I had not been defenseless on the nailed sofa looking with the same charm to see a collapse of a bloody car I would have changed channel.
