An art teacher runs into an old wooden bed made of gingko trees and puts it in his apartment, but he has a terrible history and becomes hunted by an ancient spirit that supports his human form by plucking people's hearts. <Br /> <br /> This beautiful horror ?? well, actually it's more fantasy / romance than anything else makes the thrills a bit chilly and provides some amazing visual effects, but the plot wasn't interesting enough and the formulaic script lacked any kind of life. The problem is that I spent most of my time trying to keep my finger away from the fast forward button. Certainly he would have accelerated the slow pace of the film, but then again I could not say too much about what was happening, that it was reasonably difficult to understand or maintain interest in the first place. The exhibits ranged from too melodramatic or simply banal, and it is probably because these characters do not convince, stale and like inducing. The current background story of the old bed and the spirits is incredibly boring and put together, with too much attention on an inconsistent love story, to be ridiculous when it shouldn't be and on the whole is built in an ordinary way that only needs grit or conviction to bring the film. What makes up for the shortcomings of the story are truly artistic images, which looked great, but the use of some images had me somewhat baffled by what it actually means for the film. What attracts attention is the faded color scheme, but sometimes the actual screen would look grainy or snowy. Although, from that it shows the raw intensity of the production valves, but it also adds some beautiful glossy effects that fit well with the calming but sometimes sharp edge. Camera work was quite varied (although it didn't add too much to the function), but during some of the more optimistic scenes there were too many close-ups or dark lights that made it difficult to understand what you are seeing. Also on display are some beautiful moments of blood and blood, but not overtly grandiose or distinguishable from most other films. <br /> <br /> A lethargically strange film, with luminous images that look like something from a painting, but still not particularly appealing Attentive, it could put you in a deep trance!
