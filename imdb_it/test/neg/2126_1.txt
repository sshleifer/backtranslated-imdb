What could ever go wrong in a film that includes a group of Italians who pretend to be Flordians, and some vague-lava-octopus-crustacean-thing like hell-hell-induced-hell-induced fish?!? <br /> <br /> Everything is what goes wrong I tell you! <br /> <br /> This is a very good MST3K episode because the comment is right on the ball, that without fault is easy to do considering that this movie is a piece of junk with a boring and boring plot. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for the MSTied version. 1/10 for non-MSTied version. <br /> <br />
