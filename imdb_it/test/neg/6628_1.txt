Carrot Top's "Chairman of the Board" and his AT & T commercials are living proof that wind-blown fecal matter is available in orange. NEVER available, however, as HBO charges for such garbage. Blehhh! The saving grace of COTB is that it surely fills the suicide hotlines across the country, perhaps providing work for thousands of telephone therapists who lost their jobs when the recovered memory treatment was discredited, though (unfortunately) Carrot Top probably contributes to the AT&T sponsor fund in line with the telephone traffic increased by the devastated HBO viewers. I can see the hordes of traumatized TV viewers, phone in one hand and car completely trampled. 45 cars in the other hand, composing last-minute despair before exiting the axis of life to escape the ghost of the orange-haired monster of the COTB that echoes in their synapses like the agony of swelling, irreversible swelling and meningeal.
