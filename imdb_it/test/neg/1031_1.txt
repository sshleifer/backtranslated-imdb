Here's a rundown of a typical Rachael Ray show: <br /> <br /> 1. The terrible theme song starts playing, and Rachael goes down wearing her Snapcrotch dress in this bizarre load lift. 2. Start running screaming and / or insulting the audience, then shout at them to sit down. 3. An embarrassing monologue. <br /> <br /> (The following are in any order) 4. A segment singing Rachael's horn (ie "I lost 500 pounds with Rach's recipes," Rachael Ray saved my life "," Rachael's Fashion Tips. ") 5. A totally useless DIY tip (ie how to engrave words in casserole dishes, how to use the washing machine as a meat grinder, how to build a tube of lipstick with a light on it. ) 6. The unleashing of a horrible recipe for the unsuspecting public (the reaction shots of the first bites are never shown) 7. A celebrated guest with an embarrassing interview, followed by some questions obviously written by the public 8. A person who receives help from one of the companions of Rachael (ie I say yes to every woman, I have nothing but women's suits, and I can't find the time to put the housewife for makeup) What Rachael would do without you. * Panting * <br /> <br /> Reasons why this show should be avoided to like the plague: 1. Fakeness: Rachael Ray claims that the whole show was not copied. and those who participated in the show's recordings stated that the whole show is scripted. Many of these same people have also said that there is also a very strict dress code for the show. <br /> <br /> 2. His show skips too much: where Oprah, who is the most voted talk show host of all time, has a specific theme for her show, Rachael turns around like a soda child ADHD on crack. His show has an average of maybe 10, short, useless segments of a show. On the second, you will receive fashion advice from Kojo, and the next Rachael will produce "Spanish" stuffed peppers with manchego cheese, and the next one will be a giant anaconda on stage, and the next one, well, you'll have the image. <br /> <br /> 3. Rachael is a bad presenter with bad ideas: apart from his grateful personality, Rachael's hosting ability is terrible, at best. His questions for his famous guests are scarce, and are often not even relevant to the interview, and his segments are unattractive and offer little educational or humorous value. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it is not necessary to waste time with this schlock. Soon it will be canceled anyway.
