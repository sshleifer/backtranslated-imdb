Hey, I know Angel isn't the kind of show that gives people a happy ending, and I know they couldn't just make everything perfect, but I couldn't believe Angel's ending. I love the show, it's perhaps the best show ever. However, I really hated this ending, as well as the whole way in the second half of Angel's season 5 (similar to Buffy's season 7). The deaths of my favorite characters were practically useless and did nothing for the plot. Cordelia was one of the best characters on the show, and once she and Angel were finally getting together, she turned all evil into a demon. I wanted so much to get her back, don't get me wrong, the episode in which Cordelia comes back is fantastic, but I was still very angry that she was gone. So on earth had he ended up with Fred dying, right after he finally got on with Wesley? There was no sacrifice, it was useless, he did absolutely nothing for the plot, and the blue-haired demon girl is a terrible and useless character. They spent too much of the end centered around her. Another big problem is that they didn't connect the elements well enough. I know those guys in that black thorn wanted to cause the apocalypse, but there wasn't even a date for when it should have happened. The apocalypse should have been performed and discovered throughout the season, rather than just mentioning a few bad guys an hour before the end of the season. One of the biggest problems is that every character the public cares about is dead or has nothing to live for. My three favorite characters are dead, and Angel, Spike and Gunn (who I'm not sure survive) don't have an office, they haven't even returned to their helpless help, they are in the middle of a huge battle and they lost to all those they care about. Angel and Spike are never redeemed, they lose the girl they care about and practically all of them are dead, and they still have to fight this strange evil army. I take the whole thing that you never stop fighting, but it was stupid to end up in the middle. There could be no redemption, knowing that there would always be many more battles to come. I don't understand why this episode is so popular, because I think Buffy's ending is 10 times better, and I wasn't even a big fan of that. Because they had to slip at the end, the third and fourth season and the first half of the five were incredible, then they went to mess up the show.
