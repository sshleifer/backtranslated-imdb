If Halloween 5 was a cruel joke to fans of the series, that Halloween 6 is like a vicious insult. The plot went to all the dogs. Michael is used as a helpless pawn in this film and is not at all scary. It reminds me of an overweight alcoholic man that the black man who sparked fear in our hearts in the original. There are almost no redeemable qualities for this feature and I'm so glad the H20 came out because it would have been an insult to the fans to have this in our mind. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 had about 2 aspects that I liked. Having a Tommy Doyle adult in the movie was a nice touch and he linked it to the original. Donald Pleasance is here (in his last performance ... that bad movie puts an end to an otherwise enjoyable career). When it's on the screen, it reminds you of the good old days when Halloween was really scary. <br /> <br /> This is all my friends are. Stalk sequences are not original. One of these is a blatant rip-off of the pursuit of Laurie / Michael in the original. The other characters are terribly underestimated and are not nice. The music, among the highlights of Halloween, even when the film is bad, is tortured in this film. we get a stupid rock version of the stalk / chase theme. What were they thinking when they made this film. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Their biggest mistake was to kill the character of Jamie (now played by another actress who is not worth mentioning) We saw this character escape death in two films. We were rooting for her and when she is killed in this movie you can't help but feel sorry for her and realize that filmmakers don't care when good characters are made in a movie. <br /> <br /> * FINAL SPOILER * <br /> <br /> The less said about this embarrassment, the better. I wish it didn't exist. I suggest skipping this movie, and even 5, and going directly to the H20 because if you look at it you might not want to see another Halloween movie again.
