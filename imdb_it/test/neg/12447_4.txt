Don't be fooled by the 'prizes' and comment below. This is just a poor movie. The way George Katt played his character (the soft gangster) makes it very annoying to watch. The conversation in the opening scene is a dramatic exhibition of this. In the rest of the film, the character's head seems to be somewhere else. His emotions do not coincide with the things that happen in the film. The things he says as a voiceover add nothing to the film. Makes Zeus an even more spineless character with his head in the clouds. <br /> <br /> The story and the film were put together with a total lack of imagination. All parts of the film were stolen badly by other modern directors. We hope that Jon Rosten will use his style and his ideas for his future films.
