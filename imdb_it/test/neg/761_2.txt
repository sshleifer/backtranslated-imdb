I think South Park is hilarious, and I have no problem taking pictures of people on the left, but you'd think that after taking a whole movie to attack celebrities for risking their career in an illegal war, and then being GASP they would have the good sense to start giving w. and the bastards who ruined the country a shot or two. Bush seems to have a free ride from these guys, however stupid and messy he is. <br /> <br /> gore is a fair game, but please, what do the Republicans have to do, how badly the country has gone before these guys finally act as if maybe they weren't just trying to do the best they could, and that they did a little mess ... or maybe just after acting limbaugh ... hes a good target ... or even just teasing the gap teeth of condoleeza rice.
