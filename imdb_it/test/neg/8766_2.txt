The back of the DVD of this movie is enthusiastic, "Chey is the Christian Quinting Quentin Tarantino." This is not so much an insult to Quentin as to Christian films. This film is poorly written, played with rigor and modified with an aimless intensity. The scenes take place in a confused and unrealistic way and are interspersed with some beautiful time-lapse photographs. Flashback, fading to gray, blocking of frames to tell the time (without importance in the story) are made for no apparent reason other than to give the cinema a more cinematic credibility. The camera is haphazard, some nice crane shots are cut with ridiculous montages that have no meaning. Poor blockade and lighting leave the viewer wondering who is talking to whom in many scenes. Oh and the audio is terrible. The special effects were decent and fortunately limited. But this is all just technical. The film fails to engage on an emotional level. The dialogue is so fake and the actors seem to have read it just a moment before the camera moved. The story ... the things that happen in sequence have no motivation behind them. The characters are struggling to take a dimension. And the characters must take a stand on Christianity and faith in every single scene. Make a queue from M. Night, engaging Christian films must not have the characters that say the name of Jesus Christ in every scene for the film to be Christian. Goodness! Please don't try to show this to your unsaved friends with expectations other than laughter.
