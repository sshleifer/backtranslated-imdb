The film was half before I could figure out what was happening. It's a dog's breakfast movie on four Thanksgiving family dinners. The clich√©s and stereotypes fall on each other. When it was all ten hours later --- well, it seems like ten hours have passed --- you are disconcerting what it was. I don't want to see a movie on the table bickering. There's enough in my family. The turkeys looked pretty good. The rest gave me indigestion.
