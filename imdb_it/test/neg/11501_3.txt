this is a sight to behold, it is not the best nor the worst. I watched it for a long time and I don't like any of the new things. This show has changed to some teenage garbage and is living very differently. I don't like that crap .. I don't have IQ because they completely changed the theme of this show. The first season was really nice to watch and it was partly fun. The second season has just come out of this stupid world. I honestly don't know why the writers / directors changed this show. many more people enjoyed the first season better than the 2nd and 3rd. I will only watch the first season of this show from now on, every time I see a new episode, I will change the f * ckin channel ... you hear me! He gets a 3/10 because I liked the 1st season a bit but I hated 2nd and 3rd
