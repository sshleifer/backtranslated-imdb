How sad when a film as wonderful as "Jurassic Park" slowly swoops down into a trivial and mediocre territory for its entire franchise. The new sequel, Jurassic Park III, never thought of characters, a story or a script, and instead relies on a non-stop dinosaur action, which is neither thrilling nor very interesting to watch. The dinosaurs looked incredibly fake compared to the technology of 1993, after 7 years of CGI progress, it just gives you more feeling that the film was pumped for the summer based only on its name. The introduction of a pterodactyl does not make a great film. <br /> <br /> Go see "Shrek" again. <br /> <br />
