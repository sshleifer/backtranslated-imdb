The main character of this drivel full of sex, Mel (Ethan Hunt), notes on several occasions, "You deserve better!" The "she" she refers to is Ginger, played by the beautiful Brandy Davis, who actually deserves better. Brandy deserves better than this film, its lame script and perverse Mel. A guy who comes down to watch his dream girl having sex with another man, even in the virtual world, seriously doesn't deserve it at all. An A- for simulated sex scenes, an F for the script.
