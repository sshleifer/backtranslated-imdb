Director J.S. Cardone has something a little scary and a bit scary, but nothing more. A widowed mother Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) inherits a house in the mountains of Pennsylvania; so she takes her two daughters and moves into the sprawling estate in what appears to be the center of nothingness. But somewhere, somewhere, ninety years ago, a tragic mining accident has caused the death of many children forced to work in the dark and wet. The area and in particular the Tunny estate seems to be haunted by the spirits of the small evil souls. The legend is that the screaming children come out in the moonlight to seek their revenge; and you'd better believe it. Still in the cast: Ben Cross, Scout Taylor-Compton, Chloe Moretz, Julie Rogers and Geoffrey Lewis.
