This is absolutely the worst film I've ever seen. It's so bad, in fact, that I'm going to rent it again as soon as I can find it. This film makes "Plan 9 From Outer Space" an Oscar nominee. Watching the actors makes me want to laugh out loud. I can't say enough bad things about this movie. It is apocalyptic perfection. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon in San Francisco (I think). It's the best I can ... I'm laughing too much. I know it shouldn't be fun but ..... * LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL * <br /> <br /> MOVE OVER ED WOOD !!! <br /> <br /> Regard * DATO *
