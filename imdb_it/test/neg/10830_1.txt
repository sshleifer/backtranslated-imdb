This film does not even have the saving grace of being so bad that it is good. It's really scary. It is closer to an ironic parody than to a catastrophic film, but unfortunately they were serious. Made for TV, but not even worthy of that. Contains every clich√© and plot moment you can imagine. Oh, will it save the city from the flood? Will his wife admit that she still loves him? Will they escape before the flood drowns them? I can't explain how bad this is. A horrible predictable plot that makes you jump is so poor. Bad effects (although to be honest I saw boiling water worse super taxes). Bad Screenplay Painful Acting. Hideous. So bad that you should probably get drunk and watch it.
