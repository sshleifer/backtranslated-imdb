Oh dear, just what we need for another Essex -Cockney garbage effort that tells the rise of the English hooligan / gangster rave that obviously followed West 'am (East Londan / Essex style). Nobody told you that they won the hat of the world! And then, of course, the inevitable decay in the underground world of the rave culture of the United Kingdom. Blah blah blah. Because how and who would like to finance a film like this I don't know, but let them pray that it came from private financiers (we see former drug dealers, merchant bankers - we all know how to call them, and the rest of the mockneys) rather than means financed with public funds. We hope that with the recession we will not see the like again. If we do we will call the bell to death for British films and, of course, we will all be able to blame Britains, the famous Mockney Country gangster, Guy Ritchie.
