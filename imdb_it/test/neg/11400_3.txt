As a fan of Gipharts writers, clear and humorous books (of which Ik Ook van Jou is not the best), I couldn't wait to see this film. I didn't take it to the cinema though, and after seeing it on TV I'm terribly happy that I didn't buy it on video. From a good book, they managed to make one of the worst films in the history of Dutch cinema. All the good parts have been left out, the story has changed, not its benefits. All the humor was cut off. What remains is a badly interpreted, too dramatic, inconsistent film that I never want to see again. <br /> <br /> I condemn Giphart with this result and I am happy that Robbert Jan Westdijk has done one hell of a better job on the Giphart topper. Phileine zegt Sorry. Go see it!
