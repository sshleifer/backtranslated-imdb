When my six-year-old boy fell asleep at the cinema during this movie, this was the confirmation that I needed this movie to be a stinker. It was boring. The scary parts were boring. The maudlin parts were boring. Even the fun parts - with two small exceptions - were boring. And predictable. And did I mention predictable? Examples: 1) The gruff but loving dad who indulges in the brat of a child. 2) The gruff but loving dad who buys the farm (while he sings a song?!). 3) The brat of a little boy who decides to cut and run, but, thanks to his friends, check things out because they need him. 4) The brat of a child who wins against incredible odds. 5) And a brash character voiced by an African-American actress. I must recognize these filmmakers that touch of originality and perpetuate that stereotype. I mentioned two funny bits. In both cases, contributed by minor characters. The mouse bouncing on the farmer's wrist was fun. The farm dog who fell victim to his dogged weaknesses while competing for leadership was fun. But the rest? Painful. Someone tried to create a Hip-thru-Committee movie and made it even more hipper by making it a computer-animated movie, and that was the result. And why make the evil Batman-coyotes stupid monologue with their victims instead of eating them? Oh yeah. There is no need for blood in this film for children, already focused on fake alcohol consumption, destructive behavior and potty humor. And the fuzzy thing in a box? What exactly was it? A porcupine? Tasmanian Devil? What, plus a really stupid plot to help Otis the Cow win the Mother of All Battles? The courtyard is a bomb. And I didn't even need to mention the udders.
