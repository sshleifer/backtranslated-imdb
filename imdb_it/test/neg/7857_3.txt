For some of us, director Ernst Lubitsch, adored for his subtlety and ironic comic touch, was rather humid when it came to collecting material. It is not that Lubitsch is overrated - on the contrary, he was probably ahead of his time in terms of a visual narrative - however the projects to which he was attached (or which had been assigned to him) are not really the reference points of the comedy. fans like to label them. With "Heaven Can Wait", a film adaptation of the drama "Birthday" by Lazlo Bus-Fekete, Lubitsch is joined by the sleepy Don Ameche in the head - and by the combination of an anemic plot, a colorless star and a musty flashback-framework stymies the movie director. An evil man at the turn of the century "falls asleep without realizing it", presenting the facts of his life in front of the entrance to Hell. Ameche ... evil? That was the number one problem. The promising opening sequence (set in the Hades lobby) quickly gives way to a monotonous monotone, and the supporting cast is of little help. * 1/2 from ****
