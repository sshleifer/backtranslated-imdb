Another horrible Hollywood movie. This time a woman helps revolution in a Central American country. Yes Yes Yes. Hey, make a movie with no sense of realism. I'm so sick of movies like this. The actors and actresses are bad, the effects are poor and the dialogue is horrible. And suddenly I see John Rhys-Davies as the bad president. From Gimli to Hugo Louis Ramos. I bet he's very proud of this. Well, I shouldn't have expected much from this movie and I didn't. And I'm happy because this sucks. I wonder what kind of people who like this movie. My hypothesis is that young people aged 12 to 16 years. And I think some people like Kristin Dattilo. Well, I'm not in any of these groups and I hate it. Evaluation: 2
