Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate are the bachelors who intend to hijack a casino, "Ocean's 11" wing and pin it on Hell's Angels. Wrong move. For a film with the words Hell's Angels AND the number 69 AND with Hell's Angels, this film is surprisingly docile. Hell's Angels really deserve a better film to center around them. Not this snoorefest. Fortunately this is one of the DVDs with the commentary of Joe Bob Briggs, so the pain of having to sit is greatly relieved. If you look at it in another way, I advise you to recommend something. DO NOT !! <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: commentary by Joe Bob Brigg; Conny Van Dyke's message to his fans (does he have more than one?); Photo gallery; Theatrical trailer; and trailer for "Blood Shack", "Hell High", "Samurai Cop" and "The Hollywood Strangler"
