This is without doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen. However, it is also one of the most unwittingly hilarious. I like to compare it to Plan 9, in the sense that it can be so ugly, so horrible, so stupid, and such a waste of time that I find myself laughing out loud. <br /> <br /> One of my biggest problems with it is a complete repugnance to Robin Hood, and I have to be honest and say that I love Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. But let's face it, from the forbidden love between Peck (who is definitely doing it. Although in all honesty there are still some years before the masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird) and the female character (which is so forgettable, it seems, that Ho forgotten his name.), At the final scene where good guys dress up as monks to deceive the bad screams "ROBIN HOOD" everywhere. <br /> <br /> However, I don't think the film is worth seeing. On the contrary, I think this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years, even if it wasn't intentional.
