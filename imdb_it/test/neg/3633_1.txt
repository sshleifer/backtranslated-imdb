Imagine: a high school. Except for the college, and the children have no parents around. Oh, and it's in Malibu. And the children are all thin, white and splendid, with the exception of a symbolic minority or a fat boy to interpret the "freak". And there are no reasonable rules, like the way they live together, nuclear weapons in their dormitories, coffee stalls, a sushi bar and a free student laptop. <br /> <br /> Here's the story: To the girl, Zoey Brooks, she goes to the PCA, a former school for all the kids. Absolutely perfect in every possible way, she is intelligent, pretty, slim, athletic, creative, and everything a perfectionist wants to be. Most kids at school want her, and every girl wants to be her friend. It is the one that everyone comes to for advice, one that saves the day with a simplistic plan, and is simply wonderful. Too bad, none of this makes it nice. <br /> <br /> Should we believe that if we do not approach Zoey's perfection, we are bad people? In the show, nothing is his fault, and if someone contradicts it, they are portrayed as the villain (Logan). He may be an idiot, but at least he has a kind of brain that thinks for himself instead of just accepting the princess each time. <br /> <br /> His faithful group of blind followers are: Chase, the dumb medium ass who has a secret crush on her, Michael, the black guy (and the only decent actor on the set), Lola, a illustrious actress and anorexic, snobbish airship, Quinn, the clever but clueless girl when it comes to teenage things and Logan, the rich idiot who has a soft side. Yes, this show basically sows stereotypes. <br /> <br /> What drives me, though, is that everyone tries to pretend to be normal children. They complain that Logan gets too much money while working alone, even though they are already in a college too good to be true and have relatively nice things that many teenagers can't afford. They drink coffee and eat sushi regularly, almost don't do their homework and tan almost every day. Wow, they struggled! Any other problems? I'm too handsome, rich and stress free! I imagine Zoey 101 (what is 101 for, anyway?) It's Nick's attempt to realistically try to portray teenagers. Except they saw the reality, he didn't like it, and they decided to give life to kids like the donkeys in The Hills. <br /> <br /> But hey, at least the set is nice.
