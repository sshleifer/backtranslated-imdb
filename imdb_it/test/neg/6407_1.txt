The film starts well, has one thing to do. About 1/3 in the film things go downhill. Carrey begins to obsess over the number 23 because he sees it everywhere. So? There is no reason to go crazy and start writing things all over the body and on the walls. <br /> <br /> The recitation of anyone who plays his son is bad. From the beginning, as soon as he hears about his father's obsession, he jumps on the wagon and is hysterical about it. Absolutely incredible. I hope I don't see this guy in another movie anymore. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time watching this movie. Take another one. Boring piece of ... well. Is the number killing him? Give me a break. I won't ruin the ending for you, but let's say it's just as disappointing. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
