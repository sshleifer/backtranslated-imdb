Not all films made in 1931 are so creaky, and the fact that this was "Best Film" must have given even greater impetus to the development of television. <br /> <br /> Typical of all Ferber novels, it is not possible to bring the whole story to the screen, not to mention the development of the character. Dix - so foolish in the first third of the film - asks a question on the face, but nobody knows why and it doesn't make sense. And what's with Dunne that makes her so stoic? Edna May Oliver's scenes are priceless, as usual. <br /> <br /> This film has a role to play in the history of cinema, but it is long and boring.
