I would like to make it clear that I am not religious at all. I'm an atheist, but I saw that Richard Dorkins repeatedly contradicted himself. I would also like to let you know that I am not the kind of person who always discusses philosophy, but I feel that when comparing science and religion we must be philosophical and be willing to question belief in the main science as well as question religious beliefs . I wonder if Richard Dorkins ever spends some time thinking philosophically about the belief, whoever thinks long enough about science and religion will realize that science is indeed a religion in itself. Yes, there is a fundamental difference between the way in which scientific beliefs are maintained with respect to other religions, but at its roots is faith in a particular human instinct. <br /> <br /> In this series, Richard insists that scientific methods are the only right way to think and that it makes sense to believe in something only if the evidence is strong enough. If you delve deep enough into how science works you will realize that it is as irrational as religion and that eventually it comes to faith, faith in trials, faith in our health, faith in our senses but more than anything else we believe in our instinct to follow patterns of recurrence. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to explain, but let's think about how the laws of physics were decided, why they were and still are the most common patterns of recurrence of which we are aware. I think that human beings have an instinct that makes them believe that for a longer time something remains in a certain state or place of existence, the more we simply assume from blind faith that it is more likely to remain so. For example, we do not expect gravity to work suddenly in the opposite direction tomorrow, meaning that this will remove matter as if it were supposed to attract it. But the only reason we don't expect this sudden change is because we've known it for so long that we've always been attracted to what we know. However, this does not mean that it could not do exactly the opposite tomorrow or even now. No matter how long something can remain in a certain state or change, there is no rational reason to make assumptions about it, but we do by instinct. Would you ask me to consider what is a long and short time? There is no such thing, I don't know exactly how long it took these supposed essays to decide that everything must be done by matter, sound, light, etc. But let's give them what they would consider a marginal way! We say much longer than it really was 12.00000000000 years! Is it a long time? 9999999999999999999 years ago 12,00000000000 years seem an incredibly short period of time. As far as we know, in the next trillions of years there could be a huge amount of changes in the so-called laws of science. It is a matter of comparison, only when we compare things can we say "which is long" or which is short. It is the same with large and small, broad and thin, heavy and light, strong, weak and others. <br /> <br /> I doubt that any scientist can tell me why they think that trusting this instinct makes sense. I certainly don't see why it should, but that doesn't mean that we, as humanity, should necessarily stop using it. With this in mind, the most hypocritical comment that Richard Dorkins made was when he said that faith is irrational, "a process of non-thought," he said. If what we have in this instinct that I have described and this instinct that we all possess in some way is not faith, then I don't know what the hell it is. Other times he is hypocritical is when he speaks of religions as the Bronze Age, "myths of the Bronze Age", he says. I would like to stress that, regardless of how many scientific methods have been modified over the years due to experience, experiments and evaluation, the pure rules of science are getting older and older! They could also be described as the holy bible of science. He was talking about how tired he is of the different religions of being stubborn "I'm right, he's wrong" but, looking back at how rude he was to the various interviewees, he seems to be just as stubborn about himself. To be honest with him, at least he does not try to bomb religious communities. I appreciate his hatred of certain religious beliefs that generate war, but I do not respect his arrogance in his convictions. <br /> <br /> For me, Richard has the right to believe in science if this is his way. I also have a scientific mind, but I don't think he has the right to present himself to religious leaders with hostile arguments, trying to force his opinion on them and virtually describing them as stupid. Despite all his education, experience and discoveries do not seem to have the wisdom to properly question his belief system. I read what he says in defense of this argument that open-minded atheists like myself propose, what he says suggests to me that it is totally meaningless. <br /> <br /> Finally the title of the documentary, Root of all evils. This states that religion is the root of all evil, it is not true. There are causes of evil that have nothing to do with religion. <br /> <br /> In the round, the documentary series was a frustration, a narrow, hypocritical and flat mentality.
