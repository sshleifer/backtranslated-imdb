Having just watched the movie, I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This takes away my worst film award from Komodo, which is not an easy task. It is neither a porn film nor a legitimate film and gives both of them a bad name. The acting, the camera work, the plot, the script and the sound are horrible. My favorite part of the film is the duck asking the bartender if he has any grapes. Why was such a joke inserted in the film? The director was thinking; "I need a humorous scene to balance the great acting, so I'll use some crap joke I read on a Laffy Taffy wrapper." Another delayed part is when Norman turns the invisibility potion on himself while trying to stop him from spilling. Why did they even take the trouble to give the film an NC-17 rating, hoping to get the widest possible audience? At least if it was rated X it would be more sexual and therefore would bring the attention of the spectators away from the general low quality. I pray for someone who worked on this panty to waste a movie to answer.
