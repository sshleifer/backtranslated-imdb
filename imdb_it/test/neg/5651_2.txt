Flatland is one of my favorite books, so I couldn't wait to see this movie. Unfortunately, the film is absolutely horrible. The dialogue is so bad that it seems to improvise half the time. The new plot makes me think I took the book and a couple of newspapers, threw them into a blender and used what came out for the script. It is a disgrace for the book and for the making of independent films. The only reason I managed to get the whole film was my hope that it would improve. Unfortunately, it only got worse, culminating in a really late finish. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that EVERYTHING on the film is bad. The CG is acceptable, in a sort of "reboot" of the 90s which I assume is what they were looking for. And I suppose you can't go wrong with the "people" who are cut in half and spread blood everywhere.
