I'm not afraid of bad movies. I like bad movies. I enjoy teasing them with my friends. We are all pretty good, in fact. Having said that, let me tell you how much I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> To begin with, it was incomprehensible. Rob Lowe attacks some people, they capture him but he escapes in this great shooting. There is this singer that we think is dead, only he didn't do it, unless maybe there aren't many of them all acting and looking the same. Cue Burt Reynolds to enter and interrogate the singer. It looks like he just joined this movie off the Walker, set Texas Ranger and he's pretty damn confused. Then Rob Lowe dies, only he does not ... And the worst thing is that there is not enough dialogue or action that does not involve killing people or trying to make fun of this movie !! And don't even get me started on the casual chihuahua. Then there was the fact that it had to relate to the old power structure in Eastern Europe that was falling apart. We didn't know where we were, all the accents were apparently "Eastern European" and what did Burt Reynolds and Rob Lowe do in the first place? <br /> <br /> I wanted desperately to tell the people of Blockbuster what I thought of this movie, and get my money back, but since I got a special (only $ 0.99) I decided against it. What I want to know, however, is HOW THE DIRECTOR MADE GREEN to make this movie damn good, and what were the "stars" thinking when they signed ???
