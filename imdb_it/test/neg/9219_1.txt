Since I don't have a TV and I've never heard of this mini series, I didn't know what to expect from The Second Coming and I only hired it based on its synopsis plot, which seemed interesting. <Br /> <br /> Dear God! (Every word game is intentional). If someone had told me that it was written by a class of 13-year-olds who had been given the project of turning the second into a school play, I wouldn't have been surprised. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why did they decide to portray Jesus II as what amounted to a savant idiot? Is there anything in any of the gospels to suggest this? Ok, a normal type, but a Great Northern Moron. I don't think so. <br /> <br /> Apparently all that Jesus did to impress people was his miracles, because according to this his preaching surely never struck anyone. Surely without the acrobatic night of the day Mr Jesus Eccleston would have been in trouble without a canoe, a paddle or any other type of pursuit. <br /> <br /> And the strange little gay polemics put into the vernacular, without a rhyme or reason. In addition to, of course, Russell who greets his QAF fan base. Jesus shows up at the pub to recruit "disciples" (more stupid losers of the North and, of course, the standby of the gay writer - the harpy, the nag, the nag, the rumbling). The rights of homosexuals are rammed in the throat to no real purpose, almost as if Russell thought he "owed the boys" to put Jesus on the spot. <br /> <br /> I really can't see the real Jesus coming out with "Well, I have nothing against it personally, friend". Only someone who is truly bourgeois and woolly can imagine that Jesus is so wet. <br /> <br /> And don't start the finale. "Please enter and eat rat poison because the only way to be truly free is if God dies." <br /> <br /> It was like a sketch of Eddie Izzard about God like Bill Gates. "Hi, I'm Bill Gates, and now you've pointed out to me that my global dominance is hindering your style. I'll give everything to you, my clients." And I eat rat poison, of course. <br /> <br /> I am often disoriented by ratings on IMDb, but the highest rating on this takes the cookie. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about Jesus for the new millennium - this is Jesus for MTV's mindless kids. <br /> <br /> God really helps us.
