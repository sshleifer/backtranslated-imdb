My brother-in-law and his wife took the film for a night to watch videos. This should have given me the first clue that it would have been horrible. Was. From the first frame to the last, this film is terrible. It is not even recorded as a "B" movie. Maybe an N or a P. One of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. From the rubber bird of prey to the bodies that still breathe in the car to the horrible closing lines, it is not worth watching this movie if you received it for free. <br /> <br /> Skip this together - unless you want to play at the Mystery Science Theater with your friends, it will provide good ammunition.
