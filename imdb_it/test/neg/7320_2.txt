I had high hopes for this after reading the back of the DVD, "In the spirit of American Pie and Animal House ..." After suffering for it I realized that I just spent $ 2.50 to rent it. This film started slowly and became slower ... short and fleeting moments of lightness showed that it was in the spirit of American Pie if you meant the "spirit" as a dead thing. not very funny or fun! Don't be fooled like me and expect something that is barely watchable because this movie will make you more depressed than having fun. "I have to fill three more lines for this stupid film that does not deserve the effort ... what a stupid piece of ignorant cruel. This film was provoked, even the brief nudity was sucked in!
