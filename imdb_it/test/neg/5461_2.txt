It looks like one of these Australian films made by "talented" students and funded by the government. It is chock-full of clever shots of colors and shapes and verbal excursions in Freudian psychology to be appreciated by art students and teachers, but in general it is perceived as a stupid mockery of good cinema, storytelling and good taste . This is what will happen when art students become so obsessively lenient. "Pink Flamingoes" is miles ahead of the same subjects. Some 70s porn movies are much more watchable and inspirational. Book of Revelation is not entirely without merit, but as an overall experience it is well below the B-grade average.
