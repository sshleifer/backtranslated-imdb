I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I saw this movie. I wish I could fall asleep. The plot was very thin and the assembly team did its best to stretch it until they did. <br /> <br /> Gary, played by Andy Garcia, was such an unlikely character that I found it difficult to support him. Andy's acting ability is good, but not enough to compensate for the poor writing of this film. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell did a great job with his portrait of Linda, Gary's romantic interest. I can't say anything negative about Andie, I always like acting. The problem here is that the love story between Andy and Andie is so far-fetched and incredible. The two don't make a good pair on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The end of the film was almost as disappointing as the film itself. A sign from the Pope and everything is forgiven, let's go. The event that allows this film to have something of a happy ending and that the writers would expect us to accept is pathetic. Gary does not change and only with the death of a dear friend does his situation improve. <br /> <br /> There are tons of fantastic movies that should be seen before this. Do not waste time. <br /> <br />
