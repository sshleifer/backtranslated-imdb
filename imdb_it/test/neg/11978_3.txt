So I'm not a big fan of Boll's work, but then it's not many. I liked his film Postal (maybe I'm the only one). Apparently, Boll had purchased the rights to use Far Cry long before the game itself was even finished. <br /> <br /> People who have enjoyed killing mercenaries and infiltrating secret research laboratories on a tropical island should be warned, this is not Far Cry ... This is something that Mr. Together with his legion of schmucks, Boll elaborated .. Feeling alone on the set Mr. Boll invites three of his compatriots to play with. These players go by the names of Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller. <br /> <br /> Three names that actually made them great in the cinema. So the story is like that, Jack Carver is played by Til Schweiger (yes Carver is German, everyone greets the kids they eat !!) However I find that Tils is acting pretty bad in this movie ... People have complained about how he it's not really true to all of Carver's agenda but we've only seen the carver in a first person perspective, so we don't really know how it looked when he kicked ** <br /> <br /> However, the plot in this film is beyond dementia. We see the evil mad scientist Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier, who creates genetically mutated soldiers or GMS as they are called. Performing his top-secret search on an island that reminds me of "SPOILER" Vancouver for some reason. There is no palm trees right here. Instead we have beautiful woods from rich woodsman. We never went long before I started in CRY (mehehe) I can't go on anymore .. If you want to stay true to Bolls shenanig, then go see this movie that you won't be disappointed with offering you the real Boll experience, which means Most of it will suck. <br /> <br /> There are a few things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good job on some areas of the film, like some nice boat and fighting scenes. Until the whole GMS team raw / albino enters the scene and everything makes me laugh .. The movie Far Cry stinks of scheisse (which is poop for you simpletons) from a ago, if you want to make a wiff go ahead .. BTW Carver he gets a very annoying companion that makes you want to shoot him the first three minutes he is on the screen.
