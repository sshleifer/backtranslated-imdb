The reason why this movie sucks, did these people even read a bible? Everything in the film spoke of mosques, God remained outside. THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED! God directed everything, told them where to go and what to do. People also wandered for 40 years AFTER they arrived in Canan and betrayed God again! They did not wander for 40 years, then suddenly they found it, it was a punishment for their doubts. Perhaps if the people who made the film actually picked up a Bible, they would have said "oh no, we've got it all wrong, try again". Everything in this film spoke of Moses. They made God appear like an idiot who was joking with Moses all the time. NO NO NO NO NO !!!!!! God was theirs all the time and wanted people to see that he was taking care of them. How dare they say otherwise it is not even close to the passage. And Moses was kept out because he was angry with the people and openly disobeyed God! He sinned and was told that he would not be allowed to enter for this. When did the fly break out and scream to God for everything in the Bible? NEVER!!!!!! Actually read your story before inventing whatever you think is a good idea. Even all this God has remained out of it for the most part and made him do it alone is not true !!! God did everything for the people, he provided for them in every way and God told them where to go. He was there all the time. The whole we have to do ourselves is somehow true, but then it's not how it worked! Yes, today he doesn't work directly for everyone to see, but at that point he actually killed people after the golden calf thing! God worked directly with people. Read the Next Time Echo Bridge Bible or don't make another biblical movie!
