This movie is fun if you like movies about poverty, the public domain films of the first half of the 20th century, or you're a fan of amateur film production. The film combines public domain thrillers with newly filmed scenes in which the "actors" (with the sole exception of Redfield that is about to die on Lugosi tear, all the "performers" are simply terrible!) Attempt to interact with the archive footage. The "New" movie is covered by digitally added film scratches, as well as some of the poor old movies (?? !!). As far as I can tell, the plot has something to do with a group of strangers gathered on an island for a reading of wills (?) This film, while boasting a creative premise for 'Dead Men Do not Wear Plaid', is a technical and creative wreck. In a terribly long sequence and a wounded sailor on a ship describes an abortive journey to "Fog Island", whatever it is! The "flashback" therefore incoherently interweaves old footage of completely different eras and totally different cinematographic quality. Unrelated scenes from "The Lost World" (1925), The Most Dangerous Game (1932), White Zombie (1932), Bela Lugosi meets A Brooklyn Gorilla (1952) and some other poverty productions. This happens with an incredibly bad voice that seems to have too much echo in the room, as if the audio were recorded on a cheap home video camera. <br /> <br /> The "directors" seem to think that they are paying tribute to the great actors of the past by giving the characters the surnames of famous actors (Carradine, Zucco, Ouspenskaya, etc. etc.). This tactic was done intelligently, just as subtly in "Final Destination" here is simply hateful! Bizarre, and painfully little fun, the jokes about Spiderman, Dracula and Superman abound. Even the old man as a dirty reference 'Dewey, Cheetam and Howe' lawyer is used here - this was old and tired when The Three Stooges used it in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The stock and audio film does not combine scenes with scenes and dozens of different sources are used for Lugosi. The final effect is that he seems to be getting older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger and older by the minute. Strangely, the film did not use it as a subplot of comedy and wastes a good chance of comedy. <br /> <br /> To tell the truth, however, it was a lot of fun to watch it at night in bed. Maybe that's what they wanted to happen!
