I am very interested in Waverly Hills and saw Death Tunnel The Movie for the first time. It wouldn't have been much worse. Then I heard that the documentary was coming out and I got excited thinking that since it was a documentary it would have been more serious and wouldn't have had the horrible special effects. The same guys have always made the documentary and ruined it with effects instead of creating it. how a documentary should be. Waverly Hills doesn't need help with goofy effects but it's ok as it is. The tours are $ 20.00 per person and $ 100.00 for 8 hours of night investigation per person minimum group of 10 for night investigations. Tours must be arranged in advance. Fantastic place for the ghost hunter!
