"The Wizard of Menlo Park" was deeply responsible for many things we take for granted in 2007: even if he didn't invent them without rivals or assistants, he gave birth to electric light, the phonograph, the camera, the electric car battery, the electrical network (probably his most important but least remembered invention), the prefabricated house and the innovations on the telephone and the telegraph, as well as the round tape machine and an early voting machine. The total number of patents is over 1,000 - far more than any other American inventor. <br /> <br /> But Edison was a ruthless business competitor. He has often had great legal fights over the precedence of his inventions over rivals. The best example is the telephone, where he was one of seven or eight rivals with claims against Alexander Graham Bell. In fact, Edison's invention here was not the central idea that Bell and Gray had devised independently of one another in 1876, but an improvement in the sound quality of the telephone receiver and transmitter that Bell did not develop. However, it was part of the enormous Supreme Court decision of 1888 which was the longest decision of the US Supreme Court (a single volume of their reports!) Written by the head of justice Morrison Waite - which, among other things, he killed the poor head of justice for too much work in a few weeks to complete it. <br /> <br /> In 1886 Edison found an equally ruthless competitor in the area of ​​power grids for large cities. This was George Westinghouse, the inventor of the railroad break. Westinghouse's firm had obtained the assistance of a new inventor and former assistant Edison, Nicola Tesla. Tesla developed "alternating current", which was a rival system of Edison's "direct current". Edison's system was basically a straight circuit system of electricity. The Tesla system allowed to pass the current from one circuit to another - in reality it was a better and more efficient system. But Edison was determined to break this rival with an advertising campaign. <br /> <br /> It started with the power lines. At the beginning Edison had put its lines underground, so that they were not endangered by weather conditions. But Westinghouse was forced to have its lines in open phone lines. When there were several accidental deaths by the men of the repair lines on Westinghouse lines (in particular an incident in which the repairman had been burned alive before hundreds of spectators horrified in the Manhattan business district), Edison began to insist that alternating current was much more dangerous. <br /> A result of all this was Edison who helped some subsidiary inventors get generators and CA Westinghouse dynamos for an electric chair. Edison himself has always denied having invented the electric chair, but he has helped several minor figures along the way - for the complete story, read EDISON & THE ELECTRIC CHAIR by Mark Essig (New York: WALKER & COMPANY, 2003). <br /> <br /> Edison experiences himself with cats and dogs (experiments he was happy to show to the public). In the long run, despite the aid in the invention of a new execution method, Edison failed to remove the public support of Alternating Current. But he never stopped trying. <br /> <br /> In 1903 he had the opportunity to join his campaign against Westinghouse and A.C. with his invention of the cinematographic camera. He helped "put down" a well-known public elephant ("Topsy") that had killed several men. He did it by blasting the poor beast with A.C. But the whole killing is in film - and you can see it until today. It is a pitiful film - whatever the poor "Topsy" had done was a poor beast - not a Machiavellian murderer. The moment we see the explosions of electricity sparks that show the elephant's death, we are aware that soon it will be over, but the sudden collapse of "Topsy" is still an unpleasant sight to see. The film leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the modern cinema audience. Yet, sad to say, he probably made a profit for Edison - his description of the film in his film catalog shows the real pride for his success here. In 1903 it could have been fun entertainment for many Americans who watched it. One is glad that more people are scared of it today - sometimes it can be perceived that the human race has improved a little.
