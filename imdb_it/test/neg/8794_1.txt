In his feature film debut, "Yellow", Chris Chan Lee attempts to illuminate the Hollywood portrait of American Asians, abandoning the typical stereotypes of mainstream film. However, in doing so, Lee commits a much more atrocious crime: he exaggerates the same stereotypes of Asian-Americans towards disbelief. The result? Terribly one-dimensional characters and an outrageously superficial script set off the cast in a frenzy of over-acting, resulting in a physically painful movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by any of the positive reviews collected by 'Yellow'; everyone falls into one of two fields. In one corner (eg, right here on imdb.com), you find American Asians who are so excited that an Asian character can be pictured on the screen without thick glasses and a math book, which somehow overlooks the idiocy of final product of Lee. On the other hand, one finds film critics who have simply assumed that it would have been unreasonable to give "Yellow" the exaggeration he deserves; after all, it's an angular African-American film made by an independent American-Asian director ... protected territory for now. <br /> <br /> Case Example: Main Character Sin Lee (Michael Chung). The writer / director Lee creates a monumental feat with Sin, modifying "Yellow" so that Sin never appears on the screen unless he is frowning or screaming. See the sin suffered by the support of his friends. Frown. Watch Sin walking along the beach and brood. Frown. (The scream ensues.) See Sin closing his father's shop. Frown. See the sin that urinates. Frown. See Sin breath. Scowl. <br /> <br /> Damn, I wonder if sin is full of Asian-American angst. Think? I'm not sure. Frown. Scowl. <br /> <br /> Just to be meticulous, Lee introduces us to Sin's father, Woon Lee (Soon-tek Oh). Throughout the film, while sin simply frowns or screams, Mr. Lee frowns * and * screams. In fact, this is the main role of Woon in 'Yellow': simultaneous frowning and screaming. <br /> <br /> Gee, I wonder if Woon is an Asian father with an authority complex. Think? I'm not sure. Frown. Url. <br /> <br /> If Lee's one-dimensional characters don't bother you, his plot will be. Meet Mina (Mary Chen) and Joey (John Cho), two characters that exist in this film for the sole purpose of throwing a tangential and totally irrelevant love story into the film. See, Lee learned at the film school that every good movie must include a kind of subtext related to love, and these two characters allow him to fulfill the obligation. The exultant and playful dialect of Mina and Joey consists of monotonous insults culminating in a kiss: "Nerd!"; `Stupidhead! '; (eyes meet); (understanding of the smile); (follows the kiss). <br /> <br /> But rest assured, somewhere out there, Sin is frowning as this happens. <br /> <br /> That neither Mina nor Joey contributes in any way the plot of the film leaves me as perplexed as Lee's insistence on the most banal clichés to realize his non-successors. And believe me, the flirt sequence is just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, we find Woon Lee trying to explain his constant frown and yell at Sin's girl, Teri (Mia Suh), in what I'm sure Lee wanted to be a touching moment . What a surprise: while Woon invokes a metaphorical story about the motherland to illustrate his point, ripped straight from Reader's Digest, his voice quivers in that very special paternal way. The camera frames a forced shot of Teri's trembling hands. We feel obliged to look up, except that we realize that Woon's explanation makes absolutely no sense. But the lack of substance did not prevent Lee from making the film, so why should he have cut this scene ineffectively? After all, the world can always use another cliché. <br /> <br /> Well, you say, the film can be painful, but at least * it must * be a technical masterpiece - say, like, "What dreams might come." Sorry, on a technical basis, even 'Giallo' disappoints. Lee's changes are embarrassing and disturb the small rhythm that exists in the film, but I'm sure Lee thought they looked fashionable - to make matters worse, each frame is underexposed or overexposed Although the light meter was invented in 1932, somehow the newfangled technology did not enter the "Yellow" set. <br /> <br /> In light of the total lack of the film, actor Burt Bolos, who he plays Sin's like the best friend Alex, behaves relatively well, even though Bolos minimizes slightly, you can't really blame him when Lee's script consists only of frowning and screaming, Bolos' comrades, on the other hand, don't show any moderation in their exaggeration. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen a bad movie like "Yellow" for a long time. And I really pray that I won't see such a bad movie as "Yellow" for a long time. Please don't waste it on see it, life is already too much short. Thank you.
