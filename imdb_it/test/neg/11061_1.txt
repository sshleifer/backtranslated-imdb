If you are a bit masochistic and like to waste some time you should try this. I've wasted enough time looking at it, so I won't go into explaining why it's so terrible. Watch out !!! Oh, I see that I have to fill 10 or more lines. Here we are: every year someone thinks it's fun to start shooting a low budget movie about the scary underground monsters, which hopefully will prove to be a kind of success. The Cavern is one of those. I didn't have high expectations on this, but the acting is so bad and the production so poor that I'm seriously considering asking for a refund. Phewww ... another line on a useless film ... Oh, I'm done.
