Ok, don't go wrong - this is a pretty horrible movie, but I actually thought he had a couple of gruesome scenes and exceeded his pathetic budget from time to time. At least it is unintentionally funny in the points and has a definite air of creepy and uncomfortable (a face-burning scene, the part with the disfigured bride). <br /> <br /> This child falls into the "so bad is fun" category for me, and for that I would only give a star. The effects are terrible, the acting is abysmal and everything seems to have been shot in a day. You must also love that toy ship at the beginning! He remembered childhood memories of having seen him on TV late at night many years ago. While the Alpha DVD print seems weak and as if it had been recorded directly from an old TV show or something, I actually liked it in this case!
