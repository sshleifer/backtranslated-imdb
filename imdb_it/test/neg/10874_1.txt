Because that's what Hell Ride is. Larry Bishop and Tarantino celebrate Weinstein's money with a promise to deliver a film sometimes down the line. I'm all for fake boobage and alcohol as much as the next, but do we really need the movie? In reality there is nothing worse than the heated second-hand leftovers of an old trend. And I'm not even talking about the grindhouse cinema of the 70s, because Hell Ride doesn't have the raw and unpolished feeling of the era he claims to pay tribute to. No, this is a Hollywood and glossy MTV in all respects. The old trend I'm talking about is the extravagant pseudo-hip cinematic world in which Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie and Robert Rodriguez. All three boys were at least talented and found success for a reason. Hell Ride is just a second-hand copy, fickle and uninspired, polished to the maximum when it should be raw, the "supercool" look that comes out forced and silly. <br /> <br /> There is no reason, for example, because a simple and absolutely silly story has to be told in a twisted way, back and forth in time. It's just a post Tarantino quirk. There is not even a reason why the dialogues should be so pointlessly useless, the people slamming their gums while saying NOTHING: at least when Travolta spoke of a cheeseburger in Pulp Fiction it seemed fresh. The dialogues here are little more than pseudo-macho postures. There is also no reason why a rock'n'roll grating guitar should vibrate aimlessly for the whole movie. Perhaps the lowest success of Hell Ride is when it tries to be quasi-existential. There is a hilarious dream / illusion scene in the desert where the bishop eats the peyote and sees the colors. I almost expected an old Indian to come out and offer nuggets of wisdom. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming thing about this horrible asshole is Vinnie Jones's boobage and monologue on his tattooed wings (and maybe some of the outer blows of the desert). Lots of boobages and hot, skimpy-dressed girls. Now it's something I can get, but a movie that they don't. Everything else is just an empty shell, an imitation of other infinitely more talented imitators.
