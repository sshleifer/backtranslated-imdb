At the center, this is a typical Western revenge, heavy on spaghetti, and if you follow it as such, the protagonist arrives successfully defeating the main villain. However there is so much to do that it has no relation to the story that you have to ask yourself what the directors were thinking. I refer to things like the way Miss Rosie's number of singers comes out of nowhere and the boxing match in the city center. OK, they have a loose connection with the evil influence of Mash Flanagan, but because suddenly he comes up with an alias - Mr. Donovan. <br /> <br /> On the flip side of the coin, I thought it was quite innovative how the camera shot showing Wallach's wounded sight on the track could have been filmed by someone with a bullet in his shoulder. And wasn't it great how Donovan's girlfriend uses the old headache routine when she gets a little lively? Don't let me forget the great acrobatic work of the gravel boys, as the Wallach shoot them as part of the finale. <br /> <br /> However, there was one thing that couldn't be counted, and I kept waiting for the whole movie for this. Whatever happened to that trio of caps that Flanagan / Donovan takes near the beginning of the photo? You know, the guy Martel that a mortician wanted to hire for his firearm skills, the devil's henchman Mitchell with the rifle and the Lincoln Tate knife thrower. Each had a size of five thousand dollars on his head, and they had to protect Donovan from the boy who survived the massacre of the opening scene. They have never been heard again! I like to think that maybe Donovan just killed them and he kept the 15K all to himself.
