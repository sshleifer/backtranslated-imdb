Travolta and Thurman deserved a better film. This is very minor in all respects, not just a fresh idea. But the biggest problem is the ridiculous philosophy of this film. A gang of black rappers after all their criminal activities and even killing people are almost becoming Mickey Mouse-like heroes who perform on stage and give prizes during the ceremony. Perhaps this corresponds to real life. But showing it as a completely normal "happy ending" is beyond my imagination ... "What is wrong with shooting a couple of Ukrainian villains if they are not politically correct?" - the show must go on! This makes me think that Hollywood writers have a big problem separating good and evil, even though the genre should be a "black comedy".
