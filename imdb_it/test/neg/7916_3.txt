I'm glad I didn't expect too much when I saw this sequel to one of my favorite childhood films. The plot was as boring and unconvincing as the characters were, and I was disappointed that some of the characters in the original were not in this sequel. I also didn't think the characters themselves were similar from the previous movie. Charlie had changed and now he has a girlfriend. The first film had good music, but the music of this film was not memorable. In short, this film didn't do it for me. And, looking at the feedback from other users, it seems like it hasn't been done for many of you. Not worth watching.
