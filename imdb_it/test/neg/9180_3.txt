Unlike most reviewers of this particular film, I'm not at all a fan of Cynthia Rothrock, to say the least. However, when I saw that the film had Fred Williamson and Robert Forster (both great actors), I just had to watch the movie. Williamson is a Dakota Smith, an alcoholic cop who has been relegated to washing the bathrooms with a toothbrush and even worse having to collaborate with Cynthia at the behest of the captain (Robert Forster). Forster is always watchable, it's just a shame that the film is damn trivial and banal. It also features one of the least terrifying villains who have ever relied on celluloid. Williamson will return to the Dakota character in other films, the next is "Down N Dirty" <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nina Richardson shows some T & A; Mary Kapper topless <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Extreme
