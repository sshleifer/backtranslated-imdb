Don't waste money or time. Terrible film Bad acting, plot everywhere. Really, really bad acting. Dude, this movie is just ugly. I turn it off at 7 minutes. The script is bad, the direction is bad, it seems to me that a group of high schools has gathered to do a project for their acting class. Yes, it's so bad. The acting is not convincing at all, mind you I only saw 7 minutes. As this film arrived on DVD, it's beyond me. <br /> <br /> It should have been left in the modification warehouse. I saw the cover and thought it was nice enough, I'm sure it won't do that next time: _)
