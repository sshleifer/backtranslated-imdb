In a quiet city a couple of girls watch a friend's murder at a strange boy named Milo, who lives across the city. After the murder, his body is found in a river and his dead pronounced. So sixteen years after a marriage attracts girls to their childhood city and Claire, a school teacher, becomes obsessed with the fact that Milo is not dead because she has recurring visions about him and her friends die one by one and no one he believes her when she says Milo is part of it. So now, part to discover the horrible truth. <br /> <br /> When I came across this film, I was rather skeptical about it, especially when it had "From the creators of Anaconda" on the cover, but reading the strange plot on the back of the video case, it sounded good and rather refreshing for a change. Well, guess what? At the time I thought it was a good idea, but it was a completely different story when it came to watching the movie. He just seemed to be trying to be smart and very psychological, but that last element didn't come out so good for me and it was basically a prolonged and mostly unconvincing thriller. Hey, I admit he had his moments, but barely enough to make it neither effectively chilling, or memorable. But, a good one for filmmakers, at least the story is not a review of those slasher imitators who followed "Scream" and horror shock, isn't there an obvious self-referential humor ?? in reality there is not even a TIP of humor. Though, maybe he was too serious? Above all, since the plot is rather absurd, but this is not its main problem. What a bumpy plot we get, I didn't know much about what was happening, since it seems to skim a lot of things in favor of some seemingly shocking and disturbing sequences. No! More irrelevant scenes and yawns that induce clich√©s that we see from time to time. Also you can see some influences of some "good" horror movies of the 70s, one of which is "Do not Look Now". This is when our main character continues to see the figure of his past in a plot. The other should be one of my favorite "Alice, sweet Alice" with the person who caused the problem by wearing a yellow snub and committing macabre deaths. An interesting idea but it is quite superficial and too many errors appear. I liked it better when the scenes dealt with the character's childhood, since the performances and circumstances had something disturbing about them, but when they got into their adulthood they were mostly tired and uneventful and the performances weren't terrible , but incredibly trivial and hardly engaging is a good way to put it. Most of the dialogue made me moan incredulously how ingenious and embarrassing it was. You will be shouted "no duh!" on the screen, because you can't believe what you're listening to. The police detective suffers the weight! <br /> <br /> Quality wise: the film is not bad, in reality it is better than the usual video directed to the video. Very smooth stuff. With some inventive and prominent camera angles and a weak score that works quite well. Another factor that stood out and was the key to building the moody atmosphere is the creeping sound effects and the bicycle bell leaves a sound sensation in the ears. The setting of a quiet elementary school was well done and the rest of the action takes place in a house. But don't expect any real suspense or surprise because the execution of these is non-existent. The deaths are not pleasant and are slightly bloody and are more the consequences of what happens to these bodies, which tries to disturb you. The villain in this piece, the lively and witty child Milo Jeeder was slightly disturbing, although the voice and the yellow enchantress make an imprint to begin with, but it seems that it will lose its effect when we reach the conclusion of the film. The poor text lines of the video compare it with (moved) Jason, (careful) Freddy and (it's not child's play) Chucky, but you're kidding me! Right? It is labeled "The new face of evil", yes of course. All he needs is to teach good manners and solve problems. Overall, the film left me with just a sour taste, like I could have done without seeing it. I probably wanted him to do it. <br /> <br /> Don't expect too much from this movie blur. Or, even better, just skip it, since you won't lose yourself much, really.
