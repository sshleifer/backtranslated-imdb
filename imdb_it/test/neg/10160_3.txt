I had seen this film when I was a boy (before the Second World War) and I was surprised that the local library had a copy. I saw him again after about sixty years and I forgot how bad he was. This is an example of a film that was not an "A" movie. No changes, poor script, weak acting and not much directing. It shouldn't even be as tall as a "B". I laughed at how tiring I have become over the years. It seems to me that it was nice when I saw it originally.
