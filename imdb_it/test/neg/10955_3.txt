The production company of this film calls itself "Nott Entertainment", and this is a surprisingly suitable name. This is a lot of fun from "Nott" from start to finish, which is a shame because a mix of zombie and western movies may have been interesting. Whenever a low-cost zombie movie is published, it will tend to be "for fan fans". Actually I consider myself a fan of zombie movies, but there are too many like this and I will reevaluate my opinion! The film seems to be a rip-off of the half-decent Australian zombie movie, expect instead of just having the advantage in a cowboy hat; everyone wears one; but this doesn't make much sense because the film is apparently set in modern times. The sequence of credits at the beginning of the film makes us believe that we will be in an atmospheric film, but when the film starts correctly; soon it becomes clear what we really are inside. Of course, there is quite a bit of cold blood and it is actually quite well done, even if the good things I have to say about the film end here. There is a halfway turn which could have been interesting if the rest of the film were. Overall, this is just another zombie movie in a world with too many zombie movies. I don't recommend it.
