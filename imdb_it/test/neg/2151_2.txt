I'm not sure if this is just a bad movie or if it was meant to be a mockery of a Western "B". The plot was so-so, but filming, editing, and acting were just plain ugly. Furthermore, the background music was irritating to the end, too loud and simply non-stop. Many times it was not possible to distinguish the dialogue on the background music. I'm in SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) and I do some Old West with them, and many actors are members of this group, that's why I bought it. If you have no interest in this group of people or in that sport, surely you would not even have this small interest in helping out with the film. The acting of even veteran actors (especially Stella Stevens) left much to be desired.
