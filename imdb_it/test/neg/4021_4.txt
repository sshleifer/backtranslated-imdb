I saw about a half-dozen of the cheap western B poor that Ken Maynard made in the 1930s, and I'm constantly amazed at how poor an actor is. Why did you become a leading cowboy actor? They say he could ride quite well in the silent ones, but he doesn't do anything particularly impressive in these subsequent sound films. Still, maybe he got the contacts because he was big and could ride. <br /> <br /> Phantom Rancher is not as bad as some of the other Ken Maynard films I've seen, but it's still not much. Some of the other characters refer to him a couple of times as a "young boy", in which it seems to me that he is as old as the other older actors. <br /> <br /> And if it's not silly enough, there's a pretty significant script problem in this movie. At one point, one of the characters makes a remark about how the ghost prevented the poisoning of a well, something that had not yet happened. Only a couple of minutes later, we see that particular scene. No, it wasn't a flashback. At first I thought that maybe when Treeline Films was doing the DVD transfer, they could overturn two of the reels. But in those days the film reels contained about 11 minutes of film, and the entire inversion took only 3 or 4 minutes. Everything else was in a logical order. Therefore, it seems to have been a real problem of continuity in the original film. Perhaps this is one of the reasons Colony Pictures didn't last very long.
