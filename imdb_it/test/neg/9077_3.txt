Bronson took the money and ran with this film; must have house payments like me! This low-budget film made in Mexico reminds me of some of those smelly Italian seafood. I heard, I don't know if this is true, but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes. I believe it because otherwise they would have made this film, certainly not to earn money. We have had a lot of these stinky made in Canada, because the government has granted tax relief to create a film industry. I wonder if it was paid in other countries like in Canada. However, returning to the subject this film is badly done in every aspect, I believe they took Charles Bronson to sell this stinker; that corpse in the end seems very fake. 3/10
