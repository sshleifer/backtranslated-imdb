There was a lot of hype about this movie and the commercials made it look like it would be great. Unfortunately, as Bring It On 2, Bring It On 3 has shamed the glory of the original Bring It On. There is a shameless stereotype in the film. The lines given to the actors were humiliating for all the races involved in the film. Hayden Panattiere's performance was sub-par both in terms of acting and cheerleading. There were several scenes in which I literally got crushed because I was embarrassed about the cast because the scene (lines, plot, etc.) were just so stupid. My recommendation to the producers of every future Bring It On movie is that you should hire good cheerleaders and teach them to act because the cast's "acting" was horrendous and their lack of cheerleading skills made them completely useless to the film . Just a great character: Kirresha.
