Critics are a strange kind of people. Some of them are ordinary people like you and me. Some of them are not. When a critic says that Subconscius Cruelty is beautiful, I wonder where they grew up? What's nice with shooting a field, some clouds or a tree with an old camera if you can't do it in style and capture the atmosphere of the environments. Karim Hussain certainly cannot. I've seen kids make better movies than the ones Karim can do in Subconscius Cruelty. But this is not the worst part. The worst part is the whole recording, I refuse to call it a movie, it's just a bad excuse for images of extreme nakedness and torture, rape of both sexes, masturbation, sperm, pissing, cannibalism, murder of children and much more . I love blood / splatter and I love horror. This is none of those. This is crap and if my comments make one person jump Subconscius Cruelty it was worth it. Always remember that your life will not last forever, don't waste two hours of precious time on Subconscius Cruelty. You have been warned
