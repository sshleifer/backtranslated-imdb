I just saw it on Showtime ... ewwwwwww, it's not even funny in a bad movie. One of the most monstrous crazy monsters I've ever seen. In addition, the television reporter in the film was that annoying Jerri of a past season of Survivor. The only funny thing was that the "secret base" was the home of Fantasy Island (and a million other films and television programs, the place is located in the area of ​​L.A.). I expected Mr Roarke and Tattoo to come out and greet the visitors. If Tattoo had been eaten by the snake, I could have given this movie a 2, but oh well. Watching people stand there and scream for five minutes while the Komodo or cobra loomed over them instead of running away was pretty funny, especially since you could really tell they were just screaming in an empty spot where computer animators would later paint in the monster. I almost fell off the chair when, in a flashback scene, they introduced the cobra or komodo - then the normal size - into an indestructible solid steel container with some drilled air holes. Wouldn't a metal cage have been enough? LOL! I guess they couldn't afford to rent a real komodo and cobra. I must mention that I rented Showtime for their series and not for their films.
