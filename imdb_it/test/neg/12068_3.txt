Apparently, the writer and director of this DVD-directed slasher film is a Friday 13 fan and other summer camp lumberjacks. This film has it all - a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend having fun, alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called "Camp Blood", the old man who warns them not to go there; and of course the crazy machete killer who continues to cut and hack teenagers for no reason at all ... The whole thing could have worked if it had been shot on 35mm film with acceptable special effects. But instead the special effects are badly made. The killer walks around like he's out on an afternoon walk, and the only good things about this movie are the acting of the talented lead actress and the sex scene in the beginning. Apart from that - boring and forgettable. Jasper P. Morgan
