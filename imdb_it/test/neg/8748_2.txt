If you've ever visited Shenandoah Acres as a child and wondered, could there be a worse vacation spot in the world? Well, you could have seen this movie and got your answer. Flavia (a.k.a. Fistula) Macintyre's ranch is often frequented by Gordon casual business, at least since Jessica, the resident water witch, was 13 years old. But can Jessica find much more than fresh spring water with that divination rod? buried "tray-shure", lost jewels, corpses, even a talisman that will prevent her from dressing like a whore and raising a drink with a fake rhythm and a Suzanne Pleshette look-alike while being mesmerized by a disembodied head. Bad, bad evil.
