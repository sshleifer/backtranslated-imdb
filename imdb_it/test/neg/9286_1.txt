It's the single most ruthless thing I've ever seen. It's sad how much you try so hard to come up with a good joke and all he does is curse and think his disgusting vulgarity is fun. He's the bitterest person I've ever seen. All his action is trying to show how much he doesn't matter, and showing just how angry he is with critics and people with any taste and sense of humor that he'd rather suffer immense torture than look at his "show". There are good comedians, there are bad ones and there are horrible ones. But this guy is in his own league. I'm sorry for him and even more for the people who find it funny.
