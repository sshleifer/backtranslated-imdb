Eghads, what a bad movie. Tart is perhaps the worst film I've ever seen throughout the year and I met some doozies. There is nothing saving about this garbage, from characterization to the direction of the plot. Even the usual genius Dominique Swain could not save this film. None of the characters is minimally understanding, with the possible exception of Eloise (wonderfully played by Lacey Chabert, the only bright spot in this sad failure). <br /> <br /> ******* Possible Spoilers ******** <br /> <br /> The main problem with Tart is that it gets lost without saying anything. He staggers drunk instead of guiding us along the path of history. It also introduces numerous potentially enticing details (the hypochondriac brother, the mother's assets constantly recovered, the anti-Semitic classmate, the murderous father of the other classmate) without successfully exploring one of them. And just when I finally thought there might be some sort of resolution for the characters, the movie crashed to an unexpectedly violent end. <br /> <br /> I left the film feeling that he was trying to tell me something, but with the strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be communicated. This is an obvious first film by a writer / director who really needs to spend much more time working with more established directors before leaving his job to an unsuspecting public. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 1 out of 10, and I'm usually very generous, even with bad movies.
