For some unknown reason, 7 years ago, I saw this movie with my mother and my sister. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard with them before. This film was tremendous. How the sequels were produced is beyond me. It's been a while since I last saw this "movie", but the only impression that impressed me over the years was: "They must have found the script in a dumpster in a movie studio backlot cheap, turned into a "movie", and decided that it didn't suck enough and made things worse, I'm pretty sure they spent all the budget for camera work and so-called "special effects", and then left 13 cents to the script AND to pay the "actors".
