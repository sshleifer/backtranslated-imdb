While babysitting in an isolated house in Colorado, a teenage girl is terrified of an elusive killer on the phone. <br /> <br /> The remake of the 1979 semi-classic horror film basically takes the first 20 minutes of the original film and stretches out for an 87-minute interval! So it's pretty useless to say that the plot of this remake is pretty thin. There is little in terms of originality or interest in this film. There is a lot of Camilla Belle who wonders around in a dark house to wonder who is calling her and meeting all kinds of false scares. Everything becomes repetitive and routine after the first 30 minutes and never manages to gather a lot in terms of suspense or chills. Certainly it never reaches the intensity of the original film, especially since it abandons and changes an important point of the plot with respect to the original. I imagine we will have the PG-13 rating to thank for that. <br /> <br /> On the plus side there is an impressive set and a dark atmosphere, unfortunately there is not much to do around this to save this remake from being sub-par. Belle's performance is also rather mediocre. <br /> <br /> It's just another senseless remake. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
