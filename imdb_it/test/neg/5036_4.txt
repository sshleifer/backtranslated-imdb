The short existence of The Sex Pistols and the making of this film after the controversial and revolutionary break-up of the English punk band both happened before I was born. However, I started listening to their only album, "Never Mind the B * and% @ # & s, Here's the Sex Pistols", in 2003, when I was a teenager, and quickly became a big fan. I didn't see "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle" until 2006, but I saw it a couple of times that year, and I thought it was pretty good (certainly not great, but quite good), even if I could just remember bit of it, and didn't see how everything was connected. Seeing it for the third time, almost three years after the second, I didn't care much. I'm not even sure what I found very good to a large extent (I don't remember now). <br /> <br /> This film is a mockumentary, in which the Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren tells the story of the band and its members to their side; guitarist Steve Jones, credited here as "The Crook"; drummer Paul Cook, credited as "The Tea-Maker"; bassist Sid Vicious, credited as "The Gimmick"; and John Lydon (a.k.a Johnny Rotten) was credited as "The Collaborator". McLaren claims to have created the band (and also the punk rock genre) as a money-making scam. He tells much of the story to Helen Wellington-Lloyd (a.k.a. Helen of Troy), in various places where they go together. It's basically a jumble of McLaren chatter, Pistols songs, live band footage, imaginary scenes (often silly, weird), different cartoon sequences, etc., all put together in a movie, to tell the manager's story Pistols of history in a bizarre way! <br /> <br /> It has been shown that McLaren is a liar, I know many have already pointed this out, including the band members themselves. He was NOT the driving force behind the band, he didn't create them (nor did he invent punk rock, and The Sex Pistols weren't even the first punk band, though they were unique). The band members were the ones who made the band what it was. "The Filth and the Fury", a much more credible film about the band by Julien Temple, who made this film, is told from the point of view of the band members, who contradict McLaren's claims. However, the dishonesty of "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle" is not my biggest problem. If it was really funny (which I thought was to some extent), I would be able to ignore it, as I was obviously used to doing. During my third vision, apart from the Sex Pistols songs, some live footage and at least a slightly funny sequence of cartoons was pretty boring! I found the song "Who Killed Bambi" slightly amusing at first, but it was tiring very quickly. <br /> <br /> Is this mockumentary worthy of being seen by Sex Pistols fans? It seems that a good number of fans would say that it is, not to know the true story of the punk band of the 70s of short duration but revolutionary, but for entertainment. This was once my opinion on "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle". After the first time I looked at it, I didn't remember anything McLaren said, and when I saw it for the second time, I was aware of what the Pistols director was using this movie to imply, but he still managed to barely remember anything I heard him say! Obviously, other aspects of the film were what I found impressive. Now, after my third vision, I can definitely remember some of the things that McLaren says, but it wasn't 100% clear yet. Like most of the film, I believe his words are not so memorable, probably because of the way they are presented. If you're a Pistols fan, I guess it wouldn't hurt to try "Swindle", but for me, for the most part, it's just an incoherent, boring mess that tries to be funny but fails.
