I just finished watching him after I got tired of getting ready for the Michigan Bar Exam. I wanted something that was brainless and that I could just sit and say "what the hell were they thinking?" I was not disappointed in this undertaking, but if I had looked at this in a serious state of mind, I would have been angry. The company that made this thing has just stacked the CGI footage of the first octopus and added a little movie with a fake octopus that makes the one in "Bride of the Monster" look like a masterpiece of movies with special effects. Since when has an octopus got fangs? The plot is that a New York police diver is investigating some murders / disappearances on the Hudson River just before July 4th. He and his companion (who will soon be transferred, or who will soon be shelled from an octopus that gorges on figs) investigate rather inept (believing all the time that a huge octopus will kill people) and will occasionally be accompanied by lackey female from the mayor's office. Of course on one it is believed that an octopus can become so large until the thing attacks the policeman and the girl from the mayor's office. Surprisingly, all hell is not unleashed and only a few policemen and a few more civilians are killed. <br /> <br /> Really lame. Do not worry about it.
