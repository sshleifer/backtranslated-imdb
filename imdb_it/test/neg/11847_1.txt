This film is an aborted, born attempt to mend together several bad movies and make a sort of extra-bad movie. It also fails in this, given that there is too much "plot", and not enough silly puppets and ridiculous blood. Seriously, the puppets are sweet, and the guys in suits are giving me a nice ass. The performances are at C level at most and limping, with special items for the guy from Spec-Ops that spoke of a kind of bizarre Veneto / Oriental dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. Not that you really care what he says, because only damn words are distinct. Cinematographically, it is not offensive, practically what you would expect from cheap straight-to-video offal (just like the script). The fact that New Concorde used the movie "Carnosaur" is offensive and rather confusing. For shame, New Concorde. For shame. "Carnosaur" is one of my favorite and terrible films, and somehow they ruined it and made it almost invisible. Watch the "Carnosaur" movies if you want to see the chaos of the dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> I give him a star because I love the movies he steals from, and also because the scale doesn't have a zero.
