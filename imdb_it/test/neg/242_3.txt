With the dialogue in the dubbed version of this film, I don't think Shakespeare is in any great danger. This is the story of an ancient Aztec mummy who has been deprived of civil rights. His things have been taken and this really drives him. He seems to know who is doing it even though he is a wandering entity. I adored the two obtuse men who tell the story of how the mother and doctor were found who are determined to destroy the creature. There are all these scenes in this ridiculous cemetery, full of economic crosses and other odds and ends. There is a mausoleum in which the mummy is kept. I can't begin to reproduce the idiocy of this, including a snake pit where the good doctor is thrown (there's a door next to him so he can crawl out) to the robot, a mass of metal cans with a guy inside. The dialogue is terrible. There are long pauses between speeches as if someone outside the stage were feeding their jokes. I love the scene where the two kids accuse their mother of going out at night (she enters this zombie state or something like that). However, if you're looking for a movie to laugh at and never take seriously, watch this. First have a couple of beers. Like a direct line from Mother's grave, "Watch this and your eyes will bleed and your breath will smell." What else can I say?
