The main problem with this film is that it is not possible to use Bill Murray to the best of his ability, simply because of the co-star. <br /> <br /> If this was a road movie with another comedy actor, it might work. Even if they both tried to get the elephant across the country, they would at least allow a fun dialogue to be shared. As it is, Murray is left to talk to an elephant who cannot respond with jokes. In essence, it means that Murray is talking to himself, and this makes the movie more boring than it could have been if he had another character to bounce off. <br /> <br /> The guys will love this movie, simply because of the fact that elephant, but anyone who wants to watch Bill Murray's biting delivery and enjoy an excellent script must look elsewhere.
