Nothing to spoil here, but this could be a SPOILER so be careful. <br /> <br /> The special effects were at the level of a video game - about five years ago, or perhaps of the original Star Trek. The acting was simply pathetic: a blonde with a sardonic look crossing the desert while a voice in the background kept ringing. And go. And go. This was the journey and half of the drone I actually passed. Progress is interrupted by some fighting. Ships hit each other without a real apparently episodic reason. Again, it's not like there's a real fight you'd expect from a movie, more like an economic video game. Boi-ing! Boi-ing! The ship explodes. Next ship Apparently some of the ships are looking for the blonde. Here in the distant future, ships must be short-sighted and astigmatic because many of them pass directly over the futuristic girl elegantly dressed in black, but they never see her. <br /> <br /> Then there are a couple of choreographed fights that seem to be made by high school kids. Once again, the video game mentality is essential. The fighters switch to "Fight Mode" throwing something at the wrists, and a strong computerized voice echoes and "Fight Mode" flashes. It must be a dandy design if you're trying to sneak up on someone. Then go to a large power plant that looks like a daytime power tower and plug in to recharge it. LOL, I'm not kidding, you can't invent this stuff, it's like watching a fucking video game from around 2000, only acting is better in the game. <br /> <br /> Other trekking. Then he introduces himself to "The City". (Lame sound trek is even weaker here.) He starts arguing with a mechanical robot of the future who can't hit her with his big gun, even if he runs right in front of him, about five feet in front of him. Obviously the robots of the distant future are just as useful as the toaster ovens in a fight. He throws sand in his eyes and beats him to death by throwing stones at him. rofl, at that point I was at about 95% tolerance, my nausea circuits flashed red. <br /> <br /> In the next scene he ends up tied to a rocket with a rope. I'm not kidding, tied directly to the outside of a rocket. This should be an advanced form of transport. At that point I saved myself. <br /> <br /> This film is a real dishonor for a film made at the time. Only a shameful misfortune. There was an unpleasant story, but the film was distracted from it - someone who continually sang of "mother". <br /> <br /> I gave him a couple because there were some scenes that showed beautiful science fiction artwork as a background. Unfortunately the plot, the acting, the action, the cinematography and the narrative distract this work and degrade it. I'm not kidding.
