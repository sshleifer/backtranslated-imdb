This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm still trying to get over how bad it was. Just because it has the name of Godard connected to it, it doesn't make it perfect. Beyond the fact that it makes absolutely no sense, we see a crazy take on a traffic jam that is not amazing, unbelievable or anything like that. While this long roundup of traffic jams is going on you will probably feel more like making a pastrami sandwich than watching it. Pieces of a supposed story, stupid, stupid characters. What message should we take from this? It offers nothing and has no purpose. The director's arrogance to show off these crazy and boring French chain smokers and make them sit and talk for hours and hours and then make them go unnoticed because the art is truly stunning.
