... out of this movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry, this was shown at the Cleveland International Film Festival. Our copy had no subtitles, so I asked the festival staff if there was a problem with the received print. "Not so ..." I was told. "the director wants it that way". <br /> <br /> Again, sorry to say, my French is barely elective (more than 3 decades ago). Much of the initial dialog is in French, so I'm sure I've lost the nuances and many details in my understanding of some keywords. <br /> <br /> I evaluated this as a "1", mainly due to the irony of a director who once worked subtitling by refusing to put subtitles in a movie to be seen by an American audience. Excuse me, even though most Americans would not know where Europe is on a map, it should not be assumed that the film festival audience knows "the mother tongue" of a particular film. Although some of us do not know Finnish, I would expect subtitles for the few "sweets" that are not sophisticated enough to have experience in the 37 different languages ​​presented. I'll bear this ego of David Lynch, not Litvack.
