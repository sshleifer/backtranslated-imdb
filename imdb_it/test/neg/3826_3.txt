Tim Curry was the reason I wanted to see this movie, and although of course his appearance is always fun, after all it's wasted. The rest of the cast is not going too well either, in this remake of one of the first zombie movies that has extremely graphic effects that are completely useless. To quote a popular axiom, sometimes less is better.
