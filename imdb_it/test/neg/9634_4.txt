HANDS OF THE RIPPER <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: mono <br /> <br /> An Edwardian doctor (Eric Porter) uses a Freudian analysis new on a young girl (Angharad Rees) who turns out to be Jack the Ripper's daughter, and just as lethal ... <br /> <br /> Unlikely Hammer horror, in which a respectable society figure takes on a beautiful young undressed without attracting even a breath of scandal, even when she starts killing everyone with a variety of lethal instruments (broken mirrors, headgear, etc.)! L.W. Davidson's script wanders aimlessly from one murder to another, sacrificing the inherent subtext of the material (Porter's obvious attraction to Rees) in favor of commercial melodrama, and the tone remains subdued everywhere. Some of the gore scenes are surprisingly vivid, even for Hammer, and have been cut from the original US version (despite an MPAA R rating), although the full version is now available on home video. Porter and Rees give excellent performances, and the climax in St. Paul's Cathedral is a highlight, but the rest of the film is strangely empty and unaffected. Directed by Peter Sasdy.
