Having just seen Acacia, I find that I have to agree with the negative reviews here. I like Asian and Korean horror and I had high expectations for this film. Friend, I was disappointed. Looking at this, I kept thinking "surely they just do it to catch me off guard later", and for a while I expected something ingenious to happen. However, I slowly realized that the film is really that bad. It's the cheapest money in the Asian horror market I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> The basic story is perhaps not so bad, but the way it is filmed seems to be the most laughable plot ever. The tree as a "scary" device could be fine if used intelligently, but everything the director does is giving us several shots of ... yes, a tree, again and again. He seems to hope that the tree does all the work for him in terms of tension and accumulation, but it looks like what it is: the blows of a tree. For God's sake! <br /> <br /> Slow accumulations can be very effective, and a film that presents the viewer with few glimpses of what is wrong could provide good bravado, but not Acacia. Of course, you see a child on a tricycle that disappears around a corner, and, once again, significant shots of the tree above, or below, or on the side, but these scenes are not just scary. They feel silly, especially because you realize that the director makes them be fearful. They simply are not. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the characters are ridiculous. In particular, the "descent into madness" of a character is ridiculous. However, what really breaks Acacia is the terrible montage. It's hard to see why the scenes were cut together as they are, but it's ugly and kills every spark of interruption that it may have had. It also makes me feel patronizing, because I can see what they are trying to achieve with it, but I can't believe that they think I would fall in love with these economic tricks. <br /> <br /> There are many fantastic Asian ghosts films, and many villains, but this is by far the worst I've seen. They must have looked at the list of "what to put in the ghost movies", and they have combed them all, but in the end they forgot to add the actual movie.
