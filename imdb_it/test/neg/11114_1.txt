I saw this film knowing it would be terrible, but damned if it had not broken a new and revolutionary terrain in making fecal matter acceptable as entertainment. The plot is Deep Rising with cruddy effects and HORRID acting. The lines in this ... well ... wow there's really no way to put this movie down because I think the words still need to be created in English. The sad part is that the filmmakers thought they were really doing something good. You will not believe your eyes when you see how many movies they have torn away without even trying to hide it. There are scenes / plot devices directly from Deep Rising, Alien, Jurassic Park, Predator, Jeepers Creepers, and the list goes on and on. However, unlike none of those films, this is not up to the celluloid faeces. The most incredulous thing about this film, apart from the way it tries to be competent but fails, is that Gimli, he, is the true self. How the hell can they afford John Rhys-Davies but no decent effects, scripts, actors or sets. Really terrible ... and not the kind of ugly that is fine.
