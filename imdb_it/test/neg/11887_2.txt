Tribute at the hands of honest hacking. I felt good in a soft-core way about equivalent to his bland pornography, until his lack of technical and economic reality, emotional and moral sophistication became evident. <br /> <br /> Basically a confused 90s remake of the 90s Real Genius ", with fewer stupid genes, and a cynical bad ending. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie might please someone delighted by the thesis that becoming a billionaire is so easy to be almost casual, or perhaps to technical types who like to see themselves portrayed as beautiful and sexy, speculating on why someone might like this film is certainly more interesting than the film itself. The film's closing credits song is more interesting than the movie itself.
