This highly busted Blaxploitation / Kung-Fu hybrid was released in my country by a questionable DVD label that usually only talks about the transfer of pure shit to the record, so it wasn't exactly a favorable herald. Several other titles have been released in the same series, such as "The Black Six", "The Black Gestapo" and "The Black Godfather" and, judging by all their low ratings and negative reviews, none of these belong to the elite of the 70s Blaxploitation hype, n√©. "TNT Jackson" is a rather disgusting film, completely devoid of a significant plot but with ridiculous fighting scenes and horrible acting to compensate. Apparently Roger Corman ?? never too embarrassed to make easy money ?? assigns two of his most hilarious acolytes to quickly invent a simplistic story that appeals to fans of both oriental Kung-Fu films and contemporary fashionable Blaxploitation films. The result obtained by Cirio H. Santiago and Dick Miller was "TNT Jackson"; the story of a black donkey who travels to Hong Kong in search of his missing brother. He quickly discovers that he was killed by a criminal drug-trafficking network and vows to avenge him. Ms. Jackson infiltrates the subsoil without problems and meets magi macho, useful undercover agents, lots of ferocious Kung-Fu fighters. Only one thing is certain; everyone wants a fascinating piece of TNT's body in one way or another. I honestly doubt that the cinematographic concepts are more elementary than this, but ?? unfortunately, all other aspects also suck. The battle scenes are too long and also pathetically staged. Jeannie Bell and the other poor wretches really try to fix themselves threateningly and take a difficult position, but in the end all they do is kick in the air and jump stupidly through the rooms. Cinematography is horrid, the soundtrack is very disappointing (whatever happened to soul music?), The few dialogues are poorly written and the performance performances are lower. By the way, Jeannie Bell is undeniably a beautiful woman, but she can't hold a candle for Tamara Dobson or Pam Grier. There is only one really good and memorable scene in "TNT Jackson", namely the famous hotel room battle where Bell, completely naked except for her panties, repeatedly turns the light on and off while kicking the hell out from some henchmen. Funny scene ... I still don't know if it's thanks to the ingenuity of the light switch or to the perfect shape Bell's breast.
