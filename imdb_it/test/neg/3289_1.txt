I finally managed to sit through an entire episode of this show. I was very, very tired. Clearly. Previously I should have always turned it off because I thought it was so bad. Watching a complete episode convinces me that it's really so bad. I couldn't even tell you what happened, but I distinctly remember that I didn't laugh. For people who think this is the new All in the Family or Married with children ... have you ever really SEEED those shows? They are well written and well performed and above all funny! This show is NOT fun. You might think so if this is the first sitcom you've ever seen. I can't see who else would do it. I remember all the previous feelings about arrested development, etc ... It's probably my fault that I'm frustrated by television and I don't watch it, allowing stupid people to dictate what actually remains on the air.
