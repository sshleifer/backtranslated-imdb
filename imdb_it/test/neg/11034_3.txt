What did Rajiv Rai do to himself? Once a successful film director like Tridev and Vishwatama is now making one bad movie after another. At first I was excited about the thought of Rajiv Rai that he returned to the genre of action but that soon vanished. As a Rajiv Rai fan I thought I should try it, but I left after an hour. One reason I left the film so early, as well as the Paki-bashing number in the film, this was not in Rai's previous adventure. <br /> <br /> Many directors have tried Paki-bashing but I did not expect from Rajiv Rai Another disappointing was the music. Rajiv Rai has always had good music so far. There is only one good song and this is Tere dekh dekh Ladgayan. The performances are not up to par, even by the very faithful Rai Naseer-Uddin-Shah. Fare avoided by my favorite director once.
