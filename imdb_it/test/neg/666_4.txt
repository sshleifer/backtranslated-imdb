The first official release of the film division of World Wrestling Entertainment is a basic horror / slasher film called "See No Evil" starring Kane, one of their great male fighters known for having an intimidating presence, hard moves and one of the most twisted events in wrestling. And we don't punch here; while this film is promoted as the greatest horror film of all time (mainly by the WWE), it is obvious that after seeing this film, I can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all time. <br /> <br /> "See No Evil" sees a group of young delinquents sent to a hotel so they can clean up. Obviously, even a monstrous killer (played by Kane) lives in this hotel and we all know where it goes. Without revealing too much of the film's plot, this film has all the appearance and structure of a 1980s slasher film with most of the intact clich√©s, but without the fear that those films accompany. And this is the main problem with "See No Evil". He experiences so many of the tricks implied by his predecessors in the kind that is predictable; veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the gimmicks in advance and even those who have seen only a few gestures should say what will happen next. It's too general to be scary. <br /> <br /> The film is gory, no doubt, but it's only there for the effect. The dark atmosphere instilled in the film initially emits that feeling of terror, but when you reach the end, somehow it feels out of place and quickly becomes annoying. The scenes of death are not as bloody and horrible as they are ridiculous, although some are rather fanciful. <br /> <br /> And even the acting in this movie is pretty bad, as the main characters are not developed enough for us to worry about when they are eventually cut. Some can't even portray fear correctly; they scream and cry in a vain attempt to emulate. So when they die, it only adds to the play because you don't care enough about them that you simply consider them the equivalent of Starfleet Redshirts to the monster Kane. <br /> <br /> As for Kane, he simply played his character in the movie in the same way he portrays his wrestling character, only using axes and hooks instead of hellfire and sulfur. I have no doubt that Kane can be a great element in the horror genre. It has the appearance and presence for this; he just needs better material (especially a script that is not written by someone writing wrestling shows) to work with. <br /> <br /> Now, despite what may seem like a tough review, I really enjoyed the movie. It is one of those ridiculous and ugly movies that you can't help but sit and enjoy. My main complaint with the film, once again, is that it is simply an exercise in filming raw killings and has no time of fear or shock. I liked it, but I liked it because it was easy for me to laugh at some moments that should have been scary in the movie. If this happens because it had to be so, the film would have been rated higher. But it was not so. It made me laugh because it's a B-movie and it doesn't help that the director's previous experiences were porn movies and music videos; not exactly things too complicated to manage anyway. However, I loved it. <br /> <br /> If you don't mind an entertaining B-movie or horror movie, I highly recommend "See No Evil". If you are a true fan of the genre, I would wait for the DVD to come out before taking a look. Everyone else should probably go and look at something else.
