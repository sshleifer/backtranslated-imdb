I really mean, really, REALLY high and this movie has a chance of entertainment. I do not mean normal high, I mean the level where reading the phone book will make you points. otherwise save time out of your life and go do something more constructive with it, like hitting your head on a brick wall and insulting your own intelligence. A total waste of talent in some cases (Bernie Mac, John C. McGinley, Tom Kenny and the master of hams Shatner) and exactly the kind of shit they deserve to do (the myriad of rappers who insist on making films). Not without his laughter (once again chemical aid is crucial) and certainly not without offending politically hyper-sensitive (which I am always in favor of) but in the end it's not worth it.
