I clicked on the Encore Mystery channel to wait for the movie I wanted to see, Island of Dr. Moreau. I only captured a few minutes of Shadow Conspiracy. An old man runs to meet Charlie and grabs him by the arm. Suddenly, an Assassin with a bright raincoat bends the old man in the head (with a side arm) across the street. After waiting for "C" to turn and look, "A" tries to shoot "C" and clearly misses. "C" was a much easier target, the old man could not have run away. Duh! There is a chase and "C" is on a lift "A" is on the roof, so try to shoot the cable, which is parallel to "A". It hits and cuts the cable, impossible. Later, this time with a specialized rifle, the "A" aligns itself on the "C" from about 50 meters, but it is stupid to notice a motorcycle approaching and instead touching the pilot. How does Charlie take his parts? Dad goes to the producers and says "Look, my son needs work ..." It reminds me of his stupid Sit-Com. All the actors are good except, yes ... you have it. Usually I have to finish 2 or 3 minutes of that expected for C.S.I. to come. Let's see, what can I do for the next hour. I know, I'll cut my toenails! Much better use of my time.
