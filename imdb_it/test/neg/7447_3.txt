For most people, RoboCop 3 is the film that is really the great shame for the Robo series. He has few fans and most people hate him for his blatant commercial PG-13 approach. Now, I won't say that RoboCop 3 is good. Frankly, it sucks. But although it is a film that is correctly filmed and executed, it overcomes this chaos of the circuit. Yes, the truth is that RoboCop 2 is the worst of the two bad and useless sequels of a near-masterpiece. So if RoboCop 3 turns Robo into a comic book superhero in an ultra mainstream production for children, at least it does so openly. I don't know where RoboCop 2 starts or ends, I don't know what or who it is, I don't understand what's happening to us, I don't understand which jokes are deliberate and which are not, I'll go crazy if I try to understand the characters, I don't see anything valid in all that someone is saying, I can't believe anyone looked at the script and thought it would work and I can't believe Irvin Kirshner saw the final result and realized he liked what he saw. By the way, he probably didn't, nor did Miller, nor Weller nor Allen do it. It is not difficult to understand why. <br /> <br /> Now, RoboCop 2 has its fans, I know. Mostly they belong to this championship of absolute anti-claims, firing anyone who expected a deepening, or arguments of the first film, as academic apprentices of Roger Ebert Sith. It's just a lot of fun, a nice piece of action and great fun, the topic goes. Yes, I imagine that if you don't listen to what some of the characters are saying that you could fool yourself into having Arnold in the suit instead of Weller. Don't get me wrong, I like a good action movie, with pure entertainment value as it's just - more satisfying - virtue. But RoboCop 2, sir, is not quite like that. <br /> <br /> See the first two scenes. This horrible actor makes Robo repeat that he is only a machine, and then he enters this operatic discourse about how he could never be a man, where - after Murphy's wife (who cited OCP for robot stalking) enters from blue and has this sad little moment with him, and then you don't hear him speak again! I would definitely like to get into this movie scene by scene, because everyone has this kind of nonsense in them. It is as if a twelve-year-old fan made the script, the characters behaved in a totally random way and before they said it, then say it. OCP wants to stop the crime with a new Robo, especially this drug called "nuke" but then it seems they really want to become this great capitalist empire and control the whole city ?? politics is abandoned I imagine, understandable given the comic relief mayor, The villain (played by Tom Noonan, who made a better version of this in Last Action Hero and who is saying a lot) is an addict, but is still used for this machine . The woman behind it all has a program that is impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> Speaking of twelve, this film has the infamous "Hub" role, this crazy guy who curses and kills people, played by a child actor. I'm not going to be completely moral, it's a free world and if you want a psychopath in your action movie, do it. I don't know how much of the original vision of Frank Miller has been included in this, but the credits recognize it at least as an element of "history". And, if I zoom out, I could see this as a rather interesting character. It's really sad, having a killer maniac child but then again this is the world of RoboCop and who would be surprised? This whole thing with the OCP trying to become this giant monopoly on everything, is really dystopic and good. Furthermore, the idea of ​​RoboCop to get in touch with his wife and son, putting them in some way in history, would also be great, and as far as I can see a logical and natural step if they were to do a sequel to RoboCop now. <br /> <br /> But of course, these are just ideas. As many people have already said, the script is one hundred percent. The boy has a scene (the scene of the torture) in which it is mentioned that in reality it is only a messed-up stereotype, and then we have this unimaginable scene where he is dying and everything becomes soft and friendly towards the tin head. Why not just take his uzi and try to take him down with his last breath? Isn't that what your character would do? Does his life have a second afterthought on his deathbed? Not necessarily, since his last words are "sucks", so why? It makes absolutely no sense, and this can be said of everyone, not everything, in this film. Is there a strike in the police force? IS machine or man RoboCop? What is the deal for turning Robo into this community service machine for 10 minutes? I mean, sure, it's funny enough that I wouldn't deny it. But why build it and then discard it? And why the hell is Allen so abused? and what is it that Weller has the obvious desire to express with his character and yes, well, the threads are many and the chaos is enormous. <br /> <br /> This review is as messy as the movie. The only reason I gave an extra star is because of the actors in the first movie, I'm sure they had good intentions with it. I mean, it's something a little stable, kind of an anchor in this sea of ​​bad movies.
