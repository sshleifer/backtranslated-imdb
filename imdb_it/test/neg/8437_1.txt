This film starts as if it were a comedy. It almost seems that the actors are reading the cues, especially in the sequence of the airport. William Smith plays the role of "Caribe", a hunter, who is rather twisted and unbalanced. Smith always seems to play villains as in "The Ultimate Warrior" (1975) and "The Frisco Kid" (1979) to name a few, although in this film the evil role seems ridiculous. This is one of those movies where things that don't make sense only take place to fill the time on the screen, such as the chase sequence of the girl at the beginning and the long and stupid biker race. I make this 1/10 movie. I would have liked to see this movie on "Mystery Science Theater" would have been fun.
