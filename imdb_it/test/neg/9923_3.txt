<br /> <br /> Very slow and tiring film with an intricate plot. The film's only hope of keeping the public interested is free nudity launched at regular intervals. Ellen Barkin is uncomfortable and her appearance does not hold up when she is on screen with the much younger Peta Wilson. I'm not sure what this movie was.
