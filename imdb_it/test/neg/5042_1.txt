The acting was flat (at least none of the actors sounded like they had just received the script that morning) and the film and sound quality made me think of the 1970s movie of weekly bombs. The only thing that told me it wasn't a movie from the 70s of the week was the reference to DNA testing. But for me, being Eastern Orthodox, the most striking thing about this film ... was the total Romansh of religion. Romania is 88% Orthodox, but you would never know from this film: Father Soren is Irish. And I would have known even if I hadn't seen the actor play the Irish pub, Michael Sullivan in the Star Trek: Voyager "Fairhaven" episodes. The bishop wore Roman vestments (and for the record, not even the Orthodox bishops wear their vestments unless they are saying the liturgy, especially if they live in a monastery). About the only non-Romish paraphernalia I saw was the 3 bar cross on the church door, and even then I had to squint to see it. The first reviewer said the producers had done their research. Well, if it is true, they have messed up the religious aspect of the film.
