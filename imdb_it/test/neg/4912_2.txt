Emraan Hashmi post MURDER has done some good roles in Bhatt's films but the other director has just made use of his kissing and bad image <br /> <br /> AKSAR is one of them and arrived after AAA, JAWANI DIWANI of row and I was already tired of him and of roles like that <br /> <br /> The film has a nice turning point at the beginning it seemed like an Abbas Mustan movie but then it turns into a routine movie with sudden love, sudden jealousy and an ugly climax <br /> <br /> Anant Mahadevan makes a terrible film Music is saving The camera is fabulous <br /> <br /> Emraan Hashmi simply repeats his film of his first films and has 2 expressions in Dino that looks stiff, speaks as if he practiced Hindi and in certain scenes is fine, Udita is inexpressive and irritating
