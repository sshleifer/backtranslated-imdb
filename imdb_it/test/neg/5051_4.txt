The only reason I saw this film a second time was to learn the name of the "second banana" that he played alongside Katie Holms. His name is Marisa Coughlan. Never heard of her before. She is lovely. Captivating. With a lively face and a cute body, he is highly watchable ... He has a real "Poisenality" ... More than a feeling of madness from Grace Kelly ... with youthful exuberance. I think it's Irish in the gene pool, (my favorite female DNA), so it makes sense that it looks like the most beautiful of American Irishmen. The film is irrelevant, Katie Holms is the classic beauty in the flesh. But Marisa Coughlan is the one you follow with your eyes. In 1999, when this film was made, he was about 25 years old in his perfection. This reminds me of another foolish, worthless movie, with the only redemption that is Pretty Girl in it. It was "Career Opportunites" with the first time I saw Jennifer Conoly. Or "Grease II" the first time I saw Michelle Pfeiffer.
