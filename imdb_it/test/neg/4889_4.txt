Ruggero Deodato is often credited for having invented the cannibal subgenus with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST in 1975. But director Umberto Lenzi, usually recognized as a Deodato scam, directed THE MAN FROM DEEP RIVER 3 years earlier in 1972. It is a worthy start for the genre ? Well ... not really ..... <br /> <br /> A photographer accidentally kills a man in self-defense and while retiring in the jungle of an Asian country, he is captured by a native tribe that holds him prisoner, force him to work as a slave, and eventually accept him when he marries the chief's daughter. Throughout the film, I never thought it was a horror movie. It was more reminiscent of a drama, like A MAN CHALLED HORSE, which I liked best. Ivan Rassimov is quite good as a photographer, but it is Me Me Lai as the chief's daughter who is memorable and great. I've always been a Me Me Lai fan since her breathtaking performance in JUNGLE HOLOCAUST and she has never been rewarded for her acting jokes because she barely talks in her films. She is still very talented and charming. A lot of real animal mutilation is the only thing on DEEP RIVER that could make it a horror movie, but even that doesn't work well. <br /> <br /> THE MAN FROM DEEP RIVER is nice to see for those who want to see what started the cannibal subgenus, but as a voice in the genre, it is easily eclipsed by the voices of Deodato and even by the voices later by Lenzi. Recommended only for fans of completists and Me Me Lai.
