There was no 0 in the voting option so I was forced to use the next available figure. <br /> <br /> It is a sad day for Bollywood when this type of film that has leading actors is nothing more than a little youthful acting, and a horrible script. <br /> <br /> This film is nowhere near a Hitch clone. Salman Khan with his usual take-off-shirt theme and Govinda with his humorous laughter. If someone had said twenty years ago that I would write a comment on Salman (after his success with Maine Pyar Kiya), I would have written him / her.
