I'm Mike Sedlak. I co-wrote the soundtrack for this film. And proud of it. <br /> <br /> And I love all the comments. Some haven't gone far enough. <br /> <br /> The film was presented in San Francisco in the summer of 1973. The theater was full of friends and relatives. We have all applauded. <br /> <br /> Five days later, it was extracted from all the screens in the Bay Area. <br /> <br /> If anyone is interested in hearing some scene-by-scene details, which could make the movie even more enjoyable, let me know. <br /> <br /> We could start with the shot in which Gideon Blake throws the plunger of the bath to distract one of the evil henchmen who oversees the radio transmitter on Bud's Casa bridge. <br /> <br /> Or as Gideon released the bomb in the original version. <br /> <br /> It didn't help. It is still bombed. <br /> <br /> Turn it on.
