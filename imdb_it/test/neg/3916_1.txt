Oh dear! oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I like it! <br /> <br /> I love science fiction but this ... um ... the film only puts the gestures of space to shame. Every science fiction movie I saw during the last YEAR was disappointing up to a point, and now I'm seriously reconsidering what kind of movies I like in the future !! (Maybe I'll watch romantic movies from now on!) <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ALERT! (And that's not saying much!) <br /> <br /> This movie is so silly stupid that rivals Battlefield Earth and Baby Genius in pure wickedness. The special effects are obviously fake, the Big Mac Truck seemed lowered with its roller coaster sessions, the killer robots looked like a more idiotic version of the Power Rangers, a huge fat guy gets sucked out of a window hole and before. .. Space Truck School ??? WTF? <br /> <br /> Mr Hopper can do better than this. What was really stinking were the two young, good-looking things that accompany him and run into nothing but their underwear (??) for a full two-thirds of the shot! The obligatory 'sex scene' (snicker!) Among our young heroes it was so poorly kept that I almost choked on my tonsils laughing at the TV screen. <br /> <br /> The only character worthy of mention is the captain of the pirate / cyborg / mad scientist. He exuded the grotesque word and was predictably insignificant, but I think he could have been much more threatening. He does and says things that are quite funny (all the best scenes involve him!) So for the captain I give this film an extra point. <br /> <br /> But this movie is so ugly that it will make you want to launch a TV abuse or maybe throw the TV out the window! It could even kill some brain cells and put you in a catatonic state. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION? I like the way the captain struggles to walk on his wooden leg when he is obviously a fake leg! I would have given 0 out of 10, but since it makes me collapse with its mocking antics ... this movie gets 1/10!
