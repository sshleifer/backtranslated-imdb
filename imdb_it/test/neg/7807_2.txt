Yet another recent comedy that shows that Hollywood cannot even lay the groundwork when it comes to films that it has been making for decades in its sleep. If the writer / director had any brains, he would have based the film around the character of the tyrant Jack Taylor. When it's in the film at the beginning it's nothing special, but it's slightly promising and occasionally fun. Once he has departed for most of the film and Kutcher has his 'hilarious' adventures at home with the guests after the boring guest has fallen, the film totally disintegrates. <br /> <br /> As a result, what should have been a passable timewaster turns into an inept stinker.
