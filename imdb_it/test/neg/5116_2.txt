Looking at all 29 years, Rob Lowe is a detective in charge of a murder investigation. <br /> <br /> When the husband of a woman from the company (Leslie Hope) is found dead, the police suspect the rich may have something to do with it. Rob enters the scene and immediately falls for the beautiful widow even though he claims he is only trying to be "useful". Rob is such a good cop, he can slip some of his incriminating love letters into the pocket of his coat before accidentally throwing them into the fireplace. Monotonous murky drama with an infinite drone of background music. <br /> <br /> This is a great remedy for sleeping if you have finished Sominex.
