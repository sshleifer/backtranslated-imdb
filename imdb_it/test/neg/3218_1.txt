What is the agreement with all these ethnic crime groups that copy films related to the Italian mafia? We all know the Godfather as in Don Vito Corleone, now we have this Mexican that is just a tight copy. I can't understand why other ethnic groups should imitate and imitate Italian mobsters, but it certainly makes them seem silly. They certainly look like Italian wanabee. I much prefer to see Mexicans display their ideas and see their culture, and the way they do it, instead of copying ideas from the The Godfather trilogy. Apart from that, the film was disappointing, seeing the Mexicans acting and trying to be Italian is not my thing. After seeing this, I'm going to see the "real" Godfather, so this movie can be erased from my memory.
