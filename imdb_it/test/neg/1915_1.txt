I'm not sure why I didn't like this movie so much. Maybe I'm too old or too male or too much. Only who was the target audience here? If you are and you liked it, then I'm happy for you. Personally, I found a little bit of a pill. The characters were uninteresting and unlikely, the script was simply embarrassing and some, though not all, of the acting were not inspired. Mawkish, boring and occasionally nauseating - There is certainly something better. <br /> <br /> On a related problem: why is it that every time I see Chris Klein in a film I want to slap him? Does anyone else understand that?
