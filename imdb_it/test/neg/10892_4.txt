Like horror movies, "Rest Stop" could have been better on many levels. The director / screenwriter John Shiban shows that he probably had the best intentions when he started it. Unfortunately, either he wasn't sure what to do with the material, or maybe, he was under pressure to deliver a film different from what he intended, both from the studio and from the backers. Several endings have been included on the DVD, but unfortunately, the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a psycho wandering the back streets of a remote part of California presents many possibilities at first. After Jess's disappearance in the ghostly pause, things get out of hand. Poor Nicole is left alone to defend herself all the odds she finds along the way. <br /> <br /> It was clear when "Amazing Grace" began to be heard in the background that there were forces trying to avenge the ways Nicole and Jess desecrate their neck in the woods by engaging in a carefree sex it is very appreciated by the natives. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk. There is a lot of blood for fans of the genre.
