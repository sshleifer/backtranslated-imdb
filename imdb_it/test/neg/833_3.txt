This is a classic example of what happens when a sitcom is on TV for too long. Everything gets tired and the lines begin to repeat themselves endlessly. OK, from the beginning, the first two series were pretty good. You had an entertainment director (Simon Cadel) chased by his deputy played by Ruth Madoc, a cleaning lady who wanted to become a yellow coat, an alcoholic punch and a Judy man, a bent jockey and a comedian. As mentioned above, it started well but went on too long. Once Simon Cadel left, he went downhill fast, you were getting terrible plots and a new entertainment manager who jumped on Ruth Madoc again (again). When a play is all shot in one place, there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be violated. Unfortunately this went on so long every beat was violated 3 or 4 times. If this comedy had been interrupted after the 2 series, it would have become an all-time classic. As it is, it will be largely remembered for the terrible last few series.
