SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I don't go to high tech movies expecting them to be 100% accurate on everything related to the computer. But somehow, even the average user "I have a computer" should believe that: <br /> <br /> 1) A computer professional with a top secret, special data <br /> <br /> 2 ) is going to keep the primary copy of said data on a floppy 1.44 <br /> <br /> 3) and absolutely NO BACKUP of these special secret data <br /> <br /> Even high school students perform the tasks for goodness. <br /> <br /> This is also the worst representation of a computer nerd ever. Even if she's super cute, we should believe she has no friends, neighbors, an extended family or colleagues who can identify her. Even the non-student had a family that could transform it. <br /> <br /> SPOILER END <br /> <br /> These are not just small errors that have not had any connection with the film - these are the main plot points that have fueled the plot. The characterization was horrible, the plot totally inconceivable, and if you didn't see it, don't worry.
