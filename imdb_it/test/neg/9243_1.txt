Harmony Korine. I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this movie. If you wanted to turn my good morning into a night of disturbing memories of what I imagine has succeeded. <br /> <br /> I know there were big questions raised in this movie like, who we really are, what we're here for, there's really a God. All great questions, but I really don't think it's funny when you have the questions alongside such a tragedy. I'm all for the real life that is portrayed but come on. It is never fun when a wife is raped, someone kills herself (and family and friends find the body) and people die for unexplained and useless reasons. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing about this film was its location was shot. There are many beautiful places. <br /> <br /> I am not a film student nor do I know much about the subject, I admit, but I know when I leave the theater with a feeling of disgust, so it was not a film I would recommend to anyone.
