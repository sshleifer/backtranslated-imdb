For a Norris film this is quite docile. For an action film, it's a bit boring, and as far as predictability is concerned, my friend and I almost made the film. It was nice that the killer's moves hadn't been telegraphed by the clich√©s of the action movies of the 1980s, but come on, the only unforeseeable move challenges the plot and the editing setup. Above all, it is said rather quickly that the murderer (Jack O'Halloran, who is one of the few little-known actors) only kills women. STILL, he suddenly stops his M.O. and kill men, eh? I guess it can be interpreted and rationalized in some way, but why has the film been modified to show that it is going to kill women ?? <br /> <br /> Once again, I'm sure there's a reason (for example to create suspense), but why spend time watching it when many other suspenseful films are far superior. <br /> <br /> "Renegade" fans will appreciate Branscombe Richmond's little cameo like Victor, but his brief appearance can't save the film and even a vote of 4 looks generous. <br /> <br />
