Despite a small handful of well executed scenes, this voice (the fourth) seems tired. Toshiharu Ikeda, who directed the superb MERMAID LEGEND and the seminal Japanese splatter film, EVIL DEAD TRAP, shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise. <br /> <br /> A disbeliever becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porn photo shoot. Stalking, harassment, assaults and predictable rapes follow. <br /> <br /> The basic food of Roman porn is sex. And sex mixed with violence. Both potentially exciting subjects, to be sure, but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh. A masturbation scene in which a woman pencils when opened (with a condom) is too small to be late. <br /> <br /> The rain motif of the series continues and the final scene of the film brings relief.
