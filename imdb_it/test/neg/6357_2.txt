<br /> <br /> As a fan of bad movies (and MST3K and a member of MFT3K), I must say I saw my share of them. But man! Even the worst I saw had at least one soundtrack. While George Lazenby wanders rigidly around Hong Kong, doing who knows what, you can guarantee that you won't be distracted by any of the background music that fills today's cinema. Or any of that music that fills the elevators. I don't think anyone in this movie even just bites. <br /> <br /> Now, this is not entirely true - there * is * a soundtrack. if you listen carefully, you will hear him play half a dozen times throughout the film. Of course, times will be completely inappropriate and won't last very long, but something that could be classified as "music" occurs. The best thing, though, is to sit with your child armed with a wooden spoon in front of the TV with a collection of pots and pans while you watch. Rhythm and flow would be better than anything the film offered. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on Sammo Hung as a little peasant in this movie. Aren't we all happy to have found Jackie Chan to work with?
