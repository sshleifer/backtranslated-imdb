Ants are shown in cartoons as being able to take away chicken legs, watermelons, people, etc. This can be an admirable feature because the ants carry the film Phase IV. This is not because they want it, but because they have to. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a narrator explaining cryptically that a cosmic event has come to earth and that a fellow scientist has worked on the effect this disorder has on the ant population. The film is divided into segments; the first part after the cosmic event is Phase I, and so on until the end of the film, which is Phase IV. <br /> <br /> What is Phase IV? Who knows? We don't see that part; presumably it has something to do with the bond of one of the scientists studying ants and a girl who lived in the area. The girl, who looks like a cross between Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler, is angry with the ants because they killed her horse, but except for an angry explosion, she turns around the biodome with an empty look ("Clueless"?) . /> <br /> These ants are pretty smart; or scientists are rather stupid. I'll give the ants credit. Why? Everything that usually ruins my picnics that can build reflective towers, blow up trucks and adapt to poison with the greatest of ease, is my vow to be the smartest species, at least in this film. <br /> <br /> Sterno says stomp on this anthill. <br /> <br />
