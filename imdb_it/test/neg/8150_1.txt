This film has one or two slightly interesting gags but they are NOT worth the wait. After an inexplicable argument between two guys who collect waste in a drive-in movie theater, let's jump in the family! Hollywood and drive by driving driving their camper van on the screen repeatedly while playing a crazy dialogue. At least I think it's inane, the terrible song that accompanies this montage is mixed so strong that it makes the dialogue almost inaudible at times. <br /> <br /> Finally the camper arrives, at night, at a service station where the family leaves, has another crazy conversation, before leaving. The camera then moves through to reveal the actor we just saw running away. He speaks directly to the camera and we realize that he is the director of the film we are watching and that he talks about him, and how he came to make the film. <br /> <br /> A nice idea that ALMOST (but not quite) makes the previous sequences worth the pain. <br /> <br /> As the film unfolds, it meets the two characters we met by collecting litter at the beginning of the film and all of them forming a film company. <br /> <br /> All kinds of comedy that are not very funny and clumsy come from putting together a crew and trying to collect the money needed to start shooting. <br /> <br /> This film was obviously put together on a string of shoes and a promise and there is a nice idea in here that struggles to get out but the execution is so inept that the idea is lost. Comedy is more than things that fall and everyone talks (or shouts) at the same time. Much of the dialogue here is shouted by several actors simultaneously - Robert Altman can do this kind of thing well because he has a script, rehearsals, decent sound techniques and editing services. All those who were shouting into the microphone, who apparently were hidden in a trash can in the next room, are not clear.
