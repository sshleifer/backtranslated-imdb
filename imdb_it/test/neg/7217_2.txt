If I had never seen the first Road House, then I guess this movie could have another star, but even then it makes it a 3-star movie. Besides, I was really surprised by the relatively high valuation he currently has. <br /> <br /> Actually, I wasn't able to finish this film because it was painful. Where it went wrong (at least the most obvious) is that it is practically parallel to the original, even if the original plot is still referenced. This really doesn't make sense and it doesn't work. Also, acting is weak ... I never felt like I was in the movie, but I felt like I was watching people perform. Even good actors like Busey don't work, probably because of the script or maybe the difficult editing. The strangest thing is that the film looks like a movie from the mid-90s, but it was made in 2006. I'm not sure why, but then again, this seems to happen often with sequels for some reason. The music, the appearance and the whole general feeling remind me of the films you saw 10 years ago on Cinemax late at night. The strangest thing is that I expect Ja Rule to arrive at some point ... it often reminds me of the most current films with rappers as actors. <br /> <br /> The most irritating thing is the love interest The girl who is the character looks like a total rip-off of the Lois Lane character on Smallville, which is also quite annoying. And let's not forget the "southern accents" that seem to me more echoes than I heard from Walk the Line. I realize this is a common place in the movies, but no accent would work better than trying to sound like I'm from that universal place of TV hick where someone from any southern state (or KY and WV) play exactly the same. Of course, people in the desert cities of AZ sound just like people in the southeastern states more than 2,000 miles away. That one wore thin 10 years ago in the B movies where the technique came from. Why do writers / directors make such decisions? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: I would definitely not recommend this if you are a Road House fan or if you like good movies. Also, if you haven't seen it yet, don't ruin it by seeing this version first. The original Road House was one of those accidental classics that people love and watch again and again. It was an unexpected success as American Graffiti, Dazed and Confused, and most recently Office Space, Fast and Furious (only the first!) And Napolean Dynamite. Because they ruined it !!! ??? <br /> <br /> They should never have made a sequel to Road House other than a high-budget version with the right actors / directors. Of course, you can never get past the original (ex: Bad News Bears, The Longest Yard, etc.), but at least if you can do it well you will be presentable as in the case of the examples I mentioned. But to make a low budget, off the net, Road House self-production is criminal.
