Watch this movie ..... just to really appreciate how beautiful the original is. I'm not very hard to please, but this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It hurts a lot, because I like Chevy Chase, Jackie Mason and Dyan Cannon. The writing was simply terrible! I thought Chevy would at least advertise some better things than him. There was almost nothing to laugh about in this film. I went into it wanting to enjoy it. I wanted to laugh but I almost cried. <br /> <br /> In the credits, he read Chevy Chase's Special Appearance. This worried me from the beginning. Chevy is actually more than I thought. It is more than a "special aspect". Too bad the appearance wasn't special. The character of Mason would have been a good secondary character, but he became old as a protagonist. I would have preferred to see more (much more) than Dyan Cannon. At least his character was funny, if not well written. I also missed the free teen sex scene. Mr. Gopher went from being cute and innocent to an annoying rodent that deserved to be blown up. Jonathan Silverman is the only character that interested me and we haven't seen enough. <br /> <br /> I take it back. Try ... looking at half of this movie, then ... remember Alamo, Maine and CaddyShack I.
