From the brilliant mind that brought us "The Exorcist" ... and "Cruise". "Rampage" is unfortunately more similar to the latter. It's a messy movie that has a great atmosphere created for TV. The entire film pretends to focus on the question: "What if the 'Boy Next Door' was a serial killer?" but instead ends up being an uninspired courtroom drama and the meditation on the madness topic and the death penalty that makes little sense. The film is very loosely based on the case of Richard Trenton Chase, breaking down some facts here and there to create a fake character and a different result. One of the main points of the film seems to be the fact that ending the life of a terminally cerebral child and ending the life of a murderer is somewhat similar. "Sometimes you just have to choose", says the protagonist. Yes, sometimes you have to choose to switch off ... from your TV!
