I would like to start with a personal note as a film and television enthusiast, more on the enjoyment side of life: I love what James Woods can and has done, and I always love Melanie Griffith, and Natasha Wagner was very good at this terrible, miserable, smelly "real crime". <br /> <br /> Anyone who has actually written this film, apparently has never spent time talking to real criminals with real criminal talents: yes, some thieves are drugged but have very short careers as thieves. Really successful thieves are rarely caught because they do not "drugs" or drugs before getting a score (job). <br /> <br /> The character of James Woods was faithful to this paradigm at the beginning of this film and then the script was completely destroyed. He turns into an alcoholic and furious madman .... a good job for a boy with high tones like Woods, perhaps, but not at least credible. <br /> <br /> Most criminals are lazy. If they wanted to work, they would work. <br /> <br /> These people in this film are beautiful, self-indulgent and drug addicted narcissist losers. They failed to get a real score in the real world, the real world where a big and sturdy security guard who beats the living hell of a skinny little boy (as happens in the first scenes of this "DOG"), keeps him down and don't let it go. Never. <br /> <br /> How many ways have I found to hate this movie? Lot of. Even totally vulgar people - like most thieves and drug addicts - have a wider vocabulary than these idiots. And the 'rip-off' scenes with neo-Nazi riders? Puhlease. All the rednecks are not neo-Nazis and those that deal with neo-Nazi speed are not really stupid !! <br /> <br /> This film earned a two because Natasha Wagner was extremely good in her role as Rose and because Melanie Griffith still has "that something special", or at least she had it for this brutal and offensive film stupid. I'm not one who commends the real criminals for any reason, but the reality of these criminal types in this horrible film is that they would all die or be imprisoned according to Act 2, Scene 1. Watching a lousy Zombie movie would be the time spent better than this ... what ... and I hate zombies.
