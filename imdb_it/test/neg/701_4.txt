"Riders of Destiny" was the first of several westerns that Wayne created for Monogram Pictures 'Lone Star arm between 1933 and 1935. In this entry, the producers try to turn the Duke into a singer cowboy called "Singin' Sandy Saunders with hilarious results Every Wayne fan knows that the Duke couldn't have sung a melody if his life depended on it. His voice was nicknamed by Smith Ballew whose deep baritone doesn't look like Wayne. Wayne looks embarrassed and uncomfortable in "reciting" the musical Thank goodness, the cowboy singing experiment ended early. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, it contains a standard western "B" storyline about the fight for the water rights between the villain (Forrest Taylor) and the local breeders, the duke obviously plays the hero: he had not yet developed his character on the screen and still looked like a cowboy of poverty. <br /> <br / > In the cast there were also George (pre-Gabby) Hayes the heroine's father, Cecilia Parker as the heroine and Yakima Canutt as "one of the boys" who performs his stunt "falling from racehorses under the wagon" while doubling Wayne. Both Canutt and Hayes would continue to appear with Wayne in most of the other voices in the series. In particular, Canutt would have had a profound effect on Wayne's future development by teaching him, among other things, how to move, fight and appear at ease on a horse. <br /> <br /> Like the "B" westerns, this is not a pity, however, I have to give a negative vote because of the "song".
