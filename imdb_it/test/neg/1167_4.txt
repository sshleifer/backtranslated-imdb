Since playing Lone Wolf McQuade, the actor / stuntman Kane Hodder has been busy. His film, Hatchet, got all the publicity last year, but every year he still has a couple of movies. He should have skipped this. <br /> <br /> Hodder seems to be the king of rings. he starred in Jason Voorhees from 1988, Friday 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988), with Jason X (2001). He's working on a new movie that seems to be a Halloween remake. It is very similar to what I would call the serial killer with his methodical and expressionless thirst for blood. <br /> <br /> However, there was not much blood in this film and very little action occurred on the camera. It seemed like I was watching an episode of real law enforcement officers on A & E. <br /> <br /> I won't blame it entirely on Hodder's shoulders, since the rest of the actors didn't contribute much either. <br /> <br /> Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes, The Devil's Rejects) just made his mouth until Gein closed it. Adrienne Frantz ("The Bold and the Beautiful") was cute. A veteran actress ("Three's Company") and Penthouse Pet, Priscilla Barnes did a credible job. I'm sure there are other favorite horror films, but everyone seems to have simply played their roles.
