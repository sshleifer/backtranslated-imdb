This film is simply stupid. Don't worry about watching it; believe me, you're better. <br /> <br /> Long and short of the plot: a defense lawyer represents a man who killed his son and other children. In defending him, he comes across a wooden doll from Pinnochio. She brings the doll home. Pinnochio is possessed and begins to kill people. <br /> <br /> This film moves very slowly just to have such a weak ending. The plot is very bad and Dennis Michael Tenney's soundtrack is pitiful. The story, written by Kevin S. Tenney, is simply useless and evokes NO horror or fear. This is far from his work on Night of the Demons and Witchboard, which are decent releases but nothing to write home about. His direction is OK, but with such a bad story nobody could have done this movie well. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: 2 out of 10, perhaps the most bland and boring film I've seen all year.
