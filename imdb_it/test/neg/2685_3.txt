This film was, unfortunately, terrible. <br /> <br /> Clich√©t, rigged, sad and reciting dialogues make it almost unwatchable. <br /> <br /> The wellness finale is ridiculously lame. <br /> <br /> There is a reason why Judge Reinhold's career has vanished. <br /> <br /> If you do not live in New York, and you are not Jewish, many of the lines will be inscrutable. <br /> <br /> I also found the need for the unrecognized lesbian daughter to end up being rather offensive. <br /> <br /> I just can't understand how this movie was so popular at film festivals. > <br /> It is, without doubt, one of the worst films I've seen in a long time.
