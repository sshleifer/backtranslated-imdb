Although I liked THE SATANIC RITES OF Dracula (1974) a little, I knew that I should not expect too much from his even more defamed predecessor! Surely the smallest of the Hammer Dracula (Marcus Hearn in the audio commentary of THE CREEPING FLESH [1973] even goes so far as to call it the studio's nadir!), The film actually afflicts because of its total absence - and now embarrassingly dated - update of the myth (the modern setting actually adapts to the SATANIC RITES rather better) ... although, to tell the truth, it is still decidedly preferable to Dreck as Dracula 2000 (2000) or VAN HELSING (2004)! <br /> <br /> Despite Christopher Lee's violent attack on the film, he continues to cut an undeniably surprising figure like the undead vampire (although he looks very small and is inexplicably confined to a context); similarly, Peter Cushing offers his usual committed performance. The only other noteworthy acting job in the film is the one given by Christopher Neame (son of director Ronald) as Johnny Alucard (!) - although this is only because of how incredibly Hammy is! Unfortunately, the two most famous female members of the cast (both horror racers) - Stephanie Beacham and Caroline Munro - cannot overcome their physical attributes. <br /> <br /> The camera is by Dick Bush (who shot THE BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW [1971] and, for Hammer, WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH [1970] and TWINS OF EVIL [1971] - but he is perhaps best known for his long collaboration with Ken Russell) who manages some nice atmosphere everywhere, especially during three crucial sequences: the carriage scuff at the beginning (properly Gothic); the hysterical sequence of the black mass, followed by the resuscitation of Dracula; and the final clash between Lee and Cushing Van Helsing.
