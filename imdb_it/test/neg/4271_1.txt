total disgust. <br /> <br /> I was a little excited to see this as it is the only film version I saw of Mansfield Park. I suffered during the first four episodes but when I arrived at the scene proposed by Henry and Fanny I shot and I had to turn it off. Whoever employs this lady from Sylvestra Le Touzel must be both blind and deaf because the woman is the worst actress I've ever seen in my life. The whole thing is just bad, bad, bad. I do not know. I don't know why the people who write the scripts of Jane Austen seem unable to give their work the respect it deserves.
