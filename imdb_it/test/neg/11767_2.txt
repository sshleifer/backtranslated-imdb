If you can stand campiness, this movie should make you laugh out loud several times. He did it for me, at least. I will mention only one of my favorite elements: the "underwater shots" of the "swimming" fish. Even the sound that accompanies these shots is fantastic. <br /> <br /> One last note: William Katt is actually a fairly respectable actor. I hope another day comes in the sun; watching it as "The greatest American hero" was a fun part of my childhood a couple of decades ago, and since then it hasn't been very visible. He seemed rather depressed in this film. Someone offers him a fun job on a good show, or something like that.
