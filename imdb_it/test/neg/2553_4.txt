I must say that I was disappointed with this film. Although it is well acted and directed, the underlying story simply trudges too slowly. <br /> <br /> Granted, in another mood I would have liked more. I giggled a lot, but I rarely laughed loudly; and there was actually a sense of suspense to find out who won. But in contrast to another film that my wife picked up the same day (neither of them had ever heard of it before) this in comparison. <br /> <br /> If you see a lot of movies, then by all means see this - it's way better than your average rate. But if you (like me) have a limited time and you just want to look the best and the most fun, save this for later. <br /> <br /> [Rate: 7/10]
