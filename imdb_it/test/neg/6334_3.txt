Another sadistic and ultra-bleak revenge movie of the 70s / early 80s ?? Wes Craven has certainly launched a popular trend with his "Last house on the left", although "Terror Express" is more like a rip-off than other scams, such as "I Spit on your Grave" and in particular "Night Train Murders" . Storyly, this film has absolutely nothing new to offer, so the only thing left for director Ferdinando Baldi to do is to multiply the sleaze-factor by a thousand! This is actually just a soft core porn movie that gets a little rough near the end. On the night train from Rome there are three hopelessly imbecile losers. They provoke male travelers and sexually molest females. Things get a little out of control and a traveling prisoner comes to the rescue of a prostitute who continues to be fucked by the three. This is a very docile film and there wasn't even enough budget to buy a couple of fake blood bags. This type of film is generally infamous for brutal rape sequences and discriminatory behavior towards women, but sex in "Terror Express" is not at all disturbing. On the contrary, these 'rapists' spend more time to please their victims and then take a little! The music is fantastic, the dialogues are unintentionally exhilarating and the characters are the most ridiculous I've ever seen. The bad guys are imbeciles and the train passengers are so immobile they seem like part of the set. If you like your exploitation as dirty, this is your movie. However, your hunger for blood and controversy will certainly not be appeased. "Terror Express" should be in the porn video section.
