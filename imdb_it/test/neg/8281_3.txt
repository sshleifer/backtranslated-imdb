This movie is slow. This film is cheap. This film makes Friday 13 seem like a candidate for the best film. Acting is crap. The special effects are disgusting. No one dies for 40 minutes and all the people act badly. The only thing that saves him is the ability to make you laugh at all the stupidity that is happening. The most fun part is watching the heroine "fight" the attacker. She had to be trained but fights like a seventy year old. They spend useless scenes on people who don't die and without scenes on people who die to the point where you don't even know why they're dying. I love coupons, but this is just crap.
