I'm a little scared by some of these reviews that praise A.K.A. Not only do they sound like they were written by the same person, but they contain all kinds of privileged information that you could surely find only by reading the press book from the first to the last page. Please don't tell me that the director is writing his reviews as it would be too sad to contemplate. <br /> <br /> I am afraid of being another one of those who hated the film and was surprised by his unapologetic amateurism. Great idea, too bad for the execution. And it was very disconcerting to see so many good actors (as well as some bad ones including the lead lead), all apparently thinking of appearing in a series of very different films. <br /> <br /> I hope AKA was bold, innovative or just simply interesting. Unfortunately it was like watching a home video unintentionally hysterical with artistic aspirations. A missed opportunity.
