First of all, I refuse to consider this piece of work a music video ... I consider it a short film that uses excerpts from the song "Thriller" in its soundtrack. For me a music video doesn't have to be longer than the song itself, and the song must be played for the entire duration of the video. Calling this a music video is like calling The Great Gatsby a poem. In addition to this ... let's face it ... "thriller" is a boring 14 minutes, including the transformation of the extremely outdated werewolf, the unreasonable poetry of Vincent Price (just because VP plays doesn't mean he's not lame), and the least threatening zombies I've ever seen. Of course, this was certainly a cultural phenomenon, but don't forget it, this also happened at the same time that the A-Team was the number 1 show on TV, so don't give the culture too much credit on that ... Uno l last point on the impact of this film on media on music videos ... what exactly added to the equation that "Billie Jean" and "Beat It" have not already added? From what I can tell, he just added the practice of stopping the song for a few dialog boxes, or an unnecessary dance scene ... so you could say that this whole video was really giving Puffy the inspiration to make more videos annoying. Not really my definition of great
