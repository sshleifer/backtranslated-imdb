After a long night spent at the Islington Walkabout, I needed a thrill. My throat hurt, my wallet was empty and eventually I stopped chatting with an addict at a bus stop trying to sell myself gasoline. Today I saw "Red Sonja" and I can honestly say that I felt much better last night than I do now. Brigitte Nielsen leads a group of ass-kicking warriors of various shapes and sizes to retrieve a green rock from an evil queen whose motives are never fully explained. Yes, it's so beautiful. <br /> <br /> "Red Sonja" is not a genre known for great films until Peter Jackson arrived with a certain Oscar-winning trilogy. In fact, the best sword and spell film I could think of before "Lord Of The Rings" was the "Willow" for the children of George Lucas. Perhaps, in view of this, one should go a little lightly in this film. But I can't - it's badly written, badly performed (with the exception of Paul Smith, who is only average) and put together terribly. The film is as convincing as an episode of the Flintstones, with costumes and sets apparently raised directly by Bedrock. Considering the source material of the comics, it is easy to forgive the various inconsistencies of the plot. Because Sonja insists on saving the most annoying child, in this or that world, it is disconcerting. His personality seems to strike from spoiled brat to gentle gentleman with a touch of switch. Schwarzenegger shows less charisma than a field full of cows and goes through the movements, a perfect actor for his starring role in "The Terminator". <br /> <br /> It's easy to kick a movie when you're down but the fact remains that this isn't a good movie, with any imaginative effort. When Nielsen mourns the death of his sister and Schwarzenegger tenderly lays his hand on her shoulder to console her and then comes out, with that particular Germanic accent, "she is dead", then you know that a hard ride awaits you. Some smiles were raised in inadequate points, like the priestesses of a temple who, when he was sent to fall into a hole in the ground, seemed to enjoy themselves in the experience - at least, judging by the orgasmic moans that seemed to echo around the place. If you have to watch a fantasy movie from the eighties that wasn't porn, look at "Willow" (but never take it like a turnaround). Actually, take yourself to your local multiplex and show Peter Jackson what work he did with "Lord Of The Rings". Trust me, 11 Oscars really means it's a great movie - unlike the bloody "Titanic".
