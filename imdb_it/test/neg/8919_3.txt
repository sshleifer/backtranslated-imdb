Today You Die starts as an honorable criminal Banks Harlan (producer Steven Seagal) is hired by the sinister entrepreneur Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe) to drive a security vehicle with $ 20,000,000 cash in the back from the Las Vegas 'A' point Vegas to the point 'B' he, sounds simple right? Well, Max forgot to tell Harlan that the money was stolen and that he just became the driver of an armed robbery. Bummer. Things still get worse for Harlan when local cops capture him and put him in prison for a long time, however Harlan managed to hide the money before he was captured and with a good $ 20,000,000 up for grabs and missing for Harlan must beware shoulders like criminals want it like government agents do. Harlan joins forces with Ice Kool (!) (Anthony 'Teach' Criss) in prison and both manage to escape at that point Harlan goes in search of revenge ... <br /> <br /> Photographed and directed by Don E FauntLeRoy it must be said that the shooting of straight-to-video action films from Eastern Europe that Steven Seagal specializes these days is not improving, and Today You Die is a good example. This is a terrible film, as simple as that. Producer Danny Lerner's script, Kevin Moore and Les Weldon gives Seagal a new kind of character for his non-existent acting ability, that of a criminal rather than a government agent / policeman / soldier / clich√© of a man of the army that usually plays. In fact, if you were a charitable person, you could say that Today You Die is a rip off of Mel Gibson's excellent thriller, Payback (1998), in which he too played a really unpleasant job with such an effect. While Payback was a superb noir-like action uncompromising and uncompromising thriller, Today You Die has not turned pale. Unfortunately Seagal is terrible here, it doesn't even have a screen presence or threat and the public is never quite sure if it is meant to be a bad guy we hate or not. For example, initially his character is set as a modern Robin Hood stealing from rich drug dealers and charlatans to give to the poor (as well as keeping a good profit for himself) that is just ridiculous in itself but then has Seagal itself it turns and kills a lot of people who contradict the nice criminal with the moral that the film went so far as to put it first. The story is full of holes, for example agent Knowles is contacted by Harlan the pilot and is then scolded by his bent superior to meet him and it turns out that he has discovered it by touching his phone. If so, why didn't his boss use the information he had to capture Harlan? The story is the usual boring predictable struggle for a lot of money with surprise surprise that the government detective is actually a bad guy! Wow, I didn't see it coming. I have to say ... <br /> <br /> Director FauntLeRoy slows down the snail rhythm and today you feel like you go on forever, the action scenes and set-pieces are even seriously lacking in entertainment value. The rare fighting scenes are not great, most are shot in the shadows, cut and assembled very quickly or with the camera behind the Seagal character to try to mask the fact that most of the stunts performed here are doubled . Again Seagal looks fat and out of shape and uses long, wide coats to try and hide it, it doesn't. There is a nice car chase through the streets of Las Vegas in the beginning and I thought that Today You Die could be fine, but it seems that the whole sequence was stolen from another action movie called Top of the World (1997) which talks about a casino robbery in Las Vegas, besides using the filming of that movie Today You Die, also modifies scenes from Charlie Sheen's action movie No Code of Conduct (1998), the action movie by Jean-Claude Van Damme The Order (2001) & the Wesley Snipes based on the action movie based on prison Undisputed (2002), so how much of Today You Die is an original movie is a case. <br /> <br /> Technically the film is fine, considering that it has been edited together from four separate films and that it is really filmed is quite competent and quite consistent. All videos of locations in the United States are obviously raised by the films already mentioned with all the original footage shot cheaply in Bulgaria. By the way, rap style music that sucks Today You Die is terrible. The acting is mediocre and Seagal mumbles as usual. <br /> <br /> Today You Die is a really bad film from other bad action films, Seagal looks old and fat, action scenes are at best average and most of the story is pretty random and in the end it doesn't come at all well. One to avoid unless you are an avid fan of Seagal, if there is such an animal ...
