Alfred Hitchcock made this comedy of mixed marriages in 1941, but his heart does not seem to be there. Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery are the couple who discover that they are never legally married and pass the film mulling over true love. It doesn't have much reputation and it's easy to see why. The jokes are familiar from better films but they don't freeze here. And the contacts are inconstant. Lombard's performance is severed and starched and it is doubly sad to think that she died only a year later. Robert Montgomery seems to know he is in the ear of a sow and tries his most damn thing to make a silk purse without much success. The best performance comes from Gene Raymond as "the other man" (he has a nice drunken scene). This is one of the few really bad Hitchcock movies.
