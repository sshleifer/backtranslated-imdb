To begin with it's a rip off of the Japanese film Battle Royal, apart from the one thing that made the BRs unique, the balls. It is a weak satire at best and as far as the real television phenomenon that attempts to comment well is concerned, everyone knows how distorted and stupid that genre is, why was this film made?
