If you're like me and you enjoy watching awful movies from time to time (I think it's like slowing down in a car accident), you can't do better! The plot is inane, the special effects are hilarious and the acting is among the worst you have ever seen! 4 THUMBS DOWN! WOOOHOOOOOOOO !!! Seriously, I have no idea how the director and "actors" can sleep at night! It's painful, yet hysterically fun to watch and I highly recommend it to those who want to punish themselves for something. If you can watch this shit without making a face, you're a better man than I'll ever be! I wonder if the producer of this junk had any idea what he was doing (and his money)!
