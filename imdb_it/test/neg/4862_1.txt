Funny thing. Charlie Sheen, Donald Sutherland, Sam Waterston and Stephen Lang had incredible performances. Who can forget Sheen as the naive naive of Wall Street, or Sutherland as the cynical Korean War surgeon in MASH? Waterston and Lang also had successful television and cinema careers (Law and Order, Killing Fields, De Niro's Tribeca, etc.). So what the hell would these good actors do in a smelly bomb like this? The plot of a Washington Conspiracy plot is not so bad, not original maybe but not so bad. Sure it was done (seven days in May - a good movie!), But with a little tweaking, it could still have been fun. <br /> <br /> The main problem with Shadow Conspiracy is running. At the beginning of the film Sheen, an extreme political strategist, ridiculously and implausibly solves a potential public relations gaffe by blackmailing a deputy. Later, the shooting with Lang's mute assassin ripping half of what should be Georgetown is explained in the news as "gang wars". Has anyone who remotely associated with this film lived in Washington one day? Sheen is about 20 years too young, very young, to be so old in a White House administration. Sheen's response to avert a political crisis is so extolled by false machismo, he seems to have attended David Hasselhoff's acting school. And when was the last time the group wars spread to Georgetown? We are talking about a section of Washington where citizens voted against the metro stop to maintain exclusivity. <br /> <br /> I agree with another reviewer that this film would have been unbearable without the fast forward button. I recorded it on HBO a year ago and then I took 3 different views to manage it. <br /> <br /> In summary: don't buy this movie. Don't even rent this movie. If you see it in Blockbuster, run as fast as you can.
