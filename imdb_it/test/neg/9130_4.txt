What I hoped (or even expected) was the well-known "stop motion" of images and extreme slow movements, extreme zooms and all the fish eye tricks. In short: the art of a) finding interesting visual events and b) capturing them in a way that the human eye cannot reproduce, so that the human eye can see. The things that made Qatsi's other successes. <br /> <br /> I wondered what the creation of the entire title would be like. <br /> <br /> After seeing the film I had the feeling that the focus in this third part was the message and not the package. Okay, especially because the message is so valid. But I already knew the message, and it seemed that nothing else was left for me. More than half of the film has been solarised or colored or posterized or transformed through another filter. It looked a lot like the effects of the camera, but you never use them. Many images would have been more beautiful without the filters, such as giraffe and zebra. It could be said that "technology or any other malicious source based on man has disfigured our beautiful nature", but why use these effects of the 1970s to symbolize it? To the point that there had been more than 10 minutes in a row of this economic-looking effect I was ready to go. The hope that the rest could not be so bad made me stay. But then there was the slow movement: the slow movement is good because it gives you time to analyze the moving image. But if there are no more than 24 or maybe 50 or 60 frames per second, then there is not enough movement to slow down. Please record the movement to slow down more quickly, as was done with the beautiful shots of the foaming and splashing water (some of the) laughing and the song that the soldiers sang. I recognize that the images in the archive cannot be redone, but I had nevertheless seen a lot of that movie, could have done without them. It must have been a lot of work to search through the archive footage, and the effects may not have been so easy to apply and organize. In addition to this, much of the work has been mixed together. Show that the creator was not out to lengthen the film or to spare himself. But I didn't like mixed things a bit ... The basic idea was sometimes beautiful or even intelligent, but the implementation was insufficient. Computer generated images didn't bother me too much, even if they were obsolete. The "bits" streamed along the circuits (in the first part of the film) seemed more recent and pleasant. Mandelbrot is always fun, the fractal mountain was less. I was pleased to hear a cello playing an important role in music. A little less vibrated at certain times would have been appropriate with Glass's music, but it's a matter of taste. As is all of the above, of course. I hope there will be another Qatsi story to tell soon, where computer images will play a less significant role and will inspire someone to return to the field. <br /> <br />
