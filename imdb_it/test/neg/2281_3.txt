By-the-numbers, Oscar's hungry biopic of the deceased, great singer Ray Charles. There is a - exactly one - big scene in * Ray *. It happens during a flashback to Charles's youth, after the boy became completely blind. Entering the house of the sharecropper who shares with his mother, he stumbles on a chair and lies on the floor. He cries for his mother; she, in line with her philosophy that a person should "stand on her own", silently and thoughtfully observes from the kitchen, waiting to see if the boy can use his own resources. The boy proves to be up to the challenge, using his ears and memory to locate a kettle on a stove, a fire pit nearby, the grass blowing in the wind outside a window, the sinking of a cricket through the plank floor board. <br /> <br /> The film stops here; expands; breathe - even if only for 40 seconds. The scene is a much needed break from Taylor Hackford's otherwise loud movie. By "noisy" I am not referring to music, which is, of course, excellent. I refer to the sound effects (big BOOMS! Which precede the umpteenth flashback) and the inanimate dialect ("I speak to you as a FRIEND, Ray," etc.). From a visual point of view, Hackford is equally and unnecessarily flashy: sepia-colored filters on camera lenses during flashbacks; 360 dervish turns from the camera crane, etc. etc. All modern comforts. What a horrible cinematic style is shown in * Ray *! - a style all too common in the "important" films of the last ten years (Scorsese * Aviator * is stylistically very similar to this film). These gimmicks are used to obfuscate the typical script of the clich√©. Some of us will not be deceived. <br /> <br /> Even some of us are not ready to accept Jamie Foxx's performance as more than a superb mime. Of course, Foxx strangely resembles Ray Charles: he walks like Charles, talks like Charles, and even freaks out like Charles. Fox's imitation of the singer during live performances is technically perfect. I don't embarrass Mr. Foxx with his Oscar; he deserved it. (It was a pretty weak field this year, anyway.) But one wonders if Foxx really does include Charles. The actor reaches a great moment in which he insists on trying the slap his bandmates are raising: he records, even if only for a brief moment, a disgust for the injustice of being blind and a life of darkness. The film seems to want to dramatize the struggle within Charles between the brilliant salvation of music and the oblivion of heroin, with its blindness as a battlefield between these two compulsions. But that damn movie won't take time: it bounces from triumph to triumph, never stopping for a complete view of man. STRETCH must find the dramatic tension; one must provide the drama for the film. In other words, one must imagine a better film than this. <br /> <br /> In his quest for a glorious conclusion, * Ray * introduces, then dodges, several excellent ideas for a film: his first days on the "Circuit of Chitlin"; his daring musical innovations for the Atlantic label; the problem of his addiction to heroin; the inevitable artistic compromises linked to overwhelming success; the importance of man for the struggle for civil rights (touched in the film for, oh, about 3 minutes of the screen) and much more. The directors are too lazy to focus on one of these elements. Two and a half hours of watching a man go through an adversity after another can make us feel good, but such a film is not necessarily a great work of art. This type of approach certainly does not provide a more in-depth view of the subject of the film - and should not intuition be the true objective of a film like this? If I wanted a list of Ray Charles results, I would have simply searched on Google. <br /> <br /> 3 stars out of 10 - the 2 extra stars strictly for music.
