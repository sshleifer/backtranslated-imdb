I absolutely despise this movie. I wanted to love him - I really wanted to. But man, oh man - they were so out with Sara. And the father who lived was rather cheap. This came directly from the Shirley Temple film. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend THE BOOK. It's amazing. In the book, Sara is honorable and decent and does the right thing ... BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT. He has no mischievous bone in his body. <br /> <br /> In the film, it is mean and spiteful. He does little things to get back to Miss Minchin. In the book, Sara is above these things. She resists Miss Minchin. She tells the truth and is not intimidated by her. But she doesn't do the stupid and spiteful things Sara does in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's really quite upsetting to me that so many here say they loved the book and love the movie. I can't help wondering ... did we read the same book? The whole point of the book was personal responsibility, behavior with honor and integrity, ALWAYS telling the truth and facing adversity calmly and with integrity. <br /> <br /> Sara has a happy ending in the book - not the ridiculous survival of her father, but the union with her companion who looked for her. In the book, she is taken by this new father figure who loves and cares for her and Becky. And Miss Minchin is NOT a chimney sweep - that part of the movie was really stupid. <br /> <br /> Seeing all this praise for this unfortunate movie disturbs me. Are we praising a film that glorifies petty and spiteful behavior with some tip of the hat to kindness? Sara in the book was kind to bones and full of integrity. I don't even recognize her in the movie ... she's not in it. <br /> <br /> Good thing Mrs Burnett is not alive to see this horrible thing. The title of his book is horrible and undeserved.
