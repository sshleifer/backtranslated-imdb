Gamera vs Viras has been done lazily and largely suffers as a result. <br /> <br /> Space aliens try to conquer the Earth and are stopped by Gamera. Then they send another ship that manages to kidnap two young boys. The aliens then take control of Gamera and urge him to attack humanity. <br /> <br /> First of all I must say that I really enjoyed the monstrous fight between Gamera and Viras. Viras looks like a big squid with a beak. It does not have any energetic weopon and does not shoot any rays, but it can close the slopes on its head to make a pointed and sharp weopon. SO, in general, this is not a bad monster for Gamera to fight and it's decent. Viras seriously injures Gamera by stabbing the underside of his shell with his pointed head and I am surprised that Gamera managed to survive. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Gamera vs Viras decided to use the footage from previous Gamera movies to fill the time for this film. They show the battles between Gamera and Barugon and Gamera and Gaos when the aliens look at Gameras' past battles. However, when they show Gamera's battles with Gaos, they show the battle between Gamera and Gaos first, then show the final battle between the two. After showing the reused footage of the final battle between Gamera and Gaos, they show the FIRST battle between Gamera and Gaos !!! Talk about showing battles in non-chronological order. There was not even a need to show the first battle they should have stopped after showing the final battle between the two. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that they decide to show footage of Gamera attacking cities when the aliens order them to attack Tokyo. Then they show the scene from "Gamera vs Barugon" where it destroys the dam. After the scenes of the show of "Gamera The Invincible" which is a big problem for me. Mainly due to the fact that "Gamera The Invincible" was in black and white !!!! Using archive footage from a black and white film in a color film is really lazy and not a good thing. <br /> <br /> Even the dubbing is bad again. The two kids aren't that annoying, but it would be nice to see a Gamera movie that doesn't involve young children. <br /> <br /> So the overuse of footage from other Gamera Films is a deterrent to this movie. The final fight is fantastic, so basically I recommend jumping to the last ten minutes and watching this movie. The rest is something that has already been seen before.
