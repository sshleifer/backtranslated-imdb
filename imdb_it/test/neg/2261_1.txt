Alexandra Ripley wrote a horrible sequel to Margaret Mitchell's book of masterpieces published in the 1930s. The heirs of Margaret Mitchell have exhausted their rights and for large dollars allowed Alexandra Ripley to write a piece of junk book even worse than Barbara Cortland's pink novels. I was a big fan of Margaret Mitchells' book and Alexandra Ripley's fake sequel was written only for cash for money. <br /> <br /> Although I have always admired the acting talent of Joanne Kilmer and Timothy Dalton, this is a really terrible film. The script is horrible and full of clich√©s. Ann Margarets cameo as Belle Watling is so horrible that I wanted to slap her. <br /> <br /> The only thing worthwhile in the film is Sean Bean who gives a masterly performance in the role of the sexy, ferocious villain - Lord Fenton. Sean Bean's performance is along the lines of "The Man You Love to Hate" and portrays an unsafe sex symbol. <br /> <br /> But Sean Bean is only in the first half of the movie so you have to be tormented by watching an incredibly long 6-hour movie with an unbearably boring script. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on this movie, unless you are a passionate fan of Sean Bean and watch it for its wonderful performance.
