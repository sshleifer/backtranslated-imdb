Synopsis: Los Angeles in the future. The crime is kept in check by Core Trackers, android killers sent by the United States computerized justice system to execute the culprit. Secret service agent Eric Phillips prevents an attack on his boss, Senator Robert Dilly (the man who created the USCJS), from the Union for Human Rights, a group of anti-machine activists. Dilly attempts to start Phillips in his private circle, but the SS agent goes on the run after seeing Dilly kill a cold-blooded UHR agent. Dilly sends Core Trackers after him. Phillips joins the UHR group and helps them discover a conspiracy that involves Dilly. <br /> <br /> "Cyber ​​Tracker" is the first in a series of science fiction / action hybrids directed by Richard Pepin, co-founder of PM Entertainment, a breeding ground for action films in the 1990s. Other Pepin films include "Hologram Man", "T-Force", "The Silencers" and "Dark Breed". Pepin's films generally start with an important action sequence that lasts about 10 minutes before allowing the plot to kick off. Does this film's script have any holes in the plot ?? it is never clear what the conspiracy the heroes are trying to stop. As for acting, Don "The Dragon" Wilson can be tough but can't act for beans, with little charisma. His co-stars are much better. The best bet of the film are the action scenes, which generate an impressive artillery fire, a huge number of corpses and not one but three moments when a vehicle flies through the air, flips over and hits the ground, exploding. The border of visual effects on the economic side and the musical score is low and high.
