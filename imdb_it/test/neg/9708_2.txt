Well Wright may have made a stark description of life around 1800 - as he repeatedly and repeatedly proceeds because of when it was written contrary to the publication - but it is not his Austen and should not claim to be an adaptation. br /> <br /> Mrs Bennett looks like a rural washerwoman. This is a spoiled woman - do they have servants (remember the scene of the book with the servant dressing up his hair, etc.)? But Wright portrays her with rough and red skin on her chest, rough hands and work in the kitchen. And the pigs roam! If you want bucolic, you should try Tess. <br /> <br /> Mr Bennett - the script is too soft and modern and ignores its weakness. The scene where Mary stops playing should make you shudder - don't go in a few seconds. If it doesn't, don't include it. <br /> <br /> MacFadyen is very weak in the part and seems to be doing some sort of pride with the numbers. The first proposal looks like a nervous schoolboy rather than a man who overcomes his pride to make a proposal under his station. Many of his jokes, he could even read a shopping list. <br /> <br /> Lydia is horrible. Completely over the top with screams and excessive jumps. Indeed, Knightley plays Elizabeth more like the ridiculous foolish character that Lydia is actually in the book at times. <br /> <br /> Ed Elizabeth. Half the time when Knightley clearly imitates Ehle's voice and intonation, close your eyes to see what copy it is. And in his role we see Wright's biggest mistake - THERE IS NO INJURY. <br /> <br /> From the first meeting with Darcy she clearly imagines it. When he comments on Bingley the attractiveness of the women in the room initially seems hurt - not shocked and offended. The latter should create the injurious side of things. And when she's caroline they jump around the room, she runs into a provocation, obviously on him. And by cutting out Wickham virtually there is no way that Elizabeth has invested enough there to fix the damaging aspects of that relationship. <br /> <br /> And apparently it's Caroline, not Miss Bingley. And Mr. Bingley happily wanders into Jane's room. And and e - Wright can boast of how big he is with the period he wants. But some panoramic shots of rural life (which show preference for Hardy) do not excuse him for the dazzling flashes everywhere. <br /> <br /> The director of photography - who clearly wants awards - should have been stopped He veered between Bronte and Hardy throughout the film - and wasn't Tess's last filming / lighting proposal? The need to see Darcy walk around the "scapegrace with the scruffy shirt was just stupid. But above all - when you go between those two very different landscapes, you forget the most important one - Austen. (He would have laughed aloud to Elizabeth = sad, so rain, running towards the picturesque madness, Darcy's wet garbage.) I admit that I found it impossible to watch the movie without using the book as a context. I was ready to give it a margin of maneuver as it had to provide the story in a short amount of time. "But completely forgetting half of the book's core in prejudice and Darcy's seeming increasingly constipated and proud, made it almost unwatchable. I could only see it as a mess with generally mediocre shows (when Knightley wasn't mimicking Ehle was churning or hopping or both and she just calmed down a couple of times to indicate that she has some promise - but she cheers for the swings to convey the emotion it's not a substitute for a poor screenplay and bad direction - though for some it was simply a case of bad screenplay. <br /> <br /> Only Tom Holland would have escaped censorship. While he softened Collins' comic aspects, he turned it into a very interesting approach. Dench magnificently makes the crash he can do in his sleep, whether he is here or in Oscar Wilde - but he had to be Lady Catherine De Bourgh NOT Lady Bracknell. It was just a little too healthy. <br /> <br /> The reduced length could have been managed by a competent scriptwriter, surely? Not characters that fill the gaps in history and help the public everywhere. Elizabeth could not have invented the Â£ 10k figure. And while they wanted to cut time with her, learning about Darcy's involvement in Wickhams's wedding, the lines did not match Lydia. It was the worst case of incongruous exposure in the piece. <br /> <br /> It's really a scary thing. Anyone who reviews it saying that it works well in the context of the book is someone I honestly don't believe has read or understood the characterizations of the thing. Wright seems to think that his characters are in the 90s and not in 1709 from their behavior. I am not convinced that he has read the book - he certainly does not understand it. He doesn't understand the bitter wit or the lightness of Austen's touch - he certainly made it a boring film. <br /> <br /> What is perhaps worse was the sad pathetic need for chick lovers to need 'I love you, I love you on all sides, so they can sigh and go down. The fact that he has no place in Austen's work is apparently irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Anyone reviewing it as a movie by itself? Well, it's harder for me, except for noticing the poor acting, the weak Darcy and the whirling skipping the unheard-of irritation of the whole thing. If you're going to adapt, you can change a lot - but if you lose the spirit and the key motivations, then don't insult the book by taking the title.
