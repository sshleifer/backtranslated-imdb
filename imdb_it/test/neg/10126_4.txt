For a series that was inspired by Kolchak, it is ironic that the first attempt at X Files in a vampire episode should land on his ass. 3 has always left me puzzled and - at the risk of sounding like the terrible Hans Keller - I have often wondered if I miss the point. The plot looks like a puzzle that has pieces that don't match the box, and the result is that you are spending a cozy evening by the fire trying to match the sky that is really sea. This incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you revisit the episode and it doesn't matter how much attention you give. I know this review puts me in danger of being dragged to Whitby by teenage vampires who drink my blood while listening to Busted, but it's a risk I'm willing to take. I've always been a werewolf too.
