This film was absolute garbage. The director and the stars (?) Should be banned from making films forever. The plot as subtle as the plot concerns an unbalanced director played by a squalid director (who now plays) Internet advertising for women who act in a snuff movie. <br /> <br /> There is no horror, the girls seem extravagant and bored, the direction is useless, the music is out of place (heavy metal in a library scene?), and the lighting is horrible. The director should have cashed another pair of shopping carts full of aluminum cans for a script, sober actors and some light bulbs. As it is, this is a disgusting, bad mess, worthless of a movie.
