There is an endless supply of trash horror movies. It seems that people never tire of trying to scare and excite. Unfortunately, very rarely these attempts are successful. This unlucky movie has almost no ransom value. The story is highly predictable, most of the actors are very uninspired, or simply a mixture, very low quality special effects. It took a lot of effort not to turn the DVD off and go to bed. With such a limited number of foreign films released in the United States, because in the world someone would like to import this drivel. To complete it all, it seems there is an "Anatomy 2", for those who have nothing better to do. I'd rather watch the paint dry.
