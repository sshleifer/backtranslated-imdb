First of all I'm a gay, even if I don't live my life in the so-called "Community", and it's because of films like this that Gay-themed movies are not my favorite genre because 90% of them are sucks. Like this. If I could give this zero I would do it. (I don't understand all the positive comments, unless they were all made by people who made this film.) I actually stopped him at the 24th minute when the so-called "Anthony" straight kissed Adam out of the restaurant for no reason. . And how's the son stealing from the restaurant if he doesn't even live in the city? Transfers? The acting was HORRIBLE! Sound editing? (Listens to "Anthony" and Adam when they are sitting on the fence eating their lunch. Whenever the camera passes between the two so-called actors the sound changes, as if there were no filter on the microphone) Seriously not renting, oh God don't want to, buy this movie. Horrible horrible horrible acting and just a stupid plot.
