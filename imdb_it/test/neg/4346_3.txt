Not "confusion" in the sense that, "Gee, this film is really complex and therefore difficult to follow!" But confused in the sense that, "Gee, this movie really has no idea what it's doing!" <br /> <br /> DREAM OF A WARRIOR is a collaboration of Hong Kong / South Korea, but it's all nonsense. A film about parallel universes mixed with time travel has mixed with the love story mixed with nonsense. <br /> <br /> The film has the kind of mind-bending concept. Once again, the mind does not fade because it is so large and complex, but it exaggerates in the sense that it is so ridiculous and one cannot conceive of anyone having ever had such a horrible premise to begin with. <br /> <br /> Nothing in DREAM OF A WARRIOR makes sense, and it's because the whole movie should never have been made. It's pretty awful. The only thing that saves is the actress who plays the warrior woman (not the female protagonist). <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
