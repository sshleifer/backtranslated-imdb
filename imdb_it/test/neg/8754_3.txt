Hollywood has had a long love story with fake stories of A Thousand and One Nights, but few of these products have stood the test of time. The most memorable were the films of Jon Hall, Maria Montez, who have long since become a field. This is full of dubbed songs, anachronistic jargon and slapstick. It is a truly generous crop of Mesopotamian corn, and today it is quite intolerable. He was named for his fanciful special effects that are almost imperceptible in this day and age, consisting mainly of make-up photography. The only positive feature that survives is its beautiful color and its clarity. Sad to say, among the many films made in this genre, few of them reach Alexander Korda's "Thief of Baghdad". Almost every other Arabian Nights movie is superior to this, though. He is a loser.
