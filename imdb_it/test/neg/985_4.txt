The most general and superficial biography you could hope for. Busey's interpretation of Holly is accurate, but who wants to listen to Gary Busey sing "Maybe Baby"? Typically, members of the Hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama (respectively Smith and Stroud) rather than as characters or characters. When Holly uses a string section, the old-looking Hebrew-looking guys tell him he is using the same techniques as Mozart. It is precisely this kind of blatant affirmation that makes film biographies like this (and "Amadeus", on the aforementioned Mozart) so useless. Some types of entertainment can be derived from the excellent styles and songs of Holly made in a variant B.
