Right (or down) there with Toys and Jurassic Park 2 and The Phantom Menace. <br /> <br /> The premise sounded interesting, some commercials looked semi-promising, but alas, the whole movie had about 30 seconds of sharp shots, and this was shown on the small screen's 30 second slot. <br /> <br /> If you want to write amateur, second-rate effects, ridiculous costumes, and a complete snoozefest look at all costs. The plot is recycled sci-fi fodder. Even too bad, because on entering I thought it would be bad but I kept hope. It could be the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - Don't watch it. <br /> <br /> Unless you have preferred one of the 3 previous films.
