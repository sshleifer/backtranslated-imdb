First, how can someone with his creativity on the right side believe in a film like this. I saw this movie and after the end of a couple of hours it was left to scratch my head, what exactly is the director trying to say. <br /> <br /> If it is a thriller, there are no emotions, if its action, there is no action excluding a sequence of chases, there is no drama, and the much touted love story , in reality it never takes off. No passion, no emotion. <br /> <br /> Actually I never expected wonders from the movie, however after opening the bumper, I thought I'd give it a chance. I have no problem with Himesh Reshamiya, and I'm not one of the guys who will beat him at every opportunity. I entered with an open mind and came out with a closed one. <br /> <br /> We do not blame Himesh Reshamiya, he is just a novice actor. But the direction, the script, the writing, the trick, all went for the launch. <br /> <br /> Himesh is very stiff and would take a long time to climb the curve. Can do the kind of role of don. Hansika is just a little girl, and shows her fat baby and the way she walks on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only actor who was good was Himesh's friend in the film, I don't know his name, but he looks promising. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk, it's not even nice to watch it for a view of time. <br /> <br /> ** I highly recommend avoiding this movie. **
