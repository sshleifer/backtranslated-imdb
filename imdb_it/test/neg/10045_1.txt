I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was horrible; it was useless and simply stupid. the alleged plot concerned a future groom too involved in world problems to relate to his wife and other people in his life. He disappears on his wedding day (in a tuxedo no less) and connects with an assortment of strangers. <br /> <br /> We saw it with a load of people arriving in Atlantic City and everyone agreed it was a terrible movie. He was trying to be deep but he wasn't; it was stupid and offensive. If I weren't on a bus, I would have gone out on the movie. Anyone thinking of seeing the movie or renting or buying the video has been advised.
