I assume that I was actually expecting a Bollywood remake of "The Fog", titled, but this is actually more of a Bollywood remake of "I Know What You Did Last Summer", with some elements of "Scream", like, a little, and not very good. Apart from a couple of numbers of songs and very funny dances, this is pretty awful. Obviously it has a decent budget and yet it is wasted on heated leftovers that were not so tasty at first. A young woman is threatened by a creepy guy for not entering a beauty contest, because she wants her sister to win (she, fortunately, doesn't look as scary as her brother), but she comes in anyway and wins, and obviously the guy creepy follows her and is killed, after which comes a compelling game of "hiding the body". Of course, the body disappears and nobody seems to know why, but someone knows it, and they are waiting for the end to reveal a ridiculous twist. Interspersed with all this tired rehash are some numbers of elegant dance, in particular the number celebrating the dance for Simran, the girl who won the beauty contest ... it's very colorful, it's well done and definitely fun, and completely wasted in this terrible movie. I'd rather watch an old Ramsay brothers movie than this piece of shit, even if someone felt that these shouldn't be made available, for the most part, which is a crime in itself. But not as bad as this movie. I took one for the team that is watching him, so follow my advice, don't bother. 2 out of 10.
