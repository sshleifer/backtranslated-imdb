Crazy Six is ​​torture, it must be Albert Pyun's worst film. Even Blast and Ticker are better! I can't believe how boring this movie is! How has this even been brought to light? I saw this movie about 3 years ago and the only thing I remember is how bad it was. This is not a bad movie, it's just a bad movie, bad, bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10 (½ on *****)
