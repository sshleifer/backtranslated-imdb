I had seen it on Italian TV as a child and I remember being fond of it - in view of its mix of live-action with animation; however, at the time it was universally messed up ... and, recovering it again after all these years, I have to admit that the critics were right! <br /> <br /> What must have seemed wonderful in the eyes of a child is actually very badly done, not to mention boring for a fantasy adventure; fatally, both the stars (ex-Angry Young Man 'Richard Harris) and the director (the action expert Hunt) do not adapt well to the material! At least, the soundtrack of Michel Legrand (with the lyrics provided by screenwriter Don Black) is useful - if not really inspired. Among other things, a number of well-known personalities are present among the dubbers of this British-Belgian co-production (Julian Glover, Bessie Love, Murray Melvin, Robert Rietty, Vladek Sheybal, Graham Stark and, this is his last film work , Michael Bates). <br /> <br /> While the essential points of the plot of the classic novel by Jonathan Swift ("giant" Gulliver becomes the pawn in a war between the small people of two neighboring countries and, on the run, ends in a land of true giants) emerge here, it is made on a strictly kiddie level (with stereotyped characters however, fortunately, little intrusion of the comic / romantic variety) - which makes the whole enterprise somewhat useless, outside of its intrinsically experimental given nature that Max and Dave Fleischer had already made a splendid comic book version of the book back in 1939!
