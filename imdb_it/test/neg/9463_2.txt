I know this film is a low-budget horror film aimed at those in favor of "cheap" shocks, but also considering that this film is too boring, full of an inconsistent plot, along with horrible music and obvious signs this film has never been finished. <br /> <br /> Without giving spoilers, I will simply say that with the final reel, things are wrapped up without any explanation, neither by film nor by narration. The Anitra girl is really attractive, but it's still not a good reason to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of those gore movies of the 60s and 70s, then you should watch it, but I warn you that it doesn't even reach the usual plateau of this type of film.
