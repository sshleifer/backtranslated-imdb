Debra Winger's "Black Widow" from 1987 is MUCH better. <br /> <br /> This is like a lame version, and Jane Seymour usually does better. <br /> <br /> Even Chad Allen is rather poor in this. I was just playing his usual role as a boring, rebellious child. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the fact that they were both from Dr. Quinn should have turned us on. <br /> <br /> If it's on, go get a copy of "Black Widow".
