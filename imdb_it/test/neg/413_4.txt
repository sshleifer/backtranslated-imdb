Recension: Angels & Demons <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Ron Howard. He has also made famous films like The Da Vinci Code and Cinderella. He also directed the famous TV series 24. The most famous actors are Tom Hanks (The Da Vinci Code, The Green Mile, Forrest Gump, ??) and Ewan McGregor (Cassandra's Dream, Moulin Rouge, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace , ??). <br /> <br /> At first I was shocked because they changed the beginning from the movie so big. Because they changed Vittoria Vettra's father (Ayelet Zurer) into someone else, Silvano Bentivoglio (Camren Argenziano). Another change is that Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) never goes to CERN. It was nice to be able to film on site at CERN. <br /> <br /> Then the film continues, They are spectacular car races in Rome. I also really like the part in Chirstian Archives when they destroy Galileo's work, it was fun. It was also amusing that when they were locked up in the archives the second time they entered, Robert Langdon destroyed half of the archives and when they came out, the electricity came on ?? <br /> <br /> I found it very stupid that Robert Langdon did not go by helicopter, but that the Chamberlain (Ewan McGregor) enters alone, another detail is that in the film the Chamberlain is an adopted son of the Pope . In the book He is the real Son of the pape. <br /> <br /> When I should give the best acting performance then I should say Pierfrancesco Favino who plays Inspector Olivetti. The worst acting was the murderer, who was played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas, I think it was unconvincing, because in Adams Apples he played Faboulous. <br /> <br /> I think the whole movie is underfunded because director Ron Howard has made some many stupid changes. I would rate the 4/10 film.
