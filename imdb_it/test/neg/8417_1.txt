All right, enough. Whenever I think I've seen such a crazy movie, so bad anyway that I think nobody can ever find something to praise, I just go to IMDb where I'm greeted with the usual "Undiscovered masterpiece" "GREAT film" I mean, honestly, what movie are you watching, because it's certainly not the mess I've just seen on the new Fox / MGM / UA DVD. There are about three funny lines and a plot that inconsistently brings new meaning. And then, after ninety-three minutes, he stops and the final credits begin. Then there is another scene. The DVD is quite miserable, which fits the movie. The material of origin is almost completely faded in an ugly brown color. It is hard to imagine that this film has followed Get Carter. Critics and the public had this right at the time - it was foiled and a box office disaster, and rightly so. But you experts keep trying. And I will continue to try to find a film that DOES NOT HAVE ANYONE that excites him.
