Oh boy! I really destroyed Manhunt in space. I think this flopper deserves to be worth worse than Manhunt. It's not going anywhere and the growth of mushrooms has been more exciting than this tripe. <br /> <br /> Poor Cleolanta. It is so misunderstood. Fortunately, the complacent rock companions Winky does not talk about his "gay nightlife". There is much more to talk about, a really horrible space marriage (to look at) on the rocks and scraps of poor spatial effects. So, there's Bobby. Decide who's more annoying: Bobby or the Winkster? Personally, I hurl them from a balancing chamber into a black hole not before subjecting them to murderous meat that eats alien mutants. <br /> <br /> At least there is Vena. She's just a cosmic girl!
