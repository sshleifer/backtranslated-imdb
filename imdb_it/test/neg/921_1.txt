How did I deserve to watch this cagata ??? The worst ever. The acting was horrible, when I read that this was a comedy I at least expected to smile, once or twice, but .... If you want to lose an hour and a half of your life, this is the right movie. I suggest you look at a wall or something, anything else, but watch this "movie". Yoy can also watch a documentary (if you are a boy) about pregnant women, I guarantee it will be more fun :) The actor in this (I forgot his name) is not so bad, and I am surprised how much role was accepted . Anyway "I want someone to eat cheese with" is the right movie if you want to punish someone.
