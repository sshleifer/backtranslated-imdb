And obviously I haven't seen it! <br /> <br /> But looking at the cast and seeing that Doug Masters is back from the dead, now I know I avoid this like the plague! I hate it when Hollywood, the producers, the writers, the directors or all of the above think that the public is stupid and does not mean continuity errors. A presumed dead Doug Masters returning is a giant giant, isn't he? <br /> <br /> And I can't believe that someone like Louis Gossett, Jr. would come back for something like that. <Br /> <br /> Has Jason Gedrick really rejected this? Well, I hate to say it, but even if he resumed the role, he would still have the same error of continuity. I bet that (if he really refused it), he must have been incredulous seeing that his character died in the second movie. <br /> <br /> I will probably catch it on some late night air on some channel, but in no way am I going to rent this or buy the DVD!
