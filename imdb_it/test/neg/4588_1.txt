The hockey game I play and watch has something called "speed" that the real hockey scenes in this soft film never get close to capture. Add to that a plot that is clich√©, predictable and more stupid than stupid with some of the lightest 80s music that numbs your senses in every scene and you have "Youngblood". Oh, Keanu as a French Canadian, yes, whatever. Give me Dunlop, Braden and the Hansons at any time ... ONE out of ten.
