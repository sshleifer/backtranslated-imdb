This was by far the worst movie I've ever seen. And this is comparable to Alexander, Fortress 2 and The new world. <br /> <br /> I should go back to the blockbuster and ask for my money back along with the compensation as it was a really traumatic experience. For the first ten minutes I was changing the zoom on my widescreen TV because the actors seemed to be off screen. I didn't think it was possible to make such a bad movie in this day and age, I was wrong. While writing this message, I thought of a good reason to buy this movie. A joke gift at Christmas. I'm blaming the lady for this as she chose it, thanks darling. <br /> <br /> Be careful ....... A true all-round shocker !!!!!!
