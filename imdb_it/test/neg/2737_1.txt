This film is a great movie ONLY if you need something to sit down and laugh at its stupidity. As a geologist, this film gets most of the wrong facts and uses actors who are too young to be considered at the top of their fields. It is interesting how you show the lava that spits into huge caverns below the earth's surface. It's also funny how seismically active areas show massive destruction from a 6.5 magnitude earthquake. They seem to forget that construction standards in these areas would be higher and that a larger earthquake is needed to do so much damage. It's also as fun as the shoreline of Washington and even Oregon are to look like they are beautiful beaches in southern California. The Jelly donut analogy is a lot of fun even if the way it is used is wrong. The director does a good job adding more comic relief with the 2 doctorates "above".
