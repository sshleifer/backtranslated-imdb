Holy shit, the beginning has picked up the point where the first one was interrupted (good start). Then it goes downhill from there. It looked like you were watching TV and kept switching between this teenage soap opera, a Predator movie and a lousy detective show. The characters that are introduced in the first ten minutes have nothing to do with each other until about the last 45 minutes (the characters of the teenage soap opera and the current story of Alien). <br /> <br /> Then in the end the producers were quickly running out of money and decided to close the film so they decided to launch an atomic bomb in the city. <br /> <br /> PS- How disgusting is the deal with the cameras that are so enlarged you can't tell what's going on? Seriously, the filmmakers do a good job with fighting scenes and get to where we can see the fight.
