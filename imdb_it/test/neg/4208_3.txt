In terms of quality films, this is not one of them. It's actually the first Chuck Norris movie I saw and I was pretty disappointed. The fighting scenes are slow and don't have much variety. Norris only uses a lot of round kicks on all the baddies that follow him, which makes fights rather boring. The film is also quite short, but for some reason the film doesn't even seem to be finished when it ends. It is a rather anti-climatic ending. Anyway, I've seen a lot of bad movies, and this isn't one of the worst I've seen. Worth a look, I guess especially for Norris fans. There is nothing better than to see a group of rigs hurtling through the desert which I think is the highlight of the film.
