This is, in itself, an above average film, but why was it made in the name of Bog? It is impossible to treat it as a stand-alone thing because it is an almost shot remake for a 1960 Alfred Hitchcock classic. You can't watch it without the 1960 film that touches your conscience. <br /> <br /> What does "credit" mean? How can we attribute to Van Sandt and his associates something different from deciding to use different actors, sets and slightly different colors? <br /> <br /> Anne Heche is attractive but Janet Leigh's stolid determination to become a respectable female bourgeoisie is missing. And Heche is younger than Leigh, which led to his unsuccessful attempt to marry and settle, the desperation of a woman facing forty. And Heche doesn't project anxiety like Leigh did. The scene with the CHP officer watching in the car window illustrates the weakness of the role. In the original, the officer asks, "Is something wrong?" Leigh: "Of course not, am I acting like something was wrong?" The officer hesitates before answering: "Well, frankly yes." The exchange has been omitted from the remake for the simple reason that Heche is not nervous enough. <br /> <br /> The worst change, no doubt, is Vince Vaughn's replacement with Anthony Perkins. It may not be Vaughn's fault. Who could match Perkins in the role? Perkins is nervous, like a bird, with a long neck, cloaked in an aesthetically fascinating exterior that masks an inner emptiness. His every move (eating corn candy, with his Adam's apple swinging) and every expression, the faint laughter, the dry laugh, is apt. It cannot be improved. Vaughn brings to the role the presence of a short-haired muscular guy who has just been released from a US Army corporal Lance. To suggest his psychosis all he can do is superimpose a maniacal giggle on top of what appears otherwise a perfectly normal Norman in word and manner. (Unlike the original Norman, Vaughn doesn't even stumble upon the word "fallacy" because it looks like "phallus"). He could just be around the motel waiting to hear about his UCLA football scholarship application. <Br /> <br /> The management deserves some comments. I don't see what it adds to the story when we see Norman masturbating while he peeks over Anne Heche. I have no goal. I wonder why he's there, just as I wonder why the rest of the film is there. <br /> <br /> And, I suppose, to impress you with how much color you add to the visual experience, Van Sant seems to have lost some of the finer things than Hitchcock. Heche is given underwear of all different colors: green, pink, orange and - mango? Is it a color? If so, what the hell is color? It does not matter. The point is that in the original, when the camera for the first time peeks through the Phoenix hotel window, he captures Janet Leigh in bed wearing a pure white half slip and a white bra. Later, after he stole the money, we see her in underwear again - this time both briefs and bra are black. This is a small thing, but Hitch's. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​shooting in color may not have been bad, except that the black and white shots of the original were exceptional. The color and the strange light effects in this version transform the ordinary, boring and subliminally sinister motel into something that seems to belong to the most sugary part of Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Above all, the 1960 film was shocking in more ways than one. I remember seeing him on a drive-in in San Diego and watching the screen in amazement when it became clear that the central character was actually DEAD - in the middle of the movie! Nothing like this had ever been done before. <br /> <br /> That murder in the shower, in both films, was a great improvement over Robert Bloch's original novel, by the way, in which the author writes something like, "The killer came into the bathroom and cut off the head with a knife. "I'm not making this up. Well, not entirely. Here, too, Van Sant's film gives us excesses. There is more blood and more naked flesh. And where Hitchcock had first closed on the blood surrounding the bathtub drain and dissolved in Marian's wide-open eye, then slowly pulled the camera back to reveal his face, turned his camera lightly inclination towards the correct vertical, giving the viewer a sense not only of disbelief for the murder, but of a dizzying disbelief. Van Sant does not tilt the camera 10 or 20 degrees as delicate as Hitchcock did. He practically turns it on its axis. <br /> <br /> He will not call him a bow to Hitchcock because he is not. It is a pecuniary sacking of Hitchcock's material (already torn in "Psycho" I, II, III, IV, and "Psycho: The Beginning Years" and "Come Into My Parlor: Mrs. Bates' Revenge" and "Hand Me That knife , do you want?: the true story of Norman Bates. ") A stir and grind really original things, a crumbling if not criminal act. And this not to mention the many tributes in other films, especially the French, such as the infamous "ocean of boredom" scenes between Marcel Brulee and Jeanne Gateau in the admirable "La Mere de la Nuit". (Perhaps it is better to add that the last sentence is a terrible attempt to parody academic critics and when the entrails of a chicken grind wheat, it is a "crumenal" act. I will not go on except to say these squalid gags as they are , they are more fun than the movie.) <br /> <br /> So who was it for? I should guess. Guys too young to know about the original and who doesn't like black and white movies? Guys hoping to see another ordinary slasher movie? Chimpanzees?
