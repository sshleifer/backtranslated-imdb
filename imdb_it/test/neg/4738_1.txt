AVP2 is a terrible film. The dialogue was useless, the acting was pathetic, it had practically no plot and you can't really tell what the hell is happening half the time because of continuity errors and holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> BUT! You will love it anyway. Because it pushes the boundaries on blood, on violence, on death, on destruction and on chaos. In this film they also kill children, babies and unborn children. You will be sitting there thinking "Oh my God, it's disgusting" And they will surprise you by killing the "sexy chick that always does it alive" when the predator and the aliens are fighting in the hospital. <br /> <br /> It is as if the film industry had said "We know what we did in the first Alien Vs. Predator movie was bad, so we'll do it again but this time we get help from psychopaths with a vivid imagination "It is predictable, Moral and in the lower right without meaning ... but you will think about it for a while after seeing it.
