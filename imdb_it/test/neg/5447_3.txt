I'm not really sure why people are so complimented about this strange film. That said, I spent the entire 2 hours and I can't say that it wasn't completely intractable. I think the key problem is that Frank Marshall is not a real director and this is clear in the film - he is an experienced producer, so he will have seen a movie made many times and will understand what goes into the process. But I think it's very different from being able to actually direct a movie - the management was competent, but somewhat flat and without direction. Marshall has more experience as a unit or as a second director, and this appeared to me, I think, in the finished product - it seemed to be a group of set designs that failed to have any continuity in his feel or character. <br /> <br /> Funny, watchable, but good? No.
