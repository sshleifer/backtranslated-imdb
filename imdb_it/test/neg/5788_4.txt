Someone commented that Charlie Sheen's character should be judged martial for doing what he wanted. You may be right, but that's how SEAL really is. I worked for several months with a SEAL team in Norfolk, Virginia. In fact, I should say that they used our ship to deploy in Europe for a couple of months. I was the postal clerk on board and every day these guys tried to get their mail. Since only one person was authorized to pick up the mail every day, we issued a pass to one person. Every day a different SEAL came out pretending to be someone else. Well, after the third time I said no to them until I had proof of who they were. They went NUTS !!! I thought they would break into my cage, gag me and then steal my mail. Fortunately I had not only the president on my side (the Navy), but the federal government (US Mail). That was the only time I saw the SEALs stop having everything they wanted. He was granted an unlimited permit, where we had to go back on board at a given time. They killed and tortured a woman in France and the two SEALs obtained a detention of 1 week on board, while a sailor was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a French wine shop and obtained a court martial. Is it any wonder why the retention rate of SEAL is over 85%? As SEAL you are god. So this film does a pretty accurate job of portraying how a SEAL acts and thinks ... unfortunately it's so incredible for normal people that it turns out to be a fake.
