I have a lot of respect for Mr. Silver's work, but this film lacks many of the qualities that make his films truly unique. The opening to the film is great and gives you the chance of a truly scary horror movie. What happens to the rest of the film lacks structure or purpose and does not accumulate much. There are some good performances, and lots of great atmosphere. The end of the film is weak considering all that has been built. Where there should be a huge culmination of huge proportions, instead we get a very typical conclusion that too many other bad horror films use, making them feel like they just need to finish. A couple of scenes are very memorable for their images, but in the end the film does not gel to make a really beautiful film. Unless you feel you have to see everything this director has done, I suggest you pass this ...
