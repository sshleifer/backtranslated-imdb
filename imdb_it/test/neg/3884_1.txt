After three hours in the cinema hall, the strongest impression was that theirs is something wrong. What was clear is that the directors have forgotten to direct, the actors to act and, above all, the writer to write. Evervbody screamed for no reason and gave a shred. The script has moved on and on with a lot of avoidable turns and turns that end now, a too familiar Priyadarshan theory of converging actors in a single point. This theory worked well in Hera-Pheri and in Hungama, but somehow managed to get irritated this time, so it made a habit of each actor's inability to answer them directly. The simplest questions such as "what your name would be would be repeated N times". <br /> <br /> Finally, what didn't work is that the director has forgotten that his audience has something called intelligence.
