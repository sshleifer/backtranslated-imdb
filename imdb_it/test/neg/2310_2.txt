I really should classify "Sex is Comedy" as one of the worst dreck pieces I've ever seen. The film inadvertently exposes the worst aspects of the French, or at least as they are stereotyped, narcissism, snobbery and pseudo-intellectualism. I myself am Franco-Canadian and I am a bit ashamed because the creators of this film come from the same culture as me, which should give you an idea of ​​how bad this film really was! You don't look at this film as much as if you were subjected to torture, there was a total lack of humor, and it seemed to me that the whole film was a documentary that interviewed people who were neither famous nor talented, like to celebrate something that never happened at the beginning. Instead, why not look at Auberge Espagnole, Happenstance, or Je t'aime ... a la folie, three fantastic modern French films.
