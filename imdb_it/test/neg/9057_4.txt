I didn't hate this. I couldn't adapt to the story. actually he didn't take me. Michael Mann is a great director, but I don't agree with his methods in this. I'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. some projects he has been in are pretty boring, but his acting is brilliant. my favorite movies of Daniel Day Lewis are There Will Be Blood and Gangs Of New York. <br /> <br /> there is one thing that I liked very much and this was the soundtrack, it gave the film a lot of atmosphere. that's all I liked. this film also has a high and somewhat random grade. I can see that few people will like this but not enough to make the overall score 7.8. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a mistake if I were you, but there are many high grades for this so I suppose you should watch it and make your own opinions about what you think. I didn't like it very much ............. 4/10 ............. j.d Seaton
