In case the title doesn't give it away - this movie is rubbish. <br /> <br /> Short review? Yes. <br /> <br /> I decided to take the time to write this review because Hollywood probably decided to include it in the script. I doubt it will be published considering how badly I formulated everything but if this is and whoever reads it - stick to loving Sandlot's first film. It completely overcomes its predecessors in every single way. The sequels are never worth buying or seeing and all those involved in making them should be ashamed of having ruined what must be one of the most classic and original films of our childhood.
