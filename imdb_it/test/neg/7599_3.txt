It was a tradition from my first VHS recorder for me to collect some of Charles Dickens' old chestnut incarnations, and I recorded this and "Karroll's Christmas" this year. Fortunately, when this was performed on the Hallmark Channel in the unofficial 3am, I was spared having to edit the advertisements from it. This was, however, only by saving grace. <br /> <br /> Writing was incredibly boring with almost no clever scene to save him from being anything more than a teenage girl like Beverly Hills 90210. In this, a good man who was sidelined for his celebrity seems the only logical explanation for his transformation into a Scrooge-like TV talk show hostess. He wasted Dinah Manoff who plays the goddess bitch with the other bitch Tori Spelling (who, by the way, had more paint than some colonial houses paint) and Bill Shatner is perhaps one of the few funny things in this otherwise sad adaptation. <br /> <br /> Some of the best opportunities are wasted like ghost revenues. Aunt Marla's entry could have been spectacularly fun in the hands of a decent writer, but this Christmas turkey evidently didn't have one. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling could be a lovely person, but he has all the skill recitations of a mannequin, and that makes a bad show all by himself. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was nice to see Gary Coleman working again, but the script gives him nothing to do but look up and make a really lame dialogue. <br /> <br /> And what is most irritating is that the transformation from Scroogedom to Tori "sweet and light" is as convincing as a passionate conservative. Now, if someone wants to write the latest Scrooge story of George Bush and Karl Rove, we could have a refreshing change from Carol's usual bad Christmas clones. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you are a fan of Mrs. Spelling and / or 90210, this could be your cup of Christmas cheer. I'd rather have a hard shot of scotch and a cold beer to wash myself. This I can only drive away before he has been with me here for a long time. <br /> <br /> God save us all!
