A beautiful line of actors and a seemingly beautiful plot - though not original - promised me a nice evening in front of the TV. I was disappointed. The actors showed themselves to be up to the task (Juliette Lewis was more tender than ever, William Hurt was solid but in the background, Shelley Duvall was convincing as always) but the story was too subtle to get me engaged to the story final was too obvious and too late; there was only one character who was kind to the girl, so guess what?! Then the last after-twist ?? I don't know what to think of this. The boyfriend and the neighbor? Contract with the devil or just to get her in? What! The film had a nice idea, but the idea was not elaborated in detail. It could have been good, but it wasn't. Too many rounds to tie, Columbo would say.
