I saw this movie in a show that showed bad B movies and tried to convince them to buy them. Basically it was just a long trailer, but it gave you a good idea of ​​what the movie was. After seeing the trailer, I thought about renting this movie because it seemed stupid and generic, but it could still be fun in a perverse way. IT IS NOT ENTERTAINMENT in any sense of the word. The film has two (or should I say four) things that do it and it's not the number of deaths, it's women. I am very hot and naked and Mrs. Lovell could be a legitimate actress, but not in a movie where the emphasis is on T & A and corny dialogues. This isn't even a horror or scary movie, unless you're talking about watching actors trying to act. The value of production is pathetic, the acting is worse and the writing is the worst. What was the point in making this film? Scaring people? To snatch "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"? To try to be fun? To show women's breasts? To put a boy's head in a delayed suit, with fake hands and legs? To have a character just say the word "Snow" again and again? Not to have real violence but to have enough nudity in an attempt to hide the fact that there is no real plot? Being able to make a sequel to a film that no one has ever seen or will ever see? I made a mistake in taking this movie, don't make this mistake. <br /> <br /> STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
