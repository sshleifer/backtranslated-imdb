It is a pity that such a lousy plot should hang in such picturesque places, with some documentary-style reportages pushed for extra length. A shorter film may have held the tension a little more, and a more charismatic advantage may not have weakened his lines so much. Furthermore, the female protagonist was not allowed to do enough, resulting in a pretty but boring relationship. It is built towards the end but the redemption of the main protagonist is too little and should have been revealed earlier in the film. Not terrible, just a pity. Unattractive but pleasant enough to beautify early-morning TV shows.
