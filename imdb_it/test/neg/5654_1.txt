iCarly is all that is wrong in the world. All the main characters, but Carly's brother and brother are morally bankrupt. <br /> <br /> Sam injures other people on a whim. He breaks a locker for children and is forced to pay a hundred dollars to fix it, and all he says is "hard" and goes on to destroy Freddy's cell phone. She has just caused at least $ 300 in damages and she is more focused on getting food. What the hell?. The only time he feels guilty is when he made fun of Freddy on the show. And that's just because Carly has pestered shit from her. <br /> <br /> Carly is "I'm perfect, everything I do is beautiful". kind of girl. All he does is to his advantage and is often shown only with remorse for itself. What's worse, she encourages Sam's crap. Does Sam ruin some of Freddy's clothes? She laughs. Does Sam ruin a child's vows? He shrugs his shoulders. <br /> <br /> It doesn't even start me on humor. The trace of laughter is reproduced at any time. <br /> <br /> Sam: Not so sexy Carly: Yes, he is Sam: Yes, you're right * AMBER OF GIRL * <br /> <br /> shows humor consists in degrading others and uttering obscure words and occasionally joking about trivial topics using similar phrases. <br /> <br /> Not to mention all the "extraordinary techno special effects" they can do in Windows Movie Maker.
