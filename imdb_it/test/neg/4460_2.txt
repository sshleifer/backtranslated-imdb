"Dracula A.D. 1972" by British television veteran Alan Gibson qualifies as one of the less appetizing voices of the Hammer Studios series on Bram Stoker's immortal bloodsucker. In fact, this represented the first time since the memorable "Horror of Dracula" by Terence Fisher (1958) that Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing fought each other like mortal enemies. They will resume the same roles a few years later in the last Hammer Dracula: "The satanic rites of Dracula". Furthermore, it was the penultimate Dracula for Hammer in which Lee performed as the infamous tusk. For the record, "Dracula A.D. 1972" was the seventh Hammer Dracula. <br /> <br /> The exciting prologue of 1872 prepares you for something very different from what the rest of this disappointing horror film produces. The eternal rivals, Count Dracula and his enemy, Professor Lawrence Van Helsing, find themselves literally against each other in a carriage on the run in London's Hyde Park for a vigorous opening scene that makes it look like everything the rest is relatively anti-climatic. The carriage crashes and Dracula emerges hugging half of a wooden wheel with its broken spokes stuck in his chest. Of course, Christopher Lee has to grab this broken wheel against his body, but the images are quite surprising in his own way to get through the rally. The Count expires and so does his opponent Van Helsing. However, one of Dracula's disciples tears the Count's ring and collects some of the vampire's ashes in a vial for custody. <br /> <br /> The script of Don Houghton brings down the action of a hundred years to swing London in 1972. We meet a lively young man, Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame of "No Blade of Grass"), who loves to unleash hell with a group of hippies who bring down the holidays and lead the English police with their antics. Alucard appears to be the descendant of one of Dracula's servants. Now, Alucard has the Count's ring and a vial of his dehydrated blood. Alucard chooses the sight of a desecrated church to organize a black mass. Invite his fashionable friends, including Laura (the super sexy Carolina Munro of "The Spy Who Loved Me"), Gayner (Marsha Hunt) and Jessica Van Helsing (Stephanie Beacham) to attend this black mass because she offers them something different. Not surprisingly, they succeed in reviving the Count, and the evil bloodsucker fixes his eyes on Jessica. Meanwhile, after Laura's body was discovered drained of blood, Scotland Yard Inspector Murray (Michael Coles of "Doctor Who and the Dalkes") urges the help of Van Helsing's modern progeny Lorrimar (Peter Cushing). Dracula wants revenge on Van Helsing by taking his niece as his bride. Lorrimar traces Alucard; they fight in his Chelsea apartment, and the young vampire drowns in a tub of water. Remember, running water is just as lethal to vampires as sunlight and the crucifix. Van Helsing finds Dracula in the deserted church with his daughter waiting for the count. Tangle of Van Helsing and Dracula. Van Helsing launches the Holy Water on Dracula's face. The vampire falls into an open grave with a stake that awaits him and decomposes again. <br /> <br /> The main problem with "Dracula AD 1972" is that we don't have enough of Lee as the Count, although we get more than Cushing like Van Helsing. Furthermore, writer Don Houghton keeps Dracula confined to the crumbling church and never allows the vampire to venture into the city. Despite its low budget, "Dracula A.D. 1972" could have been much better. The scene where the contemporary Van Helsing has to write down Alucard and write it back to get Dracula seems almost ridiculous. You would think he would be aware of this backward spelling trick. Unless you're afraid of horror movies, this will make you yawn. Occasionally, Gibson presents us with a superb close-up of Dracula with his bared fangs and bloodshot eyes, but this is as scary as this cooler, and that's not saying much.
