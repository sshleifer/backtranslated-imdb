Oh yes, this is certainly a strong competitor to win the questionable prize of the "worst slasher of the 80s ever made". "The Prey" has everything you usually want to avoid in a horror movie: a routine plot, derivative you've seen a thousand times before (better), unbearable characters and terrible performances, a total lack of cold blood and suspense, blurred photography and unoriginal places and ?? the most irritating of all ?? the largest amount of unnecessary padding footage you've ever met in your life (and it's not an exaggeration, but a guarantee!). Apart from the seemingly endless amount of footage from National Geographic, which I will look into later, this film is brazen enough to include a complete banjo interlude (!) And two occasions when the characters recount amateur jokes that are nowhere near funny! The set-up is as rudimentary as it gets, with the introduction showing the images of a devastating forest fire with the voice of human screams. Forward forward almost forty years later, when an elderly couple camping in the same area is hit by something that breathes heavily off the screen. This should be enough information to let you find out that someone survived the fire all these years ago and has been lurking since then. Enter three intolerable twenty pairs of people who head to the danger zone with only sex in their minds, unaware of course that they are ducks sitting for the killer stalking and panting. "The Prey" is a boring and irredeemable film. Apparently it was shot in 1978, but nobody wanted to distribute it until 1984 and it's not hard to see why. In the event that all the actual relevant content is excluded, this would only be a short movie with a duration of 30 minutes; maybe even less. There is an unimaginably large nature and footage of wild animals, sometimes of animals that I think don't even live in that kind of area, and seem to go on forever. The only thing missing, in fact, is the typical National Geographic narrative that provides educational information on animal habits. The animals in their natural biotope are undeniably pleasant to look at, but not in a seemingly vile and poor movie of the 80s, for crying out loud. The last fifteen minutes are finally quite useful, with some powerful killing sequences and makeup effects on the monster (which turns out to be Lurch from the "The Addams Family" movies), but the subtlety still continues ??? the scene with the vultures is too stupid ?? and the final shot is just an exaggeratedly delayed laugh. As mentioned above, "The Prey" easily makes my personal list of the worst 80s, along with "Appointment with Fear", "Berserker", "Deadly Games", "Do not Go in the Woods", "Hollow Gate "," The Stay Awake "and" Curfew ".
