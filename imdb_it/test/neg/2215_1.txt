There is something about Doug McLure's appearance in a film that is a guarantee of misery. His initials from DG are like a special film certification, which comes somewhere before "U". <br /> <br /> Cushing, on the other hand, seemed to suffer from both a dilatory agent and poor personal judgment. He did an excellent job in Hammer's films like Dr Van Helsing. I saw him take a passable Sherlock Holmes in 'Hound Of The Baskervilles'. And his magnum opus was probably Grand Moff Tarkin in the first 'Star Wars'. The only man except the emperor who could tell Darth Vadar to "stop arguing" and get away with it. But - crikey! - He made turkeys. There was that deplorable "Daleks" film for one. And here's another one. <br /> <br /> There is a car that was hijacked by Tracy Island. It is a cylinder with a screw in the front and traction devices on the sides. I am surprised that Jerry Anderson has not sued for plagiarism. Maybe it was bought out. Yet, if the film is a guide, they can't have paid much. <br /> <br /> It's 1976 and we're still playing in latex straw dresses. <br /> <br /> That's it. Some films have entertainment value in the "so bad is good" category. This can't even do it. It would not even entertain children. The 'Crash Corrigan' stuff from the 1930s is more successful.
