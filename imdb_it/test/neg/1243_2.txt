First of all ... I've seen better acting and more realistic makeup in porn movies. How bad was "Chris Moltisante" as Stewie Ungar? On The Sopranos, Chris is not taken too seriously and can be considered a comic relief. And then launch "Bobby Baccala" as one of his Las Vegas cronies. It's too much to take a drama. Neither of the two actors can play a serious role and is more suitable as a second banana for Tony, Paulie or Uncle Junior. And I want to know who did the trick for this disaster? I want that person to become my make-up artist for the next 25 years, so I'll never grow old a day. So this is all I will write about this film because it's not worth wasting much more than my time. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirippa are their REAL names.
