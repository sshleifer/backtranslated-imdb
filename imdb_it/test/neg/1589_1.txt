Thomas Vinterbergs "De St√∏rste Helte" is another road movie without the most important element of a film: a good story. The characters are not very original and not particularly interesting. Especially Thomas Bo Larsen is a pain in the neck, he played the same role he played in the last few years and he repeated in "Festen" - it seems as if he thought of acting = being angry and yelling at other people! The film does not make much sense and is not even very funny - even if it tries to be "extravagant" and "strange". If you're going to make a road movie, why not add something original to the genre ?!
