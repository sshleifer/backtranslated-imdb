This film is strange, even for a silent film. In essence, it follows the adventures of a post-revolutionary Russian engineer who dreams of going to Mars. In this film, it seems that the producers know that the communists have really ruined the country, but it also seems to want to make it look like they have achieved something good. <br /> <br /> Then we come to "Martian Scenes, in which everyone on Mars wears silly hats. They have a revolution after being inspired by the Men of the Earth, but they are quickly betrayed by the Queen who sided with them. it's all a dream, or it is. (And since the Russian revolution eventually led to the Stalin dictatorship, you wonder if it was all allegory.) <br /> <br /> Now I've seen good Russian cinema. For example, Eisenstein's battleship Potishkin is a good movie, which is just, well, silly.
