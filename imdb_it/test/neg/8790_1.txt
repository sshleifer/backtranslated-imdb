This film was obscenely obvious and predictable. The scenes were poorly written and acted even worse. Following the horrible scenes there was the terrible script full of useless and ill-conceived lines. I would never recommend this movie to anyone who makes sense in watching decent movies. This film was not only with the same ideas as the Bachelor and Bachelorette show, but it also contained many parts where you would know what the next move and line would be without ever having to watch the movie before. The casting went well but the actors played the characters horribly more dramatically, so they should have been used and the lines in question were those that wanted to change the channel quickly. As a note please do not watch this movie.
