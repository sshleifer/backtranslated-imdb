Here is a film that was so pedestrian for 90% that it had no right to become so challenging and frustrating in the end. Has the director decided to suddenly become an author, 80% during the making of this film? Yeesh. SPOILER NOTICE This usually starts long enough for the crazy 1950s youngsters; there are drifters, good girls, bad girls, gangs, the old restaurant manager, and the city creep. Things follow the planned path until about 15 minutes before the end, when the only nice character is killed and the anti-hero is blamed (this would not be so unexpected if this was the main plot of the film ... but all this stuff starts to happen and disintegrates during the final reel! Then things get weird, the old gentle coder forms a crowd and beats the hero in a bloody mess ... The mere presence of the hero's friend somehow drags a confession from the real murderer - the damned and disturbing madman of the city (which in every true universe would have been the first suspect to begin with, even if the anti-hero was found with his body). <br /> <br /> We stayed with a slightly "happy" ending, which is almost out of character with the rest of the film like the events of the previous 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Even more strange is the insistence of this film in reciting homosexual allusions all the way, but Fr. constantly resign the two male protagonists as heterosexuals. Perhaps this was on purpose - perhaps Bix's resistance to settling with the girl was more because of her sexuality (which in the 1950s should have been kept fairly repressed, and therefore not discussed or even admitted by him) of her need to be a "drifter". If the director's intent was to turn this like a sexual yarn - that the vagabond goes away because he feels he is a sexually outcast; that his paternal concern with Danny is not, in effect, paternal but spousal; that his inability to stay with Carrie is rooted in a sexual rebellion that even he does not understand - could have been clarified. Instead, we get this very bizarre alchemy of homoeroticism and completely heterosexual behavior. <br /> <br /> These young men sleep next to each other even when they can find some space to spread. When Danny is proposed (and once in bed with a woman), Bix turns around and takes him away. Danny pays the Bix way (of course, there's another explanation for this, but it strikes again every time you see Danny buying Bix's lunch). They end up living together in the end. Since Hitchcock has "Rope", homosexuality has been so blatant, but denied. <br /> <br /> MST3K did the right thing by wearing this. Apart from Jack Elam, there is little to praise the film.
