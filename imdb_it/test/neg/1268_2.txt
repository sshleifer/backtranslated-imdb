There are many so-called anti-war / anti-government. Political films around that start like a mea culpa and end with "our poor boys are doing hell out there, so let the world sympathize with them, it's not their fault" - kind of thing. I was half afraid that this would be another in that style, even if it was another subject / aspect of the same subject. I almost didn't go to see it; after all, I almost didn't write this review. What did we get here? An Egyptian is taken to a secret offshore torture center, on the orders of the United States, but it is another Egyptian who must torture, not an American: 'see, we Americans have clean hands', and the Egyptians are bad a lot anyway, so let them damage themselves. Oh, and the good humor must have been an American with a conscience: indeed, many Americans have them, but here the concept was misplaced. Yes, we all know it's called Extraordinary Rendition and it started in Clinton's time and is now used for reasons that go well beyond control. Otherwise it was very disgusting and nervous to really condemn the United States for being subjected to torture; as if the creators were afraid to go all the time for fear of being torn as unpatriotic or anything else (take a look at the bulletin board!) Anyone who apologizes gets a lot of heavy verbal artillery). Torture is a terrible thing, whether one is guilty or not; in the 18th century, Frederick II, king of Prussia, abolished him for convicted murderers - although I must say that life imprisonment for a child molester is much less than what I want to see. Okay, what about torture? This film did not highlight his horror and despair. When you are under torture, (now the capitals are coming to emphasize, I am not shouting) YOU SAY NOTHING, EVEN IF IT IS NOT TRUE, EVEN IF YOU HAVE NOT MADE THE THINGS YOU'RE ACCUSED, IN THE HOPE GO TO SAY AMEN TO ANY PEDDLING, YOU STOP . NEVER HAS IT, NEVER LEARN AND YOU'RE NEVER SAYING THAT YOU HAVE DONE ANYTHING they SAY, YOU DID. Another thing that the film did not bring out enough is that TORTURE IS EXCESSIVE, HUMIBLE UNABRIMABLE, AND THAT JUDGMENT SUPPORTS YOUR LIFE WITH YOU. Somehow it changes people inside. How do I know all this? Do not ask. <br /> <br /> Modification: two things: the Arabic that was used in the film was not the Egyptian dialect. It is worse than setting a film in New Zealand with the locals as the characters and they all have American accents. Furthermore, the terrible little preacher who was inciting his ignorant public to violence was telling them things unknown to that religion, which should have been brought out. Nor has it been explained anywhere that any nincompoop can become a mullah / imam; it does not need special qualifications, and this is a pause that must be corrected: many are acceptable because of their fundamentalist opinions and the great ally of the United States, Saudi Arabia, finances so many of them. Many thanks for this space.
