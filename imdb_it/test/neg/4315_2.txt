This is a total breach. If you take The Devil's Rejects and suck all the good out of it, and add lots of twisted and vicious bondage parts, some rape scenes and one or two really hideous scenes, and you'll get this movie. People call it a 1960s Hitcher scam, but I don't see it at all. Even Hitcher's worst cheats are even better than this. The main problem here is that there is really nothing here, apart from some of the director's fetishes that are on display as circus shows. All you need is a video of girls being abused and tied up, scared of fear? Well, then rent this movie! <br /> <br /> However, I'd rather just watch a good movie, which clearly isn't. The sad thing is that there are some really beautiful thrills waiting to be discovered here, but only a few. For example, the suspense at the beginning before the absurdities of slavery started ... damn good if you asked me. And the scene where the hitchhiker kills the nymphomaniac girl (he can't remember the names) is chilling, very brutal in a sense, even challenging The Devil's Rejects for unbridled fury. Why can't the rest of the film be so beautiful? Eh? I really need to stop renting rubbish like this. Closing message: let this gutter basket die and forget it forever. Not recommended.
