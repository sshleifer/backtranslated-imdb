NOTICE: This review contains important SPOILERS. Don't keep reading if you think you see this movie. <br /> <br /> Judging by the amount of votes obtained (my vote was the fifth) very few people know or care about who Mimi Lesseos is. Well, in the late 1980s, professional wrestling was pretty decent. Open a federation of all women called Ladies Professional Wrestling Association. It was a great championship, and Mimi Lesseos was one of the names on the roster. I always thought he was one of the best people LPWA had in terms of ring skills and acting skills. Unfortunately, the LPWA closed its doors in the early 1990s, so it seemed natural for someone as talented as Mimi to start an acting career, right? But surely there was an alternative to things like this? This movie is really bad. As it went on, I continued to compare it to an undervalued film called "Survivor Quest", only this film lacks everything that made `Survivor Quest 'enjoyable. <br /> <br /> As I started the tape, I went fast through the preview to get to the flesh of the tape. At first I wasn't paying much attention, but then I realized that the preview was for a film starring Mimi Lesseos. "Oh," I thought, "here's another movie with Mimi to look for." But as the preview dragged on, I realized it was a preview for ??. "Beyond Fear!" You know you're in trouble when the first preview shows the movie you're about to see! The plot of this thing is pretty standard. Lesseos plays a former kickboxer who lives with the guilt of hurting an opponent / friend, then focuses on his second career he shares with his friend Sammy: being a wild guide. On this particular occasion, he gets a troop of three pairs. Two of the couples are there to take up space. You will think that a couple, a Caucasian husband and a Korean wife, will be explored, as a problem appears between them in the middle of the film, but is ignored in favor of repeated jokes about bears in the woods, which constantly scares the Korean wife. The joke is fun the first time you hear it, but it's certainly not for the ninth time they do it. The third couple is just painful to watch: it is composed of Mr. and Mrs. Page. They trade insults back and forth and Mr. Page uses his video camera for the art of voyeurism when he is not busy making cruel jokes about his portly wife. Just like the typical American couple! Before the excursion, Mr. Page is spying on two stupid boys and their prostitute. One of them accidentally kills the prostitute and discovers that Mr. Page has recorded it. Thus begins the danger, while the two boys follow the group on their journey, and we wait? .and we wait ?? .and we wait ?? .and wait until they finally do something. When they do, it's a fiasco. <br /> <br /> You can't blame the cast. They try as much as they can with the material they have to work with. The main culprit is director Robert F. Lyons, who needs to get back to playing bits and pieces and stay out of the director's chair. Lyons starts and interrupts the scenes in such a sloppy and sudden matter that he begins to think he is suffering from dyspepsia during the whole shoot. There is also an incompetent moment when a scene of daylight with the hooligans slipped between some night scenes. Then there is the sound department. The music and the background noise completely overwhelm the dialogue so that you have to move your ear right next to the TV speaker. Don't bang your head on the screen! It is not worthwhile to hear badly written lines. Speaking of bad writing, Lesseos gets some of the credit there as a co-author. The few interesting developments among the characters are often abandoned due to thugs of thugs or bad practical jokes. At first, Lesseos knocks a thief with a jackknife, so not once do you think they're in danger from the two stupid thugs. When the criminals finally manage to pull their rear ends out of Lesseos in a long and hard fight, our cast all have a great laugh together, despite the fact that one of them has been shot and bleeds everywhere. Yes, everyone is happy in the end. All but the poor souls who watch the film, wanting the good old days of glory in which Mimi performed in the wrestling ring. The score of Zantara: 4 out of 10
