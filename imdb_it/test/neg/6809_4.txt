Dustin Hoffman's debut feature isn't as bad as it's known; a Spanish / Italian co-production filmed in Italy with the director who uses the pseudonym "Dan Ash" (!), the film is irregular but generally deviant and faces a plethora of shady characters in search of $ 1,000,000 hidden by the gangster Cesar Romero ( that, despite being third-placed - after Elsa Martinelli and Hoffman himself - expires before the sequence of credits has even ended!). <br /> <br /> Hoffman's performance, of course, is nowhere near as blurred as in the following films, but he manages to dodge the embarrassment by playing what basically amounts to a lovable klutz - an accident-prone American treasure officer of Sicilian descent (called Puzzu, which no one seems to be able to get!) sent by his company to recover the money and told to remain "inconspicuous" but, instead, he is always in trouble - even if in the end it turns out to be surprisingly enterprising finding the loot, foiling the scammers and winning the girl (Martinelli as Romero's daughter, who is a little wasted here) !! <br /> <br /> Again, the best moments of the film are provided by his fluent gangster Riccardo Garrone: in addition to his aspiring hard-boiled character and the exhilarating use of dialect, he is joined by a trio of fools who more often do not demonstrate an obstacle in the fulfillment of its various schemes! Moreover, given the history set in Rome, it is strange that the policeman investigating the case is a Spaniard (without a doubt a need for the coproduction deal)! <br /> <br /> Over the years, I missed the other Italian comedy of Hoffman - ALFREDO, ALFREDO (1972) - a number of times (I think, mainly, because Leonard Maltin evaluates it only * 1 / 2 in his "Video & Video Guide" ... but, then, MILLIONS OF MADIGAN gets a BOMB!); with Pietro Germi who directs and co-stars the lustful Stefania Sandrelli, the credentials of that film are certainly more respectable, and I really hope that you will soon return to Italian TV ...
