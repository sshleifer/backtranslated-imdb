This is the kind of movie that challenges your past admiration for a particular director before you stop and reminds yourself that there are very few people whose body of work does not contain a few clunkers. <br /> <br /> casting in Lelouch's films is of the utmost importance because it puts the viewer in such intimacy with the characters. Actors must bring the true magic of the screen to live up to the intensity. Otherwise it's just empty. <br /> <br /> None of the actors in this film had one of those magical effects on the screen, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons and Patricia Kaas were the best. Irons is a talented actor but he was wrong for this part. The lovable rogue was not good for its strengths. His charm mark also struck a false note for me here. Iron's personality is too decadent - dyed to fit a Lelouch love story. <br /> <br /> Although I would hesitate to take every opportunity to hear an English accent, I also think that an American actor would have worked better in this role. So many of the songs that Kaas sings are so closely identified with the American lyricism of the particular lyricist that he seemed somewhat discordant to have Jeremy Irons play the love interest - even if logically it didn't matter. It still ruined the flow of the film in some way. At least for me. <br /> <br /> Obviously, he should have been the right American. I think George Clooney would have been great in the part. And he would bring the magic screen in spade. Brad Pitt could also have done a great job offering his particular combination of charm and sharpness. <br /> <br /> I was also very disappointed with Patricia Kaas. Reading about her, I learned that she has a very successful career as a singer and many fans, so what do I know, but I found her presence on the screen as a very boring singer. She was actually a much better actress in her scenes than she was a singer in those scenes where she had to play and sell a song. Nothing he sang moved me. It was pleasant but tasteless. <br /> <br /> In contrast, someone like Kate Hudson, who is not a professional singer and has only the French voice-coach, would have handled this part a million times better. Not to mention all that extraordinary French talent out there that could have been exploited. It was amazing to watch Patricia Kaas take up space on the screen when there are so many charismatic French actresses that they might have been launched instead. <br /> <br /> Music was so important in this film, it couldn't work without the music working. And since Kaas delivered so badly in this regard, the film never had a chance. <br /> <br /> Lelouch sealed the fate of this film when he chose Patricia Kaas. JMO.
