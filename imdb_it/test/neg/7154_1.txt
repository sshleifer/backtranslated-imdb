I was looking forward to this movie. I like street thrillers. I like sex, drugs, youth, action and a great soundtrack. And I was particularly interested in making the film journey through Europe to see if I recognized any of my travel spots. <br /> <br /> From the first scene, however, this film was unwatchable. What was Guy doing by going the wrong way? What could have blown up the van that rolled gracefully along a slight grassy slope? If they are such bad pilots, why should they take a delivery job? And this is just the first scene! Not bad enough to be campy or silly. Simply awful! Horrible! Horrible! Waste of time. Switch to something ... anything else!
