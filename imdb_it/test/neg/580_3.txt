Dorothy Provine does the opposite here: it continues to grow and grow. I didn't detect any subtext, though. "The Incredible Shrinking Man" and other films of its kind during the period were parables about radiation, nuclear war and other horrors. Provine's growth is the result of an inept computer / robot. <br /> <br /> And who runs this computer, but Lou Costello! I like some of his movies with Bud Abbott. But, even if this is a pretty bad movie, he does it without him. And Gale Green is an excellent foil. <br /> <br /> Green plays the city blowjob. He is the father of Provine. He is determined to be elected Mayor. So when his beloved daughter starts having problems, he unloads her. He does not discharge her exactly but renounces his battle against his longtime admirer Costello. <br /> <br /> This is quite implausible: Costello is the local garbage collector. <br /> <br /> Special effects are minimal. And the subplot that involves the military is lame to the extreme.
