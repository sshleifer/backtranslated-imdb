I was permanently marked by this terrible film. <br /> <br /> The main action of the film is nothing special. There seems to be a tribe of people who worship snakes in a remote mountainous region of northern China, where women, rather than men, are the leaders and decision makers. I suppose that, among some men, this is enough to make "Succubare" a horror film ... However, occasionally Chinese men wander around the village, take a liking to the local girls, seduce them and then abandon them. Unfortunately for men, women had put a spell on them, derived from snake venom, which would have killed them horribly in 100 days - their bellies swelled up like a pregnant woman with live worms and snakes - if they didn't come back. <br /> <br /> Forget the cover of the American video. This has nothing to do with vampires, even if there is an unhealthy scene of drinking blood. The title itself is only marginally appropriate: "Succubare" is the Latin verb meaning "to lie under", and is the root of the word Succubus, a female demon that would seduce men in sleep. In reality, it is UOMs who are the seducers here. <br /> <br /> But it is not the main action of this ridiculous film that is so questionable. It's the small collateral accidents. I neglect the slaughter and the butchery of an ox that is executed on the screen. The participants seem very experienced, as if this were an unpleasant task they do in real life; and I'm sure that later they ate the animal ... although I resented the act that pushed me in the face like "entertainment". <br /> <br /> What I WANT can not be overlooked (or HAD neglected) are the numerous, totally extraneous shots of an unidentified man, who from time to time interrupts the story by eating live animals. The film begins by breaking up a living snake with its teeth. In the course of the film, he devours an insect, a lizard, a toad (I had to leave the room after this) and a whole mouse (I stopped looking at this point and lost my appetite for days). Let me emphasize that this was completely unexpected and had nothing to do with the film ... unless it is a cynical reference to love as portrayed in the film: a blind, selfish survival mechanism and predator that breaks the helpless ... but then again, I'm probably just rationalizing to get the cowardice out of my head ...
