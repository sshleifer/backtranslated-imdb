I just saw this stinky old boiler on TV. Better watched with a large bottle of Dr Jurd's Jungle Juice at hand, this exploiter's party is hilarious. On the more (very thin) side, Raquel was in his best physical shape, looks good, and you can see quite a bit of her, since she plays a go-go dancer; he had nice legs, that's for sure. There is also some minor interest for screen lovers in the Los Angeles movie ca. '69, and in finding actors in smaller parts that went to better things. The veteran Ron Rifkin ("Brothers and Sisters") offers the first performances of the first shows as "Sailor", the "fagot junkie" barman that raises Raquel from the villain. You could also recognize the security guard who acts as a gun in the hit and run scene - it's a very first appearance by Gordon Jump, who gave such a beautiful performance in 'Soap' as Piece of Chelief Tinkler. <br /> <The "storyline" of "Flareup", as it stands, follows the travails of an exotic dancer (Welch) fleeing his ex-homicidal husband (Luke Askew). This turkey is the classic Hollywood production line mud: a screenplay of numbers, pedestrian direction, hockey shots, modifications and effects, soft background music, plywood sets and performance to match. <br /> <br /> The cast is uniformly terrible as the script. Although Raquel is capable of loyal performance in the right vehicle, this old and drunk clunker is SO SO bad that he really has no chance, and not even the public. One of my favorite moments occurs when Raquel wakes up in the hospital, sees the Las Vegas policeman chasing his former murderer and asks "How did you get here?" - to which he answers "By plane". Oh, humanity ... And you won't be able to look away from the doctor (Michael Rougas) who has what could be one of the worst walk-ons in the long sad story of bad cameos. I don't think I've ever seen anyone stay in such a bad place before. <br /> <br /> The love interest of Raquel Joe (James Stacy) walks through the film with a fixed look that is somewhat confused and embarrassed - - and no wonder. This bomb puts the cast in almost all the cliches created for TV in the book, from the spectacular turn of Raquel in the terrible nightmare montage, to the pure schlock of the "romantic" ride along the beach of Leo Carillo. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler Warning ** - almost the only interesting thing about the whole movie is the ending, in which Raquel finally gets his own back, and he plays the title exhilaratingly, setting fire to the villain. Whoever the stuntman really earned his money on this - will rise like Yorba Linda in a heat wave. Yet even this rather spectacular scene is compromised by the fact that one of the crew's men moves towards the end. <br /> <br /> There are so many lousy things about Flareup that it's strangely compelling; I found myself wondering if this could be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The answer seemed to be a resounding "Yes" ... until I saw the movie that followed it, the classic "The Big Dollhouse" by Roger Corman, which brings Awful to a whole new level. I can strongly recommend these two shlockers as a double bill. Laugh yourself silly.
