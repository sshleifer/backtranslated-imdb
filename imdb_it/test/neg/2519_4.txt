OK, this is a strange movie! Fans of Ed Wood Jr. will appreciate the "inventive" techniques that director George Barry uses, such as archive footage and exaggerated voices. It can make a crack in the wall in a weft device! Here there is more humor than horror, but I found an uneven mixture. You will be laughing and crying and you will probably be wondering why you got your hands on this. Barry explains in the introduction that filming began on this film in 1972 and was completed in 1977, at a cost of $ 10,000. This is 59 months and $ 9,900 too! If you like your cheese on the side of the field, with the vintage "70s" gore ", you might find this an irresistible and extravagant snack.
