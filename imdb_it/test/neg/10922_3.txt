This film was extremely boring. I only laughed a couple of times. I decided to rent it when I noticed the name of William Shatner on the cover. It's all about this kid who is always made fun of by his classmates. When he wanders the streets in search of old ladies to assist, he meets a prostitute. She takes him to a club called the playground, where he makes friends with several protectors. When mayor Tony Gold (Shatner) decides to take over the pimp business, Lil 'Pimp has to go for his friends. <br /> <br /> Animation is not very good in this. It looks like it was made with Macromedia, which I'm sure it was. It doesn't suck, it's just the kind of flash choppy animation that people have become used to in recent years. The humor in this is not very good, I didn't think it was funny.
