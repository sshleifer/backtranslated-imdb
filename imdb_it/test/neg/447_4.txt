I can't honestly believe this to be a sequel or sequel to the classic John Landis horror movie from 1981. I guess you can't describe a movie like an original werewolf, since the bare bones of the story steal the elements of the one set in London : an American tourist visits a famous European capital, survives an attack by a werewolf who kills a colleague, embarks (Pardon the pun) on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession, turns into a werewolf, is visited by apparitions of his dead victims, etc. etc. and reading the previous line I just found out how much the plot has in common with the original which looks really very similar. The difference lies in the way the film Landis is fun and entertaining <br /> <br /> With this film based in Paris there are no scenes that really stand out. There is no naked man who wakes up in a zoo wondering how he will get home without money or clothes, there is no bizarre sequence of Nazi dreams and there is no spectacular climax. AAWIP tries to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than a failed humor? I'm thinking of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone who has chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two films is that there is no intensity in this dubious sequel. You are really sorry for the destiny and the dilemma of the protagonist in the London film, here you hear that Andy is nothing more than a cypher who goes through the literary movements of a script. There is also a large number of visible weft holes. Is this the first time the Lunar Club has carried out a massacre? If not, then, have not been reported numerous corpses with their hearts torn in the world press? Why didn't the police have the command? <br /> <br /> Everyone else mentioned it and I'll do it too - The images are poor. Watch the bungee jumping scene at The Eifell Tower, it is painfully obvious that it was achieved through a blue screen projection while the transformation of the werewolves is performed by some highly comic CGIs. I will not put Anthony Waller on the same staff as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally ruins a film because of an excessive dependence on CGI (the main problem with AAWIP is the script combined with a high degree of expectation on the part of those who have seen the film 1981 classic film), but I would have preferred the special effects like Rick Baker used for the transformation. To be honest, it is reasonable to assume that perhaps the budget did not extend to that point. But at the end of the day this is a pretty poor horror movie that doesn't need to be done and DOG SOLDIERS is a much better entertainment
