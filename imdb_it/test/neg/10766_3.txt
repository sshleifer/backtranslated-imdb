As someone who has read all of Baroness Orczy's books and seen most of the films based on them, I must say that the 1980s version, with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour, was better than this one. It was written better and more closely related to the spirit of this story, which seemed to do everything to get people to get shot. This new adaptation is less carefree, but it does not even have the same depth. Although there is good acting, the actors don't have much to work with. Beautiful costumes, though.
