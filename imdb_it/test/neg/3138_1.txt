I saw it at the Fantasy Filmfest in Cologne and left the cinema in the middle of this "movie" (with lots of other people), so maybe I'm not the right to comment on it, but I think the fact of leaving "SC" is a sufficient reason to do so. "S.C." it's a different film. People who need a coherent narrative, characters or storyline will find nothing in this. It should be an experimental film, based on the power of images. But these images have no power. They are so forced in their intention to simply cash in on people who have nothing else to say. Introspection of the off-narrator is simply boring, images are cheap. OK, the effects are good, but if that's the only thing, why worry? Husseins's film wants to be shocking and inspiring - instead it's boring and annoying in its non-creativity. Note: not all films without a story are art and there is no more creativity in breaking taboos - especially if everything is executed as in "S.C.". I would suggest that director Hussein should either visit a psychiatrist or a film school before he makes mistakes again for art. Note: I never want to see a child being hit again during birth.
