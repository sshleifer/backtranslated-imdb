The stinker at the bottom of the barrel is so ugly that it's not funny. The "plot" is about an American mercenary, played by Reb Brown (in the film he is called a "military adviser", but it is not very clear whether he is in the American army or not), helping the army in a Latin campaign fight - American guerrillas who end up joining the guerrillas when the government turns it over, imprisons it and tortures it. Shannon Tweed is a "sports equipment seller" who gathers in a bar that gets involved in all the intrigues. That description actually makes the film look better than it is, because it is really a stinker of almost biblical proportions. How bad is it? Well, Shannon Tweed turns into the most professional acting job in the film. If this is not an indication of what a turkey of the twelfth degree is this turkey, nothing is from sound effects not corresponding to a musical score that seems to come from a horror movie of the '40s "Z" (and could very well be) to the same video (ie, armored personnel battleships that descend along the same path in the jungle) constantly reused in some of the more in-action action scenes "in action" in recent memory, this sludgefest of laughter per minute must be seen not to be believed. Tweed looks bored, Brown seems to hang, and when this thing is over - if you can last that long; I couldn't - you'll know exactly how they feel. <br /> <br /> Although there are many explosions and shootings, this cannot be considered an "action" anywhere in the imagination. It's boring (there's a scene on the back of a truck where everyone stares at each other for three or four minutes), repetitive (the same "rebels" and "soldiers" killed over and over), illogical ( when a group of rebels are captured in an open field by a government helicopter, instead of raking to shelter they are simply there to stare at them), inept (soldiers and rebels fall "dead" when no shots are heard, a shooting in a house where fighters standing against the walls are strafed but miraculously the walls escape unscathed) predictable (when the "Governor" says to offer a reward for catching Brown because "someone" could transform it, you know exactly who that "someone" will be, and turns out to be exactly who you thought it was) and absolutely stupid (pretty much everything else in the picture). Inept, mindless and stupid beyond imagination. Do not waste time.
