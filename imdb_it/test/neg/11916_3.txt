I just spent the last half hour reading the other reviews and I don't know if I want to laugh or cry. There is no way that ADJL is like Harry Potter, Danny Phantom, Fairly Odd Parents, as well as a magical secret world, which was close to being exaggerated. Moreover, no way is the ADJL anime. The anime is very much a drawing style (and some will say more, like the Japanese plot and origin), in both cases ADJL is not an anime so stop saying it and if you are looking for something that is like the anime , look elsewhere where, like Teen Titans and Avatar. <br /> <br /> ADJL is typical. It's just like all the other Disney shows. An arrogant child main character who thinks he knows everything and does not bother to listen to people who are older than him and continues to make the same mistakes. Friends best friends. Repetitive texture with a twist. And sibling rivalry. Can't they once make a character who has a brain and isn't full of himself? Can't they have children who respect their elders? Can't think of something different with the plot? Can't the brothers get along and not hate each other? ADJL is too general, because you also have villains who are defeated and come back again, and they are also complete idiots, who have no background for their hatred. Come on, you will think that someone who is at least 30 years old will be able to out-wit at age 13. <br /> <br /> Watching ADJL is like watching almost anything else on TV these days, the same thing and more. Nothing special, just new design characters and a small idea that has been used again and again.
