In a world where humans can live forever, you spend the whole movie wishing to die. First of all if you insist on watching this movie you do two things before putting it on mute, don't worry you miss a storyline, hell they don't even speak for the first 70 minutes of an 87 minute movie, after being dumb you must now hit fast forward until the main chick dies, don't worry, even if you pay attention you won't know why or how she died. Once the "good part" is reached, take it mute. Oh, how will you know the good part, wait for a lift scene with two idiots in spacesuits with World War II weapons. These weapons won't look like much until you realize that the first character had a laser tag gun and a bandolier of CO2 cartridges. The only remains of a plot occur between a luminous ball and a semi-hot girl who appears to have been attacked by Wolverine. After listening to the "plot", you will want them to return to not talk. Of the four people who are part of this film, none of them can act at a distance, not even a little, you will have better luck in acting in a kindergarten theater. <br /> <br /> To comment on the special on the special effects, let me say "Wow", no, really, you'll spend the entire movie telling you "Where this film's $ 1.8 million budget went! " He will seriously leave you to the extent of ineptitude. The best "sets" are basically Windows wallpaper backgrounds. Ships are essentially wrenches, waiting for some to be barges that look like whales. I've never heard so many words invented in my whole life. They have buttons on the wrist (large pedometers) that can put them in "fight mode" and in super runing mode (makes them superfine). This will seriously drain their energy reserves but they will find pieces of chewing gears to regain their strength. The explosions were less impressive than my fourth of July, I only had streamers. <br /> <br /> So the plot, as far as I can imagine, is something like this "mother" is a captain spaceship and goes into the desert for a while a rocket dies. Then his 6000 year old daughter (no I'm not exaggerating) remembers her mother's memories through a sort of capsule. However, they start chatting for another 10 minutes and then the cause is a big bang. Yes, the same "Big Bang" that started our solar system. He explained how he goes back in time or something, no matter what happened, I think. Roll Credits Seriously the whole script was mercifully on a piece of paper, unless it actually described the terrible fight scenes. <br /> <br /> After seeing the credits I now laughed more than the entire movie did, the jobs created as restaurant supervisor "galactius sarcophagus" and then special thanks to George Lucas were the best. <br /> <br /> I didn't really expect so much for a movie that I paid 99 cents but seriously some the body owes me to this The most frequent comment heard after the movie "I want my life back". You have to admit that some, but put the time and effort into this film, but seriously, why?
