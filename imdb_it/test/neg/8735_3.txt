First of all I would like to declare - for the record - that it is incredibly stupid to call your film "Embryo" when the topic turns exclusively on scientific research carried out on fetuses (both animals and humans) of 12-16 weeks. The embryonic stage is finished at the end of the eighth week of pregnancy and from that moment the unborn subject enters the fetal phase. Okay, honestly, I didn't know all this, but I made the effort to look for it and this is also the last thing that the creators of "Embryo" could have done. Do not worry; I don't just want to stumble in detail or be overly bitter, as there are many other reasons to say why "Embryo" is a huge failure. Real science can be considered boring and inaccessible, and therefore science fiction is a cinematographic genre created specifically to make the otherwise boring but educational subjects of science more interesting and understandable to a wider public. Describing ambitious scientific experiments that go terribly wrong, or space missions that encounter evil aliens instead of light years of emptiness, filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects and, at the same time, teach them useful little trivia about science. To make a science fiction film good or at least half decent, writers and directors must adhere to one fundamental rule: NOT to be boring! If they fail to satisfy this unique condition, the viewer could also read a theoretically accurate book. Something must have gone wrong during the production of "Embryo" by Ralph Nelson. The basic premise is potentially fascinating and engaging, as we are all sensitive in saving the lives of unborn children. There were also very important names involved in the production, such as the main stars Rock Hudson ("Giant", "Seconds"), Diane Ladd ("Chinatown", "Alice does not live here anymore") and director Nelson himself was responsible for the acclaimed classics "Soldier Blue" and "Charly". So what went wrong? Simple. The script is hopelessly boring, clich√© and the whole thing seems incredibly stupid because the laboratory scenery and scientific equipment are clearly too primitive to achieve any medical breakthrough. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson, in a very poor performance, plays a doctor who has never put passion into his research work since his wife died. When his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night, his passion returns and he does everything he can to save the fetuses of dying animals. He manages to keep a fetus alive, accelerates his growth process impressively and prepares him to become an extremely intelligent dog. Because his procedure is so successful, Dr. Paul Holliston convinces his friend from the hospital to repeat the tests with the human fetus taken from the belly of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide. The female subject continues to grow at a fast pace, however, and after only a couple of weeks she is a mature, charming and super-intelligent woman. The good doctor naturally falls in love with her, but the innovative growth treatment also begins to show horrible side effects ... Absolutely nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film, apart from a lot of implausible and excessively melodramatic mumbo-jumbo and one or two profoundly impressive tricks performed by the dog. That second part of the film contains some (grotesque) action and suspense, but at that point the stupidity of the dialogues and the implausible plot have already ruined the potentially fabulous science fiction idea. There are some really interesting scenes, in particular the chess showdown between Victoria and Roddy McDowall (in a very memorable and ultra-hateful supporting role). The grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally on the verge of ridicule, and it almost seems as if Ralph Nelson inserted that last disastrous blow because it was the general rule in contemporary thriller and science fiction cinema. The last sequence, including the horrible freeze-frame shot at the end, certainly does not match the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the film. But anyway, sincere admiration and respect for the dog and his coaches. An animal with such an intellect and talent certainly deserved to show its tricks in a much better film.
