Mr. Moto's Gamble has a fairly straightforward plot: when a boxer is murdered in the ring with a mysterious poison, it's up to the mysterious Mr. Moto to solve the case. <br /> <br /> shocked by the number of positive reviews by Mr. Moto's Gamble on IMDb. Because for me ... well, I found it extremely disappointing. I like Mr. Moto and I like Charlie Chan, but I can't say I took care of this mixture of the two. For those who do not know the story of Mr. Moto's Gamble, it was originally supposed to be a Charlie Chan movie. But when Warner Oland backed off, some scenes and actions were rewritten for Peter Lorre and Mr. Moto. As I have indicated, the final result has left me undertone. Mr. Moto is not Chan. It's more mysterious, it's more athletic and it's more exotic. So trying to put Moto in a Chan movie is like trying to insert a square peg into a round hole - it doesn't work. And listening to Lorre / Moto tries to provide one of Chan's trademark euphemisms, it ends up sounding silly. Add to that the fact that almost 10 minutes of the already short 72-minute run time consisted of boxing scenes (something that never seemed fun to me) and ended up with a movie that I couldn't help but dislike. If I have to say something positive, I would point out Keye Luke's performance. But he isn't even close enough to save Mr. Moto's Gamble in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but a 4/10 is the best I can give to this.
