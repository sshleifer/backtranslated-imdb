It's horrible. <br /> <br /> A brief review, I know, but it's been a long time since a movie left me in such a bewildered state - wondering how the hell a movie like this is made. <Br /> <br /> The last time it happened was the "Mission to Mars" turkey in recent years. <br /> <br /> Salvatore Coco is a former swindler who tries to improve himself through self-help videos, endless seminars and improvement courses. He lives near the slogans that these courses expose. <br /> <br /> He runs into a singer in a flooded nightclub, played by Nikki Bennett, and has lighting; his new career will be that of a talent agent - with the singer as his one and only customer. <br /> <br /> Financed by his gospel song, paraplegic girlfriend, played by Sasha Horler - opens shop and tries to revive Nikki's career, with disastrous results. <br /> <br /> 'Walk the Talk' is the reason why Australians are so contemptuous of Australian cinema. It is poorly built, lame and very long (111 minutes for a play that should have barely scraped the 80 minute score). <br /> <br /> Each scene is too long and very repetitive. The public does not have a character to empathize with; a vital ingredient in a film like this apparently based on a "loser" who starts off. <br /> <br /> The negative and frankly poor ending comes at the end of the 30 minutes of dialogue and the most numb scenes you have been crying over a power outage. <br /> <br /> This film is a failure at all levels - made worse for the Queensland public by its liberal and inaccurate use of the various locations on the Gold Coast / Palm Beach; and its ridiculous use of Brisbane suburban names like Norman Park and Caboolture.
