I think my summary says it all. This response from MTV to the classic Candid Camera TV show presents a gen X (or is that kind of gen Y) that puts fake helicopters and wears various hats and wigs and glasses, and prepares people in rather bizarre situations, although often not very interesting. Example: Kennedy has a boyfriend who invites his parents to his "marriage". Kennedy is the bride, made in a full wedding dress and a long wig. The "joke" is that parents immediately understand that their child is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his "fragments". The problem is that this reasoning goes on too long, obviously to fill the time. And Kennedy is as much fun as a dead cod lying in the sun. Candid Camera would have performed three or four scenarios in the time it took Kennedy to overcome this, running around, constantly asking "Do I look fat?" I recognize that the show was not done for me. It was created for 12-year-old head artists who think that JACKASS is the pinnacle of today's comedy. So let them laugh. Thank God the show was short lived.
