I saw this movie in Edinbourgh's theater with 3 other Americans and our friend from Manchester and we thought it was a waste of time. We would have preferred to spend another hour more to watch the vocal dialogue of Star Wars III that was playing in the room compared to all this. <br /> <br /> Opening one of the worst jokes I've ever seen in celluloid on the big screen, it didn't take off with a bang. during the whole movie we had the feeling that the jokes were just trying too much, the writers thought so much about the setup that you could see the joke arrive 2 minutes before, then when it arrived it was so weak that you couldn't even smile; I mention the cum-ming giraffe as a prime example. <br /> <br /> The plot itself makes some interesting thoughts in my mind, which entertained me much more than what was happening on the screen. I think we could have done a lot more with that corner (the two different worlds, the experience of fish out of the water of the characters, confusion and surprise as people try to understand and distinguish the characters and the writers from the from each other.) But too much time is wasted to push this painful plot to the end with as much "bizarre" and "goof" as humanly possible. <br /> <br /> And to say that the characters of the 16th century show an extra talent on the part of writers is an insult to writers and intelligent editors who might have made this film a 40-minute rethink; but no, it is a full-length torture film of intolerance. <br /> <br /> As we were leaving the theater, which had a LOT of little laughter in it, I heard the young British hip-electro-clash couple behind me say, "It was pretty good, that's not true. What would have happened later ". And the girl replies "yes, rather surprising." and so it was. If this is what it means to get out of the British people from watching a comedy: don't laugh for 90 minutes but a little piece of communication between two lovers in the end, then this movie succeeded. But I have more faith in British life than that. <br /> <br /> I didn't, I laughed so much in a comedy film from American Pie II.
