Ok, so writer / director Larry Bishop obviously has important connections and knows the right people in Hollywood to produce their own film and fill the cast with catchy names. Good for him! Now what he really needs is inspiration and talent to come up with a really useful scenario, rather than the twisted and pretentious farce he wrote here. "Hell Ride" is not a film; it's a frantic and hopelessly fanatical attempt to pay tribute to the notorious motorcycle films of the 1960s and to the recently revived Grindhouse cinema formula in general. With "Hell Ride", Larry Bishop fails embarrassingly in his set-up and there are many obvious reasons for this. Doesn't it have a story to tell? or at least not very interesting ?? but seriously tries to explain it through numerous redundant twists, loads of free and very rude disloyalty on the part of women, too long and pitiful dialogues that aspire to be a great and cold quantity of senseless violence. The plot seems complex but can be summarized in a sentence. The ancient vengeance between two rival motorcycle gangs still blazes with the arrival of a new member; a boy who may or may not be the long lost son of a girl with a double cross who was executed in 1976. That's all, seriously! Everything else, from betraying gang members to recruiting old timer members to playing with his nymphomaniac girlfriend, is all useless and confusing. Another big problem in "Hell Ride" is Larry Bishop's tremendous and seemingly insatiable ego. Surely he should not have rewarded himself with the role of a tough and relentless gang leader, who presents himself as incredibly pretentious and petty; especially when there are so many other more experienced stars in the film. Of course, Bishop starred in a couple of authentic 60s biker exploitation films (like "The Savage Seven" and "Angel Unchained"), but it was a long time ago and honestly he's not as good an actor. Perhaps it was simply the lifelong dream of Bishop to play a character who always surpasses his enemies and for whom every hot babe desires sexually, and has just written an entire script. The cast veterans, like Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen, don't really care about leaving a plausible impression and I can't say I blame them. All this production is lame and pathetic and I can't bring myself to recommend it to anyone, regardless of the many beautiful girls who parade with naked breasts and bare cigarette ends.
