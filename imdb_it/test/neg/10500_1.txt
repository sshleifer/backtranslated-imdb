Normally I don't make "1" movies. Although I am a critic of HEARTLESS, I try to find everything that makes the film useful (ie, watchable). The main thing I look for is a coherent plot. If so, I can watch it! I would like to start by saying that this does not even deserve to be called a movie, this is more like an elementary school project ... it went terribly wrong! And I've seen all the science fiction film specials that have ever been made. <br /> <br /> Many times I read reviews of professional critics who say shit like "This one played like a Made-for-TV ... (etc. etc.)" and I kept saying "Oh, come on, I would like them to think of a real criticism ". Well, that's worse ... much worse! This is really the worst "thing" I've seen that lasted for a movie (if I had considered it a movie it would be my new worst movie of all time) and I've seen all the films made by Uwe Boll! This film makes Uwe Boll appear as Francis Ford Coppola! :) I'd rather watch Jaws the Revenge all day and then see it again this time ... even 5 minutes ... there was a good scene and it was the END! ;-P OK enough clubbing Ron Hall's work, now for serious criticism. <br /> <br /> The script is poorly written, the dialogue is delivered in a wooden way, the effects are more than those in a power The Rangers show, and they don't even let me start looking at the transitions zoom-in (ugh). Has anyone actually seen this, mounted it and then said "ok release it"? I would rather burn it than release it! In closing, all I can say is "Thank God DVD and VHS players have a Stop and Eject function!" My advice ... don't rent it, if you do, you'll be glad that you stopped and expelled too! :)
