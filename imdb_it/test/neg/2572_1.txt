This film is without doubt the worst action movie I've ever seen. I'm sorry, but it's just pathetic. In fact, the best part of the film (this film should be serious) is when a chicken crosses the street, on foot, about 100 miles an hour. This pathetic editing mistake makes the movie absolutely hilarious for about 2 seconds, so go back to "non stop, on the edge of your seat, while trying to find a comfortable position to sleep, action!"
