I read a lot of comments here about how this movie fits the book. I don't think any of them actually read. Edgar Rice wrote of a dangerous African jungle and the monkeys were murderers and hunters. Now we know differently and this film portrays monkeys in a more modern vision. I've never seen a Tarzan movie that even comes close to Edgar's vision. Maybe one day Hollywood with the trust of talented and respected authors to tell the story. So, if you've never read the book and enjoy a nice story of feelings and a soft vision of the wild bunny, maybe a good cry, watch the movie. I hope John Carter of Mars has more respect than Tarzan. We miss you, Edgar!
