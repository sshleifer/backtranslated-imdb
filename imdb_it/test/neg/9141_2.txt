This is such a complete failure that I get angry. <br /> <br /> All the subtleties and structure of the early Reggio films are over, leaving only a hash of digitally stained images whose sole purpose seems to be Whining About. The bad things human beings do. Just like the Star Trek spatial charts, the sand-colored seascapes, the obviously false computer icons and the athletic competition shots that, incidentally, show that no one has ever been able to overcome (or even match) Leni Riefenstahl to film moving bodies, assembled together with a video coloring overlay that a producer of "Dr. Who" in the 80s would have rejected as "too bad", adding a controversy against "civilized violence"? There is no intellectual, emotional or visceral connection between these images as assembled and changed by Reggio and too many artists of digital effects, and the story of admonitions that I presume he wanted to produce. With all the "dramaturgical consultants" involved, nobody seems to have come out of his feeling to say something important and considering that everyone might not be able to say something new. <br /> <br /> Only people who watch too much television could make a film like that and believe it is meaningful; this is the Stan Brakhage kindergarten, and finally structured in its relentless obviousness. The only irony and tension here evident (unlike "Koyaanisqatsi" where the inexorable beauty and strangeness of ordinary images altered by time forced you to consider their meaning) was when the DVD I was watching was blocked and skipped. This is MTV for Noam Chomsky's audience, based on reflection rather than reflection and meaning nothing. Two stars for music, which is in the best style of Pomo-Cesar Franck by Glass and contains a passionate cello by Yo-Yo Ma. (I hope for his interest not to have to record his parts for a reproduction of the film, there are some things you shouldn't even do for a salary.)
