Low budget horror movies. If you don't increase your expectations too high, you'll probably appreciate this little movie. The beginning and the end are quite good, sometimes the vehicle is dragged and seems to go nowhere for long periods, while we observe the vicissitudes of crazy people who add atmosphere but do not advance the plot. A lot of blood. I liked Bill McGhee's performance, which made it very credible for such an inexpensive portrait, he managed to bring the film to moments when nothing seemed to be happening. Nurse Charlotte Beale, played by Jesse Lee, played her character well, so be prepared to slap her towards the end! It makes some really stupid mistakes but then, that's what makes these low budget movies so good! I would have been out of that place and five states long before she thought it would be a good idea to leave! If you like this movie, try Committed from 1988, which is basically a rip off of this movie.
