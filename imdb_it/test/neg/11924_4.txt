While Aeon Flux was pleasantly fun and a slightly better way to spend a Wednesday night than the pub, I was glad you bought one get two free tickets. not knowing anything about the film how I went, I didn't really even know that there was an animated series before reading this site, I was ready for anything and, as noted by other viewers, the trailers showed a well-shot movie, good looking, and a interesting piece of cinema pulled me in the middle of the film, even though I was a little disappointed, it reminded me of the fifth element, but I feel that I still lacked some depth and left me with an empty feeling. and enough of useless and slightly boring gun fights, if you're going to do them, do it with a certain style, not just a lot of explosions and inept guards falling down. personally I would have preferred to see a little more about the history and the people in the city or to know more about how the president had been undermined, than yet another long and noisy firefight.
