For those who expect the cover and plot to indicate another fun Bollywood Indian production, beware: there are no musical dance numbers or songs of production value to cheer up the mood in this rather tired story of arranged marriages in the British Indian culture - with few variations introduced. As written by Roopesh Parekh, the script skips on topics worthy of discussion just to cover them with routine avoidance tactics. Harmage Singh Kalirai heads like a policeman, trying to hold together the disparate subplots to the point of the Keystone Cop tactics. <br /> <br /> Jimi (Chris Bisson) is a medical school student who is gay and has a lover Jack (Peter Ash) and lives with the Jewish mint, alcoholic, alcoholic of Jack, bisexed Vanessa (Sally Bankes ) and Sally's plump daughter, Hannah (Katy Clayton). Jimi's family is visited by the Patel family from Delhi who bring their beautiful daughter Simran (Jinder Mahal) to England to find a husband. Jimi's parents (Saeed Jaffrey and Jamila Massey) and his grandmother (Zohra Sehgal) decide that Simran is Jimi's girlfriend to get married and arrange an engagement and marriage in the custom of Indian ways - without consulting Jimi. Jimi discovers the plot and is too immense to not get along, a decision that rages Jack and infuriates Vanessa. Hannah tells a "little lie" to Simran (who is Jimi's daughter) and the marriage is off. When Jimi's parents visit Jimi's house they discover the drunken Vanessa, they are repulsed by her, but in the end they decide that for Jimi's happiness they will go together with the fact that Vanessa gave them a "granddaughter" and decide to use the preparations marriage like a wedding for Jimi and Vanessa. Jimi convinces Vanessa, very reluctant, to follow the idea and in a short time Vanessa is dressed in a sari, prepared for a wedding, and Jimi, terrified by what he is doing just to please his parents, includes Jack as his man best. At the wedding the truth comes out and to Jimi's surprise his family adapts to Jimi's true self and the day is saved simply because it is true. <br /> <br /> The cast faces this stupid little nonsense quite well and there are some good performances: Chris Bisson and Peter Ash are attractive men and play their roles well, even if without any indication of a relationship. 'love (the director seems terrified to show the least suggestion of intimacy between the two men); Sally Bankes provides most of the laughs like Vanessa; the rest of the cast repeats the stereotypical roles they have played countless times in Indian films. This is not a bad movie - it has its moments - but it is too superficial and tired to make us worry about any of the characters.
