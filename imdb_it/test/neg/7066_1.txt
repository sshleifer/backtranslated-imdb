I had this movie, in the back of my mind, I saw it. I wanted to tell people from time to time, but never remembered. now I found it. now finally, I can tell people exactly which is the worst film ever, the worst one I've ever seen in my life, no bar is. <br /> <br /> this film is complete garbage, and is unsuitable for a landfill. all prints and other copies of this film must be loaded on a large rocket and launched towards the sun. only the heat and pressure of purifying the sun may be able to purify the materials on which the film is stored, so that they can again be useful to the universe. <br /> <br /> I like movies. I like bad movies and yes this is an opinion. but this film was pure garbage, dirt and excrement of some beast that should never be seen, much less named by man. I'd rather watch a Uwe Boll Movie marathon than watch this movie. and I hate Uwe Boll's movies.
