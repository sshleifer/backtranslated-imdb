I respect Mike Hodges, and I enjoyed immensely having Carter for his bleak appearance, but The Croupier looks like a particularly boring ITV drama. <br /> <br /> Cold and reserved acting is not only the protagonist's prerogative, it is widespread in the entire cast, which means that there is nothing that contrasts Owen's character with. <br /> <br /> None of the characters evoke any kind of feeling, except boredom. The ending of the film is also messy at best. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera is pretty good, but if you want to see Hodges as the best Get Carter watch, don't waste your time with this uninteresting and unimaginative trail of emotions that it held better over 20 years
