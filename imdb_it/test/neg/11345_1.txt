Friend ... I liked Buffy and Angel as much as the next science fiction maniac ... but that's too much. The worst leading actress EVER !! Even David Boreanaz's "Hot Pants" can't save this shit. No wonder I NEVER watch the fox ?? blows !! We completely gave it a chance, and continued to suck. We observed four or five painful and painful episodes. I want to kill the execs at the net SO BAD! Why is the money spent on this drivel?!?! I do not understand and I do not support it and you must NEVER waste your time watching this show ... unless you like it when your EYES get SCORED FROM THEM! <br /> <br /> Shit. Crap. Crap.
