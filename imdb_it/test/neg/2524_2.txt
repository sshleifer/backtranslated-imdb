I had read online reviews that praised this obscure discovery as a combination of bloody horror, extravagant black comedy and borderline art-house; the film has elements of all three, to be sure, but they are at the service of such a supremely foolish premise (the title immediately distracts the game) ?? and amateur production to boot ?? that its long-term negligence due to a lack of proper distribution? basically until Cult Epics picked it up for DVD release for 30 years from its creation! ?? it was not a great loss for the cinema or even the genre (i). The bed was apparently created for the purpose of accommodating the love of a demon with a woman; however, a dying man who had used the quadrangle and even painted it ends up trapped in the wall behind the canvas (!) and provides intermittent comments to the action. Several people (from teenagers fleeing gangsters to hiding places) supply fodder to the perennially hungry bed; the latest on the menu are a trio of girls ?? one of which, however, remembers his long-time lover and, consequently, the bed seems to fear her! Seeing various objects ?? from cigars to fried chicken pieces ?? and the people who are swallowed (the belly of the bed is depicted as a tub of honey-colored liquid) makes the film slightly funny sometimes (especially when a young man's hands are reduced to their skeletal formation, which seems to take too easily in his stride!), but also terribly repetitive so that, even for a short period of 77 minutes, the whole exercise is useless and tense.
