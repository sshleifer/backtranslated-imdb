The people who criticized this film were looking for it as the first, which is not the case. This film was to be the complete opposite of Ocean's 11. This was said by many cast members and also by the director, Steven Soderbergh. The 12 of Ocean, while lacking a compelling storyline, were hit because it was different from what people wanted. Had it been released before Ocean 11, it would have been taken very differently, not as a failed sequel. The problem with sequels is that people try with a predefined idea of ​​how it should be and have many expectations. They should go into this movie with an open mind and not expect it to be "Ocean's 11, again".
