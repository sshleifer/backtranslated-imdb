I'm a big fan of The ABC Movies of the Week genre. I'm only 27, which means I wasn't even born until after the end of the series, but I'm trying to collect as many as possible on DVD. I have about a dozen or so. I had read such wonderful things about this film, both here and elsewhere, that I was really excited to see it. I just received my DVD by post today and watched it anxiously. I must admit that the first two phone calls gave me the creeps - that boyish voice would have given anyone goose bumps! But it started to fade quickly and the whole divorce subplot was stupid. I also realized that Michael Douglas was the antagonist about half an hour before the end of the film. As soon as the story of how the character of Elizabeth Ashley had locked up her mother was told, I knew there was something suspicious. Besides, has anyone ever thought of asking him why he happened to appear suddenly that night when the fire occurred in the barn? I have to admit that I thought he was training a boy at school to make phone calls. I didn't imagine the part of the dumb boy or the pre-recorded tapes (had they ever said whose voice it was?) I doubt Douglas could ever get his voice so high?). <br /> <br /> It's just me giving this movie a four out of ten because I actually liked most of the acting. Ashley is particularly beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because this movie has such a big premise, but oh, well, that's what happens sometimes when you hope too much for a movie.
