All those who are in the PC culture are amazed by the dogmatic Christian vision of this film, arguing that it contains racist ideation and / or religious intolerance. <br /> <br /> Those who do not care about this but are oriented towards slick production values ​​and competent acting are appalled by the lack of such here. <br /> <br /> Those who denigrate both are apoplectic that this production was escaped from the general public, as evidenced in the comments here. br /> <br /> What is an interesting premise, which is not original, but is a combination of GHOST and FROM BEYOND, is treated rather immature in this film, but done with taste. What the crew and actors lacked sensitivity, professional skills and technical competence is somehow counterbalanced by the intensity they show. <br /> <br /> It is not as bad as many people think here, and it would have been good in someone's hands with maturity and common sense, and it is enough below mediocrity to arouse laughter and groans. However, it develops with sufficient intensity to maintain interest in everything, and is close to equality with a voice produced by Corman of his first period of work, or the material of Arkoff or Sam Katzman. If you take it for $ 2 (or less) like I did, you won't feel disappointed, but you'll want to have a say in how it's done.
