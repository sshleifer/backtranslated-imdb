Was this supposed to be a comedy? The black coat and the skeletal mask are hilarious. There is like a zero plot. The film begins with an archaeologist and his assistant. They make a small mention of their excavation site being cursed. And then, here ... in Halloween Costume Man drops, dressed in a shiny black cape, with a skeleton mask face, holding an ax. So kill these two people. Then we cut the woods with a bad Predator imitation, only the commandos are driven out of Costume Halloween man who now rides a horse! More commands appear, but these people should be disguised as a group of hikers. Yes, probably the production has finished the commando costumes. Can you say, low budget? However, they come across a lonely old Indian sitting in the woods. It is too funny. And start babbling something, but you really don't know what's muttering, so they flashback to some Indians who are killed. None of this really makes sense. And then we go back to our commandos where they are killed more than them. And this is basically the plot. It's so incredibly ugly, you just can't look away because you want to see how low it sinks. You could make the same movie with a video camera, a Halloween costume and a group of your friends with fake guns. Don't see this if you want a horror movie. If you want a play, maybe? Or just jump and get something like the real Predator.
