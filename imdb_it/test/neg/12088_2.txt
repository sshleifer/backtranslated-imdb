The housekeeper was, by far, a very pitiful film. I don't use this word roughly, as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie. I finished looking at this feature with just a word on my mind ?? "why"? Honestly, you could use this question at the end of every scene in this movie and it would seem to be suitable. There were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development (both in history and in characters) that eventually lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through movements instead of giving any explanation. The scenes would occur without prefiguring, understanding or leading to a complete ending. It was as if I were looking at different ideas thrown together without a real resolution. The actors were setting up events that didn't seem to fit their character or were really solved. This was my biggest problem with this movie. The complete and total lack of structure of this film has brought all the starting points to ruin, with a real "chain effect" that made itself felt throughout the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Let me explain more about this lack of consistency throughout the film. I would compare this film to a bowl of lumpy oatmeal that contained a zebra. It made no sense nor was there any logic behind all this. Minnie Driver was the worst culprit in this action. His character's lines were drawn very blurry and almost transparent. He would do things like talk about sex all the time with his sister, but despite this he always seemed very open to sexual experiences. She has her first moment of passion in this film, and there is no pain or excitement. It happens with nonchalance, and this does not seem to fit the original conversation we had at the beginning of the film with Rosina and her sister. Is she a very intelligent woman who accidentally finds a solution to Wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants full rights for her invention? This was confusing and completely random. It is not obvious to anyone else that his teaching methods were non-existent. Someone in his right mind could see that he was not teaching anything to Cavendish's daughter. The sudden and embarrassing relationship that accidentally forms between Driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers almost made me laugh out loud. I thought maybe I had discovered some magic in this film, since Rhys-Meyers literally "took a little" in the scene and suddenly caused an unnecessary drama. It seemed that the director (or writer) thought that the original story was not going anywhere fast, so adding this random character we might be able to advance the plot a bit (or confuse minor movie fans). Well, it didn't deceive me, I saw that it was almost a "cut-and-paste" character used to reinforce an already weakened story. Don't get me started on the finale, which was inconsistent with the rest of the story. Still using the "cut and paste" method, the writer of this film needed a way to end the story, and this was the only solution they could get. Is it sad when the actors are forced to do things outside the character ?? but I guess this is the name of the Hollywood game. Fixed the issue until it is completely broken, or at least recoverable. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story was a little exciting dribble. There were perhaps a handful of moments of clean cinematography in which one could see that there was a fragment of creativity trying to reach the peak together with some jokes of decent music, vintage, but nothing to write to the grandmother. A more familiar structure with some stronger introductions could have strengthened this film a little more, but as I stated earlier, leaving the endless scenes that lie around the entire film, you will experience a crack in your foundations. What may seem like a robust story will eventually fade over time, and by the end of this film I felt that the house was crumbling over me. Wilkinson plays himself in this film, while the pilot apparently didn't want to remain naked, but all the others (I'll have to see a doctor after those images were burned in my eyes ??? Also, he wore the same suit every day "It was disgusting and I could smell it through the television. Sex and dirty laundry. Now there's a great movie for you! There seemed to be some floating potential here, but instead it was just garbage. Nothing was answered, the questions were answered they seemed to fall like snow in Alaska, and mediocrity seemed to reign supreme. <br /> <br /> Overall, this may have been a decent film that combined the powerful themes of science and love together, but instead it was just pitiful I cannot stress enough the disturbing fact that the characters are going through movements without any kind of pre-explanation, I don't need cinematographic moments passed to me as a child, but something it should be done to build a base. Just remember the oatmeal with a zebra analogy that I used. If you were so confused about what I was, then you will completely understand the movie The Governess, while if you prefer zebras in your oatmeal ?? then, maybe this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> Vote: * on *****
