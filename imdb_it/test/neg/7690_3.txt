The amount of hype and the enormous success that this film has met testify to how desperate our people are to a good independent Saudi film. In fact, the huge success of "Tash ma Tash" is also a test. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to start thinking about how important the making of the film is, since it's obvious to those with half brains like the movies I changed the world. <br /> <br /> And I will not say how much our society needs a lot of films to solve many of the problems we have in our country. Religion, politics, women's rights, education, general health, terrorism, law and many others. <br /> <br /> News has arrived about the first Saudi film that should have been a remedy for some of the problems we have, especially towards young people. Instead we experienced a bald film for that matter. <br /> <br /> The ignorance and ingenuity of the script were obvious. It was as if it had been written by a thirteen year old. <br /> <br /> Now I have heard that the budget for this film was enormous. I'd like to know where the money went, eh? The effects were really bad, the editing was poor. The script was "kharabeet". You really don't know what the plot is and what the director aims from this movie. <br /> <br /> A note about the actor who played the religious brother, his performance was good but with bad direction. Another thing with the role of the religious friends he has had is not what religious boys do here in Saudi Arabia! They are not "bad" as this film means. In fact they are some of the nicest people you've ever met with a really unusual lifestyle, and that's what should have appeared in the film. <br /> <br /> Young people follow the religious here because of a reason, and that is the young are the most passionate and sentimental. And with the well-formed principles on which the religious live, young people follow them. Once again, this is what should have appeared. <br /> <br /> We need another "First Film" with a writer, actor, director, composer, even cameraman. So they all work with passion for their experiment, not just for the money! <br /> <br /> And we should do what Shakespeare did hundreds of years ago, we should include the phrases from the Koran in the script of the film. Because the people in our society still see art as a form of sin, the challenge that a Saudi filmmaker is facing is changing the mentality in that corner.
