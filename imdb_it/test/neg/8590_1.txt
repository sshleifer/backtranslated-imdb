I just returned from "AGS". After seeing it, I am convinced that no matter how it was written about how he did extensive research on the film, Stone NEVER saw an NFL game in his life. Great cinematography? Give me a break. The game's montages were almost impossible to achieve and 90% of the other shots in the film were close-ups. Was there ANYTHING in this movie that was not brought to "North Dallas Forty"? <br /> <br /> Seasoned star player ... check. Hot young ... check. Painkillers .... check. The owner who does not "understand" .... checks. Crazy out-of-field behavior .... check <br /> <br /> Also, it's the playoffs in Dallas (ie December or January) in an outdoor stadium, yet the people sitting there in tank tops and shorts! And what was with those lights? Were they playing in a Japanese Kabuki theater or in a sports stadium? <br /> <br /> And the strategy shown in the game was ridiculous. He is fourth and 1 in the "Sharks" "30. Dallas leads 35-31. DISCOVER THE FRIENDLY FIELD OBJECTIVE. Not only would this have made sense from the point of view of football, but you would have had an even better final sequence where they could score and had to go for the two-point conversion. Hell, bind the game with the extra point and Stone could have done it even 3 hours with overtime. <br /> <br /> Were the laces set up by the players of "old time" football that should be a tribute to the game? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> And the script ... ugh. More clich√©s of what you can shake a stick to .. oops, n ' it's another. <br /> <br /> "Slapshot" was better than this movie. By far. <br /> <br /> 1/10. <br /> <br /> Skip this at all costs. <br /> <br />
