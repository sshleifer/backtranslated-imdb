European films may be slower and less plot-driven than American films, but this takes it too far. It also shows a lot of incompletely drawn characters who do inexplicable things. It's not a fantasy, it's not even surreal, it's just embarrassing and ugly. <br /> <br /> What is the message here? That people in France are pensive and fix very often? What do they like to watch other people having sex? Do they scream or touch a stranger spontaneously on his neck? Do not wear a watch when watching this film, as you will be amazed at how little is explained or learned in huge periods of time. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a "police superintendent" who is deeply troubled by the brutal murder of a child, although he actually looks upset before then. He is not simply upset by his personal tragedies, but seemingly slowly enough, behaving very much like a six-year-old child disabled by learning. He looks very empty, he walks with stiff arms like a child, he speaks in a gentle way, with his minds, his tones, he behaves quite strangely in all his interactions (although no one seems to notice or worry, even when it should be a police affair). He is not a distressed policeman, more ambulatory. Picture The character of Andy Kaufman on Taxi, but without humor. Not only is he not credible as a policeman, he is not credible as an adult. The fact that he won a prize for this interpretation of his character is truly amazing - unless he played the part exactly as written and the blame is on the strange ones who wrote this thing. The plot is clearly secondary. Don't expect to see anything remotely similar to what the police would do if a murdered child were found. This is not so important, even if the implausibility of their behavior is a kind of insult. The problem is that the rest of the film also makes no sense. This leaves the long foregrounds of the fields, the vegetable gardens, the faces of the people etc. The ending struck me as particularly ridiculous - totally unsupported by previous events - unless you think "What is the worst way this film could end?" <br /> <br /> There is a lot of sex and nudity , which should mean something. Do you want vaginas? You'll see the vaginas. Don't worry, it's art. It has a profound meaning, what I am not sure. And the protagonist, despite his innocent strangeness, seems to have a sort of homoerotic neck or rascal fetish. <br /> <br /> Finally, the subtitles are white and often appear on a white background - very difficult to read many of them. On the other hand, there is not much dialogue, so this is not a big problem. There is also a very small sound - not even the ambient sounds you would expect to hear - in the film, contributing to the emptiness of the whole experience. Old Woody Allen would have had a field day parody of this work. <br /> <br /> That this is an award-winning film is sad. I'd hate to see the losing films. <br /> <br /> Enjoy yourself.
