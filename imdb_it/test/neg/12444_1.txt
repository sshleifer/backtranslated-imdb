Everyone has already commented on the obvious fact that the first comments were obviously of people who had an interest in the film or had friends / family who had an interest in the film, and that's fine - if I had made a movie, all of my family and friends I'd be in there to compliment myself. In all honesty, there are some good things along with the bad things in this movie. Unfortunately, bad things far outweigh good things. Well: the general plot was slightly interesting. The music was overall pretty good. Many of the songs (when you could hear them) were really nice. The only musical problems I had were: # 1) the first suspense scene with a kind of silent instrument (it really seemed to take away the suspense), # 2) the song that was played when the protagonists went to an outdoor party at a friend's house and # 3) the songs that were good were too quiet, especially when a heavy metal song played in the background while Danny Trejo hanged a man (it sounded like a nice song, but it should have been ripped off the scene when Danny Trejo got the fog). Now for completely bad things: the script was atrocious. I mean, HORRIBLE. I've seen more fluid dialogues in a Star Wars movie. Advice to the writer of a part-time writer and fan of full-time films: when you write a dialogue, ask yourself: "Is it something that people would really say?" Honestly, the script was ridiculous. I want to beat acting, but with that kind of writing, it's hard to know if they have talent or not. The slightly interesting plot was seriously hampered by the lousy dialogue. I know it was low budget, but words don't cost money: if you have a good script, even semi-competent actors can do it. Even this film seemed not to have, but I hope the director has a second chance to make a better film.
