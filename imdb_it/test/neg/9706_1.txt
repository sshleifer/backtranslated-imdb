I went to see suspect that I would hate him, I did it. Everything was wrong; it was like they were filming another book. Granted the places and the houses very pretty (if not a little uncomfortable - yes, even the house was wrong for their parts) Keira was too modern, boring and honestly, I found it unpleasant to see it. If everyone else saw Darcy as a god of sex, the writer of this considered him sexually frustrated and inadequate. Bingley was stupid and dippy (he is not meant to be) and Bennett's inhabitants proved destitute and, for unknown reasons, farmers, this is incorrect and ridiculous. The idea that Mr. Bennett would answer the door with his night gear with the rest of the family in his underwear in the middle of the night is stupid. They had servants. Mr. Collins was not repulsive and greasy just stupid and hateful, Georgina Darcy was ugly and old and Miss Bingley wore a sleeveless dress, what! As if! It is historically inaccurate and even the ending is unsatisfactory. I could go on for days. I hated it so much not only was it nothing like the book, but I fear that for many people it will be their first experience of this great novel and will give them the worst possible idea. The BBC version is so superior that it's not even funny and everything about this version is an insult to his memory. In short, if you have to see it make sure you read the book first or have seen the BBC version in other ways, you will be led to make the disappointed way that this is what it is, and it is not!
