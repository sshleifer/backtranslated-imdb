In Pasadena, Mrs. Davis (Joanna Cassidy) sends her daughter Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) to Tokyo to bring her sister Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who is interned in a hospital after surviving a fire, back in the States US. After their meeting, Karen dies and Aubrey decides to investigate what happened to her and gets cursed in the same situation, chased by the ghost of the house. Meanwhile in Tokyo, the three high school classmates Allison (Arielle Kebbel), Vanessa (Teresa Palmer) and Miyuki (Misako Uno) visit the famous haunted house and are also cursed and chased by the ghost. In Chicago, Trish (Jennifer Beals) moves into the apartment of her boyfriend Bill (Christopher Cousins), who lives with her children, the teenager Lacey (Sarah Roehmer) and the boy Jake (Matthew Knight). Next door, strange things happen with their neighbor. <br /> <br /> "The Grudge 2" has a scary sound and visual effects, with the creepy woman and the boy, and I caught a couple of times while watching this movie. However, the complex script with three subplots is totally confusing, making the story intertwined a complete disaster. There are too many characters and situations, and at one point I was completely lost with the disconnected and fragmented narrative. In the end, I was completely disappointed with this confusing, but also spooky film. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Grito 2" ("The Scream 2")
