There are some nonsense involving Siamese twins, a pan-to-the-head-obvious frying joke, a reasonable amount of bare tits, low budget to ridiculous production values, a script that would make Syd cry Field, acting that in principle only an Ed Wood could love, and the camera-operates a step above the pedestrian. The device of the serrated vagina could have been an interesting horror film, but "Angst" fails the premise. Strictly out of tune, and even then, much better could be done. Sturgeon's law (or Apocalypse) is still valid.
