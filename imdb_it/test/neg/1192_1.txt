Don't get me wrong, I love the League of Gentlemen TV series. It was fun, twisted and completely inspired. I couldn't wait to see the movie, the premise was interesting and I couldn't wait to see what they had done with the characters and where the bizarre plot would take them. <br /> <br /> It was a total disappointment, for beginners the three weakest characters in the series were the leads and contained only bits for the other characters (why not choose mickey and Pauline, Pope Lazaro or tanks and Edward for the main parts!?). It wasn't fun from one end to the other, half-hidden gags and poor beat humor. <br /> <br /> The real cover was the simple drama / comedy of the ridiculous period (and I will freely use the word comedy). He was distracted from the main plot and felt uncomfortable, not to say painfully little fun. The direction of the film is frightening and it is often felt that the lines were delivered by the characters in a single shot. Very hasty. <br /> <br /> So - the three-headed plasticine monster. What the hell was that all about? Simply ridiculous, I felt like the League of gentlemen finally tagged it. <br /> <br /> All in all I found myself looking at my watch and sighing with disappointment for all my experience of the movie. What was once an extraordinary television series was contaminated by a terribly unpleasant film. <br /> <br /> If I could give it, I would do it on 0 out of 10. Don't waste your money seeing this.
