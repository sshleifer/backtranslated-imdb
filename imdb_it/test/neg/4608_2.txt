I would have given this film a 1, but I laughed so much, so many times, that I had to give it a little credit, in the off off off chance the movie had to be fun. Such a bad movie you will think that chimpanzees have written it. You will want the chimpanzees to have written it. The dialogue is so staged that only he and the cockroaches will survive the next nuclear holocaust. The film exaggerates its terrible intertwining scenes of Original Carrie (a really beautiful film) in scenes of this. Like the scenes that intersect from Taxi Driver to Baby Geniuses. Do not rent it alone, because you will NOT like the experience. You will need someone next to you to confirm the wickedness of what you are viewing. The worst actress of the Millennium goes to poor poor Amy Irving as a school adviser of stone, monotonous, disastrously in wood. The worst movie of the year so far (see also _Arlington Road_). --FRINK-3
