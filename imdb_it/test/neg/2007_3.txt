Wow, there's a lot of poison directed at this film, and much is deserved, but it's not the worst movie of all time. (Probably it's "Zoolander".) <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you're in the mood for something, really drunk, or just the mood for a "B-minus-minus" movie that you can tease , this could be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Yes, as others have said, the first part of the film makes you think you are looking at an update of Bram Stoker's novel. Two of the main characters are called Van Helsing and Mina, the ship is the Demeter and they are in the Carpathian galaxy. Later you will discover that Van Helsing is a descendant of the original and that he is on a ship in the 30th century with Dracula. Suuuuuuuuuuure. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and to add to the originality, this "ghostly ghost ship" movie has another character named Ash. Does it sound familiar? <br /> <br /> There is a very subtle character development and anachronisms like the aforementioned manual wheelchair, and Coolio and Tom Lister speak of 20th century black jargon. But what makes the film really ridiculous is the ending. If THIS is what happens to the characters, then the previous two hours were a rejection. <br /> <br /> As I said, you want a stupid movie to play "Mystery Science Theater" with, and your mind is in roughly the same mode required for viewing the "Great Vegetable Rebellion" episode of LOST IN SPACE, so you might find this kind of deviation. Otherwise, put a pole, it's done.
