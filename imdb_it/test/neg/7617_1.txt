I have been a fan of Jim Henson and his characters from the beginning. The most fascinating thing about them was the love, innocence and camaraderie shown. Kermit was a model of deep thinking and problem solving. A spiritual character, but gently and credibly so. All the other characters were slightly eccentric, but showed how different types of beings can coexist in a thoughtful way together, respecting the difference of the other. <br /> <br /> The following films have somehow maintained the same atmosphere. Yet this "is a very cheerful Muppet Christmas movie" would make Jim Henson turn to his grave. These characters have been completely rewritten to be excited, bad, selfish and in bad taste. <br /> <br /> The cast continues to play God as an indifferent corporate head, with an evil streak. The angels as a company staff without a backbone and not a spiritual one, and the film was so ugly that I had to stop looking. I had bought it for my great-grandson but luckily I have a preview of everything I gave to a child. <br /> <br /> This film deserved the trash instead and has no socially redeeming content or charm. <br /> <br /> Shame, shame on the people who rewrote the characters and started from Jim Henson's original heart-centered and socially conscious version. It makes a terrible disservice to a man with a big heart who is no longer around to defend his creations.
