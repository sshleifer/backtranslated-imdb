Beethovan Lives Upstairs is a very bad film. In my world history course, our teacher showed us this film and Amadeus to compare the two composers or something like that. We watched Amadeus first and it was a great movie, but when he showed us this movie right after, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The acting was horrible, the costumes were ugly (the boy was particularly ugly and boyish) and the cinematography was first choice. My friend compared it to a movie without displaying the date in the lower right corner. I understand that this is a T.V. from Canada and probably costs $ 10 to do, but please, they could have done better. I saw some good T.V. in my time, but this was not one of them. The biggest thing I don't understand is why my world history lesson couldn't just look at Immortal Beloveds or something. How can composers be compared when the film Amadeus is given, for Mozart and Beethovan Lives Upstairs, for Beethovan? It is not possible to do this when this is the choice of the film for Beethovan. I give Amadeus an A- (9 out of 10) if anyone wants to know, but Beethovan Lives Upstairs gets an F (1 out of 10).
