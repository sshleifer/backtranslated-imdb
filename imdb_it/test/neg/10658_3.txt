Two redeeming qualities of this film were the cinemaphotography and a plot that was hard to resist. However, the script, the direction and some scenes were simply horrible. I kept wondering why such a good cast would make such a bad movie. My only conclusion was that these actors had to believe in the charity that underlies the film's plot, but he knew the film was full of flaws. <br /> <br /> This film could have been much better and reached a wider audience accordingly. What makes me think that this is with all the problems of the film, some painful scenes to watch, I still wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would be solved by itself.
