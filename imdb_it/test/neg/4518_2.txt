Why does this film have so many rave reviews? <br /> <br /> This is amateur, not fun and annoying. <br /> <br /> The only memorable thing here is the title song. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are low and the "comic" ideas (if you want to call them that) are weak, they look like SNL leftovers that even they would not have dared to put on screen. <br /> <br /> I'm starting to completely challenge the ratings of IMDb. <br /> <br /> We are light years away from the Kentucky Fried Movie - not even in the Galaxy itself. <br /> <br /> It is not even possible to write 10 lines about it. <br /> <br /> OK, another good thing: bad street scenes and bad people - something you don't see much in today's movies and TV.
