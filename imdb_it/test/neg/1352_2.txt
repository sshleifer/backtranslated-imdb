To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. An amateur film made by professionals. I was about to leave the theater on two or three occasions (something I never did) I was stopped by Cloris Leachman indeed. Sounds real, the only one I should say. These new women are less modern than the women of George Cukor in the 1930s. These are "acting" for us trying to be with it, but their "conflict" is exactly the same as it has always been, in the movies anyway. The fun of the original was based on a clear, vitriolic and very entertaining script. A masterful direction and an unrepeatable cast. All the elements that are missing here. TV actresses who mix with models and candidates / candidates for the Oscar. There was nothing organic in this. The whole thing seemed a staging, improvised in the moment without a clear objective. 2/10
