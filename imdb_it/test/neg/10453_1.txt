Sorry, after seeing the credits, I thought this would be a dignified tribute to the retired SF actors. <br /> <br /> Boy was I wrong. <br /> <br /> Direction and plot tell in this POS are terrible. I have never been so insulted by a production. <br /> <br /> I have great respect and love for many of the actors in this "movie", but I must say that they have been scammed. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this debacle yet, do yourself a favor and stay away. These are not just two hours you won't come back, but they will also ruin your respect for some actors that you may have enjoyed once.
