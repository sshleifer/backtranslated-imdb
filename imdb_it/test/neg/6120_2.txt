For any wrestling enthusiast, this is the wrestle game to forget. No logic to the games, some junk gimmicks (doink the clown, and the Giant Gonzalez) this was a forgettable PPV something rare for the WWE (F). The logic of Hogan winning the world title in the end made no sense, and many people feel that by themselves they help put the nail in the PPV. From the meaningless expedients of the Roman soldiers, to simply some bad wrestling (Doink vs Crush is the worst game) to the simple bad game (Scott "Razor Ramon vs Bob Backlund, how can you have one of the biggest mats wrestlers, making a return , and working on his first wrestlemania, he faces a power wrestler who was undefeated at the time), this is a PPV that even WWE admitted was far below what was expected.
