I was at Wrestlemania VI in Toronto since I was 10, and the event I saw back then was very different from what I saw on the Wrestlemania Collection DVD I just saw. I don't understand how wwE does not have rights to part of the old music, since most of those songs were created by the WWF that shouldn't worry about licensing fees and royalties that prevent showing shows like SNLs. Seasonal. It's rather stupid to complain, but for me to hear Demolition going out with their theme music in a Wrestlemania in person was a memory I never forgot, and it didn't exist on this DVD. What is the point of them even if they have the rights to this huge video library if they have to modify it so drastically as to use it?
