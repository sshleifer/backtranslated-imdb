Poor Bela Lugosi. Just another day at work. A group of saboteurs trying to stop the American war effort from within. At first it is rather difficult to understand why, while we know that these guys are doing something, their method of functioning is not very clear. I won't ruin it, but the finish is rather surprising. There are a number of murders perpetrated by our hero. A police force that doesn't know what's going on. What a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house. There are comments like: "A true patriot would do this or that". It is obvious while the suspect abounds most of the world would not know a spy or a subversive if he jumped up and bitten them. I was also surprised to see Clayton Moore (the Lone Ranger) in a romantic role. I never realized he had ever done anything but sit on a horse. There is, of course, the complacency of the criminals who think they are immune from the murderer's guest list. However, Bela is kind of a good guy and a bad guy turned into one. The best scene in the film is at the end, but I won't ruin it. As a curiosity, and a vintage piece, it can be fun to watch for some people.
