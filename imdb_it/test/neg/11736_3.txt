Norm (a) ally I don't mind doing again. There are some pretty good ones out there, BUT this is a stinker! Considering that it was practically scene by scene, he had a good story and great actors. Van Sant copied the direction of Al practically flawlessly, and added the color (I'm not one of those who think it's classic B & W). It must have been at least a mediocre film ... but it was the caa-caa of pee! I don't understand how it could have been ruined so badly. If you have to, look at it as a curiosity, but I suggest you don't bother yourself.
