I'm a Boorman fan, but this is probably his least successful film. Comedy has never been his strong suit, and here his attempts at doublet are awkwardly made. However, it's almost worth seeing for Boorman's eye for talent: this is one of Uma Thurman's first starring roles, and as always it's lovely to watch. (On a sad note, Boorman wrote the script with his daughter, Telsche, who died a couple of years ago.)
