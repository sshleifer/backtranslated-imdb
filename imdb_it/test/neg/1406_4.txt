Independent film viewers know that once or twice a year they will see stories of dysfunctional families and have been expecting them and it is increasingly becoming a challenge to keep them fresh but here, despite the good cast, it only seems more of the same. Story tells of the Travis family that is trying to recover from the suicide of Matt (Kip Pardue), a very promising swimmer from high school. Ben (Jeff Daniels) is the father who retires from everyone and has never treated his other son Tim (Emile Hirsch) and Matt but lets his mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) find her escort (of some sort) of pot and starts smoking. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Sandy also starts flirting with much younger men like the cashier at the grocery store checkout, but when she tries to buy more marijuana she is caught and taken to prison. He doesn't tell anyone what happened, but he finds bruises on Tim's body and also that Ben took leave from work. After all this, Sandy falls ill and lands in the hospital where his life is in danger, forcing Ben to realize that he may have to come to terms with the loss of another part of his family. <br /> <br /> This film is written and directed by Dan Harris who worked with Bryan Singer in "X2" and also in the next Superman movie and while his script allows these characters to have real moments of expressing their grief and their confusion the story (for me) has too many things The script touches on so many different areas that it is necessary to have a score sheet to keep track of them all, including drugs, sex, love, infidelity, abuse, abandonment, experimentation of homosexuality and a life-threatening disease. If all these scenarios weren't enough for you, Harris will notice a twist in the end that should summarize and explain most of everyone's feelings towards Tim. While I was rolling my eyes at least 2 or 3 times with the way the script kept unrolling one thing after another, I must admit that I didn't hate this movie and I have to give credit to the actors. Everyone has at least one good scene somewhere in the film, but I wish the story would focus more on Weaver and his character than on Hirsch. Weaver is exceptional and with a more precise script he could have had a role that might have led to an Oscar nomination but instead we have endless scenes of Hirsch at parties or his shenanigans with the neighbor. Harris shows that he can be a good writer / director, but with this effort he throws so many different things to the public that the material only becomes tiring and contrived.
