An exceptional cast, a fantastic CGI monster and a brilliant script. If this movie had one of those things then it might not have been among the worst movies I've ever wasted an hour and a half. Infinite chimpanzees with endless typewriters have not yet written the complete works of Shakespeare but along the way this has appeared in their wastepaper basket and somehow been turned into a movie. You can tell the repentant actors to sign those contracts with every word that mumble directly into the camera. The CGI is amateur to the extreme and may have created more tension than the cast that was attacked with the Sinclair Spectrum on which it was created. I wanted this film to like it, it has some nice cameo appearances by Gil Gerard and Walter Koenig so I was expecting a funny horror movie that didn't take itself too seriously. He actually tries to take himself seriously, but it's as fun as the trip to the dentist. Do yourself a favor Do not watch this movie, you will only encourage them to do more.
