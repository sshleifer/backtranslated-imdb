Significant spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is a sick and disturbing film ... just like the sick and twisted director, Jennifer Chambers Lynch, who also wrote it. I don't even know why I gave this film a rating of 2. It's not the actors' fault. The cast has certainly played their roles well. It's the way this film was written and the way the characters were written that was the benchmark of a really sick mind. <br /> <br /> I know I will never watch, never another film that was written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch. It is a deviated sick, twisted, clumsy and vulgar. She seems, speaks and plays like a biker girl with a drug-fried brain, who has spent 20 years struggling. You can clearly see what kind of person you are by looking at the special features section of the "Surveillance: The Watched Watching" DVD. You can see it and listen to it for yourself. It was as bad as I had imagined from writing this film. <br /> <br /> I am not shocked by the bad language, although this director certainly talks like a sailor. This goes far beyond simple bad language; worse than any movie film. The level of implicit violence of sado and perversion that it incorporates in every character you write is of the kind that is even illegal according to the p0rn standards. This perverse and disturbing thought is clearly evident in his own personality and in the things he says. Another reviewer found the description I was looking for. This is a snuff movie. <br /> <br /> Make sure you hear his narration on the deleted scenes and the alternate ending. This director / writer is really a sick person. I can't believe someone would have named her responsible for a movie, much less would pay for it. You can be sure that I will never, ever, ever watch another film with which it has been affiliated. In the thousands of films I've seen and collected, there are only a couple of directors and writers who have deserved this kind of boycott. It's offensive beyond any other person I've ever seen connected with filming a movie before. There were bad directors and writers, but nobody could compare to his sick and twisted mind. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, that was just a murder unleashed after another. Once the murder was over at the hotel ... then the sick policemen who shot and brutalized the drivers for the kicks ... the family on vacation with the bad parents (who had no business in the presence of children) ... followed by drug addict .... the film then went to the (even more) serial killer diverted and diverted. <br /> <br /> As I've seen the serial killers turn out, I started wondering what kind of really sick mind wrote this movie. Those were my real thoughts while watching this movie. I completely intended to find out which writer had such a sick mind ... because this writer seriously needs to be committed to long-term psychiatric treatment. To my surprise, he turned out to be the director. When I saw and heard what he had to say on the DVD, I realized that my assessment of the writer was right on the nose. On the DVD, he was really the sick and twisted person I had imagined writing such a disturbing film. <br /> <br /> While the girl, (Stephanie) Ryan Simpkins, has really stolen the show ... I can do it I think her real life parents would have tolerated that this sick, foul-mouthed director could be close to their daughter. <br /> <br /> This film is disturbing, sick, offensive, distorted and the director and director need some serious treatment in a mental structure. <br /> <br /> As for the end of the film ... the alternative ending, should have been the result of this terrible ordeal. There was no point and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the film from the death of the other character. I am amazed that any studio has actually distributed the film. The trailer was completely misleading. The only reason the film captivated the audience was the clever wordsmithing and the creative representation of the trailer. That trailer is not representative of the movie you will see. <br /> <br /> In addition to the child ... every character in this film was a sick, murderous, twisted, perverted, violent sexual phenomenon and their characters are mirrored in the mind of the writer-director who created them. But if you look closely, even the parents of the family on vacation; the sick policemen who shoot shots; serial killers posing in alternative roles; policemen in the station; and even the station commissioner ... each of these character roles included a sexually twisted and violent pervert. I'm not very sure about some of the actors after seeing them talking about the filming of the film and the Canadian city in the Special Features section of the DVD. <br /> <br /> This author-director has such personal mental deviation that no matter what he writes, each character role contains those same carbon copy stamps. The only character who did not have these deviant tendencies was the child. Look carefully and you will see it in every character. Then listen to the director-writer's speech in the Special Features section of the DVD and you will understand what I'm telling you about his mental state and his psychological problems. It wouldn't be tolerated in too many decent houses if it didn't come from a family of Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Jennifer Chambers Lynch doesn't have much of a filmography ... less than a handful of things. Since she has copied those disturbing traits in all her character roles, I don't think we will have to see many films written or directed by her unless her father, director David Lynch, helps her. I would recommend staying away from any movie she's involved with ... and I'm not sure if her father's movies would be better. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Avoid anything written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.
