Shwaas could have a good story, but the director is completely devoid of talent. He doesn't know when to stop. When history requires people to act confused, there are ten-minute scenes of people mimicking the act of confusion. When the plot requires some background history, there are ten minutes of scenes of Konkan vegetation. When history requires a child who is acting up ... you have an idea. <br /> <br /> Not to mention extreme close-ups so you can count people's hairs on the nose. There are films that should be seen on a big screen, this film should be seen on a 13 "television and even Amruta Subhash who plays Asavari is the worst actress I've seen in a long time. You practice too long to get what she does effortlessly. <br /> <br /> I give him 4/10 just because the topic is different, and the story is not bad.The fact that a film like Shwaas comes to be the entry of the Oscars to India says volumes not concerning the state of Indian cinema but the status of Indian judges' committees. A film is not good just because its topic is artistic.
