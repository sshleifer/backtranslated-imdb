They must be. I list them so I can check them one by one: <br /> <br /> - The police regularly leave tens of millions of dollars of cash and drugs around because they have no evidence. <br /> <br /> - When you are shot, you always grunt the same way and fly back the same way, even if there is never a mark on your body. <br /> <br /> - Police are unable to identify the sound of gunshots and do not think anything is suspect when a phone call from an undercover cop during a high-level drug and money deal is cut by that gunshot. <br /> <br /> - Bad gunmen can hit dummies with one shot, but they can't hit a large bulky martial artist with 100. <br /> <br /> - If you launch a car's rocket launcher in a parking lot, the next three cars in a line will explode evenly at 15 second intervals. <br /> <br /> - In addition to the last point, all economical cars are always parked next to each other. <br /> <br /> - The smoke caused by the launch of the rocket launcher is much greater than an amount of smoke caused by four exploding cars. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games that are far, far ahead of any other game company can produce in shape on five floppy disks. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games that are far, far ahead of any other game company that can produce graphics that look like Windows 3.1 screen savers. <br /> <br /> - Floppy disks can be read even after being hit. <br /> <br /> - Drunk boys in bars watch the news closely when they are at the pub and have a profound knowledge of modern American military history, Agent Orange, and the family trees of senior military officers. However, they are only able to articulate their points using dialogues that seem silly from anyone over seven. <br /> <br /> - Even if the fighting seems to break out almost every hour in a bar, that bar has only one staff member, who pays both beers and manages security. Of course he knows martial arts. <br /> <br /> - The gold medal Olympians regularly make the simple transition to the CEOs of corporate software companies in a few years. <br /> <br /> - A woman who works for a video game company knows all about how to beat a game she has never played, constantly thrills about her competitor's big games and can rattle off facts and figures about her rivals company - but he didn't know he had passed almost all the other companies in the field of large company mergers. <br /> <br /> - Bad guys always die in slow motion. Always. <br /> <br /> - Wives tell their husbands that they are pregnant with delirium about their man's courage to kill the bad guys. <br /> <br /> - Wives do large amounts of police work from her husband; this could explain why she complains and complains so much every time she has to go to work. Although, he doesn't explain why she loves him so much every time he gets up in the morning and can read about his murderous escapades. <br /> <br /> - It is quite typical that a policeman is involved in kidnappings, kill tons of people on three different occasions and stop a series of illegal multimillion-dollar deals in a week. <br /> <br /> - When you try to lose a car that is following you, it is wise to continue driving under the speed limit. And if you're following a cop, the subtlety is not important - you can take it with you for miles, then park next to him. He will not notice. <br /> <br /> - All policemen are martial arts experts. <br /> <br /> - It is possible to kick a boy four meters away. <br /> <br /> - People scream or grunt when they are stabbed or kicked, but when they have a broken arm, they do not make any sound. <br /> <br /> - The bad guys clean their bloody axes with their handkerchiefs and then leave them in their pockets for many days. <br /> <br /> - The pieces of wood, when they swing with a sharp blow, shatter the sturdy stairs in six or more places at once. <br /> <br /> - The photo and special features listed on the back of the DVD case do not have to be on the DVD. The advertised interactive menus? Because no menu! The index of the advertised scene? Why not have it all as a scene / chapter, and it doesn't need an index! Similarly, it is OK to use the Matrix font and title in the tag line, and not be a scam in any way. <br /> <br /> With all this, I am shocked that 12 out of the 15 best accredited actors have never acted again.
