I hate a movie that doesn't have an ending. I don't care how good or bad the rest can be, I don't like being left without a conclusion. Such shows should insist on a disclaimer ... something like: The movie you are about to watch has either no end or is so ambiguous that it is not conclusive. <br /> <br /> In the film the last scene we are on the left is Dee and Dominic who have a little in a row and he says, almost with regret, that it couldn't be him because the fingers were or those of a girl or a child. THEN FINISH IT! Well, of course, the smoking gun, so to speak, is in Dee's son's hands, but what about Dominic's daughter? I really thought we could find out it was her! However, unless you like inconclusive movies, I avoid this. Otherwise, I thought the film was generally good.
