This opens with the company credits that inform us about World International Network. I knew I had already seen this business credit, but I couldn't remember where, but I knew it was at the beginning of a really bad movie I had seen, so I was seriously thinking about changing channels, the only thing was that I had seen every movie on others channels which is one of the problems of being an IMDB reviewer. What the hell I thought it wouldn't really matter if WANTED was good or bad because I would still be able to see it again for this site. <br /> <br /> As I expected, WANTED was not that good. It's a plot I've seen so many times (Too many times) before involving a runaway fugitive, a bit like the INCREDIBLE HULK TV series without the tearing shirt. Jimmy crosses the crowd in a completely artificial way and goes on the run and in a completely artificial way he finds himself working in a Catholic reform school. Have you noticed a description often used in the last sentence? "Completely invented" is the answer. Allow me to repeat that it is difficult to think that this is a completely invented film where everything is based on coincidence. Another problem that I had was the reform school run by the church - it's too compassionate and kind, I led to believe that this kind of structures make Alcatraz look like a country club, I'm saying this is a fact, but when the presbyter looks like the spitting image of Donald Rumsfeld, one feels that there is a great deal of sugar coating going on. <br /> <br /> To be honest despite the ridiculous twists and turns WANTED is not a bad bad business even if it is terribly good. I never had the urge to turn it off, no matter how complicated it became, which is a compliment to the film
