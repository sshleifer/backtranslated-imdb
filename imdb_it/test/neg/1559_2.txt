The aliens lose a giant monster named Zarkorr, so they send down a hologram that looks like your stupid teenage media telling the postman, Tommy Ward (Rhys Pugh, in the only movie you ever saw him) that was chosen for fight. Even if he loses the plant he goes to ruin, so he goes off to fight against Zarkorr the Invader! This film is bad, very bad. So bad you need negative numbers just to give him a rattan. Horribly written, bad direction, far below the Power Rangers' wooden recitation, which you're just whining for a horde of lumberjacks coming out of nowhere and cutting them down! And don't get me started on the music theme at the end. People who have created this S $ @ # ball should not be loud out near a camera or anything related to movies. Zarkorr is a fantastic looking monster that should have been in a movie a million times better than this. Do yourself a favor and not see this movie, it's about 80 minutes of life. The actors that are there have never worked again. <br /> <br /> 3/10
