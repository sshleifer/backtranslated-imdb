A long time ago, in the distant 80s, a late-night television program "Fridays" came to ABC, trying to steal the limelight on NBC's "Saturday Night Live". He didn't, but he introduced some loathsome and "semi-talented" sketches into the world. Like Mark Blankenfield, for example. <br /> <br /> Which indirectly leads us to "Jekyll and Hyde ... Together Again". Which is repugnant in every sense. <br /> <br /> Blankenfield is as thin as a bench full of cushions of madness that descend after Communion. And also in good taste. This is just his junkie drug addict who played in the long-running unlucky "Fridays" show. And if you didn't like it there, why are you reading this review? <br /> <br /> Whenever it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie, this is a bad sign. Then, when it comes to discounted jokes that will get you thrown off every makeshift stage in the Western hemisphere and replace the gags with the coarse, things can only get worse. <br /> <br /> A way of doing comic about Robert The story of Louis Stevenson? An interesting idea how to do a "Fall of the House of Usher" sitcom by Poe. <br /> <br /> In addition to a few (MANY few) gags that make a slight grin, this entire film is a wasteful exercise - wasted actors, wasted movies, wasted opportunities. No wonder they showed the original author Stevenson turning in his grave. What more observant review could you do? <br /> <br /> No stars. No, not even for Armstrong, who should have known better. <br /> <br /> "Hyde" from this.
