Despite the famous cast this animated version of Dickens's fable is the most bizarre I've ever seen. Just I disappeared in the first commercial break. The characters don't like me at all and the animation seems cheap. <br /> <br /> I will give this film a very low rating. Give me the Disney version at any time.
