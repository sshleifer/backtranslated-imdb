While traveling with a team of misses for the dispute of the Miss Galaxy, the plane piloted by Maximus Powers (Eric Roberts) and Mike Saunders (Charlie Schlatter) crashes into a block, where lies the Ark of Noah protected by the Jurassic. As the group struggles to survive, alien monkeys plan to use the ark to destroy the human race and dominate planet Earth. <br /> <br /> I like parodies, but "Miss Castaway" is an offense to human brains. The terrible story and the special effects are very, very ugly indeed. There is a parody of "Lost", "Castaway", "Jurassic Park", "Sixth Sense", "Titanic", "Planet of the Apes", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "Congo", "MIB", " Perfect Storm "," Austin Powers "," Jaws "," Mission Impossible "," Close Encounters of the Third Kind "," Star Wars "and" Hulk ", but the problem is that many of them are very silly and not funny. In the end, the trailer is better than the film. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Missão Quase Impossível" ("Mission Almost Impossible")
