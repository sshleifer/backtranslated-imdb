Okay, let's start by saying that I love the original RS for the 64. The graphics were new, the ships were really fast and beautiful. The missions were a challenge, but you had a strategy to invent. The computer didn't tell you every step of your mission, you could wander and explore. <br /> <br /> This is the first thing wrong with RL, everything you do is under a schedule and controlled by other people. I mean, shouldn't you, as a leader, tell people how to handle every single mission? <br /> <br /> And speaking of missions, why are the original trilogy intertwined with a completely invented shit? It does not matter. <br /> <br /> I was so waiting for this game when I learned that they would allow you to fly through the asteroid field from Empire Strikes Back. I think anyone who is a fan of movies wants to do it. So they give it to you. It's the most stupid level in the game. You start flying through the asteroid field with the bonds that chase you, and your goal is to go farther into the field while you shoot the ties. You have to kill them all to keep going. Hey, remember how many Han killed when he was in the field? None, they all had poor piloting skills compared to him. I just wanted to be able to dodge asteroids as they came to me, but instead I have to use my automatic guns to kill the ties behind me. <br /> <br /> It was the biggest disappointment, you don't have control during your flight, everything is slow. All except the A-Wing, probably the fastest and most maneuverable ship in the entire fleet. But, oh yes, did Han not say that the Falcon was? However ... <br /> <br /> Finally you arrived at the Battle of Endor. Here is the last level, you get to destroy the death star, everyone's first instinct is to choose the Hawk and be the leader. But, of course, you get there and you have to make silly pre-selected strategies how to find (not to mention the deciphering of the difference between) the bombers. This is impossible in the hawk, when you have identified a group the frigate is destroyed. The only way to overcome this part is to choose the A-Wing. After this you have to attack the destroyers and this is a real stupid task. This game makes you feel like you're the only one defending the rebel alliance. <br /> <br /> After frustratingly overcoming this "fun" fight, get to the death star. And here, you might think 'yay! I have to destroy the death star ", and again, like in the asteroid field, you have to do something boring while you hold the tunnels of impending doom. Your mission is to protect the ship in front of you, remember that of the Return of the Jedi "He is so idiotic because if you choose the hawk, you will die because you are not maneuverable enough, but if you choose the x wing, you must continue to lock and unlock your sheets. So it's a choice to either kill the bad guys, or try to reach Lando which apparently does not know how to maneuver. So dying in the process. <br /> <br /> The bonus stages are not even worth betting because every level gets more and more frustrating.It makes me feel like I did when I saw the three new movies, upset and needing to kill something. Fortunately for me, Smash Bros Melee exists. <br /> <br /> I hope that with the Wii something much better will come out and that the original trilogy levels will be full regime, I will sell this game at the first opportunity.
