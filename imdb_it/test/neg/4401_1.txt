<br /> <br /> It won't take long for this movie. The first half hour was one of the most boring I have had to face since I started watching movies. The story is not advanced, nothing has been explained about any of the characters. It looked like a non-movie. (A lot of people had already left the public at this point). <br /> <br /> Many scenes were totally unjustified and inexplicable. <br /> <br /> The director should have studied the film a little more to know that each sequence, each scene, must advance the story. He never did it. <br /> <br /> The seemingly fun moments were invented, and only a few people laughed (people with a strange sense of humor, I imagine). <br /> <br /> Jury Prize at Cannes 2002 ..... I don't know what the jury thought ... probably "the politically correct effect". <br /> <br /> I would have liked to love it, so the disappointment was even greater. <br /> <br /> You have to see it to believe it. But wait for the video.
