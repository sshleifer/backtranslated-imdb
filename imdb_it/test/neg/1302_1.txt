In addition to all the negative reviews: I was amazed to see that in the blink of an eye, somehow, a CCTV camera was summoned to a very unlikely position, to show the "crisis" team ("Watch Maaaaa-aaam '') what was happening, particularly near the Thames barrier, where the professor is struck by the force (wind) against the head by a heavy object and then lives to tell the story, otherwise I could not shake off the image of some actors portrayed in other films / programs: I told my wife: "Hey, that's Neil, from the young" (Nigel Planer) and "They called Hercule Poirot for help?" (David Suchet). To add to the shame of this film (shown in two parts on ITV UK recently), ITV showed the phone number of the Environment Agency after each episode for worried viewers, living in areas "at risk of flooding" . How low can you go as a broadcaster to treat the public in this way? What must the Environment Agency have thought ?? ("" Oh no, I'm Mrs Jones of Hull again, she says she's always right, she saw it on ITV ").
