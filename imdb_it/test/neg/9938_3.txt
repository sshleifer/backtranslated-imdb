Wow! This is the movie that should be shown on TV at Two in the morning on Cinemax for all those insomniacs (the gentleman knows they will probably go from boredom to watching this movie) The terrible acting, the killer is far enough from being scary, I've seen clowns at the scariest carnivals. A lot of useless "skins" in this film, pseudo-porn scenes that are simply horrible in more than a million, a soap opera-style script that really hurt the film and the director didn't really have talent for any genre he tried to create with this film. I could see a group of teenagers with their parents' cameras doing a better job than this. I don't think there is a part of me that could recommend this movie to anyone ...
