I'm sorry I disagree with you, but I found the DKC series quite compelling. So much so that I invested in the SNES system and in my copies of the games. This is, mind you, almost ten years after the initial version of DKC 1. The graphics were revolutionary for their time, the first vector graphics games for home systems. The music and the characters are all memorable and the games have brought me and my girlfriend dozens of hours of fun. True, the second game was better than the first, and the third perhaps lacked the "edge" of the second episode. But all three offered a different game, and I still like them today. By the way, I'm old enough to remember when there were NO video games (and the TVs were black and white!).
