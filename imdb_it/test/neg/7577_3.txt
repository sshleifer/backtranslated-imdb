I have seen many Japanese horrors and I must say that some of them are really interesting but they are practically all the same. this is no exception. the ghost is a girl with black hair, who scares her victims by doing nothing but walking and looking dead ... the difference is just the reason for the disturbing. the rest is the same as every time: black haired girl, strange things that happen with some media (photo), gruesome acting. while watching this movie I constantly found myself asking why I was wasting my time looking at things that someone else did much better before. some scenes are pretty nice, I'll give them 3 out of 10
