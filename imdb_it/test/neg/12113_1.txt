I will preface my review by stating that I am not a fan of the independent "straight to video" genre that owes a great debt to the grindhouse movies of the 1960s. I don't own any, I've never rented anyone, so I might miss the appreciation for these low-budget skunks that many other people have. <br /> <br /> I took this movie at Cinemax one late Saturday night with a lady friend. Please don't ask me why I was watching Cinemax late one Saturday night with a friendly lady. We were bored with World Championship Poker. Some of the atrocious courtesy courtesy of Misty Mundae (and I wish she wasn't mistress of being from Illinois, since we actually have some diamonds here) have caught our attention. Normally, the purpose of good soft-core porn is to engage you and your partner in the mood. Some good sex, the tongue in brash humor, and who knows what could happen? After about 15 minutes, and a scene in which the title character seduces a victim who attacks, my friend said, "if you want to see the rest of this fine, I go to bed so I don't have to. Please turn off the volume." Here's what I tell from the plot: the character of Misty is a sexless nerd who gets bitten by a spider and turns into a super-sex kitten with super-web impetus powers that don't come from her wrists. wickedness involved, which does not seem particularly bad or sexy Spiderbabe saves the day, has sex, MJ (who is a man in this film) is constantly being offered by stereotyped and bad gay bikers, and somehow the evil villain is being pushed by a building after his death. <br /> <br /> What was good about this film? It's over. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with that? Reciting a third-level competition resembles the winners of the Oscar, a screenplay created by people I imagine to be drunk, college sex sexual perverts who wouldn't know what sex to do if they took a lesson taught by Dr. Ruth, special effects that were so special as someone jumping off a trampoline, funny humor like ?? well, I still have to meet everything that is Lamer. The sex scenes? If we were watching a video, the only thing these scenes would trigger is the fast forward button. And the action scenes? Some of my old Atari VCS games had better choreography. <br /> <br /> I now know that this type of film should be appreciated for its inherent malice. Companies like EI do not propose to make good films: they have a niche and they target it. My experience as a marketer tells me that they are right to withdraw their public. But after my brief exposure to "Spiderbabe", I can say first of all that I won't go into that world. Perhaps the problem with directors in this genre genre is this: so much attention is paid to making the movies bad, that if they made an effort to try to focus on those things that they do very well, they would be very funny 'the bad' Cinema, a film by La Troma in the 80s. Sorry folks; the spirit is there, but the effort is not. <br /> <br /> Although I must admit that "Alice in Acidland" intrigues me ??
