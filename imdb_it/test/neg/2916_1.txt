Possible Spoiler alarm, although there is not much to ruin about this film. I saw Project A part II not having seen the first film. I don't think I've lost much. Project A Part Two is not only the worst film by Jackie Chan I've seen to date (yes worse than "Fantasy Mission Force"), this film is one of the most unwatchable films the world has ever seen. It is right there with `Plan 9 From Outer Space 'on the sleep-inducing scale. The plot is twisted and knotted like a 50-foot ball with which the cat played and eventually died. The humor, if you can call it that, seems to have been written by a boring high school freshman, who despite the fact that many people tell him it's not funny, is determined to bring out his limping humor, no matter how painful the film. And this movie is painfully bad. The plot involves Jackie Chan as a naval officer recruited by the police to gather "all the notorious criminals". He gathered them in the first half hour of the film, and I prayed for a quick ending that I didn't get. Because the film annoys progress from this point I have no idea. The film drags on and on without purpose, without plot and humor attempts that fail so miserably, make Carrot Top seem like a comic genius. The Kung Fu in this film is lame and forgettable. There is better Kung Fu in that movie about the 3 Ninja children. Project A part II is neither an action film nor a kung fu film, it is still a total waste of the talents of Jackie Chan and Maggie Cheung who have made films of a higher level than this. While Jackie Chan repeatedly escapes certain death, I go into "Blair Witch" mode asking (and wishing) "He is going to die NOW, so the movie can end?" An example of how ridiculous this film is: Jackie Chan is handcuffed to a "Another man. A band of pirates (who doesn't look like pirates) tosses axes at Jackie. Does Jackie grab one of the rebel aces and break the chain on the handcuffs? No! You see it would ruin his" hilarious "gag that is handcuffed to a man "Other person. If you have a friend who laughs at everything, I encourage you to watch this movie with him or her, and see that they won't laugh at this movie. If you're an insomniac, this movie will put you to sleep. Don't use heavy machinery while looking at part A of plan II. Any side effects include headache, retinal tension and death from boredom.
