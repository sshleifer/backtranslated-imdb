I did not see or hear the original version. <br /> <br /> I'm not Russian, but I'm learning right now. <br /> <br /> I have no preference for Russia, Bulgaia, United States, etc. <br /> <br /> But what I have to mention is: <br /> <br /> In the German synchronization throughout the film all the Russians speak with a Russian accent. Americans speak "Hochdeutsch" (without accent)! I have never felt such stupidity! Moreover, this is boring. <br /> <br /> I hope the original is better. <br /> <br /> The rest is a simple thriller, not really good ideas. As an economic version of a James Bond movie.
