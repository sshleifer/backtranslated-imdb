Well, I've seen and seen this movie based on the rather high score here (7.1 now), and some of the good reviews. Usually, IMDb is a good guide when it comes to sharing, although in this case I was very deceived. <br /> <br /> The film is a contemporary detective story, with Vinnie Jones as an investigative journalist, investigating the death of a mason. Mixed with this is a novel by Dickens composed (called The Riddle, set in the 18th or 19th century), which also deals with a murder story. Both stories are connected through the discovery of an unpublished manuscript. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting? It may have been, however this film fails horribly in a number of areas: 1) Acting. Mediocre at best, but it is watchable. Not worse than your English sitcom, even if a movie is expected a little better. Especially with a score of over 7. 2) Music. The music used is simply horrible, distracting and annoying. Especially the pub music and the music playing in the journalist's apartment. 3) Plot. This is a big joke. There are plot holes wide open everywhere and even the obligatory romance is so unrealistic that it's almost funny. Furthermore, without going into details, I can safely say that the ending is absurd, and one of the worst acting and plot pieces of the year. 4) Workroom. Sometimes the positions of the cameras and the views are distracting and do not serve the "history" at all. <br /> <br /> I am a bit of a film fanatic and watch an average of 1 to 2 movies a day, but this is easily the worst movie I've seen in months. Don't waste your money or your time with this junk.
