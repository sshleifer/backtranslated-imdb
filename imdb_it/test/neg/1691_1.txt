The classic author C.S. Lewis wrote an essay stating that the story of no child is worth reading, viewing, etc. if it can only be enjoyed by children. I would say that this film is easy to defend as an argument. <br /> <br /> At the age of five or six, I loved it, tracked it down only three or four years later and found it to be damp, poorly animated, scornfully and confusingly written, and with distressing and repetitive songs I'm watching you, hi-cockalorum), showing a production that pointed to joyful stupidity and fantasy, but that turned out ugly, twee, frustrating mess. <br /> <br /> By all means, show it to your child, but I highly recommend that you don't buy a copy or try to sit down while watching. If you want something set in the same era but with a genuine charm and spirit, follow "Oliver Twist" or the brilliant BBC adaptation of "The Box of Delights".
