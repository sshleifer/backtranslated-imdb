This film was bad. I think Elton (or Mike) played in Wong. However it was the Wong who didn't have that silly grin and looked worse. He plays a man who is hit in the head and suffers brain damage. He resumes and takes revenge. Gordon Liu is the only one worth seeing in this film, but he can't do much. But what little it does seems to make others pale in comparison. Moreover, the film has some rubber hawk that controls the Wong boy. This film is not worth renting or buying.
