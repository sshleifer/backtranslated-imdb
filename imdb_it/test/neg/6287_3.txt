Poor old Robert Taylor. Apart from the FEDS, it has not been done in its own way: this almost shocking is a waste of ninety minutes and not much more. It's one of those criminal-detective-crime jokes with the main character narrative all the time - usually this is reserved for comedies these days, but this movie takes itself too seriously! A shame; Australian films, particularly in the 2000-01 period, were of exceptional quality overall, but I suppose there are some mistakes. Why even make a film like this, which obviously won't go well?
