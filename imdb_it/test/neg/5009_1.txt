The strangers with candy creep in all the wrong context, the situations are not at all funny with the cheesy voices and the bad weather of the low forehead comedy, the clear attempt at dry / black / dark humor is obvious and fails to provide all the elements of a good joke. <br /> <br /> With a high rage factor and a low laugh ratio, I was shocked that this show went into season one, I personally like Scrubs, The Office, 30 Rock, Trailer Park Boys, Pulling, Peep Show, Simpson, Family Guy and I know what you think, these shows are not strange at all, so some other good shows I've seen are Jam, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, The Book Group, Asylum and Snuff Boxes that are original with dry / black / dark humor / satire and they are all at least 5/10. <br /> <br /> The Darkplace of Garth Marenghi in particular is cheap, exaggerated and strange, however the context is thought and works to make it really out there and fun too.
