I tried watching this movie, but I couldn't get over the first 15 minutes. It's a terrible disappointment, considering the cast, but I can't look beyond the fact that the dialogue is in English and some of the actors who pretend to be Indian are not even close (read: Kristin Kreuk). Considering that India alone has 1/6 of the world population and one of the largest film industries, I don't think it would have been difficult for filmmakers to have found an excellent Indian actress to play the part. And I'm not saying this because of a blind patriotism, but because it is absolutely and totally absurd for a non-Indian to play the role of an Indian / Pakistani. Now some people say that 'as long as she is convincing who cares?' but my point is exactly that it is NOT convincing and can never be - not because of its acting skills, but because of its ethnicity. For example, however good an actor Tom Hanks may be, he will never be able to play an Australian aborigine! <br /> <br /> But this is still of secondary importance for the biggest misstep that the directors have made: having dialogue in English. It completely destroys the mood, as well as any semblance of authenticity. If the same film had been made in native languages ​​(Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi) with English subtitles, this could have been an excellent film. Unfortunately, at present, I would not recommend anyone to see it, apart from film students who want to study "What not to do" in movies.
