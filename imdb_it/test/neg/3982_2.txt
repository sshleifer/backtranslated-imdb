This film has had a pretty interesting story about clones and organ use, but it fails because the main character is so annoying and whiny that you want him dead. Not that anyone else is very good at it, but when you hate the character that should gather your understanding, the movie doesn't work. Funny enough, it seems that in the near future a film is coming out that has a plot that mirrors the one with more action and a better cast, although I won't be able to think of anything else, but this movie if I were to watch it stupid that somehow he is smart enough to understand that something is wrong in his field where people ride bicycles a mile an hour and struggle for no reason. The advisers tell them that when they are ready they go to America, but our "hero" has his doubts, so he spits around and learns the horrible truth that sends him fleeing from the bad guys who shoot and repeatedly hit the boy. He goes to look for the man from whom he was cloned. There's Peter Graves and Dick Seargent, but they don't add anything to this film that looks like something that was made for television. The positive side is that when "The Island" comes out, the producers of this film can proudly say "we've thought about it before".
