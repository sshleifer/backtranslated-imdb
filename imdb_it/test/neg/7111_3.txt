One day I was sick and I was looking through channels and I came across this terrible movie. The plot and even the subplots (if you find one) were made to extinction. BUT, as bad as the story was, I reserve a special comment to Liza Minelli. His character was absolutely one of the most annoying characters I've ever had the misfortune to see in the movie. His only two competitors in this category are John Leguziamo in "The Pest" and Julia Stiles in everything he did (or done in half). Maybe she performed exactly as the script suggested or maybe (moan!) It's the limit she has for her acting. In any case, they would have had to rewrite it and kill it in the first 30 seconds of the film (for example, as the girl fell from the balcony in Lethal Weapon (I) (but at least had a beautiful breast)) <br /> <br /> Most Humbly Submitted ...
