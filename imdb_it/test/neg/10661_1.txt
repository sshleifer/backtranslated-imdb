This film must be the worst movie of 2007, it was really bad and I don't think I've ever seen a movie that is so bad, I mean they don't really make bad Hollywood movies? Hamish should really just sing instead of acting, because he can't just act, god was just so bad, I mean he was so bad in the movie that made Mallika Sherawat look like a better actress than he, like her performance, she plays the same role in every movie, god it's so boring looking at it, I mean what do men see in this woman? Yes, she has a divine body but where is that talent ???? I haven't seen it yet and at this rate I don't think I'll ever do it. <br /> <br /> However Hamish falls in love with Ria now this 15 year old girl can act, my god was the best actor in the film and she doesn't look like 15 at all, it seems to me about 21 years old, but his performance was brilliant in the film. Bless her that she was really good, I hope to see more in the future. So Ria falls in love with Himash, but her father wants her to marry someone else, a typical Bollywood movie, however there is a hiccup (it can only happen in a Bollywood movie) and they both get married in the end. <br /> <Br /> Well, I would give my music 10/10 was superb, this made the film a success, the songs were really fantastic and brilliant. however the only thing I can say is to go and buy music and not watch the movie.
