The actresses are cute and the sets, while simple, quite OK. Besides this, there is nothing to save from this movie. Incredibly bad dialogues, dumb to tears, too much expected plot, lots of errors and inconsistencies (for example, a cute girl gets head shots from a morning star and not only survives, but barely with a scratch!) .. To make it short because it's not worth more, even fans of the genre can avoid it.
