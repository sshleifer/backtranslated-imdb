This film tries but fails. Perhaps for the non-Australian public it might be interesting as a travelogue, but for the native it is simply boring. <br /> <br /> Anyone who lives here knows that Broken Hill is a harsh and hard mining town. If a couple of fruits mentioned appear in drag, well, it's all so predictable. Where did I meet this well-worn theme before? Oh yes - Mouse Town Mouse and Country. Spare us. <br /> <br /> I kept hoping it would improve, but after the Broken Hill scene I could see where it was heading and so I turned off the TV and went to bed.
