If only he hadn't bowed to the clich√©, Shiban could have made a good movie out of this story. It was just different enough to make you interested, so for the same amount of time, energy and money spent on this stinker, we could have had something good instead of rolling our eyes. <br /> <br /> Production-wise, it's as good as one might expect from a camcorder, so get good grades there. Actually it's the fault of the script, since the acting wasn't so bad, considering what the actors had to work with. <br /> <br /> I thought the days had long since passed when we would see someone, finding a radio transceiver that they desperately want to operate, first turning every knob of the thing from top to bottom, hit it on top 7 times, and then wait for it to work. This story is ruined by a continuous series of stupid moves by all the characters except the villain. It is as if we thought we were too superficial to grab all the plot devices, so there are all spoon fed to make sure we have them. <br /> <br /> I don't know about you, but this doesn't work for me My attention ends up being occupied by holes in the plot and excessive dramatizations, not by history. <br /> <br /> So, since I found that it's not so bad in a technical sense, I think Mr. Shiban should try again, only with a correct script next time; then he could give us something worth looking at.
