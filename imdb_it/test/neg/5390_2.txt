Most of the other posts have beaten this film, and deservedly so. I just have to talk about the technical ingestion of the directors. It would have been nice if the director had at least had lunch with someone who knew what a gun was, because he had no idea. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!! <br /> <br /> Stupidity: <br /> <br /> Ops Spec Team assembled by various military units whose members have never met before. <br /> <br /> Perhaps two people in the unit had weapons that used the same magazines, parts, ammunition, etc. <br /> <br /> The sniper school instructor uses a machine gun (caliber of the gun) as opposed to a rifle which we would assume would be better with him. <br /> <br /> A poor team member's night vision optics weigh more than the rifle. You can tell when it runs, which is SERIOUSLY in heavy top. <br /> <br /> The team leader sends a team member to "challenge" the Skeleton Man when they face him for the first time. Do you challenge a 200-year-old revived native American skeleton with a long spear and an attitude of riding an undead war horse with a severe nasal hemorrhage? I think not, Bubba. <br /> <br /> Bullets do not sparkle when they hit the trees, Mr. Director. (a couple of people have already mentioned it). <br /> <br /> The "air support" team consists of a ubiquitous "black helicopter", only this one has a couple of sidewinder missiles hanging below. Someone forgot to tell Helo's crew that the Skeleton Man does not fly, and they are above the American heart where there will be no enemy aircraft. Instead they would have to carry some air-to-ground missiles. <br /> <br /> The air / ground bomb of helo consists of a machine gunner with a semi-auto AK-47 (or 74?). Needless to say, it only affects the dirt. You should have brought a belt-fed light machine gun. <br /> <br /> The gunner then discovers that a grenade launcher is rather useless. <br /> <br /> A wooden arrow from a darting curved bow does not go down to the helicopters, Mr. Director. <br /> <br /> I could not recover after this point (about 30 minutes) and gave up. You seriously need a drip of morphine to make it through this film, it's just painful.
