Intelligent summary, isn't it? <br /> <br /> If Mad Max was something of a simple, direct, nothing special, but nothing wrong with any type of film, they completely compensated for it with the sequel, The Road Warrior. So, in theory, with a third big movie it would have been a great trilogy ... now, it's not! <br /> <br /> Such a huge disappointment was Beyond Thunderdome! The main premise is very beautiful, with an "underworld" (think of a mix between Metropolis and The Time Machine), but all this is not carried out with too much conviction. Add the hateful Tina Turner and the unpleasant plot of people waiting for a plane, and this is just a huge stinker. <br /> <br /> Maybe they can rekindle things with part 4 (although that will probably be just a big budget-explosion deal, because it's not right. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
