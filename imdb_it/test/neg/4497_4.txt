The photograph is complete, the acting is quite good, but in virtually every other department The Greek Tycoon is a boring bore. Taking its cue from the real-life love story of Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis, the film is a lucid soap opera but absolutely empty of the genre that can be found on TV all day. Viewers who embrace the entire "celebrity magazine culture" (photographs of paparazzi and gossip stories about the rich and famous) will no doubt find much to whet their appetite here. But those who prefer films with a bit more substance and craftsmanship and oddity will find the execution time of 107 minutes an amazing slogan. <br /> <br /> US President James Cassidy (James Franciscus) and his beautiful wife Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) are in Greece on official business. A ridiculously wealthy Greek tycoon, Theo Tomasis (Anthony Quinn), sees Liz at a party in her elegant manor. Despite the fact that both are married to someone else, there is an immediate attraction between them. Later, at a private party aboard his yacht, Tomasis makes his wishes known to Liz. Some time later, President Cassidy is assassinated while walking on a beach. Liz is shocked and saddened by her death, but it is not long before she seeks solace in the arms of her Greek lover Tomasis. In the end the two are married and their love affair becomes the preferred point of reference for newspapers, magazines, photographers and the world's hunters. <br /> <br /> It is rather amusing to note the vigor with which the producers of this film denied that it was a dramatization of the story of Kennedy-Onassis. They wanted the film to be seen as an original story, rooted in fiction. But anyone with a brain can see where the film is inspired. Even Aristotle Onassis himself knew that The Greek Tycoon amounted to his love life by receiving treatment from Hollywood (if rumors are to be believed, he actually helped approve Anthony Quinn for the role of Tomasis!) J. Lee-Thompson isn't he really the right kind of director for this kind of film ?? is it better suited for forage action like The Guns Of Navarone and Ice Cold In Alex ?? but it orders the proceedings with adequate and professional adequacy. Quinn is as watchable as Tomasis; Bisset looks adorable as the object of his desires; Franciscus uses his toothy smile and a facade of integrity to become a credible politician. Their performances are good on the surface, but there is little to do for the actors at any deeper level. Similarly, Tony Richmond's photography gives the film an elegant, superficial sheen as it moves from one exotic room to another, but the smallest of scratches shows that there is nothing behind the film's shiny exterior.
