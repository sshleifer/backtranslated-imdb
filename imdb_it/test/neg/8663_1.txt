I agree with many of you that this film was rather boring and boring. I found myself disliked by the main character and the following actors / actresses who came into the scenes. Camera work was not pleasant. Random shots and shaky movie scenes have made me rather annoying and I turned the movie off. I will talk about my time looking at the 1999 adaptation and I hope it is pleasant along with Senso and Sensibilit√†; Emma; To become Jane; and Pride and prejudice. I have only a few others to look at in addition to these films, but I think they were done very tastefully. The music was also a bit out of place with the film, reminding me of another show I had seen this year. His name was Hex and a BBC show. I found it a night on the web. I liked the first season, but the second season was dry and I got things out of thin air that should stay with the clouds. I found the main male character who was Henry in this movie out of place. Maybe I don't like his way of talking or his stature. Well, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless they muted it and wanted to look at the fashion of the era or the way the houses were kept at that time. Again I will watch the 1999 version and hope it is a better one and Jane Austen does justice to her writing.
