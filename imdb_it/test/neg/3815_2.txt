A terrible film that is amateurish on almost every level - a boring and derived script full of stereotyped characters played by embarrassed actors for a director lacking the most rudimentary understanding of his trade. The whole thing stinks. It sounds like a slasher of the early eighties, up to the lousy score and SFX ketchup, but without the nostalgia of childhood that is required to look fondly at those dross. One of the worst horror movies I've ever seen - certainly the worst that received a mainstream theatrical distribution. I never came out of a movie in my life - if I had been unlucky enough to see "Hatchet" in the cinema, it would have been the first. Avoid at all costs.
