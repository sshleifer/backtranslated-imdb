Much of the comment on this forum revolves around the debate on the validity of some comparisons with R DOGS on the DVD cover. Forget all this ... This movie-- er-- home movie is absolutely horrendous. How can anyone with a modicum of credibility claim this as 10/10 ??? There is no plot, no one. I could not believe that I had spent money renting this (more on that later) and that I had been deceived into believing that this (based on the cover of a box and some sort of award for the film festival) had potential. The only thing I really remember is that, incredibly, one of the boring main characters was apparently projected with a bullet in the head ... and ends up surviving the wound and earning the final credits alive. Wow. And apparently Dere, Killers has a following. Double wow. <br /> <br /> True story - In reality I was so denied having wasted my money and my life force in this rental that I held the videotape for what must have been six months. I kept telling myself that it never happened. The video on top of the TV was an illusion - a mental symbol of my contempt for myself. After someone pointed out to me that it was really real and that I needed to grab, I decided I couldn't leave it there. I thought: "How many others have I denied the suffering of witnessing the vision of this masterpiece by accumulating Killers for me?" I had to do the right thing and give it back to the hell it came from. <br /> <br /> So, as I imagine most of IMDb's populous would do in a similar situation, I gathered some courage and went to the video store ... at 2 am. After making sure no one was around, I got out of my car (still in course), slipped the movie into the drop box slot, and booked out of there to never come back. <br /> <br /> I think I would have expected some corporate Hollywood Video goons to come looking for me (the bill must have accumulated to something like $ 1,238.67 at that time) so I walked away from the area. However, coincidentally, very similar to Killers' plot, nothing ever happened.
