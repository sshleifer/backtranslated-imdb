It is hard to believe that such a bad film can really be published. The dialogue was unnatural. The portrait of the relationship between the boy and his future stepfather was particularly poor. I guess we can say that they managed to produce uncomfortable dialogues, but what was said seemed false and artificial. There was no suspense. The music was bad. The only reason I watched this movie is because I live in the Death Valley area and I was curious about what positions would appear on the screen. Fortunately the film was on TV so I didn't waste money renting this sorry excuse for a movie! I honestly believe that many amateurs could put together a more engaging storyline than the one presented here. Too bad the time of an entire film crew has been wasted on such garbage! I imagine the only positive thing I can say about the film is that some of the landscapes were good.
