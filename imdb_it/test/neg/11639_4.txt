A blackface man lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in a kind of shack with a monkey. He connects her with a phone, and she teaches him how to go about Charleston. Then they fly off into the spaceship, leaving the monkey behind. Apart from the defenseless black face, this short film makes no sense. I think it's the plot, but I'm not sure for a long time. You cannot say that this is Renoir at work, despite his characteristic humanism. Good use of slow motion, though. It can be found on the NY Film Annex, n. 18, I believe.
