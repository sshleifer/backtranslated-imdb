A film that tries to say something and generally fails. Like the fatuous academics who populate the film, it winds aimlessly, substituting the conversation indefinitely (it seems to be forever heard) for some action or direction of the plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's one of the best examples of Canadian cinema I've seen.
