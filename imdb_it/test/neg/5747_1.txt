Phone call to sick work - I saw him in bed and it was so horrible that I would return to work if I could get out of bed. The dog ran away with the remote control so I got stuck. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Hammer was preparing his eldest daughter to become his beeeatch. <br /> <br /> Horrid to look at - it made me vomit more than I was doing anyway. So you have it - this would be the movie they play in the waiting room of hell before entering. Or maybe you got stuck in the movie forever with the Hart kids. Just remember to take a gun with you ...
