** SPOILERS ** With the title of the movie having the name of the killer fish twice, not once, you would expect to see them in action, attacking by biting tears and eating almost all of them in the cast of characters. Instead you have to wait for the movie to be almost finished to let you catch a glimpse of the Piranah. Even then all you see is the water that gurgles and shakes when a poor individual disappears beneath it assuming that it has been eaten, whole and alive, by fish. <br /> <br /> The movie "Piranha Piranha" starts with this scary looking Piranha on the screen while the credits start rolling down but **** SPOILER **** is the only time in the movie that you have ever seen the killer fish or the fish you never saw see a Piranha is the movie yet. What you see is a travel diary of Venezuela and its people and the Venezuelan jungle along the Amazon River basin. Along with many beautiful and breathtaking photographs of the landscape, people and nature, but that's all. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of story that has to do with this great White Hunter Caribe, William Smith, which ironically means Piranha in the native language spoken there, this is the true meaning of the title of the film " Piranha Piranha "? "Caribe Caribe"! The Caribe person is played by legendary Hollywood biker Hell's Angles and all the tough guy William Smith. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film this trio of American tourists Jim Pendrake and his sister Terry, Peter Bown & Ahna Capri and their American guide Art Green, Tom Simcox, are entering the Venezuelan jungle to go and do sightseeing with Terry taking photographs to send them home. Terry is terrified of guns as we learn that a young girl saw her father blow his head off a gun. Even when Art saves his life using one when he sees an attack from a six-foot Diamondback rattlesnake, Terry almost girds him for a gun; who had promised her that he would not take her with him on the journey. <br /> <br /> At a jungle stop, or bar, the three come across Caribe we saw for the first time capturing monkeys in the jungle at the beginning of the film. Caribe is then more accepted by the three with his knowledge of the jungle and his semi-cooked philosophy on life and death, as well as his ability to take them where they go to the local diamond mines deep in the Amazon basin. <Br /> <br /> Although a little strange in the beginning, the boy is so busy with himself that he doesn't seem to notice that there are people around him, Caribe turns out to be a nice and nice person engaged in a long and friendly motorcycle ride through the marshes and the jungle with art. Caribe also shows Terry, who at one point in the film has almost beaten his teeth, the fine points of hunting and wild shooting he believes do not really die but become part of him after he killed them! A little crazy but you have to admit that this guy has imagination. <br /> <br /> It is far ahead in the film that for some strange reason, maybe it was the bad alcohol he was drinking, Caribe suddenly goes mad and becomes a murderer attacking and raping Terry and then killing his angry brother and feeding him at deadly Piranha. Trying to escape from the mad fool and then being forced to have to fight him with him. Art is beaten so wildly by the dirty Caribe fighter that he almost remained unconscious. Just when Caribe is about to definitively kill Art, he is shot to death by Terry who, after experiencing insane crazy work, has finally decided that weapons are really necessary and should be used to kill on very rare but life-saving occasions. br /> <br /> It's worth looking at, if it's worth looking at everyone, just for the scenery and nothing else. It is just a pity that the film should advertise as a killer fish, or Piranha, a horror movie when, if he were honest about himself, it could have been a jungle adventure movie more or less average with Smith, he has the build for it, playing Tarzan of the Venezuelan, non-African, Jungle
