Nine out of nine people who saw this said they were mentally scarred for life. No one should ever see this abomination. The English language is poorly equipped to express how terribly atrocious this "film" is. In reality it is not worth the plastic of which it is made. No major crime has been committed by the human race in the entire history of creation; never is there likely to be anything worse. <br /> <br /> It was unanimously agreed that the scene involving the shrunken head of Tommy and the girl's blouse was incredibly sick and twisted; in fact many of us have not yet recovered from the calvary and are currently sitting in the corner of the room swinging, sucking the thumb and whining. <br /> <br /> The fundamental question on everyone's lips, however, must be "Why ???". How can anyone create such a monstrosity and then subject it to so many innocent people? After watching the trailer, we thought this movie could be a laugh: how wrong we were. <br /> <br /> Sign the petition to free the world from "Shrunken Heads" so that no other poor civilians are exposed to it. Please, for the good of humanity.
