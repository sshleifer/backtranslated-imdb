I'm a longtime fan of the original of this movie (Bella Martha / Mostly Martha), and everything that makes this movie fantastic and fun to watch is missing from this one. I miss the slow pace, the accumulation of characters and their style in small gestures, the predominance of lights and moods and passages on dialogue. I don't think history itself is enough. Martha / Kate is more isolated, and Mario / Nick is not a clown. In most cases, the things that make a scene great in the original are not working in its copy here. The small changes remove the tension. My opinion is that you should go see the original. It is worth the inconvenience of the subtitles.
