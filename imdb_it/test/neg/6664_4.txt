Eh is not as good as the other Dragonballs. The villains are actually thefts of other Z villains like Cell, Frieza and even Majin Buu. With Baby being the Frieza clone, the Super 17 is the Cell clone and the Shadow Dragons are the Buu clones. The story is also very bad as it relates to Goku shrinking. CLINCHING !! He takes care of him at SHRINKING to appreciate the size of an eight-year-old just to make it work. Let's not forget how weak the characters become. Gohan can no longer become mystic and is even weaker than Pan. (It's sad, I know). Speaking of Pan she was so pretty at the end of Z now she's lost all that cuteness and becomes an irritating and whining little girl whose only purpose in this series is to intrude. Goten doesn't even have a purpose in the series and in Trunks ... well, I don't know what to say about Trunks. GT is just an attempt to milk the famous Dragonball franchise. If you really like Dragonball, avoid this series. It doesn't even look like Dragonball. I'll be honest even if the ending was really good and it's pretty sad (at least for me) and the thematic songs that end and open are better (Japanese, not American). It would have been better if Toriyama san had worked on it.
