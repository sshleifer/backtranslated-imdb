Suburban children meet the forest. Killjoy is better in this part. It is even more evil and stronger. However, even most of the acting is bad, as in the first. Sometimes the characters say things that don't make sense to each other and are not convincing. I made a mistake looking at this sober. You'll probably like it better if you don't ;-). If you haven't already stopped loving clowns after the first movie, you will surely do it after the second one ..... ;-) <br /> <br /> Problematic kids and their observers are on the way to a field in the forest . And what a coincidence, their car broke down right in the middle of a forest and at night? It's just their luck. They find a home and one is hit, one of the observers lags behind (because I don't know) and the rest eventually finds another home. In that house lives a voodoo priestess ..... but she is not responsible for Killjoy's resurrection. Who is it then? Well, you better watch the movie and find out for yourself ...
