Let's see ... a couple of dozen Gary Larson gags, as well as his illustrative style, perhaps a legally difficult appropriation of an Aardman character, a more than generous sprinkling of art direction from various Pixar films, positively Lion King esquire villains living in what amounts to an elephant's graveyard IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY'S COUNTRY, oh, and a stinking joke by Riverdance ten years after any possible relevance. The children (three and five) liked it, but boy, it was a booty for dad. Just another weak attempt by Nickelodean Films to attach itself to the explosion of animation. I really wish they had spent a little more money on character design, rendering, a script, a director.
