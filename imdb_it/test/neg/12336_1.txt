We'll see who the good guys are. The Union. And who are the bad guys, a rich man who steals the elections and his spoiled son. The director forces us to see good from evil. All the characters hate the bad guys so that when they watch the movie, this can help us hate the bad guys. This is the worst kind of film-making: manipulative and childish. The plot centers on a cop who is between good and evil, and is stuck in this bad movie. It's boring and useless. The story of the star Keach is really bad. And a good actor, Don Stroud, exaggerated, playing the guy that nobody likes and we shouldn't like. It takes a long time before this boredom starts to take off and the title becomes established; then when it takes off, it stops a minute later. Boring. One of the worst movies ever made.
