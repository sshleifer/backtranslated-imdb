A black comedy romantic comedy with an exceptional cast and a script that is anything but stellar. Brenda Blethyn ("Lovely & Amazing") is the title character "Betty", a woman trapped in a loveless marriage with a man who obviously has an affair with her beautiful blonde secretary. Guess who plays this minor role, yes! Naomi Watts ("Mulholland Drive") must have entered this project before her superstar status was secured with the hit thriller "The Ring". <br /> <br /> On the male side of the cast list is the wretched Alfred Molina ("Frida"), an old-style undertaker who suddenly decides to reveal his desires for "Betty" that have been dormant for decades . Maybe Miramax hopes that Molina's turn in the upcoming "Spider-Man 2" may arouse interest in this little trinket that is on the DVD shelf. <br /> <br /> But the prize for the wildest thankless performance goes to Christopher Walken ("Catch Me If You Can") which goes completely over the top as "modern" impresario with his Las Vegas-style funeral in a small provincial town. His character must be dropped into the village because there are few reasons why he exists in this script. <br /> <br /> Having said that, if you would like to see some first-rate actors engage in superficial humor then this is for you, and if this is not your glass of tea, then try renting "Harold and Maude ", the last funeral film that is still fun to date.
