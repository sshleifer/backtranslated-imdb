Leon Errol has the dual role of uncle Matt Lindsay and Lord Basil Epping so superb, but I have trouble sympathizing with the "Spitfire Mexican" series because they are all invented to produce incorrect identities, and these are wired upfront. Errol is as fun as the sweltering Lord Epping, but I would have preferred much more spirit and much less repetition. <br /> <br />
