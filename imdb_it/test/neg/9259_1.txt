Take a bad script, some bad acting and throw yourself into a morally incorrect moral story and what do you get? Something that should pass for a quality family vision. <br /> <br /> Seven Alone is the story of a nineteenth-century family traveling through America in a wagon, hoping for a new life in Oregon. There are seven children (three males, three females and one child whose sex is not entirely sure), hence the title of the film. <br /> <br /> The story opens with the family living a seemingly normal life of the century on a farm in the middle of nowhere. The eldest son John is a precocious teenager, "lazy and good for nothing" as his father constantly reminds him. We immediately see that he has a weakness for practical jokes when he ties the threads of the sleeping sisters and connects them to a nearby mule. When the mule is moved, of course, the poor girls are shaken off the bed. John is captured by his father and is immediately punished with a belt. <br /> <br /> A wagon passes that same day. Pa is tempted to unite as he promises a new life in the wild, wild west. So the family is preparing to undress its own things. <br /> <br /> From the beginning the film seems weak and amateur. The acting is below the mark, like one of those films shown at school on pioneers. I can't blame the actors, however, because the jokes in this film are silly and too disgustingly sweet and optimistic. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you that I took this film while flipping through the channels a boring Saturday afternoon on a Christian television station. Not of my religious mind, I observed with horror that Sette Alti offered not only obsolete but even offensive moral declarations! If I were a good Christian, I hope that I would have the good sense to complain to the television for transmitting the garbage. However, since I am a cynical, non-believer with a wicked sense of humor, I chose to sit down and laugh at myself silly. <br /> <br /> In one of the initial scenes, the role of the father as the stern ruler of the house is established when he proposes the idea of ​​leaving for his wife from Oregon. His answer is heated "Beyond my dead body". It is expected that we laugh, I suppose, as the film cuts the next scene with Pa and Ma smiling as it directs the cart along the prairies. Oh I suppose even the most convinced feminist should admit that this 'Father-sa-good' attitude was the norm in those days, and the need for such a dictatorship could be argued when living conditions were difficult, but somehow feeling that this film has supported this notion, even for today. Nice message from a Christian television station. <br /> <br /> In any case, things get worse for the family, and the moral integrity of the films has further diminished. An Indian (or Native American) robs John while lying down sleeping in a field. Like a wild savage, the Indian takes clothes and objects from Johns. Fortunately Pa, with the help of the passer-by Kit Carson, is able to kill the Indian, as well as a couple of his delinquent friends. Kit Carson tells John that his father is a true hero. <br /> <br /> The family is accompanied by the train's resident doctor, Dr. Dutch (played by Aldo Ray). He shares Pa's feelings about John, stating that he is a useless brat. Maybe yes, but it's also the best thing about this movie. Aldo Ray's doctor is a buffoon, who seems unable to tie his shoes, let alone treat one of the girls for a broken leg. Fortunately, the child did not cry when the cart toppled over and broke the leg in two, because Dr. Dutch did not seem to have the proper way to make the bed. We know the disadvantages of continually belittling a child. Here is a film that promotes this behavior. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, Pa develops food poisoning, or something like that, I wasn't paying much attention, and he dies. The scene of his deathbed is the substance of which the great acting is made. Frankly, the man didn't even look sick. <br /> <br /> A little later, even Ma dies. Children are left to themselves. And this is where the real adventure begins. Slipping through the rapids, meeting more Indians (these are still nice) and venturing through the snowy terrain, these children do everything. And I was left thinking, "What a pile of garbage!" <br /> <br /> Sorry, but there was nothing saving in this film. This low-cost Little House on the Prairie is a shameful waste of time and an insult to "families" everywhere. I am surprised that in 1975, at the end of the feminist movement, and at a time when Native American treatment was focusing, something like this could really be done. <br /> <br />
