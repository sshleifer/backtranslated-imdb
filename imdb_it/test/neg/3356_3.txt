When Pam Grier did COFFY in 1973, it was an exciting but imperfect film. The plot was gritty and satisfying, even though the acting was often amateur. It was such a success that American International Pictures decided to redesign the formula the following year with FOXY BROWN - not a bad movie but certainly almost like "COFFY II". Now, only a year later, the studio had apparently given up on creating something new for Mrs Grier, since SHEBA, BABY was again the same plot as COFFY and FOXY BROWN. Because the idea was so recycled and because acting and acting are so tired and energy-efficient, it really scours the bottom of the Blaxploitation barrel. <br /> <br /> Just like these other films, SHEBA, BABY starts with the local black gangsters who press and eventually kill someone who loves Pam Grier. In the past they had been drug dealers and pimps, now they were the mobsters who tried to get all the loan companies and pawn shops out of town so they could face the market. And, like the other films, Pam is a successful team with only one woman - dispensing justice and a nice screaming ass. "And, like the other films, there is a" cat fight "between Pam and a white lady of her own in front of "Mr. Big ". And, like the other movies, Mr. Big is a white guy who pulls all the strings. And, like the other movies, he is captured by Mr. Big. And, like the other movies, he DOES NOT kill her immediately but the gives ample opportunity to escape (here, leaving a knife around comfortably.) And, like the other movies, it eventually breaks free and kills its jive - @ $$. <br /> <br /> While this formula sounded interesting in 1973, frankly it was a predictable nuisance from this film. Even if you hadn't seen the other films, it was still bad because the action was so slow - the punches and the kicks seemed so slow and scenic. In one scene, four guys with machine guns, an AR-15 and a shotgun attack, Pam responds by opening a fire with a .357 revolver and killing 3 of the 4 and making sure the other surrenders !! ! Even if it is a good shot, he was rather slow and the boys seemed to wait until he killed them !!! besides, even a world champion shooter or Rambo could not have succeeded with such unilateral chances - after all, these guys had very impressive weapons and they were already aiming for them when "cleverly" pulled out the gun and easily sent these professional goons !! <br /> <br /> In addition to the slow and limping action scenes compared to any other Blaxpoitation film, the film has many logical gaps that show that the writing was terrible, but the study didn't matter. In one case, her boyfriend, "Williams", knew about the yacht and Nu-tronic at the end of the film, but Pam never told him: how did he know? In another, the cops approach a boat full of hoods and the hood immediately opens fire. However, the cops had no evidence that something was happening and the criminals started firing with little provocation. And the criminals had 30-caliber machine guns and other incredibly powerful weapons, but in many cases they were killed by the cops who brandished the .38 nose. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this is a great example of "been there / done that .... a whole lot better". I love Blaxploitation movies, but this one is just too tired and slow to deserve to be watched except by very devout fans of the genre.
