This film, like many others (Remember the Titans, Miracle), follows the basic formula of the sports film: there is a boy, he is an idiot. Jerk hurts. Jerk has to play by someone else's rules. Someone else's rules change Jerk, Jerk becomes good. Enter tragedy (death, drugs, clashes, etc.). Jerk tragedy effects, it totally changes. Jerk must now play in the championship. Lots of close-ups on sweaty players and balls. Jerk wins. Coach or news quote or something that explains the title. Credits. Have you not been touched? These films can now be used to solve the cretins of society. Anyone who pays to see it in theaters must be slapped.
