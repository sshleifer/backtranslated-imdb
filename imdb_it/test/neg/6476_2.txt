I was 12 when I saw the original film (I lived in Italy and the Italian title was "FBI, OPERATION CAT!"). It was a funny movie and not just for kids. This terrible remake is pathetic even for a 5 year old! What Disney had to ruin their reputation and the memory of a good movie I don't know and I can't believe it. Even the title song in the original film (both in the original version and in the Italian dubbed version) was extremely pleasant and created the atmosphere for the story. In this remake the title song is even worse than the movie itself. It was good to see Dean Jones although for a cameo appearance, he was a regular in the great films of old Disney. I can't honestly see anything else positive in this redone movie.
