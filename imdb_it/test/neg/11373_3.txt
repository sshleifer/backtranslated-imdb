I gave a rating of 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> And what is sad is that I tried to watch the movie program for that channel so as not to lose the vision. I wanted to see this film because it's based on a book by one of my favorite authors, Barbara Wilson. As a lesbian, I expected to love this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know how Mrs Wilson thought about the film, but I found it a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> should have been intriguing - it was a mystery - set in Spain, and the main character, Cassandra, is a linguistic translator who is contacted by a mysterious and beautiful woman who offers Cassandra a large amount of money to find her ex-husband, Ben. <br /> <br /> There are secrets revealed, but for some reason it doesn't matter. He was like, oh, so what. I could not be involved with these characters or come to worry about them, or feel for them. I could not even identify myself with these characters. <br /> <br /> I think that much of the failure of the film was the lead actress of the main character. She looked old, tired, exhausted, and boring as dirty water. Her hair was a perpetual mess, her baggy clothes were boring, and she wasn't attractive or interesting. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film was listening to a Dean Martin record, but even that was ruined by the strange makeup worn by the man who was dancing and synchronizing his lips with the song. Believe me, it was nothing to see see the beautiful Mr. Martin who performed it. <br /> <br /> The finish is so syrupy that we wish you to have pancakes with syrup. <br /> <br />
