When I was a young man (oh around 2) I looked at Barney for the first time, and I liked it. BUT, in those days I didn't even have a brain. And now I look back and see what a horrible "Barney" show really is: first of all, EVERYTHING on that show is creepy. Barney, the main character, is a hideous purple dinosaur that speaks of 13-year-olds of "imagination ...." (* cringe *) BJ (I know what he thinks of his name). a smaller but more disturbing yellow dinosaur that is put to be "suppositively" cool. But in reality, it is the exact opposite. After seeing some episodes with B.J. that trudged silently with the cap slightly turned back, and making a few jokes not too funny, I wanted to scream. Baby Bop-oh-oh-god! (* Vomita *) oh-oh-OH-anyway Baby Bop is the worst idea of ​​a character EVER. She is a green triceratops (she is a dinosaur) who wears a yellow blanket. His remarks on "hee-hee-hee" and Barney's praise on "super-deeee-doooper" make it difficult to sit in each episode, as seventh-year students learn shapes and manners. <br /> <br /> And this, my friend, is what makes this show really horrible.
