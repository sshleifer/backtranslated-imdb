I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just because I'm an educated person. This film made me lose 90 minutes of my life where I could do something useful for mankind or just for me. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is poor, the actors never seem scared! Although it should be a horror movie. For example, the scene in which Kurt collects the bones of his former colleague. He should be scared, but it seems quite normal. The girl in the film is such a clich√©. The only thing I liked about her is the dress she wore in the final scene. And by the way, the end was extremely predictable with the cocoon blinking pink in the box. In fact, I was thinking more about an ant walking in the back seat of the car. But it still didn't surprise me.
