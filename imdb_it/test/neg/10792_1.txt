The plot has something about white hunters caught by a tribe of white women in the African jungle / plains. It's a turkey and the other. What it really is is the movie poorly interpreted by the first sounds and silent films mixed with recent videos of badly shot (for release) photos of men on safari. There are scenes of a man in gorilla costume, natives of the southern sea at sea (used to represent people in the middle of Africa), women in bikinis, horrible stories and a guy in a sheet with makeup all over his body (race I think it's insensitive). This is a movie where you can sit and tease, but only with lots of spirits and witty friends. At any other time this will be a task to be solved. It's a bad ugly movie. Besides this, I am speechless
