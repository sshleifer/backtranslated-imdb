No wonder many of us hate classical music; and what are the children to think about? With an educational PR like this, serious music will soon slide from life support to the morgue. Children know when they are discussed, and this is no exception; why can't someone make a film about classical music for children? I must admit that I liked the actor who played Beethoven, he played the role with enthusiasm and a sharp balance of the moving and humorous aspects of Beethoven's character; he obviously did his research. Otherwise, it is a third step of the old ABC Afterschool Special format, without the occasional charm of those short films. Sorry about the rant, but this is an important topic for young people, and could have been done well; I wonder if musicians or filmmakers were responsible? However, children are better than you think, folks ... <br /> <br /> Medtner
