The story of Macbeth was one of the most successful Shakespeare ever written. This may be due to some features that place it near the slasher genre, homicide, murder, killing, killing, liters of blood, a tense sexual relationship between the main characters etc. More than that, the original game is very attractive taking into consideration the length (it is only half the size of Hamlet) and the focus on Macbeth so we are forced to worry despite its bloody nature. The game would seem to be the ideal on which to base a film. Not so long to give filmmakers the chance to explore its many levels, a good actor can play the role of his life, the film has a profound meaning in every historical period. Unfortunately this was not the case with Macbeth. Polanski's version is fairly close but insists too much in the medieval period. Welles's film is too personal, with an interesting shift towards totalitarianism, the television version of the 1990s is too superficial. This 2006 movie is no exception. It is very far from a Shakespeare film, but it is interesting to see how the director has understood the story and where he places it in contemporary life. No knights in shiny armor, but gangster in shining cars. A lot of drugs and trippy music replace the fear of the night in the original game. The idea of ​​Macbeth is so simple that it does not need Shakespeare to take it and implant it in modern life. The worst part of the film is the lines. Most of the moving drama scenes, like the dagger scene, are cut so much that they seem useless. Replacing the shots on the door with bells and horses with cars sounds fun. If they wanted to make a film about power and its temptation, they could easily have done it without Shakespeare. This Macbeth seems to be more loose with a brain injury than a brave, brave and ambitious warrior who wants power so much that he is ready to kill and is caught in a web of fear and despair. The film does not clarify what drives Madam Macbeth mad, does not give a reason why some of the characters should fear Macbeth and his "terror" (since there is no hereditary ascension to the throne, what without throne and everything) Macbeth in an awkward position, since the leadership of a band is so far from royalty, as the whole film is far from any Shakespeare. In conclusion, we have two overlapping ideas that never meet, making this a film that in the end is meaningless .... Don't stand on the order of your going, but go!
