This is a good time to say how well I think of this site: it gives me the opportunity to express all the frustration I experienced for two hours, waiting for something to happen, something to say, to show, to subtly insinuate, for a symbol, an idea, whatever. No, only long, endless violins, alternated by a tired piano. Tired voices, tired actors and bored characters and situations. Boring is the long death of the mind, and this film is, from this point of view, a public enemy. How many thousands of hours of life will still be stolen from thousands of innocent spectators. I don't claim my money back, just for my time and the time of the people I invited to see this ... oh God!
