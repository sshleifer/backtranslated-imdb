For those who could send me bad e-mails, I push it. There is a tendency in Hollywood where those who create excessively bizarre films are immediately insensitive to criticism. Garden State tends to be one of those movies. <br /> <br /> Of course, Zach Braff, the protagonist of a rather overvalued sitcom, surprises people with a certain talent behind the camera, but this does not justify the kind of praise a film like this has received. History is often too subtle and superficial to provide true insight. People have compared this film to The Graduate, but those kinds of people are the types that try to subvert independent cinema. Independent films are subject to the same bite-and-win mentality that typically affects studio films, but people seemed to have forgotten that there are much more bad indie films than good ones. Garden State is not atrocious, but it is not beautiful. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film is too fast, with the result of a rather fast surfacing of Large in his previous life. After ten years, people tend to act as if they never left. Where's the embarrassment? Of course, the situation is always solved by a fast-paced drug-tasting scene (which I will say was painted rather accurately). The film seems to present many emotional inequalities, giving us the idea that the emotion will present itself later in a deeper and well thought-out way. However, he cannot keep on those fronts, leaving us to wonder why the journey to some of his decisions and moments has been quickly resolved (such as the serious robberies of Peter Saarsgard). It was not completely abysmal, but perhaps we should stop praising the film as something it is not.
