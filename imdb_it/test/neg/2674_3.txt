[possible spoilers] <br /> <br /> The sixth movie "Halloween" is an extremely depressing affair, but unfortunately not in the way imagined by the directors. By now, everyone knows the story of how he was slaughtered and released in such a sloppy and inconsistent form. The second part, in particular, does not make much sense, since the elements of the plot are introduced and dropped, apparently at random. The end left me scratching my head. What the hell happened? Dr. Loomis is dead or what? This is what you get when you put a shameless movie-making hack. It is not a pretty sight. <br /> <br /> On a related note, this is the most violently graphic entry in the series. I have no problems with blood if it is in the right place, but this film takes it to absurd levels. The infamous exploding head must be a new low for the series. It seems that Michael himself is enjoying the act of killing another human being, inconsistent with his efficient and methodical approach in the original by John Carpenter. <br /> <br /> I'm not quite sure who was responsible; the director Joe Chappelle or the producers, probably a combination of both. I would be perfectly happy to grant forgiveness to all interested parties, if only they published the legendary "Producers' Cut", a more complete version of the film which is a great improvement from every account. From what I understand, it's like a completely different film. I offer to pay the full price to buy the DVD if Miramax learns and releases it. <br /> <br /> There are a handful of good elements, however. The idea that Michael is controlled by the Druids is intriguing. Paul Rudd is as solid as Tommy Doyle, whose appearance is a perfect link to the original. Slick images help make the process a little more watchable. But these meager offerings are obscured by the overhead of drivel we have to endure. <br /> <br /> Finally, "The Curse of Michael Myers" is known to be Donald Pleasance's latest film. Many of his scenes have been excluded from the final cut and, when it appears, seem fragile and unhappy. The film is dedicated to his memory, an obvious (if not intentional) insult if ever there was one. The fact that a talented artist has to end his career in this way is too depressing even to think about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of ****) <br /> <br /> Issued by Dimension Films
