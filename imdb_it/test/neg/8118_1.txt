Unless there is a huge ironic conspiracy going on, my mouth open when I read the positive reviews of this film; I can't believe this movie was even released, it's so bad. I admit that it's not my kind of movie, but I still tried to see it objectively, you know, so bad is fun, and he was still offended by his sheer vitality. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious, they can't have watched the rushes and I imagine there was a scene by scene, it's really terrible. It's the worst movie I've seen in many years, in fact, I wouldn't even call it a movie, it's a tragedy. The black gay friend, who in reality nobody calls "gay", is only implicit because he is so crazy? Homophobe. This is not good, in fact, this is absolutely vomiting inducing. Jokes die on their pathetic asses, music is so bad that it defies belief. The person who compiled the soundtrack chose essentially the most horrible and mutilated songs they had ever heard and put them into this waste of film material. Oh, my good Christ, I can't believe the 80s produced total garbage like this, I grew up through them, and I can't find anything worthy of note here, it must have been a dark time to be cinema goer. /> <br /> If you even think about watching this movie, go to a psychiatrist, so he will slap you, sick, sick.
