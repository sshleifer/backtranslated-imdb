"Changi" is an Australian comedy / drama set in the World War II Japanese prison camp. The story breaks between past events and the present, when senior veterans plan a meeting. This is a highly publicized and controversial miniseries, here in Australia. The budget is finished ($ 6.5 million Australian dollars); historians and veterans have criticized its authenticity; and the critics put to shame the difficult mix of comedy and drama (nuances of "Pearl Harbor"). Series writer John Doyle (half of the successful Roy & H.G comedy series), has tried to defend himself with comments on "the characters are composites of real people"; "the troops used comedy to deal with the situation"; "is based only on real events"; "one of our actors was actually there" etc. I have no problems with any of these points. Many dramatic and fictional films have come out of the Japanese P.O.W. experience in the field: "King Rat", "Tenko", "Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence", "Bridge over the Kwai River", "Paradise Road", "Empire of the Sun", "Blood Oath" and "A Town Like" Alice ". The black comedy has often been successfully used in POW's dramas:" Life is Beautiful "," The Great Escape "," Seven Beauties "," Stalag 17 "," The Colditz Story "and even" Hogan's Heroes " So why is "Changi" a monumental failure? - the acting in "Changi" is uniformly excellent, music and cinematography are good - it is the writing and the direction that have disappointed it. Each scene seemed to give me waves of déjà vu "When Anthony Hayes is forced to stand in the scorching sun, I thought," I didn't see Alec Guinness do this in "Bridge on the River Kwai"? ". The sudden glow in the surreal song and dance brought back the" Singing Detective "by Dennis Potter, but without the finesse. This indebtedness has happened so often that he stopped writing lazy by size and paste, rather than as a gift. The constant interconnection between past and present stories has left me unable to concentrate on both. Flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool - here it left me away from the characters, where intensity was required. The "Ausiness" is exaggerated - every conversation seemed to include "stone the bloody corvi" and so, that I was saying "I understand, I know they are Australians". Cultural stereotyping also extended to the young Japanese too mushy and Japanese; British officer tense; wisest Japanese commander; fun-loving, unusually rascals, etc. I thought I was watching "Hogan's Heroes on the River Kwai". After 3 episodes I'm tuning in.
