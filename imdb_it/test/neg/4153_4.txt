"The Beautiful Country" is a big disappointment. It does not reach my expectations. Bihn, a tall, muscular boy, is the son of an American soldier and a Vietnamese woman during the Vietnam War. We were told that he was treated "less than dust" in Vietnam in the early 1990s, so he fled to America to look for his American father. <br /> <br /> Does it look like a heart-broken material? Perhaps, but show in this film. I find it difficult to connect to Bihn emotionally, because the film is full of clich√©s and I simply don't understand it or don't believe it. The writing of this film is a total failure. The plot is full of holes. Grab some events as needed, trying to arouse the emotion of the public. We're not that stupid and it doesn't work that way. Let's see what the film is trying to do. So, you don't hear Bihn's boat trip (yes, it was on a boat!) It's hard enough, we make a storm during the night and make the ship tremble slightly. Still not touched? Well! Take a small child to suffer the heat, the hungry, the sickness, the violence with the adults on the boat, hoping that it will do the trick to touch the public. Still not touched? SOB heartless, let's say ... OK, I don't want to spoil the movie, but you have the idea. <br /> <br /> The film is really long and slow. He never tells us why Bihn didn't visit his mother and father until the time of the film when he left to look for his mother and father. What did the 20 years do before going to Saigon to look for his mother? And guess what? He is lucky and everyone will tell him where to find the person he is looking for and he will find anyone without a scratch. I really think that the Department of Homeland Security should hire those Vietnamese who helped Bihn. The beautiful country? Which? Both Vietnam and America seem like hell to Bihn.
