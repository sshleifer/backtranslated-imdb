Retro Puppet Master starts in Kolewige in 1944, where the puppeteer Andre Toulon (Guy Rolfe) and his living puppets plan to escape from Germany, they claim in a puppet master Inn Toulon that he remembers his youth and the point where he learned the secret of giving life in objects that died in 1902 in Paris when his younger self (Greg Sestero) ran the Theate Magique. Describes the fateful night when he meets a 3,000-year-old Egyptian magician named Afzel (Jack Donner) and the eventual love for life of the beautiful young Ilsa (Brigitta Dau). It tells the story of how Afzel transmitted the gift of life to himself and gave life to his wooden puppets that were part of the Theater Magique show. However the gift of life was also a curse, like the ancient God Sutek to whom the secret was first stolen by Afzel who wants it back and all those who learned it dead ... <br /> <br / > I was a bit of a Puppet Master puppet as a big fan of the top three, so I decided to watch the rest of the franchise and as such saw Puppet Master 4 (1993), Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter (1994), Curse of the Puppet Master (1998) and now Retro Puppet Master in the space of a couple of weeks and boy was it difficult to overcome them all, especially this as it is the worst of the series so far. Retro Puppet Master feels like a cross between Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge (1991) with its setting and Puppet Master 4 and Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter with Sutek trying to kill all the associates in his stolen life by giving secrets. Here too there is not much continuity, again there is none of the green serums in the previous films and although Andre Toulon committed suicide in 1939 at the beginning of the original Puppetmaster (1989) he is seen alive and well during 1944 in this . Most of the story is told as a flashback and focuses on Andre Toulon himself rather than on puppets, the film focuses on his relationship with Ilsa and on him learning the secret of life and it's all boring and boring stuff to be honest . Even at just 80 minutes odd Retro Puppet Master feels long and padded without a real rhythm and the concept is not central as the plot never settles and generally skips a lot. Then, of course, there is the disconcerting decision to totally redesign the puppets I found incredible, I mean why would the producers take the one basic thing that made Puppet Master movies so memorable and completely eliminated? The puppets are seen briefly at the beginning and at the end, but otherwise we get these scruffy-looking wooden caricatures that are nowhere near as cool as their modern reworkings. It has never been explained why these puppets were used rather than those that all Puppet Master fans have come to love, even if it is suspected that Full Moon was hoping to make another sequel that was just that question. <br /> <br /> If a bad story and complete lack of our favorite puppets wasn't bad enough Full Moon decided to go with a PG-13 rating to make Retro Puppet Master the only Puppet Master movie not classified "R" in the United States (obviously other countries have their own film classification systems) and therefore there is not a single drop of blood in the whole film, puppets do not kill anyone, there are neither curses nor nudity. This is more tamed than all domesticated children's stuff. In addition to the puppets themselves that are garbage, the special effect is also that of the series, there is no stop motion animation in this, no CGI computerized effect (surely in 1999 the CGI was quite cheap?) And all the effects are rigid effects puppet type auction. I mean every time you see a marionette "on foot", the camera is always positioned above the waiting, so the legs do not have to be shown and obviously there is a production assistant who is simply pushing the thing, it is so complex and state of the art how to get special effects. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing the Retro Puppet Master has done is that it looks pretty nice, the production design of the period, costumes and props are actually quite impressive and it's a pretty film nice to look at sometimes. Apparently filmed in Bucharest, Romania, which doubles quite well for the turn of the last century in Paris. The acting here is horrible and perhaps the worst in the series. <br /> <br /> Retro Puppet Master is more or less the latest Puppet Master film as the next Puppet Master: The Legacy (2004) basically edited together with films from the previous seven films and is a rather poor way of rounding off the series that started so well with three fantastic and distinctive puppet gestures. Don't worry about that, look at one of the top three again and just remember the good times ... The killer puppets would be back in the terrible Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys (2004) selection movie.
