The film is not bad, until ... <br /> <br /> The main problem is with the ending, so it is a pretty important spoiler ... <br /> <br /> For the moment it was made , it is a beautiful film, and it gets very good. <br /> <br /> However ... <br /> <br /> In the book, Sam succeeds and lives his dream, while in the film, he surrenders and returns to the city, completely destroying the theme "you can do what you think about ". <br /> <br /> This film is a profanation, and instead of redoing the classics that do not need to be redone, the Hollywood types who have no better ideas should do this just this time.
