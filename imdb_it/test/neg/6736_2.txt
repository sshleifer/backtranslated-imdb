I saw that "The Foreigner" was included in the "Bottom 100" movie listings here on IMDb, so I didn't expect much when I tuned into the US channel a week ago, but I had hopes. "Belly Of The Beast" (which aired a month ago) was a disaster, but it had great scenery and photography and some fantastic moments scattered everywhere, so I thought this movie could have had the same. <br /> <br /> Alas, this film fails the basic skill standards in almost every way. The screenplay was born as the bastard daughter of a novel by John LeCarre and a film by Richard Ludlum, but made by people who have no talent for writers worthy of plot and characterization. Instead what we have obtained is a nest of clumsy, petty, nihilistic and cryptic, of muddy minds, intricate alliances and shootings. And chest shootings. And the bombing. And eviscerations. This translates into the directorial style, which is based on "grainy / slow-motion" shots minced every 10 seconds, along with wire work and hyperactive jumps. These film devices were stalled 10 years ago when MTV directors used them for Whitesnake videos, and the director works them as a punching machine, hoping to inject a bizarre techno art-house thriller into the process. <br /> <br /> Segal himself is simply horrible in this. He spends the whole movie talking with a half hoarse and guttural whisper and alternating two expressions: he seems to be sucking a lemon while someone is doing a little asshole under his nose or looks constipated. And it's so big (and vain about it) that he never removes the duster from his knee with his camera. I understand that it is difficult to keep the circumference under control as a male actor ages (although Denzel Washington and Paul Newman never had this problem). But we take care of it with sincerity, and growing as an actor, not hiding it with carefully chosen camera angles and floor lengths. <br /> <br /> So I can't really say what's going on, and the movie doesn't give me a reason to worry about what's going on, and the main character is completely one-dimensional and visually unpleasant. Not a recipe for a good cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Strangely, most of the sets and landscapes are suggestive and suggestive; in fact, if you were to freeze the film on almost any scene that was not a close-up of Seagal, you will be struck by the care and professionalism of the lighting, colors and composition and how beautiful Eastern Europe is settings are. But dressing a rotten egg like a Faberge egg cannot make it edible. And the proceedings are rotten of heart. <br /> <br /> There are "cool" films (like "Versus"), and there are visually striking but emotionally cold films (such as "Underworld") and there are bad words about thrillers (like "The Bourne Identity" and his remake with Matt Damon). And then there's this thing, which can't decide what it wants to be, pretends to be all these things and fails because it has no courage or soul. <br /> <br /> This is a film made by professionals with a real budget, so you can't put it in the same class as "Manos", "Killer Shrews" or "Hobgoblins". But I'd rather watch all three movies over and over again than watch "The Foreigner" once again.
