The most disposable film in the history of cinema? This is a strong competitor! Why waste so much money on such useless useless work? The only difference between the classic HItchcock and this poor imitation is the color, the large screen and Leila's Walkman !! A film that should generate chills and fear leaves me completely indifferent. <br /> <br /> No, are you going to say it will spur the younger generations to see the original? balderdash! This "psycho 1998" is a giant spoiler. <br /> <br /> They could have done something different, for example, approaching an actor closer to Bloch "s Bates, an obese man. They settle for a hateful rehash! A vice! and live Alfred Hitchcock!
