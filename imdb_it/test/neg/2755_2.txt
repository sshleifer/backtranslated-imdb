This film reminded me of a lot of a Dead Kennedys song called "Straight A's". However, unlike this film, the hero of the DK song turns into suicide. I hope that this bozo has resorted to killing himself instead of committing the crime he committed. The whole thing has been twisted and, at first, sympathizes with the hero of the film, then quickly betrays your sympathies. The long sequences of showing only the face of the hero while delivering a monologue drag the film a little. Avoid this if possible.
