This movie could have been great. It is not in my opinion. The plot is fragmented, the publisher appears to be unable to choose between a Guy Ritchie narrative style and a more direct narrative style. There is a great emphasis on excessive violence, including torture. Too much if you ask me. The characters are very superficial and stereotyped, I would have liked to see more depth there. It is difficult to identify with the main character. As a result the film remains shallow as a whole. <br /> <br /> The film says that it offers the viewer an internal view of the British criminal subclass, more specifically of the Essex subclass. Fans, steroids, cocaine, heroin and violence, so much violence. Violence resulting from paranoia and fear in general. In this film no one seems to use his (or his) brain, we are looking at a lot of animals in clothes. As I said, there isn't much plot and the plot leaves a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> If you are a male under 30, like blood and hardcore violence and you think it's funny, then this is a movie for you. If you're looking for a movie that depicts real people with a well-developed storyline, suspense and depth, well ... you can skip this.
