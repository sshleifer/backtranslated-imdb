The title leads viewers to believe that this is a fun movie to watch and probably a lot better when viewed under the influence, but it's not good at all. A 15-minute sequence with Jack Black that magnificently plays one of his songs and stumbles on acid while venturing into the woods does not save this movie at all. Every actor in this film continued to do better things, except for the main girls I couldn't think of a movie where I had seen them before. I hate to sell the movies but I also hate not being able to find anything decent in the movies. The film is sad, not very funny and has had such potential with its impressive cast. If it was redone and written above it could be fantastic. If you want to see a movie that looks good, look at Grandma's Boy, or Half Baked or Dazed and Confused, but this is not a movie to watch.
