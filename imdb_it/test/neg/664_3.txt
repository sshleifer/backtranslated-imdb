Another movie with a wrestling star. So far I've noticed ... the wrestlers can't act on the movie screen. This film is no exception. <br /> <br /> The action is terrible. It makes you laugh at what they say, and they can't be serious, they try to act scared but they fail and they seem stupid. The acting is horrible, perhaps from the bad director. <br /> <br /> The plot was stupid ... Only some people are put in a hotel because they are criminals and are killed at random. The film is stupid to the end, making it one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only thought and this is why I give it a 3 and not a 1 is because of the way Jacob Goodnight dies. The pole through the head and the stories of him diving in was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a really awful movie, and you definitely shouldn't waste your time with it.
