Being from New Orleans, I can say that almost everything in this film, from the atrocious N'Awlins dialect to the highly creative "manipulation" of the Crescent City geography, is horrible. This is another one of those great Hollywood movies that decides to stereotype New Orleans as: 1. A city full of French-sounding idiots 2. A city full of people playing as if it had just returned from Blanche Dubois's summer house 3 Una city ​​of drunks, where every day is Mardi Gras 4. A city of profound mystery, in which almost all practice or are victims of voodoo (I admit that perhaps we are a city of drunks, even if every day is NOT Mardi Gras). "The Big Easy" is one of the worst movies about New Orleans. I would not recommend it to anyone.
