This film is about an actor in difficulty trying to find satisfaction in life, in particular the love he didn't like for 5 years. <br /> <br /> Basically it is a film that presents a man with poor social skills, and he says things wrong all the time. The plot is empty and forced. The main character, James, is alone, but this theme of solitude is not adequately explored. It is more like an empty statement from which other subplots derive. The sadness and disappointment after being dumped are superficial. There is a serious lack of emotion in the film. <br /> <br /> It's not even fun like a comedy. There are some strange coatings, but it is so. Missing the happy and uplifting atmosphere to infect people with happy mood. I can't find "I want someone to eat cheese with" fun.
