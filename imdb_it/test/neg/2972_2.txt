Hollywood has made a lot of weird movies over the years, but none more weird than this. Why this film was made I will never know, nor how Paramount could have thought it would have sold some tickets in 1947. It's the strangest mix of genres I've seen in a long time, a film that doesn't really know if you're trying be a serious war drama or a Viennese operetta comedy. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of an English spy trying to get a poison gas formula from Germany in the days immediately before the Second World War. Ray Milland, a good actor, is stuck playing the part as a fugitive from Monty Python, the exaggerated kindergarten dialogue in English. In Germany he meets a gypsy, Marlene Dietrich, who helps him to travel indoors as, of course, another gypsy. She plays her part as the typical Gypsy caricature of the Viennese operetta, as well as the other "gypsies" in the film. But there are also the Nazis, who are not funny at all. And then Milland discovers that he is starting to think like a gypsy, and that it is not treated as a joke. Sometimes the music is for a light comedy, sometimes for a drama. Whenever the Nazis appear, the soundtrack of the film plays Wagner, which is fun in itself. <br /> <br /> This film could have been a comedy, or it could have taken the situation of the gypsies seriously and done a serious job of showing how the Nazis treated them. Both are mentioned in this film, but neither continued. What remains is a really weird mixture of genres that must have embarrassed everyone (except the director) involved. <br /> <br /> Bizarre.
