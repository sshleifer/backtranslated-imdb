I wish all the counterfeiters and the parody of the horror would disappear. If you're going to investigate Loch Ness ... do it for real. Enough with the bull ****. The same with horror and science fiction ... if you're going to make a movie and it's supposed to be scary ... it gets scary ... not funny. I hate when I watch a horror movie and the character is fighting for his life (or the race or whatever ... their life is at stake) and they are beating the lines. This never happens ... why where did all the good directors go? I think horror and science fiction have really gone down since the 70s. I crave the days when a horror movie was scary ... all this shit of "scary movie" is for birds. This film is also for birds. If you would really like to see a good survey or talk seriously here ... don't expect this video.
