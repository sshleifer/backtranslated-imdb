I'm a big fan of the original Assault On Precinct 13. The ice cream scene still haunts me today. Now I am 33 years old and I still remember being a child. When I heard they were doing it again, I thought it might be okay, but when I saw the movie, it's not the same 100% movie. It is not a remake. It's a bad idea stolen. It was completely ruined. The cast, Maria Bello, Laurence Fishburne, Ethan Hawke, Gabriel Burne, John Leguizamo and Drea De Matteo are all great actors but even they can't save this film. It was simply wrong. Even the setting was completely opposite. And how the hell did anyone in that city notice that there was a war going on next door? Why didn't he help show up first? Stupid. Nonsense.
