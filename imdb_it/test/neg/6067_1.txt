From Kreestos: <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible, terrible, drivel. Act poor. Many texture defects. I don't recommend it at all. <br /> <br /> From Wikipedia: <br /> <br /> Artistic licenses The working manuscript of the score is attributed to two copyists [1], both were male, not female as depicted in the film. <br /> <br /> The copyists did not contribute or alter the score. In fact, they were rebuked by Beethoven for any deviations resulting from the original score. <br /> <br /> The film is set in 1824 during the composition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Throughout the film, Beethoven proved to be difficult to hear but quite capable of understanding people who speak loudly. In fact, Beethoven had lost much of his hearing seven years earlier (1817). Beethoven has never experienced permanent deafness; his condition fluctuated between total silence and terrible tinnitus. The Ninth Symphony was composed at a time when Beethoven's hearing had seriously deteriorated. At this point in his life, most of Beethoven's conversations were facilitated by the use of notebooks. It can be argued, however, that he was also able to read people's lips, evidenced by his insistence that people face him when they spoke to him. <br /> <br /> In the film, Beethoven makes an allusion to the Moonlight Sonata. This is an anachronism given that the Sonata n. 14 "almost a fantasy" was not named "Moonlight" until several years after his death.
