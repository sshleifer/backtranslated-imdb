okay, let's go to the point: there is no way to be able to give something other than 1 in 10; yet you must see it! The acting is bad, but it's not as bad as the script, which in turn pales before production values. Cardboard boards? yes, we have it then. Car mats painted in silver and used as armor? there he is! <br /> <br /> The film itself claims to be artistic, but it's cheap; the same shots are used repeatedly - especially in the fighting scenes pulled out; there is (fortunately!) very little dialogue, and there is a lot of 'artistic' music to remember the horror! <br /> <br /> Yet all this horrible is compelling - you have to watch it just because you can say you've seen it. I haven't even gotten to the sterile sets, the "plot" or the laughable special effects; this is really the film school "how not to do it". This has to be seen - spread the word, and let the world join together disconcerting what the hell is going on at the end <br /> <br /> The best thing, though, is that they made a sequel.
