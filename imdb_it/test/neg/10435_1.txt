Acting made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play. The plot is full of holes, holes and jumps around, so you have no idea what just happened. Half of the scenes are useless. There is no hint of character development. The soundtrack / soundtrack is composed of about three tracks, one in particular is reproduced in about 70% of the scenes. I'm glad I just rented the movie, but I still feel cheated. Avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to see decent actors offering horrible shows. It seems that the bulk of the budget has been spent on putting some brand actors in this film far from ugly. This film is like visiting a strip club, trying to make you excited and interested, but just as you think something will happen that was thrown into an unrelated scene and you let yourself try to figure out how you got there.
