This film was shot using a digital camera, and shows. There were enough annoying digital tricks used to alienate the viewer, even with the help of a terrible score. As if that were not enough, the acting was also terrible. Now in Hartley's films the acting is always peculiar, but here it was only BAD, especially from Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan) and Harvey, who (thank God) doesn't get to say much. After all these external problems it is also very unfortunate that the story itself is not that good. The jokes are predictable and incredibly simple, and events follow one another from one accident to another. The so-called book of life with Armageddon inside is not much of an excuse to see the actors fighting to say their lines. All in all this film is a waste of time and money and effort. Thumb down.
