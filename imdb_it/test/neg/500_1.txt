I saw this last night with an open mind. I'm sorry to say it's still bad. First, the movie is too loud and you can't hear what people are saying. The accents are bad especially Richard Masur. What does the French hen do in this film ??? Misasting at its worst. Walken's trick is strange. The Harvard scene is useless and unnecessary. The character of Kristoferson is unlikely and I wanted him to be killed and leave. Meanwhile, the Walken character is killed too soon and easily (despite the trick). The settlers are all stupid. GET ORGANIZED a lot of balls, people come to kill you !!!!! The character of John Hurts offers a bit of humor but that's all. <br /> <br /> I have nothing good to say about this piece of excessive shit. The only positive thing is that he ruined the career of the director and killed United Artists. <br /> <br /> Still Crap after all these years.
