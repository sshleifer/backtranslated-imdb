Although the Our Gang comedies still have their followers, I must say that their attempt to graduate for film, courtesy of Hal Roach, came out shortly. Because Roach must choose the Civil War as the subject of all the racism that will follow. <br /> <br /> Dashing the southern cavalier Phillips Holmes welcomes the young orphan Spanky McFarland and his young black friend Buckwheat Thomas after Spanky inadvertently exposes a card trickster on a river boat. Everything is placid and serene in the Old South and then the Civil War gets to ruin it for everyone. <br /> <br /> But even children can fascinate the worst in the world and there is nothing worse than those damn Yankees. They just got south and ruined it for everyone. <br /> <br /> Criticized however for his southern point of view, Gone With The Wind was a good example for the southern cause and for the black portraits even if servile that they would have to be for necessity are still three-dimensional characters. Hattie McDaniel would not have won his Oscar if it were not so. Prissy's Butterfly McQueen character, as foolish and empty as she is, has a certain dimension. <br /> <br /> But here are perhaps some of the worst racial stereotypes ever carried out in Hollywood. The company of Spanky and Buckwheat shows that children get along well, racial feelings are not acquired. It is not the servility of blacks that is questionable, but there is a total acceptance of this. Just from that horrible song of watermelon, sung on the end credits, General Spanky's message is bad. <br /> <br /> Yet he received an Oscar nomination for sound recording, probably one of the very few Hal Roach ever released from the short subject field. <br /> <br /> General Spanky is far from Gone with the Wind though.
