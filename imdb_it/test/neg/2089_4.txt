I chose this DVD for 3.99 to video rogers to get enough points to get a better movie for free. In reality I never thought of watching it but started to tease my curiosity and in the end I decided to insert the DVD player. The effects in this film are horrible and cheap. Some of the dialogs in this film seem to be written by a happy 12-year-old boy. The acting is really vulgar in some parts, and the "action" scenes are completely ridiculous. You would burst out laughing in some parts, which was good for me because it entertained me gently. The plot is that a girl has a curse on her that makes her vomit snakes, so a shaman has to take her to Los Angeles, there are also two girls trying to smuggle drugs there and a few other people who aren't important to the plot, not that there's really a plot. Do not expect anything from this film and do not listen to the cover, there are not 100 passengers and 3,000 vipers, there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakes. <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, there is a trailer that is almost as ridiculous as the movie, a whirlwind that is just a hit over and over again by an actor trying to say train, and the scenes deleted are really useless, if they weren't good enough to stay in this movie they have to be pretty bad. There is also a very bad making of featurette that really doesn't show much else except that the people involved in this film were kind of idiots. I can't recommend it unless you want a really bad movie to laugh with friends. I give him 2 kitty cats out of 5.
