The story is derived from "King Lear"; the setting is a farm in Iowa. Here is a test for this kind of thing: if you find yourself asking, "Because the sas-so does so and so," and the answer is, "because that's what happened in" King Lear "," you know the movie He has failed. Well, this is what happens here. The father figure in this story does not live his life, he is imitating a fiction. But in the film there is something more wrong than this. <br /> <br /> Jocelyn Moorhouse is ambitious - much more ambitious than I think you realize. He's trying to take the story of King Lear and completely change the setting. This is a task in itself. The most probable result is that the transplanted history will die, and no one will be able to understand why (although there are enough successful transplants, such as "West Side Story", to make it worth trying). But he is also trying to see a revisionist again. In the version of "King Lear" he wishes to create, Reagan and Goneril command our sympathy and Cordelia is a villain. This is also a task in itself. <br /> <br /> Success in both activities is difficult; succeeding in both at once is impossible. In fact, being able to try each other is impossible. If we have to look at the same events from a different moral perspective, then the events must be the same events - which means that there can be no alteration of the settings. If history is to be transplanted, alive, in a different context, its moral heart must continue to beat all the time - which means that there can be no alteration of the ethical perspective. Moorhouse would have failed not only in one but in both his efforts. And so he did. ... Of course, it is possible to try both tasks, fail in both tasks, yet with a stroke of luck on a work of art that is fine for independent reasons. I say this because I haven't read Jane Smiley's novel, which, as far as I know, is good for independent reasons. But the film is not. If there was nothing else that didn't work, there would still be no way around the fact that it's completely so terribly terrible. The cornfields themselves are even more boring than they would be in real life - which should not be the case, since on top of my head I can think of four films ("The Wizard of Oz", "North by Northwest "," The Straight Story "," Kikujiro ") in which the cornfields are not at all boring.
