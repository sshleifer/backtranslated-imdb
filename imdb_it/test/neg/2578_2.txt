This is a known fact, Mr. Seagal cannot smile, he can act, he can kick, there are dim smiles, no real smiles, they don't laugh out loud and no real point of view of this confusing movie. We see Mr. Seagal's excessive weight as Dr. Wesley Maclaren, who desperately needs a haircut and his real daughter Ayako made an appearance as his office assistant. Story: Okay, so Wesley lives in another damn outback with his sweet daughter Holly. They sit and have fun with their red flower tea and omelettes and on the other side of the city some overweight militia leaders decide to make the whole city feel bad by spreading a virus that travels in the air and kills in a matter of 2 days thinking he could survive as he had an antidote. Problem, there is no antidote and what exists only holds the virus for a while. The CIA is contacted and they too cannot help and only one person is not sick, Wesley's daughter, Holly. So she is persecuted thinking that the cure is in her blood. Wesley manages to grab his daughter and take her to his grandfather, who is a native Indian. Together with his sister-in-law Ann they go to a base where there is a hidden laboratory to find a cure, but even the soldiers are dying slowly and so others if they do not find a cure in time. And to shorten the time, neither Ann nor Wesley are infected by the virus ... hmm. A weak fight scene. The terrible film and all the men in it are in desperate need of a master of stairs.
