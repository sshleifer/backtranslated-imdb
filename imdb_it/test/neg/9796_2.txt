... and I bought a vampire motorcycle stumbles across the line like a drunk with its strings tied together. Some "bad" movies are pretty funny (like Inseminoid by Norman J. Warren), some "bad" movies are just bad (like Kent Bateman's Headless Eyes), but "bad" movies that try and do the postmodernist thing to be consciously bad should always be approached with extreme caution. A lot of people think that the Terror Firmer of Troma is a masterpiece of bad taste, for example, but I imagine that anyone over the age of nineteen acts as a braggart. Then there's John Carpenter's Dark Star. Yes, it is characteristic, and certainly a product of its time, but as a film it is only two notches above useless. This British black-comedy-horror release with no budget is trying to get a satirical tone, with its endless references to its fellow shoestring splatter (including Psychomania, Horror Hospital and pretty much anything by Pete Walker), but because of the bad performance of the second -string television actors (the protagonist resembles Amy Winehouse), a script that seems to have been written on the back of a beermat peeled by two "boys" without understanding how the cinematographic comedy, Dean Friedman (intentionally?) works elevator-rock sound and production values ​​never go beyond mediocre, the net result is a film that can only be AT, rather than WITH. If your idea of ​​whoopee is anthropomorphic turds, Chinese takeaways called Fu King and references to TV commercials long forgotten, you'll like this one, but don't expect too much.
