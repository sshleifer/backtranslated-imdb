Disappointing dramatic comedy with a sentimental covering, Michael J. Fox is ideally chosen as a former child, who now runs a talent agency for young actors; Nathan Lane and Cyndi Lauper are his assistants. All of this sounds like it couldn't be missing, however too much of the scenery is given to the strident Christina Vidal as a streetwise guy that Fox believes will be the next big thing. They quickly block the blocking heads, and the playful dialogue makes them go back and forth for an uninteresting formula finish. Fox and Lane are both attractive, but the energy of the early scenes gives way to molasses. Produced brilliantly, but ultimately stale. * 1/2 from ****
