A boring effort by the not-yet-great director Budd Boetticher and the beautiful but not yet insipid actress Nina Foch, this film is, like one of the other reviews, the quintessence of a certain type of film B. It's not the right type. And a promising premise and too much fog are wasted. <br /> <br /> Basic plot - Nina, a nurse on leave from the duties of the war because of her nerves, has a nightmare. Meet a charming person in the resort where he is pausing his nerves and realizes he is in the dream, even though he has never met him before. Meanwhile, it turns out that our guy is working as a spy, and is about to leave on a secret, secret mission, which must not fail. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are the Nazis. And the holes in the plot. And smart people who act in a very likely way take them to completely useless scrapers, so that the execution time can be reduced to over an hour. In the end, the film becomes a competition between which a group of spies can behave in a more foolish way. If the FBI and the OSS acted like this crew, we would have lost the war in '42. <br /> <br /> The film itself is filmed fairly flat (despite the best efforts of the smoke machine) and the acting - as it appears to be in many of the Columbia Bs TCM has shown recently - is curiously free. It's less stylized than what you might find in a Warner Bros movie with a similar budget, but also less fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Boetticher's strength, of course, is a rather concrete style that allows for strong stories and acting in his Randolph Scott westerns to come to the fore. Perhaps the problem here is that such a style will not work when the script is bad and the actors get tired of their five films a year.
