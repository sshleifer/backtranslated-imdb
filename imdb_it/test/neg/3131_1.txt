This may have been an excellent film. However, like many others, I think too. It is hurt due to the transfer of languages. If the whole film has to be read, then it moves away from the film and becomes something else. He has an excellent score for me and I couldn't wait to rent it. But once it was done, it was a real disappointment. Here at Boardman, Ohio, I couldn't find an English version for something like this. This film has also been compared to Dark Hours and we won't see it at Boardman, Ohio. It's not available So I guess we'll never know how good the movie was.
