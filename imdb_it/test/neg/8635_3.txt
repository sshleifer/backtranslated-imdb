The original version of The Vanishing aka The Man Who Want to Know by George Sluizer offers one of the most peaceful sociopaths of European cinema and one of the most memorable endings of all time (shamelessly stolen by Tarantino for Kill Bill Volume Two), but has a lot more to offer than that. Playing with the chronology and reversing the usual clich√©s of the "lady vanishes" standard plot, it also offers a superb characterization and strong performance, undervalued but convincing. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can only assume that when it came to remakes, Sluizer was so determined that nobody else would have had the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it alone, but few people they could have anticipated how much he was destroying his work. His career has never recovered from this disastrous misstep. <br /> <br /> The main culprit is a surprising performance by Jeff Bridges that has been thought of in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his first films noticed that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you prevented him from thinking about what he was doing, and this film is proof of pudding. Each movement is excessively mechanical in its precision, making it look like a rusty clockwork toy, while its voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas of Taxi and a Dalek who took diction lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, only a looney who walks with an invisible sign over his head that says "Please let me kill you, thank you for your consideration". But the blame must be shared here. None of the performances are good: often they don't even look good? Keifer Sutherland looks more like a small hamster than a man upset at the end of the hurry scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis, complains badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression as the object of her obsession, not that he was helped by the director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been changed to focus on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. More is the haste that the film is in, draining life and the character from each scene in its run to get to the next one. / low mood changes in the couple's relationship or the seemingly casual but careful determination of the sense of place, we have only a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending ?? stan dard woman pursued by nutter in the woods, stuff at risk full of blades 'do we end up on a joke like a moment of a television policeman' ?? better not go there ?? which is an advice that applies to the entire sinking of a film. Even a soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith, incredibly bland and uninspired, can't do anything about it.
