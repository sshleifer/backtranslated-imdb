I saw the movie after checking its rating on IMDb. Then, it was 8.0 and I thought, "wow! That must be good." I thought wrong. The beginning of the film actually keeps what the plot promises, but then drops exponentially under its basement. I think that without the character of Richie Nix, it could have been fine - although that's the reason the plot takes the course it does. The character is too extreme for my taste and difficult to bear. Furthermore, the journey that the main character takes from the beginning of the story to his "climax" in the end is partly irrelevant and could easily have been omitted - the alternative is that I didn't understand the film. <br /> <br /> Although I have to admit that it is "easy watching", and I had no trouble watching the whole movie, when it ended I was not at all impressed by the ending. All in all, rather mediocre.
