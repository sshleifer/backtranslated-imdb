To paraphrase the comments of the previous reviewer, if you are a fan of Stooges, avoid this at all costs! My basic question is that, since Moe and Larry were experienced comedy soldiers, because they insisted on trying to continue the act when it was so obvious that their home study, Columbia, was so clearly not interested in giving them serious writers and directors of veteran comedies? This movie sounds like someone giving a pale imitation of the trio and you can see how hard it is to work with Moe and Larry to make every little piece of slapstick relevant. Joe De Rita, despite his vaudeville background, is not up to the job as a replacement for Curly, Shemp or Joe Besser. If what Moe and Larry had left to choose, they would just have to close the store and enjoy their retirement years. Leave us fans with better memories of much better films than they had done before. Always let them laugh is the motto of the play and always stop while at the top. So Seinfeld leaves the sitcom while he's up there, instead of limiting himself to the inevitable decline.
