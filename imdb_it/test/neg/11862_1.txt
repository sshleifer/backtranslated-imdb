First of all, I would like to stress that I am not a big fan of political correctness. In fact, I like satire or dark humor, even if it makes jokes with minorities. The reason, because I'm quite sure, that this racist work is not worth a look, is that it doesn't make fun of minorities to prove their living conditions, their social circumstances or the way they are treated by society . He also uses every stupid stereotype and prejudice to reinforce xenophobic feelings and reservations. It is really a pity, but not a surprise, that the other comments did not get that point, because we all had an economic laugh. Congratulations.
