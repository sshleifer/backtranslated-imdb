THE RIDDLE was written and directed by Brendan Foley in what appears to be an attempt to transform the mysteries of Charles Dickens's novels into a contemporary story, but this attempt is hampered by the election of using the two time format periods in which the 'enigma' is revealed. Despite a cast of famous actors, doing their best to bring this film direct to DVD, the final product is a long, boring and amateur mess that can only be considered as entertainment if viewers are fans of the cast as other films remember. <br /> <br /> Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) is a limited journalist to report on dog racing events while he dreams of important reporting tasks. A series of similar murders includes an old friend of Mike - Sadie (Vera Day) who runs a pub on the banks of the Thames, having just discovered a precious unpublished manuscript of Charles Dickens, and has a heart of gold, giving away from these pathetic creatures like an old beach bum (Derek Jacobi). Sadie's murder attracts Mike as a police journalist and with the help of policewoman Kate (Julie Cox) begins to link investigations with clues she finds in reading the Dickens manuscript. To interrupt the flow of this rather simplistic story is the use of flashbacks at the time of Dickens as Dickens (also Derek Jacobi) tells a rather personal story of particular murders. The parallel between the stories and the cross-casting between actors may have worked in the hands of another, but the improvement of this type of enterprise escapes the writer / director Brendan Foley. He draws his story to the end (finally) with a tired Hollywood end. <br /> <br /> In addition to Jones, Jacobi, Cox and Day, the film somehow caught the attention of Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng, PH Moriarty and Mel Smith: their contributions are minimal but happily distracting. This is a thin piece of molasses that leaves the viewer to wonder why films of this quality find funding. Grady Harp
