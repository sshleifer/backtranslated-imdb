It is said that this is the first Polish western and was written and directed by Piotr Uklanski. Known in the US as DEAD MAN'S BOUNTY, this film uses some strange visual elements to tell a story short of dialogue. Val Kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes. Some embarrassing visual situations are actually comic in a sick way. My favorite is that a young man who builds a pitchfork cuts off one of his fingers and actually stops to check the strength of the rope. A cowboy known only as "the stranger" (Karel Roden) finds a dead man (Kilmer) who he thinks is a wanted man. He takes it to the nearest town to collect the size. He ends up losing the corpse and the potential cuts in a game of chance with the drunken sheriff of the city (Boguslaw Linda) and makes sure that the few citizens turn on him when he has an alliance with the bartender (Katarzyna Figura) . He manages to escape certain death and leads the small team on a dangerous "wild goose hunt". One scene has the stranger tending to the scalp wound, cauterizing with gunpowder and a match. The corpse rots chained to a pole that acts as a hitchhiker while the sheriff discovers that there is no size. This film, also known as SUMMER LOVE, has a disturbing theme sung by John Davidson. However, this western is like watching a train wreck. There's just something that tells you not to look ... but you do.
