This is the worst Italian film ever, probably the worst movie of all time! Joe D'Amato is certainly not a cinematographic genius, but many of his films are interesting and watchable. Unfortunately this is not one of them. Its cheese is boring .... boring waaaaay. If you want a movie on MST3k, take Troll 2, if you want a movie to put someone in a coma, take the deep blood!
