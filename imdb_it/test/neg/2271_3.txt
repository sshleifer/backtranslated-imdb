Usually when the BBC releases a TV series you are used to a certain satisfaction guarantee. Usually the TV series is splendid, even if the story is boring, you can trust that acting will be worth it. When I ran into Persuasion, here at the local library, I couldn't wait to spend a pleasant evening, because I read the story. I'm happy to have read the story before, otherwise I wouldn't have thought well of it. I was also relieved to learn that the production date of this TV series was in 1971, since I thought the BBC had lost it until then. It's really bad, and should be used in acting schools like horror movies. <br /> <br /> The only positive thought I have about this series is that the people in this film are not likely to appear or be involved in The BBC or other product of this century apart from the young Musgrove sisters, who apparently they were taking their first steps in acting, and doing extraordinarily well under the otherwise indicated direction.
