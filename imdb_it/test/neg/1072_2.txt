Honestly, Mr. Thalluri ... if you make a drama in a high school by following a group of teenagers during a school day and if you mess up the times and jump back and forth ... if you do it for that, you can't use the same identical visual story device as "Elephant" which uses a camera that is passing from one character to another and with scenes shown 3 times from different angles. You cannot do this because it is such an exaggerated difficulty to believe that someone has given this more than 5 votes. <br /> <br /> Where "Elephant" (which was released 3 years before this film) uses school shootings (or to be precise, Columbine shoots) because the focus of the screenplay 2:37 uses the suicide of adolescents and, seeing the reviews, worked the shock value of that topic. It's the same slow story it tells, a lot of dramatic piano music that leads to a finale you know from the beginning. At least the characters seem to have tried to do something different in that department. So you have an atypical gay guy who looks like a kind of stoner / skater, a hoverky hunky who can't handle his gay side, the brother and sister of a rich family who both have their problems and get their nose dive. <br /> <br /> You also have a spoiled bulimic chick and one of the most ridiculous characters of all time ... a guy with medical conditions who wets his pants because of the "urethra syndrome 2" that he actually doesn't have never heard of the invention of diapers but rather pants in the classroom and then change into new clothes and does it EVERY DAY! WOW, as much as this film tries to be realistic, this is the most absurd thing I've ever heard. He is beaten on the toilet and obviously is ashamed to do so, but he does not clean his nose when he walks through the whole school with wet pants and a bloody nose. This new age realism leads directly to "the twist" and the final character who turns out to be the victim of suicide ... <br /> <br /> After seeing the "very realistic" life of adolescents (one day included, incense-harp, adolescent pregnancy, bulimia, parental pressure for grades and appearance and the gay subject mentioned above, a bit like the "very realistic" daily soap ... trying to be difficult) let's look at a girl die that we met once at the beginning of this movie and that has no reason other than the guy with whom he had a crush left the room when she was talking to him (in a pensive piano that played in BTW sequence, seen from some Part one ??). And it gets even better ... before cutting off his wrist in a painful long scene of "Yes" and "No" he asks 2-urethra-boy if he is well, constantly smiling and then he cuts his wrist with scissors in a school toilet. <br /> <br /> Now you have a movie that is a total Elephant rip-off, fails with some really sloppy stories (even the whole rape-rape thing was incredible) and people call it a shocker. <br /> <br /> What the hell is going on ?? Is that all it takes to get pseudo-dramatic music, a boring story, and add a shocking subject over and people think there's a profoundly important message here? I think that Elephant is already overrated, but that film was the original while this one is a failure evident in many other levels. I've never seen a brazen steal of a whole movie in my life ... and believe me I've seen a hundred horror movies, so I know how low you can go there. This is a total disappointment in all the departments ... it is neither realistic, it is stolen, it is damn slow and in any case I wonder what is more useless ... another romantic suicide (many give this point to the film that I let's ask if they only watch Romeo + Juliet all day because there are dozens of movies that deal with the subject in a clear non-romantic and more REALISTIC way) or this ridiculous set up ... Come on! I'm still trying to figure out if the 2-urethra or suicide itself is more unrealistic and ridiculous.
