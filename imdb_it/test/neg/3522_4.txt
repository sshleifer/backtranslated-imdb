This movie is so mild! I tried not to expect anything more from this movie, but it was still a big disappointment. The basic idea of ​​the story is interesting and potential. This could have been much better. The characters are really simple, without depth. Too bad the already talented actors Tiina Lymi and Petteri Summanen have not improved the already poor characters. The director fails to emotionally engage the viewer with this piece of cr "p. <br /> <br /> and the chase sequence at the end of the film. It's horrible !!! <br /> <br /> Why did there have to be such a stupid and old solution for that situation? <br /> <br /> It is too used an element with an even more terrible way of filming it.
