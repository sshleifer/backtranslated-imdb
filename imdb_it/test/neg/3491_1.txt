Crash should be a film about racism in Los Angeles. But in reality, they are just some of the coincidences between different characters who connect during one day in one of the largest cities in the world. Who the hell will believe it? There are unrealistic situations, one after the other. On the other hand, this film pretends to show racism among Asians, Iranians, Latins, blacks and whites. But the big mistake is based on a pre-established racism from the writer. Especially since the white characters in this film are usually portrayed as people with a better socio-economic status than the rest of the other races. Iranians are poor, just like the Asians. And the Latinos, as always, are portrayed as rulers, policemen or with a very low profile job as a blacksmith. Jesus!!! Guys, don't you think it's time to change these stereotypes? The same with blacks, portrayed as a gang member, with the exception of a Black TV Director, who was the only cool character for me. This movie sucks so much, that it makes me so disappointed by the kind of cinema that comes out of Hollywood these days. Always with stereotyped characters. No realism whatsoever. Nothing to identify. It is simply a great waste because this could have been a great opportunity to show Latinos, Koreans, Iranians and blacks from a different perspective.
