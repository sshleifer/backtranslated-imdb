This is not a new movie. It is a revisitation of the "Emmanuelle, Queen of the Galaxy" of 1994, and has been significantly truncated. Attention: many characters appear in the credits that have been cut from the movie! <br /> <br /> If you want to see this in its original form, take "Queen" - avoid this at all costs, as the cuts make it even more choppier than it originally was.
