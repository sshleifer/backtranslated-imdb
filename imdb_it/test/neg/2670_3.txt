Avoid this! It's a terrible movie. So what if it's very exciting? Everything is just useless murders. And all with the curse of Thorn and Michael, that was the worst thing they could ever do to the series! Why couldn't Michael's story be a mystery? He should be the black man, not part of a stupid cult !! Ugh! Thank God for Halloween H20, which canceled Halloween 3-6! They all sucked! But anyway, if you see this movie, please don't expect anything but murders and insults.
