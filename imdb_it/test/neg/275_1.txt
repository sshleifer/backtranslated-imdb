What a ridiculous waste of time and money !!!! This film was the biggest loser of the year. All the clamor was a warning. I'm disappointed with Julia Roberts, she is by far the most talented cast member. I think his acting ability really brought the film. The buddy boys club was a little too fake, and to add insult to injury, why bother throwing Catherine Zeta Jones? It has only the ability to ruin a movie. She lacks the ability to have chemistry on screen with anyone, not to mention that she lacks the ability to act. Lacks chemistry with the other characters: a kind of reminiscence of "America's Sweetheart's". He created the "The Terminal" terminal. This film is directed nowhere, what a shame, please don't tell me "13" is coming!
