I am sorry but I cannot even partially agree with some comments on this horrible piece of sh ... <br /> <br /> English is not my mother tongue, because I am a German citizen, so please do not give the guilt for inappropriate grammatical structures or something like this * gg Can't understand why this film got such a high score? 6.3 ??? Are you kidding me? This film makes absolutely no sense, not even an aspect of good acting ... <br /> <br /> When I saw the comments on The Da Vinci Code, which has - I believe - almost the same assessment, I had to slam the head on the table, because I saw 00 Schneider directly after Sakrileg, and oh my god, there are worlds between them. <br /> <br /> Most of the posters in this bulletin board tear apart every movie. while he judges this crime of making movies with a 6.3 and calls Helge as a genius. Of course, he knows how to make money, but I think the main aspect of your opinions is the fact that German is not your mother tongue and you simply ignore - or rather you don't notice the shit pile that is said in the sentences. OK, I have to confess that some scenes are funny, but all in all, a 6.3 is just too much for my compatriot;)
