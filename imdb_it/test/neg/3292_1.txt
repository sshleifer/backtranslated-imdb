How can things like that still be done? Sein Seinfeld, arrested development, office, etc. Didn't they kill this unconventional old-fashioned crap? Apparently not ... <br /> <br /> I'm really a fan of Michael Rappaport and I enjoyed his various cameos and secondary roles (Copland, Friends) but this sucks, but no one could fight with this script. <br /> <br /> My wife has fun. But she is Brazilian. And if you've ever seen a typical Brazilian sitcom, you'd understand why he would consider it so funny. <br /> <br /> Just to show how predictable the show is and to prove a point with it I guessed what the next 3 or 4 story lines / developments would be observed for a while and turned out to be almost correct word by word! I felt very satisfied. This annoyed my wife how he hates it when I do it (I can understand why, but I felt good enough to get the balls rolling!)
