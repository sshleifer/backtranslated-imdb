This show has shown its true colors now that the Democrats are in power. He never led the world in IQ like anyone who thought it was a planned intelligence to think in a way (which is a scary thing). <br /> <br /> Comedy Central has moved this and is tracing back to a previous time when the Democrats took power for a reason - because now when the Democrats poop - that's the same thing Republicans do - Stewart no longer shoots at them. This is why the assessments both for this and for the spin are falling. <br /> <br /> Basically, most of the humor now is either jokes, or Sarah Palin's jokes - that all the plays that bring down the comedians are now saying. The facts in support of this speak for themselves. Jay Leno's show that did the same kind of humor is about to be canceled. The ratings for Letterman & Conan and the shows that follow them are in decline. <br /> <br /> So the emperor Stewart is not alone. The trouble is that if any of them start making real jerks from the powerful democrats in power, they could increase their votes quickly because the best humor is always at the expense of them in power. The Bush years showed that, since the ratings for this show and Colbert, & Letterman and Leno were higher there. <br /> <br /> O'Bama has done one thing, has shown that these shows must be willing to take risks and take people out of power if they want to thrive. Right now, the Daily Show and Stewart are run-down but maybe they can be lucky and get Palin elected as the first female president in 2012. Then Palin's jokes will become bitter.
