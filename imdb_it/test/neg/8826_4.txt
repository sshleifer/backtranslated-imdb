It's about jealousy, it's about racism, it's about manipulation, but the basic message is love. Geoffrey Sax sought to obtain Shakespeare's Othello, bringing it into the modern context. However, the actors were not convincing enough to make it. There were other bodies to help put everything into perspective, however, John Othello, played by Eamonn Walker, reacted a lot in this film, causing the fall of Keeley Hawes, Dessie Brabant, who eventually ended up with Dessie's death. <br /> <br /> Ben Jago, played by Christopher Eccleston, was seen as the protagonist of the film. He didn't give enough evidence for Dessie to have betrayed Othello, with Michael Cass, played by Richard Coyle. Instead he only played a friend at all and gave a reason why he was "cheating". In the game, it was much more convincing on Iago's part to make Othello suspicious of everything. This change made the film more about anger for the wrong reasons, rather than about what the book was based on. However, the film has had some positive points. He turned the army scenes into a more racist black group, where Othello is the chief of the police team. These scenes are made credible by the furious crowds and by the burning fires. You are able to perceive the amount of racism in the film, more than you can in the book. This book reproduces the scenes of the present day making it much easier to understand, compared to the Shakespearian times in which it was written. In the play Iago (Jago) is tortured in the end, but in the film he gets his satisfaction, and he gets Otello position. He never gets what he deserves and never gets caught for lying to Othello until it's too late. I saw this as a ruin in the film, because I feel that the evil is given its promotion treasure without lying, and in the book, it is discovered by Rodrigo. Overall, the film could have done a better job based on the game than on what it did. I feel that the director of the film has left out some of the most important parts of the game that were mentioned or there to make the game flow, or make it more of a tragedy. I would say that first you should read the book, to understand all the events that happened in the film, otherwise you could find yourself lost and confused.
