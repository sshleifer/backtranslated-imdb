I was surprised that the producers of this film came out saying that this film was a true story. Most of the scenes looked fake to me. For example, when a girl was eating her sandwich and there was a cockroach. While he was eating the sandwich, the camera on the other side showed that there was a cockroach on it. It's strange how the camera was just turned on the sandwich when the girl ate it. Another scene is when the band went to open a wardrobe of clothes and a cat flew out of the closet or I should say that it was thrown out to give it effect. This film was not at all realistic. It is very doubtful that the events that occurred were true that evening when the "St. Francisville" experiment took place. I think the house could be haunted, but not the night this movie was shot! The ending was fun when Tim and the other girl were chained in some sort of basement. Paul and Madison found them and saved them! I'd rather look at the Blair Witch Project again, so I have to sit in the experimental St. Francisville movie again. As I said, if the film's creators didn't say that this was a true story with real events, maybe I would have liked it better. It is better to have more entertainment from the Blair Witch Project (although this is not a true story) !!!
