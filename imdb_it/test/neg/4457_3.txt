Try, if proof were ever needed, that Hammer should have left the vampires firmly in the Victorian age. After all, vampirism is about repressed sexuality, so the concept is irrelevant in 1972 London, with its 30-year-olds pretending to be young boys. <br /> <br /> Remember that, by now, Hammer was struggling badly. The public had grown tired of the living-room horror of the 50s and 60s, so the studio was trying everything to bring them back, including a large nudity (LUST FOR A VAMPIRE, et al) and updating their characters - none of which apparently worked as Hammer was practically resting in the grave only two years later. Shame ... <br /> <br /> But I still have a great passion for the classic Hammer period from 1957 to 1965.
