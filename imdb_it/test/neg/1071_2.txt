I don't understand what is hitting hard for this movie! I don't understand why high school kids should watch this! I don't understand why this should make me think of anything in the slightest! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> When the undetected girl is about to commit suicide, was I the only person who encouraged her? The cliché, the classical music, the long tracking shots, the melancholy emotion of the film of that stage made me change my mind about what I meant. I would have been happy only if she had entered the room and the whole cast was there with the scissors in her hand to cut her wrists. <br /> <br /> Why? <br /> <br /> Because I went to high school ... and honestly I am sick to death to see films after films in Australia with teenagers who rely solely on terrible clichés. I waited years for a younger person to write a film that does not relate to this stereotype and this piece of emo junk was what I got instead. It was like a dark version of the heartbreak that needed a predictable ending. <br /> <br /> Why are all teenagers in Australian dramas depressed or have really bizarre problems that are not plausibly told? <br /> <br /> On the plus side, this was more fun than "Blurred". And I needed a good laugh.
