I felt like I was looking at an example of how not to make a movie. I think the director shot it in his backyard! There was no real plot. <br /> <br /> Script terrible. <br /> <br /> Terrible acting. <br /> <br /> The worst production I've ever witnessed. A couple of bad CG effects and then the rest of the movies was spent running around in what looked like a garbage cemetery. <br /> <br /> I don't normally write reviews on films, but I have been moved to warn everyone of this one. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to waste your time with this movie!
