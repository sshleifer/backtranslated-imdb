About your terrible film that copies Beethoven. As a professional musician it is my duty to watch every film produced by any composer and Beethoven is one of my favorites. When Hungarians and Americans meet, it's a terrible combination of empty emotions and subdued combined with the worst possible taste. You showed it in your terrible b-movie. The only thing that brings the film is music. Obviously you didn't bother to look beyond the good, but in my tasteful performances of the Tackacs quartet, but OK I have to admit that the performances have at least a quality in contrast with the film you made. It starts with the dying DEAF Beethoven who perfectly understands Anna who is simply whispering. Listening to Beethoven during the film is better by the minute, but this must be due to some vague divine thing. Then there is the almost impossible semi-pornographic "eyes wide shut", a double-conductor scene that is totally over the top with the sensual Anna and the crying grandson at the end (who cries even in the deleted scenes with constant red eyes, mine God what a show). And the culmination of Amadeus' rip-off, with Beethoven dictating music to Anna not in notes but in total absurdity, which she understands perfectly, but no one else in your audience, not even trained professional musicians will understand. Of course your reaction will be that the negative answer is at least an answer, but I can assure you that Beethoven himself is turning in his grave because of your worthless and rightly created creation. This so-called homage is a blasphemy and I am so sorry to have rented one of the worst films ever made, even if it concerns my favorite subject. Ed Harris and others, you can't understand Beethoven's greatness in your wildest dreams and certainly not after a couple of acting and violin lessons. This is the problem with you Americans: think you can grasp everything even when it takes a lifetime of hard work. Yes, we can do it anyway! Remember that a good product comes with hard work, talent, devotion and professionalism. All these creators of Copy Beethoven are missing. See you in kindergarten.
