When the American film industry tries to look critically at its own government, it makes it damn sure that it looks good even when it's ugly. <br /> <br /> The film makes 1 what is right, perfectly demonstrates what is wrong with American politics. The motto seems to be that of f ** k with those who want us to do things !!! Mix an American Congressman, a CIA agent, a Jew and an Arab ... just for the Ruskies. Thanks to the United States for giving us Osama Bin Laden. <br /> <br /> The film's disappointment comes before problems: using images of Afghan children without weapons and stories of Soviet atrocities and then making a clear attempt to suggest a link between them and the reasoning behind American aid . Every reasonable person knows why the $ 1,000,000,000 were collected ... not the dying Afghan children for sure. <br /> <br /> As usual the serious problems are covered in a dialogue bullshit facade. "Here for you, you M *** r F ***** s" Hoffmam sings at the end, all that is missing is the American flag in the background and the stupid military solutes. Films can't help but leave the aftertaste of the feeling of American pride and joy for how we (the Americans) saved the world ... once again. Not even the last 5 minutes of the movie can save it, where you try to stop praising yourself and wake up to the fact that it's just another American F ** k up. <br /> <br /> Acting and editing was still good.
