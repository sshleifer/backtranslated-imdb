I was once a big Olsen fan. I received this film when I was six and I saw it almost without rest until I was nine. Then he lay on my shelf collecting dust until yesterday. I was speechless. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley play Allie and Mel, two twelve-year-olds who are sent to spend their spring break in Paris with their grandfather ambassador. Along the way, as you might expect, they meet two nice French boys who show them the funniest side of Paris. I imagine the two boys were okay, fake French accents aside. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable and the humor is superficial and banal. Mary-Kate and Ashley play two superficial girls with too many make-up on their faces. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie if you are not in the Olsen twins or in family movies.
