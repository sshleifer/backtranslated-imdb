One of the films I did NOT want to see. I previewed it, but damn it, the acting was bad! At the end of the film (I'm still surprised to have seen the whole movie ..) I wondered why I saw the film. <br /> <br /> Even here in the Netherlands, the writer of this film (filmed from a Giphart book) thought it was bad, and was disappointed that his film came out this way. Next time he wants a role in choosing the people for the cast.
