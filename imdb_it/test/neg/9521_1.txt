I was very interested in seeing this film despite the article I read about the director of Tattler Magazine. I don't judge films by what the director may or may not have done. This debut feature was very difficult to watch. I found the screens divided as a distraction for the drama in the film, some of the supporting characters gave bad performances and the film is a copy of many other films I've seen. There was really nothing cool about that
