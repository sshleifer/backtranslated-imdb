Wow. After watching this movie, you will know why American youth continue to lack intelligence and any traits that contribute to the well-being of society, except to make themselves more incapable of functioning. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two plays some of the most respectable people imaginable, who at their core lack any kind of talent or brains to do something about themselves (especially Bam Margera and Steve-O), and the the only option for fame was to make a living by entertaining those as stupid as they were by hurting themselves. A boy drinking horse sperm? Simply disgusting. A man who puts a fish hook across his cheek and acts like a "bait" for sharks? This is not humor, it is a test to institutionalize it. <br /> <br /> On the whole, I left the theater without hope for humanity.
