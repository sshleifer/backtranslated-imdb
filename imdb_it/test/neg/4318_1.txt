OK, I went to this website before watching this movie, reading the comments, being pumped, because they were all good enough for a B-flick: I watched it and was completely disappointed. The rebellious solitary wannabe main characters who came out of the Mid-West attitude were sick in the stomach, and they didn't even let me start the two cops, I mean there's a damn door in plain sight, take a look! The plot was completely predictable, the editing was rather limited, I swear that the publisher was actually dozing off towards the end when he was cutting this film, and the direction was overshadowed by bad cinematography. Now please don't get me wrong, I love the B-flicks, some are really good. <br /> <br /> Want to see a good series B movie ??? <br /> <br /> Dave recommends <br /> <br /> "High Voltage" <br /> <br /> http://imdb.com/title/tt0338095/
