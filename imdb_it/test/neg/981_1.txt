I was an extra in this film, in the part filmed at the airport in the first 15 minutes or so; I was one of the fleeing Bangladeshi refugees (mostly Mexicans) who crossed the slopes of Ryan Field in Tucson. At one point, standing in our turbans while we were waiting for another shot, one of my fellow extras addressed to me asked me what the move would be. I told him it would be a remake of Lost Horizons, just like a musical. There was a long pause, then he replied: "Friend, this movie will suck." Rather insightful than he, I thought. I had fun and made some money, but even with some interesting personal memories related to this film I can't stand the whole thing. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen the movie "The Swarm", you can pretty much get the idea. You get to see a lot of famous and talented people wasted on an idea that at first sight is simply BAD. The idea seemed to be that if you throw enough money into a movie and get enough important names, then a good story and good writing are not necessary. Just turn the big crank and the product comes out. Not worth watching.
