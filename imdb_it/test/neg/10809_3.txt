OK, I read the director's commentary on this film (described as the 'frontmost comment'), and I must admit that I can identify with its position. <br /> <br /> Michael, I hope your career has recovered from this particular setback and you've moved on to other better things. I saw this movie in the MST3K form. Even with all the trite continuity and clumsy observations that have been tossed around by robots, I saw a potentially dignified film with an ambitious set of ideas that sought to escape the limited budget and limited actors available. And this is one of those movies ("Mitchell" is another) in which the MST3K crew did a lot of low-cost shootings in the main character even when it actually deserved better. You know they had an unfair fun at the actress's expense because he made a more lively episode. <br /> <br /> IMO, the fact that the film actually tried to be of something and had some decent and effective moments here and there, should keep it out of the "Bottom 100" ("Tangents / Time Chasers" is another film with a plot and a heart that doesn't even deserve to be there). <br /> <br /> But it's not a very nice film yet. I don't blame the lead writer / actress for being what she is. It's just that his acting and writing skills needed a few more years to mature before he could do a vanity project like this or bring a movie. Writing and characterization are amateur and brazen, and the dialogue is often barely up to the ABC Afterschool Special standards. The cast gives its best and the acting in general is head and shoulders compared to abortions like "Future War" or "Space Mutiny", but there are no really professional level performances here, except for 'Big Joe' Estevez , which is a hammam but appropriately intense. I've never seen the complete original cut, but the MST sampling of "Soultaker" was representative enough to make these facts clear. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie contains Robert Z'Dar. I mean, IMO, a real "kiss of death" for any film that hopes to be taken seriously. Yes, he is big and scary in his role, but I hate the boy as an actor. (In real life, I wish him well and I hope he is financially at ease). <br /> <br /> There were little things I liked about the movie. For example, the camaraderie between the male protagonist and his dead friend added warmth and humor to the film making it much more watchable. The idea of ​​an elevator in the hospital that opened its doors to the afterlife was an inspired way to invoke some ghostly vibrations without creating special effects, and I respected anyone who worked on the script in an attempt to keep the budget manageable. It didn't really work, but it could only have a little adjustment. <br /> <br /> So, Mr. Rissi, better luck with your other projects - your involvement with this misfire wouldn't keep me from looking at something else you did if the 'buzz' was good. And Mrs. Miller has nothing to be ashamed of - she was young and ambitious, and the film wasn't so bad.
