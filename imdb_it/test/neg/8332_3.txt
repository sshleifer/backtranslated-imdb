The director is sweet, like his co-director Shira Geffen, but their film sucks. He has his moments (and some beautiful girls), but there's too much of everything: "Am√©lie" meets "Breaking the waves" meets "Pauline on the beach". If you go away you want to learn more about the wedding photographer and the girl who likes best when nothing happens, be it in the movies or in real life. Instead, you get a suicide writer, a neurotic actress and an illegal immigrant immigrant with a heart of gold. There seems to be more than one truly moving story hidden in the script, but for face value it is a truck loaded with wasted plots and sentimental bullshit. Difficult to sit as it is.
