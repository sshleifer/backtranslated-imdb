He starts with Fulci who plays a version of himself, writing some ideas about how people might die. Followed by a fake-looking cat that eats what is supposedly a brain. The copy I saw was dubbed into English, which I always hate, but I was particularly sorry for not having heard Fulci with his own voice. <br /> <br /> Fulci is in a kind of feverish state working on his latest horror film. His stomach turns when he sees things that resemble the effects of his film, and he begins to hallucinate that he is witnessing acts of horror. Visit a psychiatrist, who hypnotizes him and unfortunately does not have his improved mental health in mind. The psychiatrist played by David Cronenberg in Clive Barker's Nightbreed (1990) came to mind. The shrink in this is played by David L. Thompson, who is rather mean. Probably a real life friend of Fulci's, he has a big toothy smile when he kills people, even though this could be Fulci's black humor at work, which I thought was also poor. <br /> <br /> The film is made up of many clips from Fulci's films, both as if Fulci were on the set that directed them, watching TV recordings or witnessing the proceedings. I've never been a fan of TV series clip series, and I also think that things like Charles Band's Full Moon Entertainment that cut their old movies and put together three of these cuts as new anthologies are rather lame. I guess they need to make money? <br /> <br /> The Cat in the Brain shrink refers to the theory that violence in films generates violence in real life. One of Fulci's collaborators talks about having a documentary team that follows Fulci to see what his life is like. A lot of self-referential things like this. <br /> <br /> In the end, some characters set sail on a ship called "Perversion".
