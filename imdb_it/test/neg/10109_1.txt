Well, I'll start with this: I love horror movies, not even the worst storyline or the most terribly terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of blood and suspense present. Second; this is the worst movie of all time. It also beats the Mean Guns and the attack of the killer tomatoes. And for this I pay tribute. <br /> <br /> However, unintentional humor was fun only until the middle of the film, after which everything was so sad. To my surprise, the reviews somehow split; and you guys who voted this piece of C-movie-crap from 7 up; I know you're kidding! GOOD ONE !! HAHAHA! Because if there is any reason in the world, and we have only a little bit of the same notion of what quality is; you can't be real. <br /> <br /> Anything worth mentioning about the content has already been summarized rather well, so I'll leave it. <br /> <br /> MINOR SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> But the scene where the masked rubber mask guy drags the woman back and forth through the kennel for ten minutes, with such terrible musical score the bipolar dialogue between the two, really does it for me.
