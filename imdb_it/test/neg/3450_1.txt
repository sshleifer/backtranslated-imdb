This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Cinematography was boring, with long boring shots (like a camera on a tripod that shot a theatrical show) interspersed with "dramatic" angles that made little sense to the content on the screen. The assembly was terrible, scenes combined with the delicacy of a butcher. The plot revolved around the observation of the historic night in which Mary Shelley had written frankenstien. The acting was forced, with the type of character development that left you with an intense interest in seeing each of them die horribly (the sooner the better).
