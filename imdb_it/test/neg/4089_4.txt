Well, I saw this movie that expected to be run over by the corridors ... what a mistake I had. The film was moderately fun, at best, and irritating at worst (the slapstick comic style of building an ark with archaic instruments, laughing ... no I didn't). I'm very disappointed since Steve Carrel was the protagonist. I watched the US office religiously, it made me collapse immensely, I thought the 40-year-old virgin was good ... but Evan held us ... because he never accepted this script. And, like Morgan Freeman, he's old enough to know him better. <br /> <br /> So the idea seemed reasonable, the actors I had faith in, but the execution was nothing to write about and the ending, well, it seemed like they had run out of money or ideas. For me this was one of the most ingenious endings I could have imagined. They took a biblical story and reduced it to a warning about localized environmental issues, even on global issues, but a local law - yawn! <br /> <br /> In summary, a reasonable start, gradually getting worse and, for me, it was all faded when the credit was launched.
