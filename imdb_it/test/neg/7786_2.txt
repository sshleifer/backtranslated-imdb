When a BBC thriller is full of heterosexual dysfunctions, you know who the killer should be: The Homosexual. <br /> <br /> Who killed the sexy blonde (who is also a pathological liar) while coming home from school? Let's see, could it be the mother who (against common sense) is letting her teenage son make unsupervised visits to the serial-killer father behind bars? Could it be the moody son, who is impressed by his father's absurd attitude to women? Could he be the serial killer himself, who seems able to manipulate events from behind bars, a Hannibal Lecter? Could it be mum's boyfriend, a school teacher whose relationship with a former student led to his wife's suicide? Or could it be the boyfriend's daughter, who is going to blab everyone's secrets at school, causing untold suffering? No, it is none of these likely suspects. He's ... the homosexual! <br /> <br /> The only mystery to the viewer is to guess who the homosexual is. Of course, it could be anyone, since the only features of The Homosexual are the shameful secrecy and the propensity to murder and otherwise make life complicated for "normal" people. The homosexual is the invisible root cause of society's ills; only when this person is exposed and eliminated can the fractured family come back together and things can return to normal ... whatever it is. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, both Jemma Redgrave and Robson Green are now officially exceeded their sales dates. The world could come wonderfully without ever seeing the screen again, but as long as the BBC will have roles for The Wounded Woman and the Misunderstood Man, I suppose they will continue to return to films like this.
