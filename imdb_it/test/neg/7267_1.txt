Honest with God, the Structure says almost everything. The planet Andromina (not to be confused with Aunt Jemima) is represented by an economic strip club L.A. There are no strippers, so the most recent male visitors go to recruit strippers. <br /> <br /> Men are mistaken for kings or arrested for spying on women (although despite being a planet of women we take only two women who participate in female scenes), and in the end, as always happens in films science fiction everywhere, women are convinced that men are good for something. Well, not the men who made this film, anyway! <br /> <br /> But boy, can we see much of that something, in prodigious amounts of softcore sex and nudity. This has less plot than usual for these films, so switch channels if you don't like this kind of movie and grit your teeth if you like this kind of thing.
