(Spoiler forward!) This exact same storyline from this movie has already been done before. It was done on Ferris Bueller's Day Off! Marques "Bat Man" Houston feels bad. His naive parents believe in him. His sister knows he is pretending, but he has yet to go to school! She is crazy. He has a party with his friends while his parents are away. When his parents return home, he is sick again and his parents never knew about the party. I like the Immature better when they were in House Party 3 and still immature!
