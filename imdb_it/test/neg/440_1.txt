This DVD lacks its vocation as a Heineken coaster .... This is a great example of why no one should ever see a sequel with a director / screenwriter other than the original. Two hours of this turkey let me pray for the exorcists' replies. <br /> <br /> NO legitimate laughter. NOT a decent scare. The script was just a disaster and I felt bad for the actors who had to show it (they must have had sick relatives at home or habits of coca cola or something like that). <br /> <br /> The original was a reference point for the effects of makeup. So, of course, the producers of the sequel thought it would be a good idea to do the FX make-up and make CG werewolf instead. These werewolves made me laugh a lot more than any other "comedy". It was a total lack. If you want night entertainment, rent the original again. Or go for a film course and create your own horror movie. You are destined to do better than these fools did.
