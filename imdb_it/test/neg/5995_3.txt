This should be shaken. VH1 moved away from traditional divas (Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, etc.) that had made the 2003 show so stale. Unfortunately the move failed. The show had no MC that held the show together. Queen Latifah did a fantastic show at the 2003 Divas. The show kicked off with a horrific performance by Lady Marmalade with Patti Labelle, Cyndi Lauper and Jessica Simpson. Ok, in the studio with a little control they can all play great. <br /> <br /> However, when I am competing with each other (why?) it seems simply twisty! Jessica Simpson has the most bizarre facial expressions when she sings that I've ever seen! Cyndi Lauper also played Girl Just Wanna Have Fun. It wasn't so bad, but it wasn't impressive at all. The worst was yet to come! Cyndi and Patti Labelle have teamed up to perform "Time After Time" by Cyndi. It was acoustic and did not fit the rest of the show. However, it could be fine if both of them hadn't insisted on screaming like mamed animals. It was just terrible. <br /> <br /> Debbie Harry (from Blondie) is always cool. He has a style all his own and even though he may not be able to compete vocally with many of the stars, although he certainly knows how to sing very well. Debbie came out and performed Blondie's kidnapping at number 1 of "Rapture". With some beautiful voices. He really hit the notes perfectly. It looked stunning. Rapper Eve provided a new but sadly inferior rap. It was nice. Debbie's upcoming performance was an alliance with newcomer Joss Stone. They performed the success of Blondie "One Way Or Another". I think Joss misunderstood the style of the song and just yelled at Debbie. A little sad was when Debbie tried and failed to match her grotesque style that ruined him a bit. He should have let Joss get along with his totally inappropriate warballing. The whole Blondie performed this track. The final song that Debbie performed was Blondie's big hit "Call Me". He was rather poor. It's not Debbie's fault, because you can't hear it. The sound was atrocious throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Joss Stone also performed some songs on his own. They were pretty well done. Ashanti also presented himself to perform two inexplicable cover covers. First he played Diana Ross "I'm Coming Out", and then "Is not Nobody" by Chaka Khan. You are not a diva! He can sing to a certain point but he has no presence. Why not just enter the real singers. Chaka was even interviewed on the show ... Gladys Knight showed up and did a medley. It was very good. It was probably the best part of the show. I don't know much about her except that she's an experienced Las Vegas performer and her experience and class are really brilliant. Patti Labelle performed another performance this time with "New Attitude" from the 1980s. It was the ending and it was fine, but it was too little to get late. This was a big problem. Better luck next time VH1. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a heavily modified 55min version that was shown on VH1 in the UK. If these were the best pieces .....
