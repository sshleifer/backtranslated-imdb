Angel-A is a change of pace for Besson; monochromatic, mushy and rather mediocre. It is well photographed on location in Paris, although subtitle readers should note: rapid focus dialogue and good cinematography can make viewing frustrating. <br /> <br /> This film is not "Wings of Desire" or "Wonderful Life" ". Despite his shared themes (the celestial intervention is equivalent to suicide, the angel / mortal relations derive from it), Besson does not nothing to enlighten us or inspire us. Even the most recited, tearful moments quickly descend into a curvaceous sentimentality. <br /> <br /> The imperfect ideology of the film irritates, an angel whose message of love and self-respect is constantly undermined by his violent and promiscuous behavior, a "happy ending" that denies the supposed journey of the hero from impotence to self-esteem and independence Verdict: Quite pleasant to look at but confused moral and philosophical messages obscure the film just where should shine 4/10
