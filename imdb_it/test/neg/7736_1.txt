Hero's message is quite clear: the idea of ​​Greater China is more important than the death and suffering of millions. At a time when China hangs its war toys on Taiwan, it is unacceptable for Western viewers to support this overcrowded, government-sponsored piece of dogmatic garbage. <br /> <br /> The promotion of this film by the liberal media is particularly surprising. Roger Ebert of Chicago Tribune, David Edelstein of Slate, Charles Taylor of Salon and many others have wholeheartedly supported Hero. In this way, they implicitly legitimized his reactionary political message. The only critic (as far as I know) who saw through the film's shiny facade was J. Hoberman of The Village Voice, who wrote about the "sacrilege traditionalism" of the film and its "glorification of ruthless leadership and car - sacrifice on the altar of greatness. " I, for example, sign my name under the final declaration of Hoberman: Hero is nothing but "fascinating fascism".
