It's a shame how these things were done, but then we couldn't see the best "dummy scene" ever shot. Ahhh the beauty of low budget Bigfoot movies, you see the beauty you look at them, this is if your brain doesn't melt first. As I said before, this is the best fictional scene ever! Words cannot express it, you must see it for yourself. Wonderful lines like "Smells like decanted meat", "Thems human ..." (You'll know when you see it) The creature makes a Blah, Blah! the sound and the scene in which the child is hit will make you cry (with a laugh) you will rewind it. He has a car chase, a snowmobile chase, a Bigfoot folk song and a disco song. It does not end here, as it looks at the credits that a friend has noticed "Wardrobe supplied by K-Mart". Ask, how could you get to the credits and then watch them? I could only explain it as a kind of shock to the brain, you are so mentally exhausted that you can't move and I also believe you need to know who was behind the chaos. That being said, it's a must see especially if you want to mentally punish yourself. He is a keeper!
