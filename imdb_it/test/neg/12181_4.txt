First of all, I'm a big Bronson fan, I've been since the late 1970s. I watched all the movies he made on the big screen from "Love and Bullets", which ironically was the beginning of his end as a big name, Hollywood blockbuster star. <br /> <br /> I continued to hope that things would turn around for him, that he would make a really good movie in the 80s, but it never happened. And I don't know what he was thinking when he signed with Cheapjack Cannon's studio and hacker director J. Lee Thompson for most of his latest films. <br /> <br /> "Assasination" gave me some hope when I saw it Peter Hunt was directing instead of Thompson but those hopes were quickly broken. First of all, the film looks incredibly cheap, as if it had been made for about $ 3 million, apart from Bronson's inflated salary (I heard he insisted on 5 million per photo, probably more than the rest of the budget for all of his film Cannon). The scenes of the White House were shot on the grounds of the West LA VA - I was taking the bus while they were shooting. Nice job in recreating the white house, but nobody thought to get the palms from the shots? Guess. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the supporting cast is really bad. Ireland was dying of cancer and yet it is not bad, but the horrible Asian woman who plays Bronson's partner was typical of Cannon's talent at that time - non-existent. I would be really curious to know how he got this role. I can't imagine a worse actress for the part, plus she's 40 years younger than Bronson! The story is not so bad and it's something that the bigger and higher budgeted studios did later (Eastwood "In the Line of Fire" and Costner "Bodyguard") but the way it is set here is really sad . I wonder if they couldn't afford to do more than one or two shots per shot. None of this is credible in the slightest. If the Secret Service men really behaved like the keystone cops of this movie, we would have presidents running out of office (and out of life) every few months ...
