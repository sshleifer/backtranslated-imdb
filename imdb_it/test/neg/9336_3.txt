Solomon and Sheba came down to Hollywood traditions not because of the quality of the film, but because Tyrone Power died while he did it. I was in fifth grade and I remember the huge news well for the days when that tragedy happened. Then I didn't know who Tyrone Power was, but I learned and learned to appreciate the body of his work. I often wonder if Ty had a sense for this movie and what the hell he was feeling. He was also the unnamed producer of this. Maybe he didn't want to face the critics. The good thing was actually the power with Witness for the Prosecution, even if you can see it at a distance if you look closely. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a biblical stew that probably would have baffled the great Solomon himself. Several episodes described in the Bible that the Bible treats separately are woven into a plot with some additions launched by Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The true story of the Queen of Saba is that she went on a trade mission in the Kingdom of Israel, chatted a bit about Solomon, returned with a lot of goods and that was all. The story of a love story between her and Solomon is legend. The ancient kingdom of Saba speaks of where Yemen is and its people have moved to the African continent, as Ethiopia was founded. <br /> <br /> The queen never witnessed the famous Solomon case involving the two women with separate claims for a child, nor was she involved in building the First Temple. Nor was he around to destroy it. Besides, not even Solomon. <br /> <br /> And she was not involved in the succession dispute when Salomone's brother Adonija made a counterclaim. This is the heart of this film. Adonia, after hearing the news that King David is dying, declares himself king. Of course David meets temporarily and says that God came to him and said that Solomon should succeed him. When David hears about what Adonia has done, he says it is what God has taken form, Adonijah is greedy. After Adonijah manages to plot. <br /> <br /> Things seem to go back to the breaking point as Ty Power collapses on the set dueling with George Sanders as Adonijah. Sanders and Power were rivals in many films, particularly in Lloyds of London, which was Power's revolutionary role. If Sanders is not sophisticated enough and faded it was to Samson and Delilah, Sanders is still the biblical cad. <br /> <br /> When the power died, Yul Brynner was led to play Solomon and was given a wig so that existing footage of Power in Long Shot could be recovered. Brynner invests the dialogue with the right dignity, but I think he probably regretted making a pinch. <br /> <br /> Gina Lollobrigida is the queen of Sheba and she is seductive as a biblical temptress in the tradition of Cecil B. DeMille. It seems to have no real conviction and my hypothesis is that she was shocked by the sudden death of Power and by having to do it again. Marisa Pavan in the role of Abishag could give the best interpretation of the film. <br /> <br /> The real story with Adonijah is not as elaborate as this film. He argued with Solomon for succession and gathered around a group of some of King David's court as supporters. Solomon forgave them once and then Adonia asked to marry Abishag. Abishag in the Bible and here was an adopted daughter of King David in his old age. When Solomon hears it, he decides that Adonia is getting greedy again and has him killed. The Bible mentions someone named Berniah who was basically going around doing contractual strikes on Adonija supporters. <br /> <br /> What we have in the film is a spectacular climax that involves a miracle that I sought and could not find. It came from the fertile imagination of the director King Vidor who put an end to a long and distinguished career on a harsh note. It was a matter of Vidor trying to do Cecil B. DeMille in a biblical show. <br /> <br /> He didn't make it.
