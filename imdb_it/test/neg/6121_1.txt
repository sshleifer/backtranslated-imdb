This film was a waste of time. It looks nice, the nice settings, well interpreted, seem serious and seem to be in the lead somewhere so as to stay tuned waiting for a significant gain. Doesn't happen <br /> <br /> I was surprised that so much effort was put into a movie, it was clearly done in a very professional way and has a result that seems nothing short of a b-movie. <br /> <br /> Save valuable time and watch a good French film like Les Visiteurs (funny), Jean de Florette or Manon of the Spring. I can't remember the language in Europe Europe, but this is another great film - heavy but very worthy of being seen. <br /> <br /> This film seems to promise a lot but offers nothing.
