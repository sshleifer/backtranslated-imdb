This movie has too many things going on. Another commentator comments on the fragmented and discontinuous nature of the film as a reflection of the director's memories - which is fine, if that's how it was written and performed. Instead, what we get is a direct narrative - some of the times - that jumps, that drags us, sometimes leaves us to swing, interrupts the flow with useless digressions in other cases, and otherwise simply doesn't work. <br /> <br /> There are also some details of the plot that simply don't work. For example, why drag a body on a beach in an urban area in broad daylight, as opposed to nighttime hours? Why leave your flat sheet on your body? Why would an artist who knew Joe's character briefly decide to leave it "all" (even if it wasn't much)? This subplot was poorly developed to make that point work. After all, why is even the man an invalid or an artist if not to provide the money and free nude pose scenes? Could it have been just as easily a photographer or opera composer? After all, how does someone evaluate an apartment in an opera house - in particular without a clear connection to the Opera? The coincidences are also both too obvious and unclear and inexplicable. Because the boys should take everything in the warehouse and "disappear". If Tim was a 10-year-old schoolmate in a small town like Bangor, how could Joe lose his reputation for 8 years, especially if they knew each other well enough to recommend the other for a job. <br /> <br /> Some of the subplots (like the mother and her boyfriend (s) and the sister who wanted to escape felt stuffed.) There are some good ideas that could have made a feature with full development or would have could have been interesting short films. Completed, this film makes little sense and offers even less.
