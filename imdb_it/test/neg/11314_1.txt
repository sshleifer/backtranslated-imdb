Leslie Nielsen hits the bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream film I've ever seen. There is nothing I like about this movie, as it is essentially a joke movie, and the joke is not that funny. How many times should we laugh at an almost blind man who makes a fool of himself? It's not funny, it's just pitiful. Nielsen seriously needs to start rejecting some of these pathetic scripts, and Stanley Tong must stick to making Jackie Chan films, because it's not much worse than that.
