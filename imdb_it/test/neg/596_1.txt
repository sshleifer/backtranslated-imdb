The evil behind you, was created for a specific purpose in mind, to push the personal opinions of writers / directors about who can walk on water or who can dance with the devil. Unfortunately it would seem that the creators were so focused on saying that they took power completely out of power by feeding their point to the viewer. The way his message is presented Almost reminds me of the stories I heard of the Spanish inquisition! From one true Christian to another, avoid this like the plague, fear tactics never work when you try to send this kind of message !! <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible, the selection of Muslim terrorists was racist and unjust (they are terrorists so they must be Muslims). The premise of this was good, the story provided an excellent channel for his message, however it was the execution of these ideas that failed, making it very difficult even to separate the message from the messenger, so to speak. <br /> <br /> You'd better dust off your old "Ghost" DVD with Mr Swayze to get this message better. at least that movie didn't try to go down the throat. Or if you like good Christian movies with a powerful message, try "End of the Spear"
