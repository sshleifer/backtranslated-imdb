It was fun because it was so unrealistic, I mean, come on, like a pop star showing up at a public high school and falling in love with the girl who's obsessed with him? Come on, people! <br /> <br /> Everyone, except the main girl, was completely horrendous at acting. The dialogue was poor, the premise was stupid and the camera work was badly done. It felt like I was watching a poorly made home video. <br /> <br /> I feel like I've lost almost 2 hours of my life that I'll never come back. <br /> <br /> I have nothing else to say, apart from the fact that I'd rather punch in the face more than watch this movie again.
