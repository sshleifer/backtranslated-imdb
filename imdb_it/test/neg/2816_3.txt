While I was watching this movie I never thought I would defend it. He's honest enough since the beginning of not having much plot. There are no real characters to attack except the killer. Some of the recitations can be better, but most are capable. <br /> <br /> I know, a three out of ten isn't stellar, but there are reviews that say it was shot badly and completely useless, etc. I think he decided to do what he should do well enough. Lighting is minimal, at times, more natural than most people are used to, but is considered a film film for camcorders. In fact, sometimes the quality is probably still too high to be true, but nobody will be able to overcome the minutes of camera work that is really that bad. <br /> <br /> It's not particularly scary, but it's sometimes disturbing. There are one or two characters that do not seem credible at all and the soundtrack is sometimes tiring, but overall it was put together cleaner than many films for video cameras.
