Perhaps if you smoked enough grass, this would seem funny or would make you nostalgic for how completely upset people allowed themselves in the early 1970s. There is a strange innocence in this film and sex is much more embarrassing and playful than the steel professionals who do it for cameras now. <br /> <br /> The real curiosity here - and really the only reason to watch this movie - is the appearance of Kristine Debell in the role of Alice. He was a Ford model and show. It looks good classic, WASP-ish, like a really cute Ivy League half-sister. So what the hell is he doing in this cheap and cheap leather movie? From my point of view, she doesn't seem to be drugged at all in this movie (which could explain it) and she seems really incredibly committed to the part. When he sings his first song, he really does act like he thinks he's flippin 'Julie Andrews or something. I just had the feeling that this girl really believed that this was going to be her big break or something, instead of the almost killer career she was. Anyway, she's damn cute and you can't believe she'd be naked on the screen, much less make a masturbation scene, a couple of oral sex scenes (with men and women) and then do the real deal climax to the film (snark). Moreover it is absolutely not a double body. This is our little Kristine who takes one for the team, or for the greater glory of the show or something. It's really amazing to watch and it's definitely inspiring (ahem), but in a way I wish he hadn't. That was a very pretty and talented girl who got really bad advice. Anyway, my guess is that Kristine Debell, wherever she is, has been asking for a long time for this movie to go away. She was very pretty and attractive in "Meatballs". Almost impossible to believe that this is the same girl - but it is.
