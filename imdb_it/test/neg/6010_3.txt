For the producer David O. Selznick, no director would ever do it. So, in "A Farewell to Arms" (1957) we take two ?? Charles Vidor and John Huston. Although both men were pretty good on their own, neither could make the head or tail of this disastrous remake of Hemmingway's opera magnum. Hemmingway in general has never translated well from book to screen. But under Selznick's zeal to transform it into his next "Gone with the Wind", the excursion is both punitive and exhaustive. At this point in Selznick's career, he was no longer the Titan who could take "the box office poison" and turn it into Gone with the Wind. Tired, frail, without his studio, and, with the imminent feeling that his second marriage to Jennifer Jones might have been a mistake, did Selznick deliver the Fox Studios movies to the creative realms of this film? but he kept enough of himself to become damn annoying on set. <br /> <br /> By now one is, or should be familiar with, the tragic bittersweet love affair of a nurse, Catharine Barkley (Jennifer Jones) and her soldier hero, Lieutenant Frederick Henry (Rock Hudson). Their passion is supposed to serve as a stabilizing force for what is essentially a tale of a war correspondent with romanticism launched for good measure. But the chemistry between Hudson and Jones is turgid and boring. In the last reel, Jones's facial contortions during the birth of a child are so bad that it surprises me that neither director decided to cut them from the general publication. Part of the problem with Jones is that at thirty-eight he is too wise to play the optimist Catharine with great conviction. And yet, older actresses have often managed to make viewers forget the age discrepancies. Not so with Jones. One is painfully aware of the fact that she does not fit into the bill or into the action ribs or the years invested on this planet. Hudson's laconic charm is hopelessly foreign to the stoicism of an army soldier whose heart is broken, but his head remains strong. The supporting cast is studded with luminaries like Vittorio De Sica and Mercedes McCambridge, but these are wasted fragments of absurdity that do not in any way reflect the formidable talent of both actors and made evident elsewhere in their cinema production standards. > <br /> The anamorphic element of "A Farewell to Arms" looks pretty good, although there is a little too much grain in the film present in certain scenes for the tastes of this reviewer. Overall, the colors are soft and subdued, even if balanced according to the DeLuxe color processing used at this time. Some discolorations are evident. Meat tones do not appear very natural. Contrast levels are a bit weak. Blacks are generally solid. The whites are almost clean. There is not much to recommend this film sonically. It is essentially a verbose scene with gunshots as a background. There are no extras.
