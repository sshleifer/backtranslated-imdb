The plot: four people are captured in an elevator. One is a businessman, the annoying guy who is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone and is a champion talking about distilled stress and hostility. Then there is his colleague, a woman who is much more pleasant in her character. A rebellious teenager who just broke into a coke machine and with his mere presence makes the businessman go crazy, and an older guy who has just stolen 100,000 DM make up the rest of the cast ... <br /> <br /> The film is all about how they deal with their problem, as time goes by without reaching the outside world, while the lights go out, and as the cables begin to snap one after the other ... . <br /> <br /> Still, it's not too exciting. The characters are stereotypes. The story is stupid and unlikely (how could so many things go so badly in one lift?). You don't like characters very much, just one today. And all the plot twists are not contributing to the excitement, they are just stupid excuses to fill the dialogue a few more minutes while the writers continue to remain without inspiration and ink on a feature film set in an elevator. <br /> <br /> We just hope that "Phone Booth" is a better effort ...
