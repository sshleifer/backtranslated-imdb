I think it would have been a more appropriate title for this film, since it is filled with hell and returned with footage of various insects and animals. I recently found The Prey in its original VHS "big box" and I was very excited. I love finding old slasher movies on VHS because the cover is fantastic. Usually, however, it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic. The Prey is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it started well, with the killer haunting teenage clichés in the woods. The sounds of the heartbeat used are a great effect that makes you tense as you watch. This film is basically a great cliché, and when the "fireworks stories" section arrives, the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the execution time on the assassin's background. Actually I thought it was a rather original idea. However, the back-story ends abruptly and shows us some images of a burning forest (the lack of a budget really starts to show now). After this, we returned to the stupid adolescents who are gathered in the woods. The killer himself is not shown to the end, which is a shame because he actually makes an effective-looking killer. Kind of like The Burning's Cropsy, but better. As for blood, there isn't much, even if in the end there's a moment of OK squeak. <br /> <br /> In general, I would not recommend this movie to anyone other than a complete asshole: it's really a big mess.
