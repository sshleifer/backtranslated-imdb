I have been living in Istanbul for 24 years and I (39 years of experience would suggest) I know what Istanbul has been through all these years. <br /> <br /> Faith Akin is still quite young (born 1973) and fall into the great mistake of being an ORIENTALIST looking at Turkey (just like his other film Gegen Die Wand did) This film SERIAMENTE MANCA Turkish life contemporary urban E MISLEADS the public when it yields (quite false) clues related to the geographical and cultural spread of Istanbul. <br /> <br /> Anyone who speaks Turkish could easily attest that many bands and underground groups represented in the film (Siyasiyabend for one) are SO VERY WEAK and their members cannot even speak an appropriate language that cannot be considered "representatives "of contemporary Turkish music. Much less a piece of shit that many Turkish listeners don't even know at all. <br /> <br /> We Turks have long been accustomed to "superficial" Westerners looking to Turkey with a bit of orientalism: trying to adapt the real Turkish image in their mental patterns .. The novelty of this film is the fact that now a director of Turkish origin (Faith Akin) is making the same mistake: looking at Turkey with some fake Western glasses and stirring to describe it as if he understands better All a useless effort. <br /> <br /> Just ask any of your Turkish friends: what kind of musical documentary is this without mentioning the names: Zeki Muren, Baris Manco, Ajda Pekkan, Teoman, Muslum Gurses, Ibrahim Tatlises, Ferdi Ozbegen? .. and many others who have shaped the true music that we listen to today? <br /> <br /> Faith Akin has a long lesson to learn before stuttering and confusing the minds of others with false images of contemporary Turkish music.
