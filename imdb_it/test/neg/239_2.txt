Oh, man, surely they knew how to get them back. Hollywood has forgotten the basic ingredients of the ugly movie: cardboard steel and the god fearing the scientist's action hero! <br /> <br /> This film was so close to a masterpiece, alas, it didn't have to be, given that it wasn't able to include ray guns and moon invaders. The MST3K version tried to solve this problem by adding a pilot of a show called Captain Cody, in which a boy with a rocket-propelled jacket fights the evil makeup artists from the Moon, but it was not enough summary. <br /> Also, the comments of the theater boys were not as fun as I expected them to be. All in all, a great disappointment.
