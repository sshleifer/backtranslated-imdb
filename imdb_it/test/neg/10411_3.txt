A family (a teenager, her mother and a stepfather), sick of city life, decides to move to the mountains to get away from it all and start over. However, their idyll is shattered by three brothers and their overbearing father, who does not kindly take newcomers to their area. While having objects thrown through the window and being threatened on the street is just the beginning, the young man decides to make things worse by having an affair with the sister of the terrible trio. With the law that does not want to do anything and the violence intensifies rapidly, the boy decides to take the situation in hand. <br /> <br /> Flying wildly between hilarity and nastiness, this is one of the strangest exploitative films ever made. At first, you can giggle at some of the hammer and irony games that are given to the characters, especially the horny villains. But then, you get completely useless scenes like a mother raped while her son is forced to watch, or the sister of the criminal who is beaten by her brothers for daring to sleep with our young hero. In fact, the whole vision of women in the film, which seems to be pathetic creatures that scream a lot and can't defend themselves, is rather contemptible. But of course there is the mandatory nude scene, which this time involves a young woman who dives into a swimming pool without a bra under a very thin shirt. Who cares about the texture of the plot when you have young stars available and ready to take off your clothes. Quite right ?! <br /> <br /> The climax is centered on the adolescent, who until now has not been able to sneeze without jumping, suddenly turning into a Rambo clone and blowing off his attackers on the left, right and center to save his stepfather who is being held hostage by the gang. It's completely unlikely, but hey, so is everything else in this film ... so at least you can't accuse him of not being consistent. So rather than trying to find logic in a place where the word doesn't exist, check out IMDb pages on Janet Laine Green, Dehl Berti, Stephen Hunter, Jonathan Crombie, etc. Their careers have hit all dead ends. Why? Sit down and everything will be clear. Remember the kids, if you want to get on with this business, hire a decent agent and ALWAYS read the scripts they offer you. Please .. 3/10
