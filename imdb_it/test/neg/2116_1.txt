I think this film can be called the film of badly directed anger. <br /> <br /> The characters of Joe and Bob were relics of the Second World War generation that didn't understand their children who opposed the war, taking drugs and listening to rock and roll. But I think their real anger was the fact that America was beginning its long decline from the heights in which the war had left it. <br /> <br /> "Joe" himself is a cheap Archie Bunker, ranting against all the things that made him angry, living his life of quiet desperation, until he joins Compton, a boy who wants revenge on the hippies who ruined his daughter. <br /> <br /> Honestly, most of the film seems silly, the characters are worse than one dimension, they are ridiculous. Peter Boyle was capable of better things.
