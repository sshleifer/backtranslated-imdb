Essentially an indistinguishable B-movie that is mysteriously directed by one of the greatest talents of the golden age, Fritz Lang. Even with the stellar names of Lang, Walter Pidgeon, Joan Bennett and George Sanders, get ready for a ridiculous storyline, to a bad acting, pathetically false insults and mixture. For transparency, I must admit that I am a fervent non-admirer of Walter Pidgeon, who was fortunate to have found a niche in MGM's artificial dream factory, and somehow worked in secondary roles, supporting Greer Garson and others. He is grumpy, acting in a guitarist, Ray Milland's thirty-second tone, in a role where his life is in danger, and hides. Joan Bennett's cockney accent is excessive, but her lacquered hair, perfect make-up and classy dress deny a Cockney maiden who lives on the street. George Sanders is unable to act badly, but disappears after the absurd opening that finds Pidgeon somehow pretending to shoot Adolf Hitler. Surprising for Fritz Lang is the irregularity of the tone. I found the film swaying uneasily between occasional moments of suspense-thriller, surrounded by an easy-going comic interaction. Hitchcock completely reversed the relationship, using comic relief to slow the suspense from time to time. There is a reason why this film is unknown. It has not served or driven anyone's career or reputation, and is forgotten because it is a surprisingly bad film from a group with such pedigree.
