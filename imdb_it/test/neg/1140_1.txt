I saw the first 30 - 40 minutes of this film on television the other night and I can agree that this is by far the worst in the series. None of this is fun, even Randy Quaid can't save this mess. Eric Idle was not funny in N.L. EUR. Vacation, and he's even worse here. The only funny scene is where I am at the airport and a boy dressed as Santa walks by the camera shouting "Has anyone lost this?" while supporting a prosthetic leg ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 a star out ****
