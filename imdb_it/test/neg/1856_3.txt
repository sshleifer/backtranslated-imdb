In following Dylan Moran's star from the enchanting misanthropic bookstore owner in the surrealist sitcom Black Books, I could see his comic potential pleading to be used in theater or in broad cinematic streets. This first big-screen release in a leading role (he had a cameo like Rufus the thief in Notting Hill) had a lot of promise, but like the troubled Steve Coogan, The Parole Officer, he has too many folds that should have been smoothed in pre-production. <br /> <br /> The plot is so complicated that I won't bother repeating the finer details (the script has every character for us), and the laughter comes from show-business pranks. Michael Caine is a pompous man who directed a production of Richard III - updated to the Nazi occupation (one of the few genuine laughs, a satirical jab to Ian McKellen), in which everyone always salutes Hitler whenever they take the stage. By convincing Dylan that acting should be a conceptual act in its own right, the two plots to steal money from some fairly harmless gangsters through their acting skills. Confusion ensues (both on screen and in the audience), there is a romantic subplot between Dylan and the daughter of one of the gangsters blah blah blah and Dylan dresses in strange clothes and makes funny accents. Michael Caine offers some lines of choice, and Dylan's comic timing is about money, so why isn't it good? It has a certain charm that you would expect from Film 4, but it also has a precocious child who acts as a compass in a confusing and irrelevant plot - a no-no in writing on the screen 101. The exposition overshadows everything else. You would just like to see Moran and Caine playing each other like comedians at the beginning, but when they are together towards the end, mating has lost its charisma. <br /> <br /> Actors are a fun, though overwhelming effort. It should come on telly during a rainy Tuesday afternoon, then have it to you. Otherwise you would be better off watching your old Black Books videos or renting Withnail and I.
