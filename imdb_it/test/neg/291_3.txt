I have heard the stories of the ravers in the film and this is nice but this is only 1/100 of the film. The problem with this film is simplicity. I never had the plot or because the boy was stealing girls. This doesn't make sense, but hey ... because they were in a random club, he was also curious. Many parts of this film make no sense, but overall I was interested. He was confused on many levels ... maybe they are not indie enough for this film, but judging from the final scene of B they seem to have run out of money, just cut some things, and forgotten the plot. Its reduced budget and it looks like this. I like the fact that they used small special effects that were bad, but they didn't use any quality ones. I would say that this film is the screenplay par excellence, with good production. It's definitely not as random as many movies I've seen, but puzzle pieces don't make sense together. In fact, I would give an exception to the final battle when all the effects went into my ass in the 1950s. Spark on models and the like. Watch it if you like an involuntary comedy of an action movie. The theater of mysterious science has a candidate.
