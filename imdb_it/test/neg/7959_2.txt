I'm a big fan of the work of Deepa Mehta, in particular Fire and Earth 1947. Unfortunately, this film of his lacks all that is needed for a good movie. <br /> <br /> The film attempts to show the situation of widows in India at the beginning of the 20th century and the new wave of ideas of their rehabilitation in the same period. Shown with a widowed child as a central character, although the plot is too trivial from an Indian point of view, it could still have been a very powerful film. Alas! the film lacked both the sensitivity of fire and the intensity of emotions in the Earth 1947. <br /> <br /> Even if it is assumed that the story is a given, even if there are hundreds of things that I would have wanted differently because well, the making of the film is particularly unfortunate. Everything has been said Everything is shown straight. Absence of implicit sensitive sentences. Absence of unspoken things. I couldn't believe it was a Deepa Mehta movie. <br /> <br /> There were some very standard Hindi movie characters - like an old widow with her personal interests, or a father who has two weights and the best quality. Can't you write a script without having these old characters from standard Indian cinema? <br /> <br /> Many people have acclaimed Deepa for making a movie and proved a point against Hindu fundamentalists. Well, I agree that he took a courageous step, but shouldn't he worry about the quality of the film, or is it a controversial end in itself? It is obvious that if you start with a plot like in Water, you will end up feeling the pain of widows in consideration --- It doesn't take an experienced director to do it. And the film had nothing more !! So where is Deepa's contribution to the film? <br /> <br /> And we talk about acting etc. - pathetic !!! Lisa Ray has a pretty face, an extremely pretty face - but this is where it ends. You can't speak Hindi; she can't emulate. John Abraham is no better. Most widows seem unnatural. The saving grace is Seema Biswas and the girl. They are fabulous. <br /> <br /> And this was a period film - but the Hindi dialogues suck the big time. Also in this case the wording is also unnatural. No rustic accent !!! No local jargon. Nothing. The only right thing was probably the shooting location. I thought the vidhwa-ashram set was reasonably real. Even the overall blue tinge of the whole film is apt. <br /> <br /> But all in all, don't watch this movie. You got nothing. There is nothing in history or direction. If you have to watch him watch him for the little girl's acting.
