Enjoy the opening credits. They are the best thing about this second half, but inoffensive, offering passable performances by artists like Eric Roberts and Martin Kove. The main part, however, goes to the newcomer Tommy Lee Thomas, who seems a little diminutive for this type of action, but who, however, occasionally manages to project a kind of banty-cock belligerence. The first time we see him is shirtless, sweaty and engaged in that activity of "beefcake" favorite: cutting wood. After that, he has seven more scenes without his shirt, including one in which he is hanged by his wrists and zapped with electricity to Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapon". He could use a better script, however, since the way he exposes the truth about corruption and violence within the prison is never very convincing. There is also talk of millions of dollars that apparently are linked to this investigation but which are never explained. There are some advantages, though. Sending "John Woodrow" undercover as "John Wilson" is a fun game about a presidential name, and co-star Jody (Ross) Nolan shows promise as a prisoner who is shown at the beginning of the proceedings hanged by the wrists and struck by a strong guard. One last note: the film's low budget is painfully responsible for the lack of "extras". Despite the impressive size of the prison, it looks like it only holds 12 inmates! (Note: the credits are not too useful at the end.) For the record, the stout and bald guard Jody Nolan uses as a punching bag is played by Bill Fishback, and the young blonde guard who administers Tommy electric shocks Lee Thomas is played by Marc Chenail.)
