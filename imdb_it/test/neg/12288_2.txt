Ok, I had seen this movie when I was very young and the day we were cleaning the closet I see this! I thought, "I have no idea what this movie was like", so I went ahead and entered it .OH MY GOD !!!!! This movie is really damn bad! I never thought this movie could ever come close to my least favorite movie, but I laughed, because all the jokes were so trivial and ridiculous, it's not funny !!!! So many things in this movie were fun, because it was STUPID !!!! This film is not good at all. I must say that if you want to see this movie you absolutely don't have to expect anything big and if you've already seen it, trust me, I also feel your pain !!!!
