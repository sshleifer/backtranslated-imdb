Rock Hudson's second adventure in the science fiction genre after Seconds is Embryo, a film that combines elements of the Bride of Frankenstein and Pygmalion in a rather strange film about a lack of a better word, a test tube that grows to become Barbara Carrera. br /> <br /> Hudson is a scientist who experiences organic development and has the opportunity to experience his Doberman pincher himself when he is accidentally hit by his car. <br /> <br /> Some pituitary secretions from the female dog are given to a prematurely born puppy and grows considerably in an adult. Exalted with his success, Hudson takes a fetus from a fatal accident victim and gives him some of the same things. <br /> <br /> What you get is Barbara Carrera. And she develops physically and intellectually at a prodigious pace. What it does not do is develop emotionally. Hudson still leaves her as his new research assistant to friends and relatives such as his sister-in-law Diane Ladd, son John Elerick and daughter-in-law Anne Schedeen. <br /> <br /> Embryo does not explore some of the real problems in this type of science, instead it exploits them. The special effects as they are are rather second-rate. It seems that Hudson lost interest in the project in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> Now, what would have been really interesting is if he had a son and he became a Harlequin novel hero. Now it would be something in which Rock Hudson could sink his teeth into it.
