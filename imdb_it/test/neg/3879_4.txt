Bhagam Bhag was a waste of money and time in big time! I wonder if Govinda made this film? Govinda ... friend ... you are your big fan, do you have to make the right decisions now in choosing the film? I wonder if he had a role in that movie. The role of Govinda could be given to Johnny Lever. Akshay Kumar steals the show here! Akshay ... friend, rock! you have created space in everyone's heart all over the world! Lara Dutta, Tansuhree .... you guys deserve better. Paresh Rawal is good with his witty! overall there were a few scenes where I laughed ... otherwise I was just wondering "what the hell, Priyadarshan made such a stupid movie?" Anyway, let's wait and watch the next movie.
