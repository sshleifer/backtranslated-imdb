In this desperate attempt to keep the Hammer's Dracula franchise alive despite having lost most of its power for some time, our legendary vampire is brought back to life in the swinging London of 1972. Exactly one hundred years after being destroyed by his archenemy Van Helsing, an occult disciple by the name of Johnny Alucard (understand? Take it?) Gathers his flaming friends into an abandoned church, including Van Helsing's great-granddaughter Jessica, and performs a satanic ritual that resuscitates Dracula in a haze of smoke. Dracula's only mission is to devastate Van Helsing's entire lineage and the frail Jessica is the ideal victim to achieve this goal. This is probably the only film of the 70s that goes immensely over the top in an attempt to look like a movie from the 70s! Considering that the six previous Dracula films were all set in the Victorian era, the director Alan Gibson really wants to emphasize the fact that we are in the 20th century and therefore fills his film with unbearable hippie characters, horrible trends of the 70s and terrible fashion 70s music. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing seem hopelessly lost in this environment and their performances show him with regret. The opening sequence (a flashback) and the climax of the showdown are quite pleasant, but everything in the middle is painfully boring and the exact opposite of the scary one. The greatest elements of this series of films have always been the dark castles of Dracula and the exciting competitions of coaches and, obviously, this episode lacks all this. Fortunately for the fans, the contemporary Hammer Studios has released other films that run on vampires that are much better ("The Vampire Lovers", "Twins of Evil", "The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires" ??). Not recommended.
