Are we serious ??? I mean wow ... just, wow. I think I saw this movie in an old issue of War Journal. This is pathetic, originality is completely dead, instead of trying to formulate a new idea what we receive is a mild remake of an old plot and to "turn it on" just change the genre or race of the original character. Moral and everyone should be tired and tired of seeing it ... but I guess this is just a rant and will most likely fall on deaf ears listening to the sound of another asshole hitting the water in the toilet like the best 3:10 a western Yuma ... (wait) ... 3:10 to Yuma! Thank you Hollywood for killing the cinema as an art form and turned into a commercial flurry of neo-pop junk and a noticeable delay ... wonderful !!!
