On the positive side, it's over. This is the only thing this film has, of course. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen some bad ones. This movie is actually so horrible, I went and changed my Children of the Living Dead rating into a 2 just not to be Raptor. <br /> <br /> Official evaluation of a lining: "Come with me to another movie if you want to live."
