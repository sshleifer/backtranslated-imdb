I made a big mistake by going to see this movie. This is the lottery to go see movies, I think. After five minutes you knew it would be a clunker, and I fought hard enough to stay in my place - the old kind of "lose two hours of your life" feeling. <br /> <br /> The fundamental problem is that, without even mentioning all the "historical precision" of the reviews, the script is painful, painful, bad. <br /> <br /> The first thirty minutes could have spread to an hour to give a plausible, real, development of the plot. Instead, it has gone from a "dramatic" dramatic event to the next. Having the girl crying at the beginning of the film makes no sense because the audience has no emotional attachment to anything at this point. And that whole journey to the sunset through the long grass field at the end, what the hell was that? <br /> <br /> Not even the excellent Ed Harris could save this. You could almost feel his pain at some of the jokes he had to pronounce. The most fabulously terrible thing was, for no apparent reason, watching the girl copying her work to her apartment, looking up, everything is a bit confused and romantic - an illumination (or I'm dreaming), and he says , with authority in his voice, <br /> <br /> "WASH ME." <br /> <br /> And she gets up and washes him with a sponge. "Wash me" WTF? It is funny. <br /> <br /> And then there was the music. The long prolonged session in which it was only Beethoven's direction and the 9th Symphony that came out of the surround sound in the cinema and the chorus waiting, waiting, remaining there in silence for what seems like forever. And then, finally, the launch in a huge sound. It was incredibly wonderful and I dare say, it brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> That's why the film has collected two stars. The only part of the film in which Beethoven got to say exactly what he wanted to say. <br /> <br /> And I believed him.
