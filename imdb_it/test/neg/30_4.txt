Rita Hayworth is simply amazing sometimes and, for me, the only reason to watch this stupid movie. Despite the exaggerated 40s lipstick, Rita was one of the glamorous women of all times in Hollywood. In fact, for a couple of years I can't imagine anyone looking better, except perhaps Elizabeth Taylor in her prime. <br /> <br /> However, the co-star of the show, Gene Kelly, does not play his normal sympathetic, at least the kind of guy we all know from "Singin 'In The Rain". Here, "Danny McGuire" from Kelly pouts most of the time. Phil Silvers, whom I loved on TV at "Sgt. Bilko," is so stupid here as "Genius", you'll just listen to his stupid jokes .... and they're stupid. <br /> <br /> The images are good with great Technicolor, which looks almost fantastic. Here you can see many beautiful women, not just Hayworth. Unfortunately, the story is not that much. He focuses on Hayworth deciding on a career choice. Along the way, we get the normal despicable treatment of marriage and we get an insipid-silent end. All in all, a film not memorable, except as a showcase for Hayworth's beauty.
