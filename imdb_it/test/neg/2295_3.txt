This Swedish splatter film tries to imitate / imitate American horror films like "The Evil Dead", "Gremlins" and others. Writer / director / actor / cinematographer Anders Jacobsson and writer / producer / actor / supervisor of make-up effects Göran Lundström (did I miss something?) Were obviously inspired by Sam Raimi. But the camera work is a bad copy of what can be seen in "The Evil Dead" and elsewhere. Some other users have written that they liked the humor of this movie, but I didn't. <br /> <br /> The film is rather disturbed than entertaining me. He tries to combine suspense and comedy and the final product left me with a sense of oppression, even if it wasn't scary or shocking. The combination of different genre elements made this film very strange. I was never sure if it was meant to be scary or funny. <br /> <br /> The story is rather inventive except for the showdown at the hospital, but I didn't like how it went on stage for the reasons mentioned above. The gore and make-up effects are considerably good and at least the "Loose Limbs" sequences have been pretty funny because in these scenes the filmmakers didn't try to mix the fears and the jokes. <br /> <br /> All in all a strange film that you will either hate or love. Rest in pieces, Evil Ed. <br /> <br /> My vote: 3/10 (it made me stay true to American productions)
