As usual, the leader Leo Gorcey (in the role of Slip Mahoney) and "The Bowery Boys" are in trouble for money. After trying in vain to sell their old jalopy, the boys seek help from the local bank. There, unfortunate Huntz Hall (as Sach) has his picture taken by the beautiful photographer Teala Loring (like Cathy Smith). But, since the shot was broken during a robbery, it makes Mr. Hall the main suspect. With friends Bobby Jordan (like Bobby), William "Billy" Benedict (like Whitey) and David Gorcey (like Chuck); Mr. Gorcey wants to clear Hall and collect the $ 1000 cash prizes. "Bowery Bombshell" crosses the scenes, with Mrs. Loring a major force. <br /> <br /> **** Bowery Bombshell (7/20/46) Phil Karlson ~ Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Teala Loring, Bobby Jordan
