An ex-informant from East Germany ends up in Mexico as a spy for a student group in 1971 where he falls in love with one of the activists. This is Mexico's first co-production with Germany, and although it is a good image of the ideals that have marked, and continue to mark (at least for the CGH), young people end up being insipid since the internal dilemmas that the dark brown (Noethem) like the passion from his ideals that Adela feels (Campomanes), as soon as they see, in his case, I want to suppose, from the language barrier; and in the case of her for her lack of experience. Which is why in the end there is no concrete identification with any of them, which means that what could have been a film that has also served as a document like Red Dawn, ended up being another film; although I want to clarify that in the room many of the assistants were excited in the conversation with the director, which tells me that they are no longer so young or my ideals have changed.
