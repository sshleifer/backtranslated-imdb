"Hoods" does not deliver the goods. This semi-cooked mafia comedy has a stellar cast, including Joe Mantegna, Kevin Pollack, Joe Pantoliano, Jennifer Tilly and Seymour Cassel, along with a series of faces familiar to those watching crime films, but it's really a misfire if there ever state one. Screenwriter and director Mark Malone, best known for writing "Dead of Winter" for the director of "Bonnie & Clyde" Arthur Penn, made a pedestrian potomacchio that has an evil but vengeful boss of the mafia Louie Martinelli (Seymour Cassel) who sends his son Angelo (Joe Mantegna of "House of Games") to hit Carmine DellaRosa. It seems that a rival crowd has bombed one of Pop's warehouses (in the opening scene) and Martinelli wants to sell himself. The problem is that nobody has the slightest idea who Carmine DellaRosa is. In any other mass comedy, such a complication could be fun, but here it is simply flat. Angelo and a lot of magicians, including his best friend Rudy (Kevin Pollack of "Deterrence") spend half the time trying to find out who Carmine is. Neither Rudy nor Angelo want to execute the success, in order to track down a crazy Charlie Hitman (Joe Pantoliano of "Bad Boys") to do the dirty deed. Before they can convince Charlie to make the shot, they must locate him, and Charlie Mary's slutty wife (Jennifer Tilly of "Bound") reveals that he is locked up in a psychiatric hospital. Our geek heroes cruise to the psychiatric hospital and break Charlie. About half of the film is over before they discover that Carmine is a kid in shorts (Vincent Berry) who is bland and harmless. In fact, Carmine has the only decent line in the film. While our pack of mindless heroes leaves his home with him in the back seat to take care of business, Carmine warns them that they have to take him home in time or that his father will kill him. Charlie tries to chill the hedgehog but can't. Instead, he reconnects with his feelings and wants to go back to the psychiatric hospital so he can report the good news to his doctor. Meanwhile, after Charlie decides not to shoot Carmine, the child takes his paws on the gun and makes several aimless turns. Angelo and he fight for the automatic. The gun slips out of their collective hands and hits the ground, turns off and makes a hole in Rudy's chest. Now, keep in mind that Rudy never wanted to shoot the boy in the first place, and Angelo and he fought over the nastiness of the blow. So Rudy ends up on the ground with a mortal wound, while Angelo struggles to stop the bleeding. It's about a boring death scene. Angelo is in conflict because his father ordered the blow and Angelo fears that Dad will let him in if he doesn't execute the orders. There is a flashback subplot about Angelo's father who teaches him how to handle a gun that gives some insight into Angelo's reluctance to pack a gun. <br /> <br /> There is nothing submissive to redeem on this depressing comedy with a downer of a finale. Things get worse and if you survive this 90-minute nonsense, you'll see what I mean. Comedy is largely without laughing. Good actors bask in sketchy roles that aren't even fun. Perhaps director Malone was trying to do another comedy like "The Gang That Could Not Shooth Straight". If it was, it lacked a mile. Jennifer Tilly, big chest, shows the décolleté and growls through a couple of scenes with Mantegna, but doesn't do much else. She's the stereotypical bitch who doesn't even strip. A pay slip is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented cast, otherwise this image is pathetic from beginning to end. Initially, I had hoped this could be a "Ransom of Red Chief" knockoff in which the child drives witnesses' dice, but he is not so lucky here. Of course, the biggest surprise is that they have to kill a child, but it's not the kind of surprise that makes you want to see it until it's resolved. <br /> <br /> Did I actually buy this movie on a Canadian DVD label ?? Seville ?? and contains only the basic special features. If you hate the previews that give away the plot, don't watch the trailer. If you ever meet Joe Mantegna, one of your first questions should be why he helped produce this yawn. It is neither fun nor dramatic. There are no quotable lines and none of the characters stands out as interesting or nice. The Seville DVD presents the film in full frame without subtitles or subtitles.
