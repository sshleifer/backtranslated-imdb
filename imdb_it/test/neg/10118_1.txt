Hm. Where do I start? I usually ignore any evaluation of IMDb when I watch a movie because I think I might like the same or anything else and I should at least give it a chance, but this time I wish I had paid attention. <br /> <br /> I know someone liked it, and I'm not trying to say they shouldn't. It was fun in some parts. But if you're like me and you don't like watching the cats roaming in the undergrowth for 20 minutes, the random scenes in fast moving clouds, the dogs barking in the cages for another 20 minutes set for "thrilling" music and close-ups of faces while people are talking, so you might want to avoid this movie. The actors were decidedly wooden or decidedly exaggerated, and the quality of the film was horrible, fuzzy, grainy and insignificant, and not in an artistic way. And I know we had to think that Carol wasn't just a crazy maniac with a gun that shot innocent people with this strange religious psychosis going on, but ... well, actually, it didn't convince me otherwise. In fact, in the end I really dislike his crazy character. And what happened with souls in space? I understand that this is a fantasy film, but come on. <br /> <br /> I will say, the angel was creepy in the end. It was the most disturbing thing in the whole film, more disturbing than Darth Maul's demon. I give them support for that scene, it was nice. But not good enough to actually see the movie. And the credits were great, but don't be fooled! I would have preferred them to use the money to get a better movie. <br /> <br /> Bah. Maybe I hadn't even bought it for the $ 2 I paid, I could have bought a candy bar instead. : /
