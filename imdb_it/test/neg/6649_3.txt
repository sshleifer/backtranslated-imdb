After slipping into a secret database file to match DNA sera, federal agent Frank Poo (Andy Garcia) discovers that the only person who can save his son's life is a psychopath, played by Michael Keaton. However, when a transfer of serum to the local hospital goes horribly wrong, a certain Mr.Poo must do everything in his power to ensure that the madman remains alive to make the inevitable transfer possible. By the way, his name is not really Poo, I just want to call him. Despite the original concept in hand, this is an implausible and so hesitant action thriller. I've never been a big fan of Andy Garcia, and I guaranteed that his character here is attackable, this movie gets worse. The action sequences are handled quite disappointingly, and the ending sucks. Having made a great rascal in Pacific Heights, Keaton's bad psychopath here is a disappointment, providing a fool who's too funny and charismatic to deplore. Brian Cox is also wasted as the best and frank of Garcia.
