I'm a fan of the old SCTV show of the late 70s and early 80s and John Candy was one of the main reasons why. It was given a lot of fun by the characters of the wall and it was simply hilarious. Unfortunately he failed to get these roles in the movies. From time to time I was disappointed by the mediocre films in which he almost played the "straight" role instead of the funny guy. "Armed and Dangerous" rarely tries to use John's comic abilities, or that of Harold Ramis, for that matter. It is simply a very predictable type of guards and thieves movie. If you are a fan of John Candy or Harold Ramis the movie is watchable, don't expect to laugh a lot.
