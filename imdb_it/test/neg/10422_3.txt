It is reassuring to see that other IMDb reviewers have had the good sense to make this disappointing film, risking swearing against the great Vadim, Malle and Fellini. <br /> <br /> These directors can be talented and artistic in their own right; however, in an attempt to dispel this mixture of attempted eroticism and 60s elegance as * in any way * related to the stories of Edgar Allen Poe, they expose themselves as frauds. O (A) did not take the trouble to read Poe's stories, or (B) read them but they were so paralyzed by their own selfish program that they did not pay anyone Poe's head. <br /> <br /> Imagine if Metallica connected their guitars, operated the amps up to 11 and silenced 3 chords, stating that it was Beethoven's ninth Symphony. This is the feeling you will have after watching this movie. If you are a fan of Vadim / Malle / Fellini (Metallica), you will scavoi. If you're a fan of Beethoven (Poe), I'll vomit you. <br /> <br /> METZERGENSTEIN ... <br /> <br /> Here we start with a bizarre porn version of Poe. OK, "porn" could be a bit extreme haha, but at least you have to call it a version of Barbarella (including, I doubt, some of Jane's outfits that come directly from the set of that scifi game). Vadim falls into old cliches of his own: the girl lying on a bed is pleasing to a man while from the pillow cam we see the apathy in his eyes; the general tiredness and boredom of a woman who finds no satisfaction in hedonism. Nice things, but "Metzergenstein" is not the right place. And in addition to Barbarella's clothes and irrelevant erotic themes, the horrible American accent and unconvincing performance of Jane Fonda's European countess made him the worst cast by Julia Roberts in that lousy version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . <br /> WILLIAM Wilson ... <br /> <br /> Here is a great story of Poe on the madness that claims a man when he realizes that he is no longer unique in the world. If you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme, check out Star Trek's "27" episode "The Alternative Factor". But here, Malle reflects on that central theme and focuses instead on ... some hypotheses ...? yes, eroticism, sadism and debauchery. I have buzzing. The role of Brigitte Bardot is a complete realization to achieve this goal, and once again the director distorts a classic story of Poe in a masturbatory catharsis of his own unrequited sexual problems. Do it in your spare time, Malle. I thought we were here for Poe's penny. <br /> <br /> TOBY DAMMIT .... <br /> <br /> The worst of the three and perhaps the worst movie I saw from "Staying" I live. At least Fellini showed some tact in changing the title, but his distancing from the original plot, the theme and the humor of the story is so vast, I wonder if he has just chosen this reel from his private collection of films for the house, printed "Edgar Allen Poe story" on it and presented to this collection. I tried very hard to find a thread of familiarity with Poe's works, but there was absolutely none. <br /> <br /> Poe's original story ("Don't bet never the devil ") is a dark fable short and funny a man who constantly exclaims" I bet the devil is my head ... "On a foggy morning, the devil takes him over. The result is the sickest thing and stupidest you've ever read. This was Poe, the comedian, at his best (yes, Poe wrote many plays. Check also "A Predicament "and" Devil in the Belfry "if you want a taste of his witty and satirical works). <br /> <br /> This version of Fellini? It's tasteless, soulless and not at all funny (unless it's fun to see a drunk stumble over himself for 45 minutes). Here Fellini's rant egoism speaks of an artist struggling with hypocrisy, fiction and the mediocrity of cinema. Most are set in an award ceremony in which Fellini beats us over the head with sarcasm, cynicism and that classic attitude of "grape" that we find in all the films of Fellini that deal with cinema. Note the sarcastic blows of the "critics", a recurring theme in Fellini's films. For someone who considered himself above criticism, Fellini spent a lot of time talking about it. In any case, it seems to me that Fellini has just taken some 8 1/2 outtakes, put them together and sold them as a Poe story. Worst "adaptation" ever. <br /> <br /> I think I had more trouble writing this review than any of the three directors put into production on a Poe film.
