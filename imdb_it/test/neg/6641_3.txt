This movie is stupid. There is no way around it. But so is Dumb and Dumber. Mind you, Dumb and Dumber is a lot more fun than this. However, I am the first to love watching stupid movies (Tail Sting) and laughing with a bunch of good friends for how bad it is. Call me insensitive, but watch this movie, and you will find that the only way you can laugh is if you laugh at it rather than with it.
