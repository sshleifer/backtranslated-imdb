In my local video rental shop, they have a special place for two girls and a boy. It's really a long line. The employee allows people to rent it for free. They are over-evaluating their customers to let them waste their hard-earned money. <br /> <br /> I was extremely surprised to see that people gave this film a good review. Maybe someone can explain it to me. (or maybe the positive comments were jokes? Did the people involved in the film write them? Maybe the director's mother / writer?) <br /> <br /> Maybe I saw so many beautiful films that this fails in comparison.
