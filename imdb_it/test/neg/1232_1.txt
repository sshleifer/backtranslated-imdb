Please don't waste six hours of your life looking at this like I did. The fact that I did is not a very good reflection on me. The only acting job in this clunker was Wes Studi. Like a 'prequel' with similar roots it can't even be in the same universe as Lonesome Dove is beyond me !! It was a disconnected, incoherent, inconsistent story. The plot lines were not developed, the action scenes were almost ridiculous and the big ending (disappointment) was a perfect ending for this mini series. Val Kilmer, whom I considered a respectable actor, played one of the strangest roles I've ever seen in him. His final scene on the show must have been a filler for the director. I have been reading these reviews for years and this show led me to sign up !!!
