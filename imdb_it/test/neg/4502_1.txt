Having been a Godzilla fan for many years, Gamera was an economic knockoff for me to capitalize on the success of Toho's star Kaiju No. 1. THE ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS was for me at the time (1975) an almost painful visual experience. <br /> <br /> Last weekend, I attended the annual Godzilla fest, known as G-FEST, where Carl Craig, one of the stars of GAMERA against VIRAS, made an appearance. Of course, they featured this film. It was one of the funniest movies ever made. Of course, you have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it. In one scene, for example, the boy scouts held captive aboard the alien space aircraft manage to escape distracting the not-too-bright aliens. When they realize they have been deceived, one of them says "It's funny ... I think those kids lied to us". Not even PLANT NINE FROM THE EXTERNAL SPACE can boast that kind of dialogue. <br /> <br /> This may not be GODZILLA or even GAMERA 3, but this is a decent disaster, if you look at it in the right frame of mind. <br /> <br /> However, if you want high quality kaiju entertainment, check out the recently released GAMERA 3 rating: ** 1/2 of *****
