I can't believe someone could emit green light, let alone volunteer to stay inside. I will never get those 90 minutes of my life back. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Some movies are so bad that they are good. This has gone so far again that it is somehow so ugly that it is terrible. I wasn't expecting much, being a low budget, a jump in the bandwagon, the reorganization of a B series movie, but it was still coming under my expectation levels. Even TV movies have higher production values. <br /> <br /> There was (very) little special effect, shocking dialogues, terrible acting and a completely inexplicable plot. Who cursed her and why, because the 6-inch snakes turned into 15-foot snakes, has anyone ever heard of garter snakes or highly poisonous pythons? 100 passengers? 3000 snakes? Many promises, none delivered. <br /> <br /> Some comments would have you believe that it's worth watching this movie in the last five minutes. It is not even worth a rent. Stay and watch a low budget TV movie, you'll like it a lot more. <br /> <br /> Why was it made? Oh yes, to shamelessly cash in on the internet phenomenon that is SOAP. Shame on you, Mallachi brothers, shame on you
