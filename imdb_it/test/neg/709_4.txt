I have just seen Atoll K-Laurel and the last Hardy film together and known here in the United States as Utopia-on the Internet Archive waiting to see some extra footage since IA version had a running time of 2 hours and 21 minutes. It turns out that it is basically the same version that I saw earlier on the VHS tape of the Goodtimes Home Video junction box that worked for an hour and 23 minutes (with the exception of no product placement of the Grape Juice label of Welch inserted when a bottle was shown) with the rest of the running time devoted to dark white space. While it seems that Stan is dying soon, he still continues to make a good physical comedy with Ollie during most of the first 45 minutes or so. Then the plot to take a yacht with a clandestine passenger and a landless man on board - not to mention a charming French singer who also comes to live in an unexplored island at the end - takes over with any complications that tickle the comedy and never recovers, despite Ollie's familiar ending that says to Stan one last time: "Here's another nice mess you kicked me out of!" before Stan cries uncontrollably before it vanishes. In other words, if you are a passionate fan of Laurel and Hardy, this film is recommended for you to see it at least once. Anyone who wants to become familiar with this classic comic team should look for their previous work they did for Hal Roach from the 1920s until the 1940s, when they completed their last Roach movie, Saps at Sea. Come to think of it, even some of the movies of L & H Fox (I have yet to see the two that made for MGM) of the 40s are better than this ... Update-8/29/09: I just saw some missing scenes that appeared in the Italian version on YouTube . Cherie sings in one and has a conversation with the Captain. In another, that captain's wife throws a gun at Cherie. In another, Giovanni explains why he left his country with a flashback scene. Stan is voiced up here!
