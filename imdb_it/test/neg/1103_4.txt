Child death and horror films will always remain a delicate and controversial combination and so it is my personal opinion that any film that shows the courage to shoot on this topic should receive more attention from horror fans. Of course, as in the case of "Wicked Little Things", the controversial topics do not always guarantee a good movie. Despite the potentially interesting plot, the atmospheric setting and the involvement of the video-bad director J.S. Cardone ("The Slayer"), this is an uninspired and banal film that cannot offer a single scare or shock. After losing her husband and father, the remaining tunny women (her mother Karen and her daughters Sarah and Emma) move to a small and remote mountain town in Pennsylvania, where they inherited an old and crumbling villa. Their new home is dangerously close to the old ruins of the mine, where dozens of innocent children tragically lost their lives in 1913. Strange things start, like young Emma making friends with an (imaginary?) Girl who lived in their home the disturbing locals seem to keep secrets from Karen and her daughters. It quickly turns out that the undead children still leave their mine tombs at night to take revenge on the descendants of the mine owner, Mr. Carlton, who was responsible for their death. "Wicked Little Things" is rather meek and extremely predictable. The script shamelessly serves one scary clich√© after another, like automobile wheels stuck in the mud at crucial moments, malfunctioning torches and horribly broken dolls. There is little suspense, even less gore and the effects of make-up are weakly weak. The zombie children do not seem at all threatening. In fact, they all look like miniature versions of Marilyn Manson, with their black dresses, pale faces and dark eyes. The ending without excitement is as stupid and just as derived as the rest of this useless production. Lori Heuring is completely insignificant in the role of the mother's protagonist, but Scout Taylor-Compton (currently a big star thanks to the remake of "Halloween") and the young Chloe Moretz are adequate as the daughters.
