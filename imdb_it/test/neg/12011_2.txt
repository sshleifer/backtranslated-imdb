"Problem Child" was a good movie, but did it really deserve a sequel? I don't think that happened. The only saving resource of the original film was Gilbert Gottfried, and he wasn't even good at this sequel. <br /> <br /> I really can't understand why this movie was bad. For beginners, it wasn't fun. Even when I saw this as a nine-year-old boy, I didn't like Junior (Michael Oliver). His character came to my mind as a plaintive, disgusting and, perhaps more importantly, a rebel without a clue. He seemed to hate every woman his father Ben (John Ritter) used to hang around for the sake of hating them. Furthermore, it does not send a good message to children with divorced parents (who make up more than half of the children in the United States these days) when the only woman Ben decides to (almost) get married is a southern aristocrat who is vindictive and who he hates children as he is. <br /> <br /> And as beautiful as I thought it would be to see the original cast of the SNL cast, Laraine Newman, get back on the big screen, couldn't even save this movie. I also found it strange that it was a southern southern debutant, whose name was Lawanda. It looks more like the name of an African American woman. But of course, this has nothing to do with why I didn't like this movie. <br /> <br /> I think the film didn't work because you had antagonists that you should have hated, along with protagonists you didn't have to hate. The character of John Ritter had to be a good parent who was desperately trying to teach his son wrong, without conforming to authoritative parenting. Instead, he broke away not only from a mellifluous parent, but also from desperate to find a wife in a few days, regardless of how well he knew the woman. Did I say this sends a bad message to the children of divorced parents? <br /> <br /> Simply put, the rest of the things that went wrong in this film included Amy Yasbeck, unneeded and inexplicable, going back to playing a completely different character, that little girl who was even more hateful than Junior, completely out of place for toilet humor, and even more humorous and antiquated homophobic humor (involving dog hunters). The film was just a disaster, and in reality it does not deserve a DVD version unless one has already been given. He should just rot on VHS along with all the bad comedies of the 90s.
