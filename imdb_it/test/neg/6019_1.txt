Because the poster and the works of art say "Clubbed is one of the best indie films in the UK that I've seen in a long time. SCREEN INTERNATIONAL" when it was a quote from the French distributor REPORTED of Screen International (an influential commercial film publication) . See www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=39811 which reads: <br /> <br /> "Pretty Pictures has acquired all the French language rights on Neil Thompson's Clubbed .... James Velaise, president of Pretty Pictures, said: "Clubbed is one of the best British indie films I've seen in a long time." "<br /> <br /> Isn't it misleading? The distributor is obliged to say that it is good. Are the other quotes real?
