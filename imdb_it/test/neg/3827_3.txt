This went well and looks interesting. However, as he proceeds, attempts to create emotions between the characters are so inept that they make horror really offensive and are an insult to serious viewers. The story based on "I walked with a zombie" is probably much better, although unfortunately I haven't seen it yet. "Ritual" seems so exciting and could have been a great movie about zombies and voodoo, but in reality it turned out very badly, which is a shame. It's hard to say what's wrong with that. I imagine there are too many inept scenes and it is difficult to believe, for example, in the love between Alice (her name is Alice Dodgson as the girl who would have inspired Lewis Carrol to call her heroine Alice) and her younger brother. Absolutely nothing was built between them and then they eventually get married. However, this sounds fantastic, and it was worth a look - but the film is so poorly interpreted. 3/10.
