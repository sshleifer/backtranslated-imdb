Five boys who were in the Cub's scouts get together years later to go camping. They were unbeaten in their childhood nemesis and convicted escaped in this supposedly supreme comedy. Most of the cast is simply content to call him, and he doesn't really seem to care about the movie. The writers were so lazy that the names of the characters are, for the most part, the names of the actors who play them respectively. Richard Lewis's shtick becomes really fast. Even the late great actor, Brion James, cannot save this stinker. (Even though he is one of the few actors in the film who is not at all embarrassed), I almost dispelled a smile, much less had something that would have been reasonably interpreted as a laugh. Awful. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
