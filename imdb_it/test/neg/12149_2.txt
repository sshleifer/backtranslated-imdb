Well folks, this is another stereotypical portrait of gay life, however, the other downside includes poor acting, horrible screenplay, no budget, terrible sound and let's not forget the impossible plot. <br /> <br /> It is Christmas in New York City and our story "focuses" immediately on two male individuals, apparently lovers for some time. One of them did not let his parents (the right wing, religious zealots) know that he is gay (adding the unchallengedness of the story because this boy is as eminent as gay boys these days) and his parents are coming come to him. They will stay in his New York apartment where he and his lover have just decorated for Christmas. <br /> <br /> The story continues to develop around the arrival of the parents, who no one will like anyway and - as through only obvious and predictable ways - they learn that the son is gay. Tears are shed as was my interest in this film. <br /> <br /> The cast of charecters, looked like an introductory acting course at the local community theater. Lovers of this film are not up to it, and there seems to be no cohesion with their union. <br /> <br /> The landlord is flat and his attempt to be a humanist in the situation is cruel and certainly did not help move the plot further. <br /> <br /> The dragqueen friend who steps in to help one of the lovers in his "time of need" is stereotyped and gives a bad name to the unique art of resistance. <br /> <br /> Although some guys at night find that one of the lovers has a beautiful body (again, stereotypical images) it doesn't help this story. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie, especially if you're considering a purchase. You will shoot yourself if you do!
