This film is such a loss of talented and budget people in Hollywood. It made me think that everyone in the movie was giving a favor to be there because they were all out of place and wasted talent in this horrible pile of movies. It is an invented plot that is only pathetic, unrealistic and nowhere near funny or interesting. The only thing that kept my interest were the numerous big names in the film that kept popping up for no apparent reason and that had no acting or good jokes to contribute to the chaos of a movie. I kept expecting him to have something good since all these people had been fantastic in other movies. But it never arrived. This film should be shown in prison as a punishment, but it would be cruel and unusual. You will be shocked to see so many recognizable faces parading in a horrible pathetic script with flat lines and horribly bad acting. This film reminded me of another complete waste of time with a lot of recognizable faces BIG TROUBLE (2002), which also went off scale readable on the suck-o-meter.
