Not even the kitchen of Emeril Lagasse can save this idiotic disconnected nonsense, from above, with Emeril Lagasse as television chef of the food channel, who with the help of the crew to try to make the show better, the poor plot and the stupid script put down this drain show, Robert Urich wasted in the poorly supporting role and unfortunately this was his last (RIP), <br /> <br /> This is the worst show of 2001 and will be on the list of the worst shows of this decade. <br /> <br /> I feel very sorry for Emeril Lagasse for doing this sit-com, he even said he was drunk. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that it is the same designated women producers that made this mess. <br /> <br /> TV Review: 1 star
