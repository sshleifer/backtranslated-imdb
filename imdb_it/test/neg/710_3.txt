Oh, why did it have to end like this? The last film by Laurel and Hardy, from the roughly elaborate Cuckoo theme (with erroneous credit to Hal Roach) to the "Bel pasticcio" / "I couldn't avoid" schtick closing, this is the duo as a grotesque parody of themselves. In the middle, their relationship is now made up exclusively of uncertain recitation, asinine dialogue and uncertain slapping. People make the list of King of New York, but Chaplin's last bow was not at all dignified. <br /> <br /> What really hurts someone who loves Laurel and Hardy is the appearance of the two comedians. The cover of the video I'm holding shows them at their best, all the smiles of a boy and the glowing skin, with a blurb on the back that reads "The photograph on this case is for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the content of the film . "Necessarily? It doesn't even come close. The real film sees them at least fifteen years older than the sleeve-adorning photographs, with Ollie painfully overweight. This is not humorous, or comically, fat, as it would normally appear, but sick and on the brink of obesity. He would have died seven years after the making of this film, after a series of shots. Stan, meanwhile, suffering from a prostrate and dysentery problem, seems macabre as his weight has dropped dramatically. Whenever something bad happens to him, like being squashed between a raft and a table, you are afraid for his life. Even Ollie, who gives him a traditional slap, terrifies you that he can be killed. It would last another fifteen years after the completion of this film, eventually disappearing from a heart attack in 1965. It is shocking to think of such beloved artists as they age and die of painful death. And it is painful to observe their deterioration, both in terms of health and performance, on the screen. When I and, I'm sure, almost everyone else, likes to think of Laurel and Hardy, I think of Way Out West, Busy Bodies or our relationships. Seeing them in such a state of physical health and performing serious routines at the end of their career path is a plague for my happy memories of them. <br /> <br /> The warning signs are clear precisely from the opening credits, which list not only four writers, but also someone with whom to invent the concept and a credit for "gags". So if Monty Collins was writing the "gags", then what were the other four writings? And if so, why did Monty Collins pay a fee, given that there is no evidence of a single "gag" in the whole movie? Over 40% of the film is dedicated to the island of the same name, during which we experience some of the most painful and unpleasant scenes in which the boys have ever been involved. When I saw the bat scene, I wanted to curl up and die, so great was his infantile ineptitude. Yet, what kills the stone of the film is that all the supporting cast is nicknamed, unable to speak English. This not only makes the film uneven, but also severely reduces the reactions of Stan and Ollie to their co-stars. Directly addressed with a disconcerting film and an absolutely atrocious editing, this totally denies the 2 million dollars spent on this. Frankly, it sounds terrible, and while a DVD version can clean up the image, the sound and picture quality is far inferior to any of their Hal Roach works. <br /> <br /> The "friends" of Stan and Ollie, Giovani and Antoine are a charisma-free bore that stands out from the old-fashioned repertoire of Laurel and Hardy. This is another big problem with the film, as none of the supporting characters are funny, or inserted into the innocent mentality of boys. The harsh dubbing shown at L & H ("you - the fat one") makes them stand out as isolated social misfits, rather than amiable sub-anarchists. There is evidence of a more obscure political satire - even if Duck Soup is not - and the concept of an island without rules is an interesting topic. Perhaps more current than it has ever been, a film that looks at the problems of immigration and the US Constitution suddenly becomes more current in 2003. Unfortunately, beyond a funny scene in which Stan is "the people", this don't really go anywhere And this slightly black humor has its hard edges - or it's a Laurel and Hardy movie where rape is implicit directly and Stan threatens a man with a bottle, just to blame someone in the face, your idea of ​​a good time? After all the years of Stan and Ollie sharing a bed, we also have a specific reference, with Stan accidentally kissing him - Ollie sweeps the kiss away with disgust. Equally worrying is the implication that Stan and Ollie's illegal immigrant friend, Antoine, ends up being eaten by a lion. Mind you, I never thought I'd see a Laurel and Hardy movie where they had to be hanged. The need for an intrusive and unpleasant narrative is a further indication of how complicated everything is, with the American release (the same version available on video) that marks 16 minutes in a vain attempt to improve it. <br /> <br /> Almost completely unwatchable, this film made horribly and relentless serves only to tarnish Stan and Ollie's reputation - avoid at all costs.
