I saw snippets of this on TV once, and when a friend recommended it, I started looking for it even though there seemed to be no place nearby. I finally got it at an antique store, and I couldn't wait to see it ... Oh, I had seen it a couple of years before and I would have loved it. I was surprised that this film was only 80 minutes long, and I think this is what made the plot and the story so lacking. The plot looks really good, both on the trailer and on the film's comments: a teenager, Angus (Jesse Bradford) and his new yellowish labyrinth are abandoned on an island during a storm during a boat trip with his father (Bruce Davison) . Together, they manage to survive in the wilderness and wait to be found and saved. However, what is never mentioned is that everything is shortened and the events of the plot are very hasty. There is a possible love interest between Angus and Sara, but they are never shown together for more than a moment. Yellow is a mischievous dog that parents are reluctant to keep, but in a few days it seems to be appreciated enough to participate in a boat trip. The scene of the mother (Mimi Rogers) who vaguely mentions what the death of the younger boy (Joel Palmer) is going nowhere. In no time, we learn that 9 days were spent on the island, then suddenly there are 14, then 19. Of all the animals that a shipwrecked person could be exposed to in nature, only 1 type - a wolf - attacks them. Why couldn't something else be a problem instead of having the same kind of animal - maybe even the same - hit twice? There are few visions of how Angus prepares food, except when he finds fruit and roots and when he roasts a trapped mouse. If you know so much about survival skills, why haven't more scenes been shown? The only thing that made me blank was why the dog didn't have much of a part on its own. When saved and the dog is left on the island, there is no scene showing how it survives without the help of a human. I wanted to be more open to it when I looked at it, but I liked it a little. The acting was good and the score was pleasant. However, I found myself wondering why his father was much older than his family and why he and the main search and rescue host shared the names. This is a good film for children, but although the protagonist is 14, none out of 10 would be interested in this.
