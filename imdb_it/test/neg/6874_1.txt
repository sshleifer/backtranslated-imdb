this movie has wasted my time. I saw only a part of it and I cried for the wasted time I could devote to doing something productive and useful for this land. for all those who have seen this movie more than once, I blame them for global warming because the amount of black balloons that came into the earth from this piece of shit weren't necessary and if they came from a different movie, I wish they forgave . Robin Williams has lowered his standards to actually participate for more than 10 seconds in this film and Tim Robbins, as he switched from this film to the redemption of Shawhsank, I have no idea. Please do not watch this film for earth security. stop releasing black balloons into the earth from a movie that they would never have funded or released. Please burn all copies before someone else has to watch this shit.
