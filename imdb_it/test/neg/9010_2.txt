I accept that most 50s horror films are not scary by today's standards, but what the hell is this? When you see a title like this you expect to see blood and a bloodthirsty beast. Instead we don't get absolutely blood and a beast that wants to either conquer the world or live in peace on Earth .... yes, that's what people wanted. <br /> <br /> The general story goes well with the astronaut who comes back to life and is one with the beast .... but the title really kills the film. Night of the Beast would have made the fans happier because there was really nothing to talk about. <br /> <br /> I like how films from the 50s had terminations that left room for a sequel but wisely never made one. This film is not the worst I've ever seen, but it's almost up there. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
