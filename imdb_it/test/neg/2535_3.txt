I think the problem with some reactions to this film is that - with few exceptions - they don't focus on the main disconnection, from which the main division in the audience. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, there are those who are taken by the visual design, the beautiful costumes and the variety of elements that enter the film. Some fans of children's films love color and animation, and all the non-scary "magic" effects, shape-shifting animals and so on. Some culture lovers like the complicated references, the stratifications of different elements of folklore and the fact that they can see Zhang Ziyi sing and almost mime, in two different languages, in what was actually meant to be a children's play. <br /> On the other hand, there are those who say that the children's film should still have a point, that a mixture of folk tales is not at all a fairy tale, and that it is easier to believe in magic when enough thought and care has entered into the technical aspects to make it real. <br /> <br /> In other words, the ideas could be beautiful; but when you put them on stage they have to deliver. Here, they don't. <br /> <br /> A good folk tale - from any country - has a clear history, a point and characters that interact strongly with one another. This is missing from all of them. Some gestures that are too sophisticated for Western and Japanese opera do not replace a solid theme. <br /> <br /> As a fan of fantasy, I must say that I met some turkeys and loved a few, but this one really tries to do too many things - at low cost. Putting in Zhang Ziyi to try adding some glitter to exotic flower syndrome. The other problem is not that there is no plot; there is a half plot, which means that it continues to be pulled in, then falls again when another dance number not too clearly executed starts. <br /> <br /> The characters all seem to know that they are protagonists in a film. Unless you really like watching other people's amateur video, this is not good. I would like to test it on real children; I think they would leave him for Uproar in Heaven after about 20 minutes.
