Whoa! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, did I say terrible? It can only be said from the cover of the DVD not to get this film, but unfortunately it was not my case. Well, someone brought me this house to watch it and when I looked at it I just wanted to strangle the person, because they used my money. I'll take it back soon, but I could also tell you about it while I have it in my memory, because I absolutely want to forget it. This film does not even deserve to be called horrible. It's beyond horrible. Probably the worst movie ever. The acting was so, so, so, so horribly disgusting, as death was TOTALLY lame and predictable. I didn't even laugh at how bad this movie was, which scares me a little. I don't see this movie, it's a pity for you if you look at this movie page too, and I have EXTREME pity for you if you are watching this page of the movie, because you think this will be DECENT.Final word: YUCK !!!!!!!!! !
