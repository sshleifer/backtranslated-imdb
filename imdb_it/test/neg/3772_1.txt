This film is an incredibly self-indulgent piece that assumes that the simple impression of a story is as good as a true story. It was absolutely painful to watch and if I hadn't been sucked into buying the DVD because of John Travolta and the positive buzz, I wouldn't have finished watching it. <br /> <br /> This film lacks something that resembles an interesting premise and seems to rely on heavy (and frankly heavy) characterization. There is a scene of altercation between Purslane and Bobby Long in which a TV is destroyed that, when played, is incredibly flabby and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> I found myself worrying less and less about the characters I looked at. It was probably a lot of fun for the film school to do it. But it's simply boring to watch. An indulgent and pretentious film school project on which you should not waste money.
