This film was so horrible that I don't even know where to start ... The only positive thing I can say is that Luke Perry gave a good performance. The whole film was everywhere, there were no explanations for the cause (theories only) of the eruptions, or the rationals for their solutions or why it would work. It was ridiculous! All the characters and the relationships between them were so vulgar, you just want to laugh !! There was not only a background for any of them. The "love" relationship seemed to have been added to the script, it was so embarrassing. There is an army man; a great black general with a permanent cigar in his mouth, with "AaarrrGH! i'm the Man!" attitude, a bad boy so pathetic. The two helpers, who should be geniuses, behave like two 16-year-old brothers. And then to create some action they decide to drop a rock on someone's shoulder and for the rest of the film he coughs like he's dying of pneumonia or something ... and then he plays the hero (the most cheerful of everything !!) to help the plan that has to do who knows what ... it is never a good sign when you find yourself laughing out loud in the middle of the dramatic scene ... in a nutshell; do not waste time!
