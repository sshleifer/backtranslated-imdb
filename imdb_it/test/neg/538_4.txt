It is perfectly normal for people to die in an animation, but there are too many deaths in this. It starts from the beginning, the story is all about battles, struggles, death and revenge. It goes on for an entire hour and a half. It was interesting at first, but I got very tired after the show was halfway done. Unlike other animations, this is the lack of humor. There are not many interactions between the characters. The good thing is that the fight scene with the sword looks pretty good and the characters look beautiful.
