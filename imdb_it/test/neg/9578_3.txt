They call this film "euro trash horror". <br /> <br /> Well, it's not horror. The film takes place in Europe, so yes, it's "euro". Rubbish? Ah yes, it's rubbish, that's fine. <br /> <br /> You know you are ready for a fantastic movie when, right at the beginning, the DVD gives you the text on the screen apologizing for the quality of the print you have to watch. Expect crackles, strange strident cuts and because the film does not fit the screen. Also there is the sound - at first I thought I was watching a dubbed movie. Then, looking closely at my lips, I realized that, no, it's that the sound quality is embarrassing and out of phase. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is pretty stupid - an old and disfigured woman named Dr Bannister kills a scientist for his youthful formula. I'm not giving it very far because when you see the "old woman" it is quite obvious that she is under a layer of makeup that is often badly applied. Anyone who has the lure of meaning, seeing fake old age, knows what will come next. <br /> <br /> Yes, the "old hag" is miraculously transformed into a beautiful young woman - complete with face makeup and a long hair wig! Zounds! <br /> <br /> When I say that the old woman is disfigured, I mean she has cornflakes glued to her face. The film makes no attempt to explain how cornflakes came about. Moreover, there is no attempt to explain anything about any of the characters. They have never been developed beyond the level of finger puppets. <br /> <br /> The two policemen who pursue our anti-heroine simply wander, seemingly baffled by the simplest clues. The murdered scientist was working on a juvenile serum, the old woman has disappeared, and we continue to run into a young woman - how do these pieces fit in ?! What does all this mean ?! One of the policemen sweats a lot and beats his face with a cloth. The other smokes a pipe. This is pretty much everything we get from the character's point of view. <br /> <br /> Dr Bannister (the old woman, now a beauty) walks around wearing strange costumes and then takes them off to be able to see his flesh. He has business with men. Take a close fight with a young woman in a nightgown. She goes to Geneva, so we can see the lake there. Water it a little, then remove the suit to reveal a strange beaded bikini. He takes off his clothes again in a strange ninja striptease. <br /> <br /> The ending? Well, without giving anything, it's just a bizarre, attached to the conclusion that it makes little sense like the rest of the image. It's the kind of thing a screenwriter gets when the director wakes him up at 4 am and says, "Quick! We need a final for our movie! What happens next?" <br /> <br /> The writer mumbles something half-awake, and the director runs with it. <br /> <br /> What's good about this movie? Part of the music is campy and fun. That insignificant 60s classical music is enough to make you laugh out loud. There are some strange seduction scenes, bizarre dialogues, stupid moments. <br /> <br /> It is very close to being so bad that it is good. I managed to watch it from beginning to end without digging my eyes or sobbing. I guess it's a praise, of sorts. "
