"Hood Rat" is absolutely terrible. This is an urban version of "Willard". I can't believe this movie was made, not even distributed. Someone at Universal Studios thought that people would watch and appreciate this "movie". The only good thing about this is Ice-T as a landlord. He was fun. <br /> <br /> The only thing I hate in movies is to speed up the action. Once or twice it's pretty bad, but the WHOLE movie is like that. Each scene transition is a special effect of rapid movement. The director should be forbidden to make films forever. <br /> <br /> Trust me, never see this movie!
