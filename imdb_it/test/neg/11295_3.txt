I'm a big fan of Thomas Harris, I've read all his novels at least 5 times and Hannibal is the book I really love the most. So the film was my biggest disappointment and I really don't understand why some guys give it a nine or even a ten. Their demands are very low or they have not read the book or both. Even if I hadn't read the book, I'd still consider the film an absolute average and give it a five. The creepy and mysterious atmosphere of the novel does not appear once in the film, when I saw it for the first time in the cinema I even fell asleep. Why was Margot Verger, a very important character, completely omitted? Why was Barney shown to be an ignorant fool whose only ambition is to make money? And above all, why did the psychological process that Starling went through at the end, caused by the drugs Lecter had given it, come down? Not to mention the fact that the ending was also omitted and totally changed? Well, the reasons why Jodie Foster refused to play Starling are well known and I accepted it, although as surely many others are very disappointed because I identified Starling with her. For stories like Red Dragon, The Silence of the Lambs or Hannibal that has such a psychological depth, it is very important to identify with a character when they are adapted to the screen, but as the Germans say, it is "the snow of yesterday". Ridley Scott has made incredibly good films but with that he doesn't live up to his name. Jonathan Demme had exactly the right feeling for the plot, the characters and their relationships with each other in The Silence of the Lambs, should have also been done by Hannibal. My only comfort is that I have only seen the film twice, it is a long time ago and thanks to God for this reason I am unable to see the scenes of the film when I read the novel. I'm very sorry but I can't really recommend it to anyone.
