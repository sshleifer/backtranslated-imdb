The journey here is a search for God, the great guy in the sky, the big cheese with a beard. Skillfully masked by a thirst for supreme knowledge. To occupy Leonard Nimoy in the chair of direction is the same Shat, the captain Tiberio William Shatner Kirk. In an attempt to fuse the fun aspects of the series with sci-fi histrionics (Klingon dialogue consultant, really?), Shatner and his co-writers have only realized what is almost an embarrassing parody of a parody. Where's the danger? where is the spirit of the brothers in arms? indeed where is our team poorly managed? The humor of Star Trek is a wonderful thing, when it's in the right places and done with a straight lace so suited to what happened before The Final Frontier. There are some light moments, but they do not compensate for the lack of important moments. While we really need another revelation from Spock,? really ?. <br /> <br /> Some nice sets and a few moments of Trek knowingly aside, The Final Frontier is just a bad cinematic experience. 3/10
