This film is one of the worst movies of all time. I am rather upset that this film is not on the 100 fund; deserves a place at least number 60 or 70 in that list. This is not just a movie that I think is bad in a fun way like MST3K; it's just bad. This is one of the few films I really hate, really. Freddy Got Fingered is in the same bad category. <br /> <br /> So the story in this says that the daughter (Gugino) goes to California to go to school and returns with Crawl (Shore) and tries to learn how to be a farmer. Then the boy tries to set Shore so that the girl leaves Crawl and comes back to him. It ends and what remains of the public can leave. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of this film is that Pauly Shore get ready for the camera and try to be funny; but I would say that about 100% of the time it fails. Their horrible inaccurate and obsolete view of farms and agriculture is offensive and there is nothing in this film that deserves to be seen. If you think you see it: don't do it. The only time I saw the film seemed to see it for 5 or 6 hours. If you've already seen it; you have my understanding
