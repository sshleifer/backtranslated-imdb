... But it certainly deserves only 4/10 stars and no more. The father of a stupid boy is a fighter pilot who is shot down by some Arab country. They never mention the country in the film, it's really ridiculous, they refer only vaguely to some Arab nation, this film is really ignorant. But Lamar of Revenge of the Nerds is here, he is a friend of the main character Doug Masters. Well, Doug Masters, who lives in an air force base, his father is an air force pilot, yet he fails to enter the Air Force Academy, conceives a plot (with the help of his retarded friends) to steal two jets and go save your father. Yes, exactly - this is one of the greatest films ever made !!! Louis Gossett Jr is fantastic in his role. It can be said that in practice he wanted to beat Doug Masters to death throughout the film. Well, anyway, you can probably guess how the plot ends, I can't believe they made 3 sequels in this movie.
