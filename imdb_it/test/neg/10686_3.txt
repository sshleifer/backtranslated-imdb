The geek (animal-eating) scenes weren't as bad as you'd think. After seeing Mondo Cane and Mondo Magic, these scenes are average. The grossest was when the boy ate his head from the mouse. But they were so quick and few that they didn't bother me. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the film was simply interesting. I always like to hear stupid dialogues. They never sound like what you think the actor / actress looks like in real life. I liked the bright colors worn by the princesses. Even the shots of bizarre insects were fantastic. The younger princess looked REALLY young, almost 14 or something. The fighting scenes were not as long and boring as most combat scenes, so it was nice. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
