Seymour Cassel gives a great performance, a tour de force. His acting as alleged flooded beach stallion, Duke Slusarski, will always have a place in my heart. The film focuses on a nerd who has just arrived at the beach hoping to honor his dead brother's dreams. What you get is a lame surf gear. Cheating guys, guys fighting, and guys getting drunk by watching surf documentaries with the entire city of Los Angeles on Friday night. Duke takes the nerd and tries to teach him how to play volleyball is like touching a woman. The next time my woman speaks, I'll pretend she's crushing the ball. <br /> <br /> Back to Seymour Cassel. The end of the film turns into a good drama, since the first half of the film made no sense. Duke plays a wonderful volleyball game, the best he has played in over ten years. The way the scene is shot is beautiful. You can feel the heart that this man has for the game and the love of being on the beach. Those five minutes will go down as one of my all-time favorites. 3/10 Bad to Fair, the rest of the film was lame.
