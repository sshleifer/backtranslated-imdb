This is one of those movies that I watch whenever it happens not because I like it, but because it's so ugly that I can't look away from it (like "Battlefield Earth" or "3000 Miles to Graceland"). The first time I looked I kept waiting and waiting to laugh and I didn't get my chance until about 3/4 of the movie when they stripped the molested cops at their panties and handcuffed them in the park in an unflattering position . Besides that, the jokes are not funny, the characters are not funny, their mishaps and missteps are not fun ... add it, it's not a very funny movie! Not even at the slapstick level! And what is the reggae soundtrack? It's a film about two white guardians and the music is all reggae. Seems out of place, right? If you like a good train, this is for you. If you like a good comedy, look elsewhere.
