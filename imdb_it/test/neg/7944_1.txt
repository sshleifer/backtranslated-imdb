I don't think it's necessary to trace the plot for you, because the site and other users have already done a great job. That being said, here is my opinion. This is by far the worst movie of 2005, and there have been some really bad ones. I don't even need to go into details because there is NOTHING to redeem on this movie. Bad acting, bad plot, bad direction, bad special effects: call it. If it's not the worst movie ever made by himself, he's tied to another piece of shit. I would be embarrassed to let my friends know I was in this movie. But hey, most people who see it will do it, regardless of revisions, so more power for you. When you feel the gap between your neurons two hours before the evening, don't blame me.
