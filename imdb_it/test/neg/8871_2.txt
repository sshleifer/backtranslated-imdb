Tu pa tam is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But on the other hand it is better than most films from Slovenia, which are full of depressing characters and stories without brilliant ideas. Tu pa tam is brilliant, optimistic and without artistic moments. In many interviews director Mitja Okorn tried to tell us that his film is of high quality just because it didn't cost much money. But thinking this way is wrong. Tu pa tam is a bad film for me. The dialogues are poorly written (90% of the script consists of curses), the characters are stereotyped idiots, the plot and its twists are very predictable and the action sequences (this film should be an action comedy) are shot very bad and without style. Okorn is thinking that he's even bigger than Quentin Tarantino, so he's copying his style for the whole 90 minutes. Humor in the film is very cheap and primitive (Okorn probably thinks that constant blasphemy is fun). In my opinion, Tu pa tam is a very cheap film (not only in terms of budget) with a stupid story and bad acting.
