I started taking a critical view of this adaptation in the first few minutes but as a dedicated Jane Austen fan I persevered to the end ... However, this is not a program that I would recommend to someone who is not familiar with his work as I I wear It thinks it's the justice of the book, and it doesn't make television particularly funny. There was something about this adaptation that lacked credibility - many of the costumes and even the actors didn't look authentic and I found the acting sometimes poor. There is no doubt that the actors were all very beautiful, but this did not offer enough variety to create truly different and memorable characters. It was too static to be entirely in the same position and to miss Fanny's return home, which is one of the most interesting parts of the story. The best actor was Blake Ritson, who captured Edmund's health very well, and the Crawfins were also cast. I like Billie Piper as an actress, but this role was not good for her and was played much better by Frances O'Connor in the 1999 version which gave a much more subtle and convincing performance. Jane Austen's adaptations will always provide a romance to make you feel good but unfortunately, this is one of the worst I've seen.
