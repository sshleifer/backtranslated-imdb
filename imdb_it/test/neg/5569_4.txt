I really wanted to like this movie, because it is pleasantly different from the hordes of clones of everyday horror films, and I appreciate that the filmmakers are looking for something original. Unfortunately, the plot wasn't held together and none of the characters was nice enough for me to really care about them or their fates. <br /> <br /> Visually, The Toybox was quite interesting. The director has made many rather risky moves, like adding some parts of animation (in Flash style) in parts and really getting some of the special effects (like the light of a certain amulet). Sometimes this worked and sometimes it didn't, but it deserves compliments for the attempt, and the cinematography was generally high quality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, when this same approach of throwing a lot of things on the wall to see which sticks were applied to the plot, the results were not very good. The film never finds a tone he likes, moving schizophrenically from the black comedy to the family soap opera, to the 1980s witchcraft film, to childhood nostalgia, to a family slasher. Taken alone, fragments and pieces of each of these elements work quite well, but nothing is ever consistent in a satisfying whole. In addition, large parts of the plot are never really explained. I am not one who likes having everything that feeds me by the spoon, and I like movies that leave things to the public to decide, but the parts that are left out of The Toybox just seem to have run out of money before they could explain it or they don't have really thought things out to begin with. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the director's next project, as I think there's a lot of talent hidden on the surface here, but I can't really recommend the Toybox for its merits.
