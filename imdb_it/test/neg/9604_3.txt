Alright! A hybrid of science fiction / horror / action directed by Jim Wynorski and in the final scenes we will see a cyborg with a metal head that kills more people! As in every Wynorski film, it launches a lot of crazy and subplots ideas that mostly lead nowhere. But "Storm Trooper" is more like a type of two-movie contract for the price of one. On the one hand we have the dramatic / thriller part (as the film opens) with Carol Alt killing her incredibly annoying and ungrateful husband (a plot that simply doesn't lead anywhere). And on the other hand we got the 'cyborg escaped on a fury' part, in style "The night of the living dead". With Carol and Cyborg who are trapped inside the house and a group of special OPs / bounty hunters who play the role of the zombies, trying to get into the house. Needless to say, this film is not up there with the maximum. Zach Galligan (of "Gremlins" -fame) is particularly painful and Corey Feldman (in a small support roller) is once again completely wasted in this film. Wynorski also tears one of his films here, since I'm 99% sure that he used some footage of his previous movie "976 EVIL II" (the scene with the exploding truck and the bike). Yes, it's not so good and so funny. This is exclusively for Wynorski fans. And I'm one of them, in case you didn't already know.
