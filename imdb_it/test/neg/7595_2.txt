This film is a clumsy mixture of various conventions about ghosts and suspense-thrillers, none of which is fully realized and all rather irritating. The script was superficial. The acting, ditto. The scary FXs were mostly ridiculous except for an exquisite moment of bouncing the seat that scared me even though I saw it arrive a mile away. Now, explain to me someone you would need ghosts, black magic, ritual arcane objects, Count Crapula CG, black men, psychic investigators, family curses and Irish superstitions, and milk bowls left for supernatural , And the dolly possessed, all in the same film? With all that you would expect more than a good moment of horror, but this film is lame, lame, lame.
