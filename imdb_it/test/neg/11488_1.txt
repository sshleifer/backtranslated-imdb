I would like to say something different about this film. I have seen comments on how beautiful Russia is and Russia's opinions have been fantastic. Hey guys this is not Russia, it's the most specific Bulgaria in the capital Sofia. So this is not Russia, it's my country. Regarding the film - well in Bulgaria, maybe with the exception of the Gray Zone - all the films of American directors are in a horrible word like this, of course. Too bad that Patrick Swayze has to play such cheap films. Most of the actors are Bulgarians, but in reality this film has no plot, no energy, what can I say: a weak and boring film, a clich√© no more. Hey people remember that it's not Russia, it's actually Bulgaria.
