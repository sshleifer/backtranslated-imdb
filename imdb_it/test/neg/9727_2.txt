I feel very generous giving this movie a 2 out of 10. Okay, I noticed that the special effects are, 'okay' and Renny Harlin made one of my favorite genetically-modified-attack-to-search-station movies, what you might know as Deep Blue Sea. Also, the opening titles are done quite well with a remix of "more human and human" than WhiteZombie and they go quite well with what is in the context of this "movie". But praise enough, let's see why this movie is so wrong. <br /> <br /> Since I played Uwe Boll's Alone in the Dark, I've always had the feeling that the special effects of a movie were totally wasted. Okay, our story begins with four boys who are descendants of four different families, each of whom has a power that is never fully explained by a family background that has never been fully explained that has made an art that has never been fully explained as a witch. right, these are all 17 descendants, they all go to the same school, they are all on the swim team and everyone, for one reason or another, sits in bed with shirts, sweating and talking to each other on the phone. nothing against gays, gothic or thirteen-year-olds, but this is what this film is aimed at ... 13-year-old goths who question their sexuality. Yes, there are girls in it who sit on their beds in their panties or something else, but why don't they take off their shirts? It's just his fair. <br /> <br /> However, the characters in this film say that when they turn 18 they will ascend and receive new, almost godlike, deep powers. But before going any further, I forgot to mention that when they use their powers, they age slowly and become more dependent on it. This explains why they had people in the late 1920s to play at 17. Oh, and if something needs explanation, don't worry, someone will explain it all in one big dialogue. God, this movie sucks ... where was I? oh yes, the ascension part. <br /> <br /> Ok, apparently there was a super-secret alpha-one family that others forgot, or something like that, I don't know, I was dozing at this point. But some have been written about how and the new child at school who befriends the group is "secretly" one of these descendants of the fifth family. And I say "secretly" because anyone who has seen any of the previews of this film knows that this new type is the villain. He has greater power than the others because he is older, I think. However, Bob Loblaw (he says it aloud) things happen and we get to the final battle in the movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was the whole game for a battle of witches. You know how Saurmon versus Gandalf or something like that with the magical battle, because you know, it's about witches and things. Now, when these two witches throw down, it's more like ... how can I say ... a very, very disgusting version of a Dragonball Z type battle. They throw things at each other, talk, throw stuff, talk, throw stuff, talk, etc. When I say "throw stuff" I only say this because I have no idea what the F #% k are throwing at each other. Looks like big drops of slimy water. God, this movie sucks, however, when our main witch 'ascends' doesn't become very powerful. He just throws big drops of slimy water. Things happen and ends in a way that you, as the viewer, know will end. The good witch wins the evil witch. <br /> <br /> You know how bad a movie is when the bad guy says something so incredibly stupid as, "I'll make you my Wiotch" That's where I wanted to punch myself in the face to sit through all this ... thing. <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit, the thought of the witches who are fighting, using the powers on the modern day seems a bit cold, but when the execution is this bad, I really wanted them not to make this film . Maybe if he was R-rated, I had tits and threw more deaths with a pinch of blood, it could have worked ... could have worked. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in watching this, do not buy it or even rent it. Wait for it to arrive on TV or borrow it from your lover of a friend who bought it. Don't waste time with this movie trick. If you spend money on this, there is a good chance that you will make an effort to follow up with Uwe Boll called, The Covenant 2: Alone in the Dark with the House of the Dead.
