BOOOOOOOORRRRRINNGGGGGGGG and STOOOOOOOPIDDDDD. Kept asleep. If you want to see Miles O'Keefe wandering around in a hairy Speedo, rent this movie. If not, don't disturb yourself ... Rife with anachronisms. Should it be set in the Ice Age, the Iron Age, the Steel Age or the Age of Reason? What was the reason for the black nylon wig on the boy dressed as Genghis Khan? Did that really have to be Genghis Khan? If Ator had access to so much advanced technology and science, why did we wait another 1000 years for Leonardo? It is never clear where Ator comes from or if he should be a superior type of being. You wonder if everything was explained in the first film, but after seeing this you know that you will never worry.
