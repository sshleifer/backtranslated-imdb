I have rarely seen such an annoying action / suspense movie. None of the action scenes is exciting, the plot is nothing special and, with the exception of a couple of actors, the acting is very bad. Charlie Sheen (Platoon, Major League) plays the Chief of Staff of the White House, who is in the midst of a conspiracy that wants him and more people dead. Donald Sutherland (A Time to Kill, Fallen) plays a friend who tells all he can and Linda Hamilton (Linda Hamilton, Terminator, Dante's Peak) plays a reporter who gets involved in the situation. Charlie Sheen is OK as the protagonist, Donald Sutherland is a good actor who offers a good performance. Linda Hamilton gives a poor performance. With a bad movie, I really like it if it has a good ending, but this movie has a very rough ending with some almost ridiculous stuff.
