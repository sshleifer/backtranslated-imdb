On the advice of a friend and my admiration for Philip Baker Hall, I rented the first seasonal Loop album. It is a typical television comedy with all the clich√©s that the genre uses with the "extravagant" intriguing brother (Sully), "ditzy" blonde (Lizzy), token unrequited love interest (Piper), sarcastic Asian helper (Darcy, who reminded me Arliss, as if someone needed to be reminded of THAT show). The plot deals with various misfortunes (usually of Sully) that happen to Sam who puts his work on the plane in danger, only to have saved the day, with "hilarious hijinks" that are in the middle. I haven't described a certain episode. I have described them ALL to a T. This is the problem because what might seem passable entertainment at first becomes uselessly stale when you look at episodes in a row and grow bored beyond all imagination to endless repetition. Sully will do something "extravagant", Mimi Rogers will say something overtly sexual, Russ will talk about his gay son, Darcy will do his imitation of Sandra Oh on Arliss bla bla bla bla bla. The only positive thing is the lack of an annoying laugh. But don't be fooled into thinking it's a good thing. Go and watch a much better play. Arrested Development, Always Sunny in Phillidelphia, two names two on top of my head. Surprised that this is still on the air. OH, it's true, Fox only cancels the good shows, I forgot. Needless to say, I no longer trust my friend's tastes in the shows. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
