Most movies can sit me easily, although I don't particularly like the film. I'm the kind of person who recognizes great movies even if I don't like the genre. This is the first movie I couldn't bear to watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is ok (Myers is as good as the cat, it's just that it's REALLY annoying). The silly songs that cats sang were boring and monotonous, even for the children of the audience. The plot goes on indefinitely, and viewers must suffer due to poor dialogue. The "witty" genial remarks are disgusting, not amusing (I remember a horrible comment on a garden hoe compared to, well, a type of person that people call "ho"). Although the film is really short, it seems to last FOREVER. Do not waste your time. I know little kids who hate this movie. If children can't stand it, I don't know how adults can do it. I would like to film more about this film, but I don't even want to waste time writing this review about it. I HAD IT! So, in summary, don't spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! Watch a good movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars - the lowest review I've ever seen in a movie.
