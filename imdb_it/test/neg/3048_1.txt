For once I will watch a film that completely surprises me. One that comes out of nowhere to be some exciting entertainment. One that is pure fun from beginning to end. Well folks, when A Stranger Calls is NOT that movie. It is an incredible, stupid and far-fetched remake of the best classic of the horror field of 1979. Our heroine protagonist, Jill, is forced to babysit after spending the minutes of her cell phone and is annoyed by the calls of a mysterious caller. Every clich√© in the world is used here by the stupid cat-jumping-out-of-a-hidden-spot for the car that won't start the killer can be anywhere and anytime. This film is bad ... not even bad in a "so bad is a good way" more in a "so ugly is the boring way". Skip this crazy movie and save your movie for something else. You'll thank me later, trust me on this. Degree: D-
