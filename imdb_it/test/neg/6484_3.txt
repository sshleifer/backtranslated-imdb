The 1988 Royal Rumble bored me damn well. The roar itself is pretty quiet, full of mid carders, and a winner that didn't really make any sense in winning, and why the main event of The Young Stallions vs. The Islanders? half the crowd is gone. Jessie Ventura looks bored, through half of it, and it can be said that when she mentions she finds the development of Hogan Vs Andre more interesting. McMahon and Ventura don't have the chemistry of Gorilla and Jessie. <br /> <br /> Ricky Steamboat Vs Ravishing Rick Rude. Heavily disappointing game, with too many rest breaks and too slow, sinking this. When he recovers like a madman in the last 5 minutes, he is too small, too late. Steamboat wins by DQ. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> The next is Dino Bravo who tries to set a new bench record, with Ventura seeing him. Horrendous segment, with no entertainment value what so ever. Ventura is not enough to carry this segment, and even McMahon admitted that it was boring. Controversy or not, I lost enough time for this shit. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Woman's Tag Team Championship. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 3 falls. <br /> <br /> The Glamor Girls | C | / W Jimmy Hart. Vs The Jumping Bomb Angels. This is the best game of the night, no I'm not kidding! Very exciting stuff for female wrestling, and you will hardly be able to find such good things, now a day. The Angels Jumping Bombs were over, and the crowd went to the monkey to win the title. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Signature of the contract between Hulk Hogan and Andre The Giant. Hogan has a decent pop, but there are some obvious boos for him, probably because he is in Canada. A little too tight for my taste, but it was necessary for the plot. He got his point of view, and had some effective moments, but many times, I kept saying "Go ahead with it". They both sign, and Andre slams Hogan's head on the table and pushes him against the table. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Royal Rumble Match. Very weak real rumble, probably due to an awkward rhythm and the true lack of stellar power. I think Vince was testing the waters with this, and this showed. Ventura seems not interested, and I don't blame him. Crowd clearly wanted Roberts to win, screaming DDT almost every 5 minutes he was, and while Duggan got a good pop, I don't think he was the winner they wanted, and where did he take his career? Nowhere. Bret's first Royal Rumble, and made an impressive demonstration. It wasn't terrible, but it was rather dull, and it didn't have enough to make the show, considering that this was the show it was based on. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Hogan has an interview with Craig DeGeorge. Hulkster's standard interview, but not with the same folly, and the outrageous remarks he usually takes. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Ted and Andre are interviewed. Andre states that he will hand over the championship to Mr. Dibiase. Short but effective. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> 2 on 3 Falls. <br /> <br /> The Islanders Vs The Young Stallions. The crowd is completely dead for this, and half of them are posted to the exit. It is rather boring and has had no interest in the main event. Jessie and Vince look bored and discuss other things while the game is in progress. Icelanders win, taking advantage of Roma's injury. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. I imagine historically important, but there is really nothing to see here. This was just a starting point for great things for The Royal Rumble, and while you can see glimpses of potential here, there is nothing here, going out of your way to see. I usually recommend everything once for Die Hard Wrestling fans, and considering it's the 1st Royal Rumble event, I guess I did, but I'm getting bored a lot of the time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
