This film was terrible. Biblically very inaccurate. Moses was 80 years old when he led people out of Egypt, the film has about forty. Moses was about forty years old when he fled from Egypt, he left for forty years and was with them to wander for forty years. Moses was 120 years old when he died and was denied the privilege of crossing the promised land. I realize that the films use a lot of "poetic license" because the biblical account is not so long, but, if you make a biblical film, they still have to reflect the known facts and keep the general taste of the main character of the Bible, this film fails in this aspect, and in many others. Although even the 1956 version has its problems, theatrically it was much better.
