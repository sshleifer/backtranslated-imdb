AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHEN IS THE STOPPED STOP? This is what I said somewhere between the beginning and the other part of the movie that he really sucked. This movie almost destroyed my whole life and I sat in some really bad movies. Coming from a true Puppet Master fan, I would expect to hear this, but it's true. The plot is inane, the special effects are horrible, the soundtrack is the most benawl, the infernal gossip I've ever heard. Oh! I almost forgot about acting, it was so bad that I forgot it was there for nothing, he said. The only saving factor in the film are the same puppets that are really the stars and could start all but Guy Rolfe (he is the puppeteer) and although you can see their threads and threads, they take me for all the painful beginning finish of Retro-Puppet Master. In closing, PM7 is recommended for true fanatics who are masochists. <br /> <br /> Roach <br /> <br />
