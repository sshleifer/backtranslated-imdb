Why worry, ITV? Of course, Mansfield Park is the most difficult of the "get" novels, and Fanny is certainly the most difficult to love, but ... If someone takes it, then he will have the courage to risk being faithful to the book and his spirit rather complicated. And for heaven's sake, have the courage to throw Fanny as it was written: a wicked little dog, kindhearted, very sweet! Mrs Norris was not as horrible as it should have been. And what the hell happened in Portsmouth? The contrast between Fanny's rather questionable family and family home and the splendor of Mansfield is the key to so many aspects of Henry's rejection of Fanny, his uncle's rejection, Henry's transformation into a good person, etc. . Etc. the complexity and challenges of the novel, why did they take the trouble? It is beyond my possibilities ...
