This is without doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. I say this without hyperbole and, believe me, I've seen a lot of bad movies. It's embarrassing and annoying that millions of dollars have gone into this film and that hundreds (thousands?) Of artisans have spent so much time working on what writers and producers SHOULD have known would be a colossal failure. <br /> <br /> When a 90-minute movie looks so long, pulled out, boring and incomprehensible, you know something went wrong somewhere. Furthermore, Jamie Kennedy (whose work I liked elsewhere) is simply terrible in this role; obviously it has never been subjected to a screen test, because no sane producer would consider it funny in any way, especially in the role of The Mask. Simply horrible. <br /> <br /> Personally, I can't wait to see the reviews of the major film critics, because I know they are doing a better job than me in tearing this messy train to shreds. /> <br /> The producers of this film should be embarrassed and, more importantly, they will never be able to make cinema films again.
