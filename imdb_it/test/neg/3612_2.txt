A group of tourists is stuck on Snake Island after an unfortunate accident with their boat. They are forced to spend the night and as you probably suspected, it's not called Snake Island because it's just so much fun to say - it has a history of people disappearing one by one because of the large snake population, which is exactly what happens with these poor mute souls. This is a very boring and typical film with tons of off-screen snake attacks and bad performance by NONE actors. The only quite funny scene was an absolutely useless and forced strip scene that is nothing that you can't see in a PG13 rated movie, folks. If you like snake movies, check out SSSSSSS, but don't torture yourself with this shit.
