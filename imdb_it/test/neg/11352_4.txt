"You can survive everything." Anything but a stupid horror movie. The director could not even decide if he wanted a demon or just a simple serial killer. You can't have both. It is as if Michael Moore tried to have his cake and he ate it (or in his case of 1500 cakes) making his particular charlatan brand of "docu-comedies": they had to be oh-so hilarious and crazy, yet you treat them as documentaries based on truth, shocking, incisive. Some genres cannot be mixed. <br /> <br /> "Anything can happen to anyone, at any time, in any place." (Translation: this is the horror genre , so we can do any kind of nonsense we want.) This sounds not so much like something "wise" found on a sheet of a Chinese fortune cookie, but more like the creed of every bad horror filmmaker. phrase that was served to us, a kind of preparation / justification of the absurd buffoonery that will come. <br /> <br /> "My phone does not work!" Well, of course it is not. greater than Sean's brain Penn begins to function (after decades of catatonic apathy) of what a horror film cell phone does. The single most depressing and predictable horror cliché of the last ten years. Why even say it? We know that help will never come through a phone call, so you idiot magicians might just not mention it. The last 50 horror movies I've seen use this plot device. It's getting embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "You should always expect the unexpected." The last turn was rather surprising, I'll give them so much ... However, a lot of nonsense along the way. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the elaborate traps that heroin creates with the speed of a drug addict -up rat - in cold, wet and almost totally dark conditions. I love the realism of the horror film ... <br /> <br /> When a bloodthirsty demon starts trying to be funny ("shshshing" his victims), then you know that your pleasure of watching the horror is in doubt. The least said for the old "cracking wise" geezer, the best ... Another stupid cliché served by a tired, lazy, uninspired director. <br /> <br /> What are the chances of being attacked by your husband and then by a demon who hates his eyes - on the same day? "Expect the unexpected". They might even have gotten into an event where they survive a plane crash, and then another where they meet the aliens who tried to probe it ... <br /> <br /> The fast forward button needs a temple or sanctuary built in its image.
