Looking at this and that for some seasons, two things come to mind: one - wondering what kind of girl a "model" wants to be and two - running to the nearest ice cream shop and having a low-fat ice cream. /> <br /> I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of ​​this reality show contest. No other "famous" model has thought of this, and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do it. But as the series goes on and on, I came to the conclusion that this is a large part of the people trying to make a mountain from a mole. Women shouldn't look at this, kids should stay away from this unless they're reporting on the subject. <br /> <br /> Many women try out for the slots to compete for "Americas Next Top Model". They live together, they fight together, they cry together, they go through useless modeling shootings with useless modellers and modellers and they are eliminated and almost all claim: "I'll see you again". Hell, I'm trying to see what happened to those who actually won. <br /> <br /> This is the dream of some girls, and good for them. Watching this I hope the other girls see this and run like Hades on the other side - like in college. <br /> <br /> I happened to look more of this recent season due to the "stratagem" of full figurative models joining the group. This made me think of something very sorry. The "full-figure models" were nothing more than average-sized women competing with what I think is the thinnest group of models they have ever chosen, so obviously they would make them even fatter - a "stratagem" fashion you use always. Bad, bad, Tyra and crew. <br /> <br /> But to be honest, "Americas Next Top Model" is not about "full-figure" models, but projects an image imagined as a beauty that can be sold in bulk and sold as the top of the beauty - and this show is only looking for the next piece of fresh meat to add to the mix. Hence the name of the show. Hence the desperate part of judges, photographers, associations. So Tyra and his consistent "this is me" plug every corner of the camera you can get. But then again, this is the only thing I like about this show - the former model that gives others that they would not have had the chance - the possibility of entering the doors. But after ... everything else is a status quo for that industry, which is why there are no weekly surprises or interests in the program.
