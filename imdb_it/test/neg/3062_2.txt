Wow, it's really amazing that something so bad can really be done. I'm giving this movie a 2 because it's so ugly that it has some kind of appeal. It is so bad that it is comical and has some entertainment value. Moreover, there is a bit of free nudity and this is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> So where do I start. Acting is beyond terrible, it's like you're watching a high school film shot. Theresa Russell must have done something really bad for having been forced to make this movie and her acting reflects how happy she is to be in the middle of this mess. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is simply stupid with the casting of Dan Cortese as FBI agent, the icing on top of this piece of shit. His acting made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> As for the script and direction, C. Courtney Joyner and Mark L. Lester should simply be pulled back and fired.
