Probably the greatest thing about Wild Ribelli that wounds him most is the hero. LOSER wrote everything about him, but this does not prevent him from "taking the girl". Probably one of the worst drivers in the world imaginable, he decides to stop running after dropping his car. Well, his new job is still in the running, as a group of types of bikers choose him to drive their escape car while committing crimes. There is nothing that makes you really dear to Rod, even the situation in which he was thrown is rather stupid. Finally, in the lighthouse scene, you want Rod to be killed with all the bikers. Take this: they shot him twice, once in the arm and once in the leg, and he can still crawl up the stairs a little. If only Jeeter had a better goal ... <br /> <br /> Avoid it, unless you are looking at the MST3K version.
