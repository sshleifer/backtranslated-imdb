The book, although not particularly beautiful, was decent, but this film completely changes it. Many of the elements of the story are consistent between the book and the film, but the character of Dr. Ross derives from a creatively written character who lives for money and ends up causing the volcanic eruption with his heart-on-her greed -the young maid in distress who will do nothing if she accepts the slightest indication that she could be less than noble. When movies change the book a lot but keep the same name, it should be a crime.
