The Mystery Science Theater 3000 would not have been able to bring any saving qualities to a demonstration of this "gem". <br /> <br /> This is like a pirated copy of the 80s classic that you could have bought on VHS from a 42nd arcade. before Disney bought the whole smash and closed them all. <br /> <br /> But wait: all the sex scenes have been cut. I challenge anyone to find a worse movie. This film could replace water-boarding as a method of human interrogation. <br /> <br /> No, I take it back: I would prefer water boarding. <br /> <br /> The only merit of this film, besides being the worst film ever made, would be to threaten the Middle East in solving its problems under the pain of having to watch this movie.
