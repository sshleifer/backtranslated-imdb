The violent sequel to RoboCop was directed by Irvin Kershner (Never Say Never Again, The Empire Strikes Back) will never be as good as the original, because it is almost devoid of humor, and is extremely petty, and should have been ranked NC-17, due to scenes with children involved in the shootings, people threatening to brutally kill very young babies with REAL automatic weapons, and even scenes with a twelve-year-old who used a lot of explicit vulgar expressions, giving drugs to a lot of people at random, shooting and shooting graphically and killing SWAT policemen and officers, opening fire to police officers when a lot of small and small children are present, and a whole group of children use bad words and beats the shop owner (which is a very old man) from an electronics store and steal and destroy many items there. This film gives new meaning to the term "terribly petty", but the effects and action sequences are incredibly incredible. Overall, an OK movie.
