I saw the * star * of this movie on The Daily Show and I thought I could tune in (the film was premiered on Comedy Central, then it went to theaters). Oh Vey! <br /> <br /> This makes "Shakes the Clown" as "Citizen Kane"! Avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs. Not a laugh, not even a smile. This film will bring your face out in pimples and your eyes will burst like the last remants of "Raiders". I can't even think of a worse movie, whether it's "Manos" or "Ishtar". While the Pythons nodded, ran away, ran away! Why did someone light green unless they used their money? The horror is that there is NOT a good line, not a good joke, and only ONE bad thing ... the making of this film. <br /> <br /> I feel that, if done correctly, this would have been fun. As it is, I need a new pancreas to vomit so hard. Damn anyone involved in this parody.
