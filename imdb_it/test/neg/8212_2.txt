The idea behind "Dungeon of Harrow" is not bad at all. However, acting is bad. Lighting is bad Music is bad Torture scenes are without emotion. There is really not much to recommend this film. You know what kind of movie you are for when the credits say "Special Guest Star" and lists someone you've never heard of. He could also say "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln". because there is really no one in this movie that you can identify. There are one or two decent moments, mostly towards the end and I think the basic plot pattern may have contained an original idea, but this alone is not enough to keep you awake through this otherwise inept yawn.
