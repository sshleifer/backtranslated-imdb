Only 11 people have reviewed it here on IMDb 11 years after the release of this film. There is a reason for this total lack of interest in Across the Moon. It is consistent, but lacks all the cinematographic virtues. Watch this movie for examples of terrible production in all respects. The opening titles, for example, are white letters that mechanically rise from a red background. The finale features Michael McKean staring at a prison window saying "There are many mysteries out there". followed by a clip / music video editing of all the edifying moments of the tragically bad film. Julinana Hatfield. Everything is terrible in between. I struggled to find any value in this film and went out empty. Although it's hard to believe, even a cameo role from Burgess Meridith (always a pleasure for the crowd) disappointed me further. This film is like a mockery of what is special about movies. On paper the film is below average. Women living together in a trailer. But what was actually produced was almost unwatchable. The film tries to branch out in many directions but never follows it. The unattractive conflict of having their boyfriends in prison has never been resolved. No conflict has ever been resolved. There is really no conflict. Women try to become prostitutes, but it never happens. Instead they get jobs like baristas and warehouse workers. Sounds exciting? IT was not. It was stupid. And most of the film is the two women who talk and generate a forced conflict. Women are capable actresses, but the script was above average. Unnecessary. This was a terrible movie, but it's even worse that they destroyed Burgess Meridith outside his retirement home to make it. Bad from start to finish. Like the toothless lion, this film didn't bite.
