Synopsis Correction: the finale does not show Ben on an online cruise for boys. He is looking for Arabic language courses at San Francisco's Presido Military Acadamy. Perhaps to join the war in Iraq as a translator, (FYI - many of the dishonorable discharges of "D'ont ask D'ont tell were translators (they are now the main shortages) Ben also spoke in Russian. A good life capsule in Manhatten but a bit of non-reality here, especially a good laugh at Lame's social skills and the sad portrait of "Grown" twenty years that don't go beyond the college party mode - change scene in Manhatten (somehow always remains near the edge of the same BS) Watch together the films "Englishman in New York" "and" The New Twenty "Both good for nostalgia. I think the movie" twenty "shows how far the rough between gay and straight is as evolved. <br /> <br /> These two films are GAY Time Travel For Sure !!!! ENJOY
