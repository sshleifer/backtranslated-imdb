It was badly shot. Sounds like an urgent job, last-minute casting is obvious. The writing is very weak. Good for the stage, not for the film. I feel bad for Andrew McCarthy. He's a very good actor who hasn't had good roles lately. This role was not for him. Perhaps happy that it was collected again. In the festival circuit this film must remain.
