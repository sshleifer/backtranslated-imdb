Although the figures are higher in proportion to other areas of society, I do not object to extremely high salaries for many of today's entertainers and athletes. <br /> <br /> A-Rod, LeBron or Brady all have offers well with 8 digits, or the low-9 area. Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld could actually become billionaires from their shows, huge residues and taxes they currently require. Even their cast members and all "Friends" have reached about 7 digits per episode. Letterman's earnings for a show could solve most people's financial problems, and a week or two take care of many for life. <br /> <br /> But all of these are based on solid supply / demand principles and the financial advantages they bring to their employers. And all ably perform their skills. <br /> <br /> But then someone like Rachel Ray arrives, reaching a level of earnings far beyond any apparent level of talent or skill. I find it acute, annoying and with a forced "perkiness" that is as fake as the proverbial "3 dollar bill". <br /> <br /> A friend of mine is responsible for special meetings, events and convention plans for his company and its affiliates. One of the main sources of talent has hundreds of customers available from the $ 5-10K level, to a handful that earns $ 200K more in appearance. (This area includes Trump, Seinfeld, Lance Armstrong, Robin Williams and, no joke, Larry the Cable Guy.) <br /> <br /> There are a greater number in the $ 100.001 - 200,000 range; the list included people like Bill Cosby, Steve Martin and even Cable Guy Larry benefactor Jeff Foxworthy. <br /> <br /> This category includes Rachael Ray. I suppose I must admit that there may be enough demand for his "talent" and his offers to justify his talk show and there may be some out there who will pay more than $ 100K, + first class flight, hotel suites, all expenses and limousines door-to-door, only for a couple of hours of his plaintive chatter during their organization's event. <br /> <br /> I just can't understand how this could be possible.
