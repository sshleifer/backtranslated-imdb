Gordon Scott has made some good Tarzan movies, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> While I was watching him, wincing for the bad guys, obviously the inner sets and the clonking sounds of empty wood as they walked through presumably dirty paths, I hummed in the bad dialogue and worse acting in the supporting cast, I kept thinking : "Sheesh! This is the TV show level!" Then I find out that they were, in effect, three TV series pilot episodes woven into one. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Scott go out (alone), away from the lame sets, in some of the scenes; and the struggles have very nice moves ... but oh, ouch and ouch as for dialogue. And did I mention acting? Heck, Cheetah (or "Cheta" in this version) was a better actor than most humans. <br /> <br /> And it's not saying much. <br /> <br /> It's kind of a point to see a young Sherman (ie Scatman) Carothers acting as a native. But probably not worth the investment in total time.
