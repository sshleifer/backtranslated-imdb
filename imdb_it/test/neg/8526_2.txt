This film was trying to do something, but it failed miserably. All the suspense attempts were cheap, and there were so many tired tricks and plot holes that I ended up laughing and making fun of everything else. At least I was entertained. <br /> <br /> Ghosts are trying to warn the family, so why they attack the girl, whose name I didn't like to remember. And what was with black and white at the beginning? I know what they were trying to do, but they fell very low. And where does this guy (John Corbett's character) come from? It just makes a waltz from no where in a vast field. And why did he suddenly lose it again when the ravens arrived? And if the crows were a manifestation of the spirits of his family, then why did they attack him if they made him try to kill the family? It does not make sense. So many things in this movie don't make sense, and the acting isn't too cute for the girl's main character. It's not terrible, just like his children's movies. <br /> <br /> So all in all, this film wasn't brilliant, but I enjoyed tearing it, and sometimes that's all a horror movie has to do. Rental for non-quality entertainment.
