Even with its limited budget, this film could have been worth looking at if there was a story to tell here. It started pretty well, and quite engaging and credible. The actors and characters were interesting even though there was not much character development. My favorite scene was when everyone ate their rations. Some seemed to hate him, and some seemed to think it wasn't too bad. The story begins very airtight. And then ... <br /> <br /> And then he immersed himself in a little horror that is usually a death sentence for most sci fi. Suddenly no scientific basis for any of the current events. No real credible game ending for the bad guy? No real explanation of what's going on. Generally, if a movie has to use the word F for every other word, it usually goes down from there. I still offend believe it or not. I often wonder what drives people to make bad sciences? Isn't there a universe of fantastically good stories out there? People don't feel that they are wasting their time and everybody's when they put out things like that. Why do we take so much mediocre trifles like this? Not even female actors / characters? Just anybody? This had the makings of another "Predator" but unfortunately it went very far. <br /> <br /> My final comment - poor editing and finally a budget too low to build a real bonfire? What does it give? <br /> <br /> My advice for all the low-budget science fiction film production companies around. Make sure you have a good story before you start, and change the bad special effects - it's better not to see anything about something that looks fake or ridiculously vague.
