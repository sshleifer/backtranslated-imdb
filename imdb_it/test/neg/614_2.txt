hey ... I really don't know why this movie was appreciated so much, maybe I missed the point. The way I see it, many international directors have made brilliant films that have tackled "schizophrenia" and informed, excited, shocked, evoked and forced public emotion to step aside from their own reality and to think ....... .. while it is true that the company of aparna sen was ambitious, in light of all the other films, this falls short ..... miserably ...... it was too slow, there were no details on anything and the ending .... it was completely ... useless ...... it wasn't open ended or anything else .... just useless ..... so look at it if you want to see a good concept completely wasted ... ....
