I don't understand why anyone wastes their time or money in total trash like this ... Don't get me wrong - I LOVE a good Western - Notice I said "GOOD" - this is just trash <br /> <br /> Acting is horrible - Val Kilmer must know someone or owe a favor or something to them just to use his face and his name in this ridiculous piece of shit ... <br /> <br /> To those of you who liked this movie, I'm making a list of your names to make sure you DON'T look at everything you suggest - our tastes are definitely different, yet it's your right to express your opinion, no matter how far away from the base it is. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a 2 in case they threw out all of one and didn't count them .... Just bad in the whole area ...
