Hard to believe that the director Barbet Schroeder once did the majestic and very funny Maitresse (1976), and now he seems to do only "by the numbers" of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This is very light material by John Grisham, crossed with the plot of a TV movie. Bullock is Cass Mayweather, an aggressive criminal investigator specializing in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is his police partner Sam Kennedy, and together they form an uncomfortable couple. Not good, when two unbalanced university maladriots (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them on a wild chase - planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene. <br /> <br /> Fair enough, but while Bullock and Chaplin can't create any spark, we also have to endure several overly melodramatic boring flashbacks that illustrate an important event in the history of Cass. Then, of course, there are frequent shots of a cabin in a cliff, where there is no doubt that the OTT ending will be set. Oooh ... the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Look at each CSI episode instead. It is to the point and much more exciting.
