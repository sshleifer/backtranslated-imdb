Oh. Good. I saw this title on television and I thought "I have to watch this movie, snatch Snakes On A Plane, it will be terrible but I hope also ridiculous. Well, I had half of everything. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly bad and unfortunately not even unintentionally exhilarating. It's just ugly. Even worse, it takes almost an hour to get to something that looks like the action. For the first half of the film we have to endure a bit of a foreign language (Mexican or Spanish, an apology because of my ignorance) and a terrible acting while some women vomit up live snakes for reasons we only find out later, then we have to endure even more terrible acting, and we find that those who mumble in the foreign language could still speak English, because snakes finally come off on the train and things go from sedate to ridicule. <br /> <br /> Low-budget doesn't always mean "bad" but, in this case, it does. films without any thought, a terrible script, a bad cast and not even the sense of capitalizing on them very few strengths. I give two brands for some decent special effects and a whacky ending but that still seems a bit too generous. Avoid if you can. <br /> <br /> See this if you like: Stagknight, The Wicker Man remake, terrible CGI.
