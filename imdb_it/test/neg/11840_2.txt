The plot of this film is a clich√© and obviously was torn from Jurassic Park. The filmmakers didn't even try to hide it. It seems that there was not enough budget to create decent dinosaur dolls, so instead the viewer sees some robot-like toy dinosaurs (from an inexpensive toy store) that move in a very unnatural way. It's funny, because it's so ugly. The acting is almost as unnatural as the dinos are. No one seems really excited about being in this movie (which I fully understand). Especially the last half hour is extremely boring and it's almost impossible to look at it without falling asleep. The only positive note I would like to make about "Raptor" is that it does not take 90 minutes.
