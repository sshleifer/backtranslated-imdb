Please ... if anyone has the chance to read this BEFORE watching the movie, if it can be called that, refrain from it ... don't waste time !!!! I also watched this movie right after finishing the book, and I was seriously disappointed ... the main character is basically a new Fanny invented, because it shows no resemblance to the book ... it's so lively and laughs all over time ... if there was one thing the author wanted to do was that he was a very shy and introverted character .... please !!!!! All the most important parts of the story, which should lead to the heppy ending, are not simply taken into consideration ... and the rest is compensated !!! I think it's better to use the time to read a little of the novel or just do nothing.
