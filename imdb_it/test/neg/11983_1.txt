It's not too good a movie. Sure, it contains action, but the effects aren't all that good for a 2008 film. The firearm effects are downright horrible. Acting is "meh" <br /> <br /> It's nothing like Far Cry, in addition to the names and basics of the story (genetically enhanced super soldiers running around). The super soldiers are very different, the mercenaries are different, the setting is completely different (the tropical island in the Pacific in the game, the island in North America in the film). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed playing Cry. I loved the story and the setting. I hated the movie
