This is a horror film based on the numbers with Richard Crenna and Joanna Pettet as a psychologist who buys and old dwelling and invites a small crew of friends and patients to contribute to the cleanliness of the place. Unbeknownst to them, the villa houses a cellar door - the door to hell. If you fancy a clich√© horror movie, look no further, but if you want something inventive, then you won't like this little movie. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (Quite subdued, even if the scene where a guy cuts his hand with a saw - rather grisly than your mind. Fans of inventive death scenes won't appreciate this as every character seems to be electrocuted in some way). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $ (Nothing to talk about. Mary Louise Weller adds good looks but her character was underdeveloped). <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (Cliched, but still worthy of view. This offers nothing new to the genre but the casting of Victor Buono - which is as threatening as a Santa department store - seems to have attracted a some spectators. <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$ (The best performances are by Crenna and Pettet with the other actors simply by "phoning" their roles: the writer is unable to develop characters outside the character of Pettet and seems to have forgotten Mary Louise Weller (Animal House) which disappears for about twenty minutes and re-emerges only to be electrocuted like all the others in a boring way).
