This could be all you need to know to decide if you want to see it. <br /> <br /> The film is ugly. Really, really bad. And sometimes he seems to be aware of it and make fun of how bad it is. It aligns clichés after clichés and even manages to get worse, while being accompanied by moments that are ugly enough to be hilariously fun. <br /> <br /> If you can laugh really poorly in writing scripts and production values, you might enjoy yourself. Otherwise prepared for some serious brain damage. <br /> <br /> 3/10
