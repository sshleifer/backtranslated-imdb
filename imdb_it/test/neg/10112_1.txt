Hey boys and girls! Never rent, or God forbid, buy this piece of junk. I have rarely seen a film of a genre as bad as this. The acting is actually worse than me and my friends when we were 7 and in the 1st grade we had to act in front of all the parents and brothers. In fact, we would have been considered for the Oscars, if we had been compared to the actors of Darkhunters. The story is terrible, the trick is terrible, the shooting is terrible, the set is terrible, the direction is terrible, etc. I can't find ANYTHING the money spent to watch this movie .. Maybe except all the cats, that my girlfriend thought was pretty. Please use your money on other things rather than this movie ... I couldn't even see the last 15-20 minutes of the movie, it was terrible .. If someone really liked this movie, I'd really like to hear it, and I'll try to see if I can give you a consultation in a psychiatrist's office near you .. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10, actually below if possible.
