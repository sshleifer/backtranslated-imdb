So I was excited about my Snakes on a Plane weekend, we wanted more after the movie. Why not snakes on a train? How bad it could be, his snakes probably kill people on trains. The snakes must have been rattlesnakes. First of all my friends and I thought that snakes were harmless garden snakes and domestic snakes with the same mushy sound clip. Actually we sat in the middle of the whole thing completely ready to turn it off (we are too lazy to go further and hit the ejection). The next thing we knew we don't know what the hell happened, but something incredibly funny happens at the end. It's one of those endings that you'll rewind a few times just to squeeze the laughter, because you've suffered for so long. <br /> <br /> Last 10 minutes at "8", rest of the movie at 2.
