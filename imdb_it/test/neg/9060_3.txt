It's really a shame that John Candy has wasted his skills on so many horrible movies (Delirious, Wagons East, Who's Harry Crumb? Etc.) This has maybe a few giggles, but mostly it's just bad jokes and physical nonsense. memory of this comedian remembering things like Planes, Trains & Automobiles and Uncle Buck.
