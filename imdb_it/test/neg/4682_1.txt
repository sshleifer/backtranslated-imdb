As I write this user comment, Tim Burton's interpretation of the story Sweeney Todd is making a lot of money at the box office and the film also earned a couple of Oscar nominations if I'm not mistaken. I haven't seen it yet, but I sincerely hope that Burton didn't look for inspiration and / or style marks in Andy Milligan's "old blood butcher". Yes, even though the title distinctly mentions butchers, the main characters in the plot are a barber (the infamous Sweeney Todd) and a female baker. Together they form a vile alliance where he kills customers in his shop and turns bodies into his famous London meat pies. In other words, a premise by Andy Milligan in his most typical, derivative, delusional and amateur aspect. I think IMDb's evaluation for this film speaks for itself. Although the real story is not the worst I've ever seen, Milligan somehow inexplicably attracts ineptitude. The production is a gigantic chaos, with an incoherent narrative structure, a really horrible photograph, poor lighting, bad acting and direction, laughable gore and zilco tension or atmosphere. More than half of the movie is pure padding and the words fail to describe how BORING is the film, even with a run time of only 80 minutes. Ed Wood, Ted V. Mikels and Bruno Mattei; you guys don't need to fear like none other than Andy Milligan is ?? hands down ?? the worst director ever, but I don't think he cared. Perhaps if you have a really high level of tolerance, "Bloodthirsty Butchers" is worth seeing.
