I liked the prequels and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan previously hilarious. RH3, however, was a re-hash of the first two without the charm or humor. I think I might have laughed once - and it was during the NG. Tucker was extremely annoying in this film, and his character seemed to have no other purpose than to smear it all in the most irritating way possible. Chan is always nice, but he seemed tired in this movie. I was able to predict EVERYTHING - who was the bad guy, who was the girl, (SPOILER ALERT) who was the good-turned-bad guy, etc. I hope to see more Tucker and Chan films in their separate efforts, but not in any other Rush Hour sequels. He is simply too tired. I recommend a rent, but not a purchase.
