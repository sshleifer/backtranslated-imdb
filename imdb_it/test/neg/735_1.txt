Terrible, terrible, terrible. The actors are bad, the music is ridiculous and the filming is pathetic. I rented the DVD and had to force myself to watch it until the end. <br /> <br /> My advice: reading the book is much better and you won't have to put up with all these silly images and ridiculous dreams that Catherine has. <br /> <br /> I think I've never seen such a bad movie.
