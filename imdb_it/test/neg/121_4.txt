Isaac Florentine has made some of the best western martial arts action films ever produced. In particular, the United States Seals 2, Cold Harvest, Special Forces and Undisputed 2 are all action classics. You can tell Isaac that he has a real passion for the genre and his films are always lively, creative and fascinating, with some of the best fighting sequences that an action fan could hope for. In particular, he found a muse with Scott Adkins, a talented actor and action actor as one could hope for. This is confirmed by Special Forces and Undisputed 2, but unfortunately The Shepherd is not up to their abilities. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that JCVD ​​looks better here in combat than it did in years, especially in the combat that has (for almost no reason) a prison cell, and in the final showdown with Scott, but look into his eyes. JCVD seems to have died inside. There is nothing in his eyes. It's as if he didn't care about the whole movie. And this is the guiding man. <br /> <br /> There are other obscure aspects of the film, scripted and visually, but the main problem is that you are absolutely unable to empathize with the hero of the film. A pity because I know we all wanted this film to be as special as it could have been. There are some beautiful pieces, mostly the action scenes themselves. This film had an exceptional director and an action choreographer, and a fantastic opponent for JCVD ​​to face. This may have been the only one to bring the star of the veteran action back to the action movie jokes. <br /> <br /> Honestly, a pity that this didn't happen.
