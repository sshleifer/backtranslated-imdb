The Atmosphere and Droll dialogue does not redeem this overrated classic. Boyer is a French thief hidden in the Casbah of Algiers while the police try to figure out how to get him out. Meanwhile, he falls in love with Lamarr and tries to find a way to escape. The film is slow to start and never really goes anywhere. Remembering Casablanca in some way, a broader theme than the sophisticated one that seduces a good woman is completely missing. It's all talk-talk-talk, with endless scenes of Boyer wandering between his idiotic cohorts and Boyer courting Lamarr in the shadows. Personally, for a minute I didn't care about the Boyer character, so the tension was completely non-existent. <br /> <br /> The actors of the 1930s film stumble into the sordid plot of Boyer's henchmen - boys who clearly do not belong to Algiers. Sigrid Gurie is Boyer's jealous and wild girl. Her brazen woman in front of her does not promise anything good for a future she might have with Lamarr. <br /> <br /> Particularly ugly is a long sequence in which a subordinate comes to tell Boyer how another henchman was captured. It sounds exciting ... too bad we didn't see it for ourselves. The ending is completely anticlimatic and seems to be noticeable only because it is not a happy ending to Hollywood; this does not prevent him from being mushy.
