... but obviously I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Now, I never expected to appreciate the first movie. I'm not sure what happens to the marketing group at Disney, but it seems that every trailer they make for an animated film ends up making me too childish, silly or stupid, yet the films themselves are usually anything but. And no film seemed worse to me in The Emperor's New Groove trailers, which is why I was rather surprised to find myself really happy with that movie when I finally broke up and saw it. I entered with zero expectations and I was pleasantly amused. <br /> <br /> Despite the Disney curriculum with direct sequels to the video, I still hoped for a better experience with Kronk here ... but in the end I was nothing but disappointed (and unfortunately not exactly surprised that I felt in that way). There is almost no humor aimed at adults. The original songs are not inspired and unhealthy. The animation, though not bad, does not yet come close to the Emperor (who was not the Lion King to begin with). <br /> <br /> The main plot, as such, is surprisingly "minor" and consists mainly of a mini-story flashback sequence - in fact the thing seemed more like a sequence of pilot episodes for a Saturday morning cartoon series that a single well-designed entity. <br /> <br /> David Spade gets about four lines in the whole movie and there is not even a lot of John Goodman, so overall we were just too much of Patrick Warburton's Kronk - which was fun as a secondary character in the first movie but it's completely inappropriate as the main one bring here. <br /> <br /> Even if the kids might find it a bit funny, the only thing the Kronk Groove has managed to do for me is make me want to go back and look at the far superior original .
