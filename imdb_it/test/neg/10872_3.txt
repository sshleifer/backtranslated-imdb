I've had more boring 80-minute traits in my life, but no one comes to mind right now. Hell Ride is based on the seventieth cult sect that Tarantino reported, and did well, in films like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The problem with Hell Ride is, unlike PF and RD, the plot is garbage and so is the development of the character. How many films does Bishop think he can obviously steal from? The brief case in Pulp Fiction, the air rifle in No Country, etc. Etc. Speaking of Bishop, what the hell is he doing in this movie? I couldn't help but laugh at those scenes in which he is standing with his trusty pelvis, desperately trying to look like an inveterate cyclist. Nothing in this film is credible. And why Dennis Hopper? Did they really need the Easy Rider reason? I blame Larry Bishop for his horrible plot and dialogue, not to mention his failed attempt to be the protagonist. Don't worry about watching this movie, it's a waste of time.
