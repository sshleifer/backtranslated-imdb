A boy, with the unlikely name of Shy Walker, looks for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half. This is the whole plot ... obviously with bad transversal actions. Walker wanders through a corn maze (corn? I understand! HAHAHA ... it's not funny) and shouts "Girls? Where are you?!?" about 1000 times. For some reason, every time he runs from a pumpkin, a Scottish-sounding voice laughs (as if the pumpkin was laughing at him, yes OK ...). His daughters scream for most of the movie ... even when there's no reason to scream (maybe because they're still stuck in this terrible movie?). The twin girls coming out of "The Shining" appear occasionally. Much of the corn maze seems the same, so Walker's search becomes very old very quickly. The filmmakers realize that it is NOTHING going on for this film (even the music is repetitive), so they try to make things interesting by turning the camera very fast, filming upside down, inserting smaller images of the same shot at different angles, using red lights to make the corn look scary and rotate the camera 360 degrees (at least I suppose they were done intentionally but it's probably just examples of incompetent movies). More often than not, when Walker is wandering the maze, you can't see his face. I imagine that the child holding the camera cannot look so high ... This film gives you a new appreciation for the original "Dark Harvest" (which has nothing to do with this film except for the fact that it includes also a wheat field). Don't be fooled by the rating R. Walker says the word F three times and now we have "an R-rated horror movie", ugh. The scarecrow on the cover doesn't even appear in this movie ... and when you want those generous fucks of the first movie to come back, you know that things are going wrong! Instead we get a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero (unfortunately he is dressed similarly to Mr. Walker, so I didn't even realize he would be followed for a while). I discovered the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before Walker did it (the movie is almost finished when he puts 2 and 2 together, natch). The end of the film goes on and on ... and if it's not slow enough, there's a slow movement! The last sound you hear (in addition to your laughter) is a very poor sound. In case you can't say, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. At least they didn't end with the promise of another sequel!
