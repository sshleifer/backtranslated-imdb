I don't know about the real Cobb, but I had the distinct impression that the aim of the filmmakers was to try to soften his jagged outlines and his reputation, not to give us a real portrait of the man himself. In the film, in addition to some racist remarks, he has proven to be just another old, hard-nosed coot full of life (he's so full of life!) With a heart of gold (more or less). This is also the worst acting I've seen T.L. Jones do (he brings nothing new or subtle to his stereotyped character). He can't bring Cobb to life in a way that involves me in the film. Not for a minute did I forget that it was Tommy Lee Jones on the screen pretending to be Ty Cobb. Robert Wuhl didn't impress either. The "comic" elements in this film were simply distracted and did not sound real at all. A damn waste of time, it is
