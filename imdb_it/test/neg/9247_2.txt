I can only name a few films that I saw that were so ugly. This film has something terrible: dialogue is trivial and clich√© ", acting is scarce for the most part with few exceptions, cinematography has nothing to cheer about, and the plot is stupid (A fat woman chases a suburban family because she the daughter didn't make the soccer team. This is so ugly, it's fun to watch. If you can take it all your life, I highly recommend it as a comedy. As for being a serious movie, I'm afraid I will have to evaluate this to 2. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie if you are a serious cinema fan and are looking for an interesting and inspiring storyline or good acting. There is no one to find. <br /> < br /> Edit: Hmmm ... I think a group of people who work all their lives should have written some fake reviews and voted all the negatives. Don't believe them. This is a really lousy movie.
