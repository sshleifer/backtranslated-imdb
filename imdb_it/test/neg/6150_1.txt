Really stronger, I can say that I remember seeing him at the cinema (see how it sticks painfully in his memory) as a 16 year old boy. Mark Hamill was the skywalker of previous generations and he wasn't great, in this he was worse. Plus a soundtrack from Then Jericho AAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH. There is a film as serious as this that I saw in the Arthur 2 on the rocks cinema. Strange how this question "What is the worst movie you've ever seen?" it's easier than "what's the best movie?" which varies incidentally between The Italian Job (original), Untouchables, Casino, Things to do in Denver, Goodfellas (get an idea of ​​what I like ??? - this will fool you!) In search of Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean and Moulin Rouge! Please never watch this movie or it will remain in your memory!
