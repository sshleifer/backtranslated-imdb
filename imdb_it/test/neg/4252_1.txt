A few words for the people here in the germen cine club: the worst shit ever seen in this cinema of honor. A very poor screenplay, very bad actors and a very bad film. Don't waste your time watching this movie, look at the excellent "mutantes verdes fritos anarquia radioactiva", or any film has been commented by me. Don't say anything else.
