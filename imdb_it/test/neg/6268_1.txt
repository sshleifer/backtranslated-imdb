Do you hear that sound? This is the sound of H.G. Wells rolls into his grave, between this version and Spielberg's cinematic abortion it was a difficult year for the classic novel. But at least Steven had some things compared to this crapperella. Hi, the ships weren't big bugs, they had names. They were tripods and the aliens worked at three. The ships and the aliens were all wrong, you didn't really see the aliens until the end. The effects and the cast work well. But these actors are much better than the "movie" they deserve. The bulk, if not the whole movie, is Howell's character wondering through devastation, meeting a person, joining him and losing them for one reason or another. There are no more than two people on the camera at any time, even though most of the film. It's like filming three at once, the film would have made the budget available or something. So fat, the only and understandable only watchable adaptation of the WAR OF THE WORLDS story is the PAL GEORGE version of the 50s. THE BLACK HOLE.
