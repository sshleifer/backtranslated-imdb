Director Michael Ritchie and actor Robert Redford's second documentary-style drama, "The Candidate", is a political satire that still seems fresh and relevant today. So it's a shame that "Downhill Racer", made a little earlier, looks so dated in reverse. The music is ugly, and perhaps innovative ski sequences are now standard in the television coverage of the sport. The world of skiing seems strangely amateurish (probably precisely, given the time the film was made, but it is difficult to relate to today's professional world), and the theme of Americans in Europe also seems to be hundrum in an age of travel always easier. Perhaps the biggest problem is the flat plot, centered on the arrogant but enigmatic hero; unfortunately, it is a sad performance by Redford, which gives us little information about his concerns or motivations. And a film based on characters without much character is never a good bet. I was expecting a lot, but unfortunately this is a boring film.
