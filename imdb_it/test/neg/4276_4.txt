The whole exercise is useless. Why make the movie? The lighting is horrible, but the sound is just a joke. As a high school production. Anyone who puts together the budget for this film should be designed and quartered to enable it to be released without the proper budget for soundmen equipped with suitable recording equipment. <br /> <br /> Such a dialogue is incomprehensible due to echo leaks or lack of proximity to the microphone. The economy should have been done on any other area. The entire production is lifeless and just LAME with a semi-arsato amateur production. It lacks heat, clarity and has no design.
