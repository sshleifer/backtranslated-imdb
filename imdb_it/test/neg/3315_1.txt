I have never voted for a film on IMDB before, but for this I regret that the scale does not drop to -10. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this movie is that I saw a preview, and it was my worst cinematic experience ever. I don't care about stupid jokes. I can live with the stupid story. But when I see those "main characters" who smile stupidly with their pseudo-foreign speech (only the Germans will understand what I'm talking about), I felt such contempt that I never thought I was capable of. (If they had left them out, it would actually have been acceptable ...). <br /> <br /> There's not much more to say about this. You can laugh once or twice, because it's so ridiculous, but that doesn't make it better. It's not funny at all. <br /> <br /> If you live outside Germany, be happy and rejoice that this horrible work will most likely never arrive in your theaters. <br /> <br /> If you do live in Germany, avoid this movie at all costs.
