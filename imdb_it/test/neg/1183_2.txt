*** May contain spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I had very high expectations for this movie, based on the trailer. I knew the real Ed Gein a bit, so I thought it was a medium-budget Hollywood version of real events. The man was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, the script apparently came from an eight-year-old student who barely knew anything about Ed's story and took the script out in about 20 minutes. The film completely transmits the most interesting facets of Ed and his relationship with his mother (not to mention what the real police found in his house) and decides to focus mainly on the young deputy who seems to have just moved to the set. Similarly, it seems that all male characters are releasing their dialogue throughout the entire film. I'm not exaggerating. <br /> <br /> I'm not even able to get myself started with this movie's historic shoes. Seriously, who the hell directed this? The film should take place around 1957, but the cops carry modern batons with side handles, some of the things in the hardware store seem to come from Lowes, and when the cop arrives at a public telephone he dials 9-1-1 (it didn't exist then ). Also, Ed was a small guy, as scary as Anthony Perkins' character in Psycho (which was supposed to be based on Ed's real life), not this portly guy who ended up looking too much like the villain in Men In Black. /> <br /> Another thing that really bothered me was the appearance that the creators of this film shot the entire scene in a set of abandoned 3-story buildings. Because of the "smart" camera angles, you never see a real city, and the inside of the sets looked like old shacks long abandoned. Pop a cash register on a saw and a horse! - instant hardware store. <br /> <br /> Low-cost horror films usually forgive me, but this begs it. All you had to do was include most of the real events (even embellish them!), Pay five good actors instead of 15 crap, and for Pete take 5 minutes and think about the time period once in a while. My advice: Google Ed Gein, you will be much more entertained.
