This film was horrible, simple and simple. It will probably be revered by those who see only "films" and not "films" and therefore I will be sorry for having had such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this film, but I am quite sure in my intellect to say that this boring, self-made movie exhilarating and painfully pulled out was a waste of two hours and nine dollars. <br /> <br /> I was sucked into seeing this from the inexplicable good reviews he was receiving and he left the theater thinking that those reviews must have been written by overly excited film students and the aforementioned group of people who shunned from normal movies, perhaps for fear that one day they could really enjoy one. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite a promising man - a man is imprisoned for 15 years, without ever knowing his captor or his crime. He is then suddenly released and given only five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him. However, the big concept soon disintegrates into a pathetic joke as Oh Dae-Su goes around beating people up, trying to have sex with a girl who is trying to use the bathroom and eating a twisted and alive squid (presumably due to dramatic, because there is absolutely no other reason for this). All the while he's trying to figure out this horrible thing he did to earn fifteen years in prison, and when he finally finds out that it's both ridiculous and a big disappointment. His nemesis, a man who allegedly went to school with him when he was young, looks like a Banana Republic model twenty years younger than him. Hey, I know the prison was hard for Oh Dae-Su, but is it too much to ask to find an actor who looks a little closer to his age? Of all the wrong things in this film, this one seems the easiest to solve. <br /> <br /> And the big secret - the one that kept me in my seat for 90 minutes when I could be out of something productive - is a joke of a plot that involves incest and a voice started in high school . Come on! Throw us a bone in here - was that really the best they could do? Did I sit through stupid dialogues, drama series, dark series and gratuitous violence for this? (By the way, I am not at all opposed to violence in a film, if it seems to fit the story, but in this case it seems that he was forced to watch our hero put out someone's teeth and cut his tongue with a couple scissors to distract me from understanding that I was wasting my afternoon looking at a piece of pretentious garbage. <br /> <br /> Follow my advice - do something else with your time and money, or take your nine dollars and go to see a humble "movie" - one that you could really enjoy.
