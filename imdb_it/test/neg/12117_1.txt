Every night with Jonathan Ross now means to me his humor for the first time shocking and shocking with carefully chosen words a 78-year-old man by telephone and then suggesting that he and Russell Brand should break it and masturbate while sleeping as a way of saying sorry for making obscene phone calls to him. Kinky! It's illegal. For a good laugh maybe next time you should try it with someone you know well, like his Boss? Or a follower of Abu Hamza? Would he be amused if someone had done it to one of his daughters? <br /> <br /> Over the years I have perhaps seen less than 30 minutes of the BBC Star Man Ross chat show because I find it so disgusting, some of the guests I've seen were fine - probably most of those that are appeared to have gone well for what I know. As a chat show it looks pretty poor though ?? what's so chatted about asking Tory leader David Cameron on this TV show if he's ever masturbated with Margaret Thatcher's photos? He chatted with Gwyneth Paltrow simply asking her if she wanted to fuck him. However, Ross's mentality of Yob was finally totally exposed with the revelations mentioned above, and I thought of taking the opportunity to warn the dignified few throughout the world that they might not know how vile this man is and to be stay away from him and his - unless you think that the whole play should be "angular", that is obscene / vacuous. We're not all the same here yet, even though BBC and Channel 4 are abandoning all the standards. <br /> <br /> In October 2008 Ross with his addict Russell Brand made a series of sexually premeditated obscene phone calls to Andrew Sachs. the answer phone (Manuel from Fawlty Towers), broadcast it as expected by BBC National Radio against Sachs 'request and then tried to convince Sachs' niece to burn the evidence in case they were tried. A significant number of people here (probably most of them non-BBC payers) found it hilarious and / or that the national scandal had been exaggerated, but many people apparently still knew from the wrong and 42,851 eventually complained to the BBC about accident. Many idiots in the media and others have sneered at these 42,851 having never listened to the radio program (and never wanted it) - using their argument presumably also consider an event like the Holocaust justified because at that time relatively few people complained to the media , and none of us here now should be horrified because we weren't there. The 2 BBC producers initially involved in the broadcast for the show thought it was a "very funny and brilliant" comedy and only 2 people complained about Brand's radio program at the time - which I fear indicates only the moral level that its 400,000 listeners Weekly magazines had sunk with the help of the BBC experience. The highly moral BBC has tried and has not used it in mitigation in OFCOM's subsequent investigations. Pass over Aristotle, tell Lord Reith the news! Sachs' agent complained to the BBC, but was ignored by them until a national Tory newspaper got the news. The penalty for any normal pervert doing this would normally be dismissal and prosecution, perhaps even imprisonment, but while Brand and BBC Radio 2 were both ordered to resign from the multimillionaire Ross was given a 12-week vacation by the Boss of the BBC (I assume he first asked Ross for permission, even if he managed to grab Ross's pay of £ 1,500,000, to prevent him from suing) to return to this program again in 2009 before his contract expires . All that time to think of more smog and / or more reckless insults for his 4,000,000 spectators to admire - but at least he could still chuckle as usual to keep his spirits up. Some people think that his position will be unsustainable and he will not be able to move forward. I think his skin is so thick because the stakes are so high that it will go unheard and re-energized with vitrified glass. (Update 23.01.09: I have just seen the first 5 minutes of his new series - the "most enormous excitement" - use his reference phrase - continues to allow this unnerving lawless law-breaker to take the public's money so who knows .) But who knows: perhaps in the future after the slimy British cinema and the television industries have comforted him for the moral attitude assumed by 42.851 and given him gifts, he will become a Sir for his services to Perversion by the perverts in Government. At the very least, I hope this greedy deviant couple signs up with other perverted TVs and commercial radios and stays there, so I won't pay for breaking the law and throwing illegal obscenities in the future. In 2009, OFCOM fined £ 150,000 for British TV license fees for this "excuse" - Thanks Ross for offering to pay! Not. <br /> <br /> To apologists: Get a life / sense of humor / sense of proportion! It's not the end of the world to have a couple of talented people without talent like your heroes and there are much more important things to worry about in this world, like the price of real cheese! To sum up the family man Dross: a genius of comedy for apparently millions of people (especially himself), simply an ugly obscene telephone operator who receives an obscene package of salaries from an obscene multimedia company to others. So much for our society of fairness and political respect! As you should have guessed, it does not apply to the rich and famous and never will, but only to the poor. To sum up the BBC: stumbling blindly from Huttongate, Campbellgate, Dykegate, Springergate, Crowngate, Phonegate now Rossgate, I hope his next crisis will be Abolitiongate. I also hope that anyone who thinks comedy should always be a challenge and that the borders, that is offensive, are not challenged or offended by my opinion on this particular pervert that breaks the law, its perverse programs and its current perverted employers.
