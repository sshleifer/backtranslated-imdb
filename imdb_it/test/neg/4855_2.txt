Although this film has been praised, I personally found it boring. There are some beautiful Brazilian sunsets and the characters are believable, but the story of how they interact, even if unusual for our standards, is not interesting enough to support a film so long. The central woman confronts one man after another in a tight manner and puts the interests of her children first. While the tolerance of various men is tense, we see their characters develop. The story takes place with dignity and helped by excellent acting. It is a rare glimpse into the Brazilian interior, far from the city, but not exciting enough to keep your eyes open.
