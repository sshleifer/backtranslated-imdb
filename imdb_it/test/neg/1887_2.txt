I saw this film when I was a child and thought it was terrible then. Now that I'm older, I found it just as terrible. Universal could have done better than that. They simply decided to make more money than they could use using all their monsters at once. For me, that was an economic blow. These characters were able to hold their own in their films and the choice of actors was deplorable. Dracula must have been Bela Lugosi, Frankenstein's monster, he must have been Karloff. <br /> <br /> In my mind, it was the squalid sequel sequence of Disney made decades ago, and was not appreciated. Umiversal started with something great and original, and then he thought he could accommodate the masses with the schlock which is extremely evident in this film.
