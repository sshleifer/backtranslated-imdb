The story is not very strong. Don't expect a "Bourne identity" type of film. He started with a fort, speaking in Russian and even seemed credible. (Not that I am the Russian language expert). Moscow had that depressing and obscure look that gave this film potential, I still believed it. It took about half an hour for the evil to see that they really lost their jobs with this. Acting was poor, perhaps because the story itself was not very strong. There's this part in the movie where Gordon Patrick (Nick Moran) is talking on the phone with C.I.A., as if I'm listening to a Chinese synchronizer. W.T.F!? Too bad, the writer didn't even make a small effort to give depth to the main characters. Moreover, a bit of an economic and easy ending. <br /> <br /> The strength is almost every scene in which Tara Reid is present. Not that you act so well, in fact, it doesn't. But she's really great in this movie. Overall, it was a disappointment. Rental material ??. Maybe.
