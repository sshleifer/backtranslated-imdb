Oh what the hell, I'll reveal the secret: this movie stinks! <br /> Yes, there are some dinosaur effects that, for their time, were probably really exciting to watch. Now they don't cut it, but they're not terrible. They are good enough to tolerate without being able to mock it. So they sit there, and I'm sitting watching this, not laughing, not excited, just, well, bored. Stink! <br /> <br /> If I can exercise my Jay Sherman for a moment, the movie really does. The box promises cowboys against dinosaurs, and in a very general sense offers. Boys dressed as cowboys fight a couple of big dinosaurs. But in reality these guys are a bunch of sissies, and the hero is a loser (I'll talk about it later) and the dinosaurs aren't nearly intimidating. The plot is a yawn, and there's nothing technically wrong with what's there to laugh. It's all just gray and tasteless. <br /> <br /> After a terrible nocturnal cinematography (filmed in a half-color that I called), we get the plot that involves some people, doing things. This is what I captured. Oh and I'm at the turn of the century in Mexico, so at least they dress like cowboys even if they don't behave like that. <br /> <br /> So a group of these people, which I think were human, go to the desert and run into these dinosaurs (after finding a miniature horse ... I don't know, let's move on). Then the film degrades into a pathetic King Kong hoax in the final act. At that point I had lost the desire to keep my eyes on the television level, and I let myself be carried away by my conscience. <br /> <br /> The hero is played by the Beneath the Planet of the Apes guy who basically played the part of Charlton Heston when Heston decided he didn't want to be in the sequel. He was chosen because, shock shock, he looks exactly like Heston. That's all he has for him. I was really upset when he was the hero of the movie, because all he does is look at him scornfully, mock him, deceive the girl in the movie (Who's called TJ ... unfortunately he's not a prostitute or at the end the origin of the name would have been revealed). Meanwhile his friend kills all the dinosaurs, saves the day numerous times, and what do you get for it? No recognition, nothing at all! And he dies, sacrificing himself for his friends! They don't even wait for him while they run away! <br /> <br /> Boring, long, slow paced, with little fun until the film decides to copy the King Kong script on it, it's best to avoid this movie unless you like it the pain on the scale of dropping an anvil on your eyeball.
