There is a lot of ketchup but it doesn't make much sense in the third seemingly explanatory sequel, which piles up the images of nothing with no effect. Good old Alan Smithee directed this episode, in which various members of the same family (all of whom were inadequately interpreted by Bruce Ramsay) are terrified of Pinhead (Doug Bradley, taken out of mothballs for the umpteenth time). Peter Atkins tries to impregnate his script with a poetic touch, but he doesn't seem to realize that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sick people. The inconsistent plot fails to adequately fill the meager execution time of the film, although this may have more to do with the interference of the study than the directors wanted.
