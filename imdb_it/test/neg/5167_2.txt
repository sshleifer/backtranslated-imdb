It was like watching a rising movie trailer, except there was no movie coming. The film is so unsatisfactory and obviously unfinished to be almost ridiculous. The subject of this film is in a very short space of time and, frankly, nothing actually happens in the odd 90 minutes of the screen. I was hoping in the definitive Australian film about our soldiers in World War II and how they fought against incredible adversity in terrible conditions. This is not certain. <br /> <br /> That said, the acting was great and the locations were authentic. This could easily have been a great movie given a lot more money and time, but it's not even mediocre and I can't recommend it at all.
