Is it possible to provide a 0 to 10 rating? Because this deserves it. While I'm not a big fan of Jane Austen's books, I sat through this with two women who are. Well, at least we had a great laugh about how bad this movie is. Robert Hardy was the only actor with some charisma in the whole affair, although he exaggerated as usual (almost like William Shatner). But that wasn't enough to save this skunk from total drowsiness. It is often difficult to separate the girl's dream sequences from what is "really" happening, and there are so many holes in the story that you can't figure out what's going on. Too many free ends and the ending looks like a "climate in tune for next week". The leading actress is too dull and bizarre to be a heroine, the main character is too stupid and effeminate to be a convincing hero and the music seems like a new, cheap, new pet, the director's hippy daughter (I mean the saxophone ??? mixed with some kind of industrious female lament?). So, in conclusion, I suggest you skip the budget and order a DVD of this as soon as possible. Especially if you like disappointment.
