Let me see ... I saw every movie Lou Ferrigno made. I saw Batman and Robin ... twice. I learned the dances of Breakin '2: Electric Boogaloo by heart ... I saw the incomplete student films of Blade Runner to fish out ... yet this film is the most painful thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This was the first film for the "video direct market". So you can thank Blood Cult for all those mysterious Michael Dudikoff movies at your local Blockbuster. You should know that this is not even a high quality video. This is consumer level. This is your dad's video camera that he never uses. This is what you need to watch for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I won't bore you with the details of the plot since I'm just falling asleep thinking about it, but I'll tell you that watching this movie is a form of torture. I only watch this movie when I'm angry with myself. So I recommend this movie if you're suicidal, or if you're ready for a big challenge. <br /> <br /> If you happen to rent this movie (God have mercy), you will know what awaits you for the first 10 minutes. This is when you are hit by the usual horror film introduction. Know the drill. There is a lot of suspense and it accumulates before a girl dies. Yes, you've seen it before, but not like this. This is the most boring introduction I've ever seen. I honestly believe you could have a camera turned off for ten dollars, grab your ass that smells more like gin and candy, and tell it to film your mom while cooking dinner and it would be more interesting than this intro. It bored me to tears. I cried like a baby. <br /> <br /> Another of the things that makes this movie so incredibly painful are its actors. Yes, I saw bad acting. TRUST ME. I have seen Oliver Twist grade IV productions with a more realistic dialogue. The main actor makes me sick. The "supporting" actress is a wreck of a human being. <br /> <br /> I will not even comment on my boyfriend. True horror. <br /> <br /> So, rent this movie if you can find it. You'll never be depressed about spending $ 3 on anything else.
