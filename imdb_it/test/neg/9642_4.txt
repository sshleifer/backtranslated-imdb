More acted, with heavy hands, full of speech, preaching, on the nose, and above stylized in a way that only MTV could be guilty, Stop-Loss is agit-prop garbage. I expected a lot more with talented young actors like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Philippe, but screenwriter / director Kimberly Peirce does an ax job of portraying the bad effects of war on American youth. I'm sure he did some work looking for the war in Iraq and the young people fighting us, but you never imagined you would look at Stop-Loss. In many ways, this mess reminded me of Catherine Hardwicke's Lords of Dogtown, a waste of solid, equally inept, overly stylized television topics, like film movies. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
