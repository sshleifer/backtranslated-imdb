This was one of the slowest movies I've ever had the regret of sitting down. After the introduction, where we are told the story of "something" that kills a couple of people in a farmhouse, we are presented with a white family moving to a farm - and NOTHING HAPPENED for a very long time. Then they meet this tramp who helps on the farm and NOTHING HAPPENS for a very long time yet. So FINALLY the girl of the family has something plotergeist happens. Then something more happens, the tramp goes crazy and the movie ends. In the midst of all that concerns the way this family has had to move out, the girl has had some problems at home and has no money and did SO LOW THAT I could care less about these pathetic people. I can't believe I went to the movies to see this! Not only did this movie suck, but a hole in dollars responded to his cell phone, stupid idiots were making noise And the movie was sucked. WHY THE SUCKER THEATERS - Bad movies, bad lousy food, and idiots in the theater, I stay home watching DVDs from now on, at least I could smoke if I were at home watching this stupid movie. Stay home and make some cake rather than go to a theater to see this piece of typical shit. Stupid stupid shit
