I love Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni. However, this is easily the worst movie I've seen in 10 years, and I see my part of the film. A stinker. This is a bad idea for a badly executed film. Nothing is fun, credible or interesting. I was looking for spirit, irony and genuine humor. Instead, it seemed that most of the cast members were roaming the set to do Leoni a favor. Too bad that such a acting talent has been wasted in such a void. Don't worry I have to ask myself what opinion the creators of this film have of their audience to submit them to the idea of ​​Polish gangsters in Buffalo, NY who sends a contract killer to San Francisco to become a mortuary assistant while attending AA meetings. Bill Pullman should start reading the scripts before he agrees to be in a movie. Sad.
