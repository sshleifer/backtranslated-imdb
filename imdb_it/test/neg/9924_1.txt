This contains some information on the spoiler, but the film is not worth looking at anyway ... <br /> <br /> Because Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson have agreed to be part of this debacle by writer-director Damian Harris is beyond me. The story is full of unrealistic police investigative techniques, which include going to a party with a suspect and inviting the suspect to your home and spending time with them. The story also includes a male psychiatrist who seems to have nothing but female clients - and sleeps with all of them. <br /> <br /> Even more exaggerated is the idea that women victims of a horrendous crime S belong to a large but secretive group of S / M lesbian leaders. <br /> <br /> Filled with bad editing errors and continuity, the film is sterile in all its fine locations - including Barkin's detective's apartment. And the lame dialogue is suitable for putting one to sleep. <br /> <br /> Damian is a bad writer and a bad director. He tried and failed miserably to create a noir atmosphere sometimes. Besides, he couldn't get Ellen Barkin to give 110%. I firmly believe that she understood that the film was pathetic and gave up trying. Standouts were Peta Wilson, who wasted time studying with a Dominatrix for the part. The very underrated character actor, Marshall Bell gave his absolute best as always. <br /> <br /> And since Damian couldn't get to any level, it was hard to feel emotions for any of the characters. <br /> <br /> Above all, he doesn't know much about the real world of BDSM and has chosen to create the typical "Hollywood Reality" of wonderful men and women who are perverted and dangerous. <br /> <br /> Save time, money and gestures and pass this.
