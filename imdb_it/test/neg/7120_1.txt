All I can say about this movie is absolutely boring. The introduction to the film is perhaps the worst introduction to a horror film I've ever seen, I mean an angry girl who hits a guy in the head with a pan is not scary at all, which is what I assume the director he was aiming for, but in reality he was "slightly" funny. <br /> <br /> The acting in this photo was beyond pathetic; a note for the directors, if you're making a horror movie, I suggest you hire some good actors, not a famous star of soap teen who has no idea how to behave. <br /> <br /> The scenes of death in this film have been beyond boring. .. no gore, and I'm sorry, but bloodless horror movies, or good suspense are just cheesy. I mean this girl is killed by her hair wrapped around her in the middle of Tokyo, and not one person sees it happening, they simply declare it "missing", wow it's great! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you and your friends want to see this movie, make sure you bring sleeping pills, because I guarantee you that you won't make it until the end .. My friend and I went out because we didn't care not even what happened at the end. <br /> <br /> Thanks
