This film does not have a very clear picture of what it is or wants to be. There are some positive aspects when Stewart is on the screen and they give him some lines to work on. It works best at the beginning as a romantic comedy, but the story continues to head towards more dramatic territories and gets lost in the process. In the last fifteen minutes, the twists and turns are just a series of dramatic clich√©s. <br /> <br /> The part with the plane looks like a movie left over from another movie inserted. <br /> <br /> The main reason I can think of seeing it is if you want to be able to say you've seen all of Jimmy Stewart's movies.
