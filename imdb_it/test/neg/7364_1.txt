The actors were not credible, the story was really weak, a total and completely predictable sap. Really disappointed in Depardieu. It was a pity that they no longer focused on the struggle of the Canadian struggle for independence. We have seen this love story many times before, only with better actors! We had to wait for the last 15 minutes for a little sense of drama! The soundtrack was totally disturbing. The underscore sign hits you on the head with sentimentality. But really over the top. The only thing we found OK was the fact that they let the Indians speak their language. And we found the cinematography, of the relatively realistic Indian village.
