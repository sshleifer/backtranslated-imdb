What can I say? After reading Herbert's books and loving Lynch's film version, I was extremely disappointed. I felt I was looking at a rejected version of Buck Rogers. The sets looked like leftovers from a Star Wars TV special! I felt that the acting was a bit amateurish by many. The costumes were gaudy and finished giving him a Flash Gordon from the 1960s, a feeling of mush. The worms! They must have been sand worms and yet they looked like "big stalactites" with a mouth at the dull end. The effects in general were rather secondary. I won't even start talking about the shameful "Navigator" effect. <br /> <br /> The so-called "Dune of Frank Herbert" was not even faithful to his books! It was to be called "Frank Herbert's Dune - For Dummies". The key elements of the plot have been omitted, the names have been changed and the whole "feeling" of the story has been "disinfected". I didn't even recognize the Harkonnens! In fact most of the characters did not appear as Herbert's depictions had depicted them. I'm starting to get angry just by remembering what a tragedy it was. I'm glad I couldn't stand the second episode ...
