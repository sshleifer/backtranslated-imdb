It's not so much for this movie ... either a stunt racer or a race car has a burning car at the beginning of the movie, it goes to the bar, is approached by a band of bikers that ruins its possibilities with a lady very adorable, offer him a job, go back to their place, he refuses, the police ask him to accept them! What comes out is a very annoying little movie that sees the hero not really doing so much and a band of bikers who can kill and for some reason the police can't blame a crime on them. I'm not sure why the motorcyclist did what she did in the end, but hey is a bad movie, you always have very senseless scenes. I'm still trying to figure out if I misunderstood when they said that the hero of the piece was a stunt car driver. They could have said a standard driver because why an acrobatics pilot would be running and I wouldn't think it would be so rare for a brave car to crash. The actors are bad, and all the bikers are pretty annoying and the hero is kind of incompetent ... in reality this movie is not full of kicks but they are the pits.
