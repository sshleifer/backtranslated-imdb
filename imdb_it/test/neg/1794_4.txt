Heart of Darkness was terrible. The novel was quite difficult to understand, but when a production company decides to publish a film freely based on it, then this messes up everyone. Not only did the managers decide to change some characters and completely eliminate the others, but the acting was horrible and the general impression I got from the film was that it was a real disaster. I watched the film hoping to understand the novel a little better, but it simply threw me and my classmates away. I think the film was a waste of time, and I was disappointed to see Tim Roth in such a disappointing film, especially when he has some great films like Pulp Fiction and Resivior Dogs within his reach. The same with the legendary John Malkovich.
