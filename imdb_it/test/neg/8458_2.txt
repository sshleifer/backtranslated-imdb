I used to think that "It Came from Hollywood" was the worst movie I had ever seen and that it featured horror, science fiction, criminal and dramatic film clips. Of course, I had not yet seen THIS beauty. <br /> <br /> What is wrong with "Terror in the corridors"? Four things: <br /> <br /> 1) It is assumed that most of the great moments in shock film history began in the 1970s when filmmakers like John Carpenter and Brian De Palma arrived. And what are the bones thrown to the real classics (ie black and white films) like "Frankenstein", "Dracula" and "The Wolf Man" or are shown together with Martin and Lewis or Abbott and Costello or not! <br /> <br /> 2) The clips are most often so short and out of their place of origin that they only give the viewer a momentary shock and, for those not familiar with these films, it will not make any sense (Indeed, the moment when the shark jumps out of the water to Roy Scheider in "Jaws" is shown a lot by the effect of a gag view, considering that, in the original context, it had power.) <br /> /> 3) Did we really need Pleasance and Allen in the audience to remind us that "it's just a movie" or that most of the horror film violence "is, unfortunately, against women"? So, is it an accusation against film producers to add those scenes or viewers who trample the theaters and watch the same kind of feed over and over again? Sorry, it's a whole jar of worms to open for a more deserving movie. <br /> <br /> 4) And above all, why is the film so SHORT? It is not that there was not enough of this type of film to use. If they had just opened their resources and used ALL the films available, they could have had a "That's Entertainment!" Movie, which would have been relatively more fun. Heck, even dragging out Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (Cushing was alive then, mind you) and even better, Vincent Price would have been more than willing, I bet! What applause he would get from the public! <br /> <br /> But no ... all we have left is a small, dark film that pretends to pay tribute to these films, but all it does is leave the spectator who feels screwed for less than 90 minutes with whom he could have gone to watch a REAL movie. Do not get me wrong; it was nice to see what clips they showed, but if they could have done more with the goods! <br /> <br /> Two stars. Another good idea remained "in the corridors".
