It's not too bad, but in the end it lacks the quality that the Australian series has. <br /> <br /> The jokes are few and far between, the actors are attractive (they shouldn't be), the directors think too much about cinematography (it should look like a home video) and it's just like a serious version of Kath and Kim. .. it's stupid. <br /> <br /> It's too normal to be Kath and Kim. Kath and Kim should be two curvy, middle-aged women who think they are warm and wear ridiculous clothes. There are no "Look at me Kimmy!" jokes. Kim's fat friend is not fat at all and he's not even a little stupid. It's a stereotypical black / Latin. <br /> <br /> It's not as stupid or funny as the Australian series. Does not compare. Nothing is the same. I admit, sometimes this show is pretty funny, but it's NOT like the Aussie series. I was looking forward to an American outlet on a bogan family. They failed. It should REALLY be stupid and funny, but the actors don't act stupid! For me, this is just a typical American television program. It's a disappointment if you want it to be something like the Australian show. <br /> <br /> 2 stars because it's an OKAY show, just nothing like it should be.
