Every James Bond movie has its own rules. Just like every Indiana Jones movie has its own set of rules. And the fact that the writers do not break these rules maintains the integrity of the characters. With a useless plot twist, the integrity of both Ocean films plummets somewhere between Airplane 2 and a Roadrunner cartoon. Imagine what would happen, as he stumbles over the rope bridge outside the Temple of Doom, if Indy told Shorty and Willie not to worry because in all the first two films he has secretly super powers and can bring them both to safety. <br /> <br /> Funny? Sure, for a Roadrunner cartoon. But Spielberg would never have done it because it would have destroyed the integrity of the film. More importantly, he would have ANGERATED the audience. They had already sat on the edge of their seats for 3 hours of Indiana Jones film and were counting on Indiana to get them off that bridge in a believable way. Should it fly away? People would come out of the theaters in the same way that people did during the 12-year SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> 1. The character of Julia Roberts, Tess, infiltrates a museum disguising herself as ... Julia Roberts?!? An intelligent touch? Breaking the fourth wall three hours after we were introduced to these characters? Is this the Naked Gun 33 and 1/3? It's a textbook example of how cheap laughter can ruin an entire movie. But wait ... in case you haven't left yet ... <br /> <br /> 2. The suspense develops during the last hour of the film - as they will be able to pull off the robbery - there are only 10. .. 8 ... 5 ... 2 DAYS LEFT! And then in the last 12 minutes of the movie, the ONLY fun part of this movie, we see that the robbery was made a few days earlier and took Matt Damon all 30 seconds to pull out. The last 10 days? A complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> RETURN TO INDIANA JONES ON THE ROPE BRIDGE ... "Relax, Willie! I stole the real stones back about a month ago! Furthermore, I convinced you that you were Kate Capshaw!" <br /> < br /> If you haven't already seen it, cut your losses and go see the Polar Express. I don't want to ruin the ending for you, but there's really a Santa. Above all, you won't feel cheated by leaving the theater.
