Harry Knowles has a quote right on the cover of the DVD stating "The Next Icon of Horror" Really?!?!?!? I heard a lot of clamor around this, but I wasn't totally convinced. Anyway, I'm a passionate horror fan and I'll give any horror movie a chance. It doesn't matter the budget or the evaluation, because you never know where you'll find the next gem. Not here. Not Hatchet. Hatchet is ill-conceived, misinterpreted and funny. Just because you have the actors who played Freddy Jason and Candyman and a topless chic Buffy with tons of blood doesn't make you a horror expert. Sorry. I don't even want to describe the plot because it's so idiotic. Honestly my money is on Rob Zombie. There is a man who knows the horror of the old school. Forget this garbage.
