Does anyone remember BRAVEHEART? He starred Mel Gibson, who he also directed and wrote for Randall Wallace. The film contains over 200 errors. Does anyone remember THE GREEN BERETS? That's John Wayne's western where the Duke rescues a farm called Vietnam from a group of injunctions from the tribe of Commons. If you look at WE WERE SOLDIERS you can't help us, but remember these two films. <br /> <br /> First of all with that Scottish lament that you played three times in the film, four if you count the credits? I mean what is the connection between Scotland and `Nam? Perhaps Wallace is using it in the vain hope that, given that BRAVEHEART has been bombed - Without any hesitation I could add - with different Oscars so could this film also? Whatever the reason, it really included cans. Gibson plays Hal Moore as a cross between William Wallace and John Wayne and I expected him to say something like "They'll never take our freedom - Hell they'll do" and it's impossible not to notice other similarities with THE GREEN BERETS like the subplot of a journalist who takes up a gun and becomes a warrior and Moore tells the reporter of the guilt in a scene almost identical to that seen in Wayne's movie <br /> <br /> When he does not remember the public about other films WWS fails to stand on its own, is based on real events in 1965 but seems lacking in the integrity necessary to do justice to the story, it never seems 1965 and lacks a sense of time and place probably because it was filmed in America not in Asia. Hal Moore could have dusted off the French experience in Indochina, but if that was the case then it was unique because the American military went out of their way to avoid reading the French Indo-Chinese war, indeed when asked about the previous conflict Westmoreland replied that he had nothing to learn from the French "Who hasn't won a war since Napoleon", so I was confused about the NVA portrait in this film, when in 1965 the American high command overflowing with arrogance despised North Vietnamese and the VC. It is as if the story had been rewritten to show the rice farmers of Vietnam superlative warriors. They are, but few Americans believed this in the mid-1960s. Are there a couple of other things that confused me like wives who come home to receive telegrams that say their husbands are dead? No body is shown that is returned to the base and no one on the screen is seen referring to those killed in the valley of La Drang. Likewise, we don't see reinforcements coming on the screen, so how do we suddenly see Americans outnumber the NVA? I put them as errors in directing / editing by Wallace who doesn't seem like a director, and his biggest problem seems to communicate the horror of the battle. Take the scene where the American burned in a crunchy flew away screaming "Tell my wife I love her". This should have an emotional impact similar to that of the PLATOON death scene, but there is no impact here. In fact I found the clich√© and condescending scene, and it is not the only character to put the words "Tell my wife ..." into my mouth while I am mutilated or dying, I counted that at least two other characters used the sentence. Did the characters actually say this during the battle? I have no idea, but since Randall Wallace wrote the script, I have reservations <br /> <br /> I sat open-mouthed admiring APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON and THE KILLING FIELDS made my eyes water, I laughed at FULL METAL JACKET, I kept looking at my watch with THE DEER HUNTER, and after watching WE WERE SOLDIER I felt totally patronized
