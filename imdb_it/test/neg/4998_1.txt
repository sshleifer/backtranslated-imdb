So, you've seen the Romero movies, yes? And you saw Jacob's Ladder, right? And the subsequent Hellraiser films? Okay, now let's make a movie about all three of us, let's just jam and make a big mess, does that sound like a good idea? <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Absolutely terrible. Yes, it's an independent film, who gives a shit? Is it a pass to make film excrements? The film tries to establish credibility by focusing on the interaction of the characters, this is evident. Unfortunately for writers, they are not good at interacting with characters. This is not the Night of the Living Dead; the characters are noents who shout their inanimate lines against each other in a vain attempt to be caught by the microphones on the set. Dialogue is never interesting. For a film that focuses so much on the interaction of the characters, you would think that the characters had something more to say about "WHAT WE ARE DOING" "I don't know" "WELL WE HAVE DONE TO DO SOMETHING" "Well, what are we going to do? "I DON'T KNOW." "We should leave." "WE ACCEPT OUR RATE" "No, we have to leave." "GOOD, WE WILL LEAVE THEN". "No, maybe we should stay." <br /> <br / > This is not exaggeration, there are exchanges in this film that reach that level of redundancy and inanity. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie? Half is a dream, and it really has a zero purpose. in the dream it has no relevance to anything in the rest of the film. The writers could not decide whether to make a zombie movie or a monster movie and so did both.It is clearly ridiculous, the cheapest trick in the book, and is exasperatingly insulting mostly because I'm pretty sure they robbed the idea from Jacob's ladder, which he handled the concept in a much more competent way than these pranksters could ever hope to do. <br /> <br /> And then there's the assembly. Years of watching MTV and horror-themed video games must have inspired the directors, but it's certainly sad that they didn't realize what made editing and fragmenting obfuscation into those pieces of effective media in the first place. In this film, you will often be confused, and not in the good, David Lynch's way, but in the bad "Wait I thought it had just been killed, right? So who the hell was it?" Wait, who is that guy? he came from? How did they get here? "kind of street. It's constant and constantly bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is a ridiculous piece of junk and should only be searched if you want to be swept away with some friends and laugh at it. <br /> < br /> And as a final note: as for the "comedies" other people talk about, it's all unintentional. There is not a single piece of intentional comedy in this film. It should be a serious study, because the filmmakers want to have credibility in their concept of horror.Unfortunately, their claims do not match their abilities.
