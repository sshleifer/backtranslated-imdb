What in the world! This piece of cinema for gambling would have been suitable for the lifetime network. Michael Imperoli is a good actor, but I think his portrait of "Stu" has failed. The montages were unbearable and too many. The supporting cast, where are you? Whoever did the casting should be partially at fault. Cinematography was useless. A story of gambling with an after-school program. Stories of this kind should be left for the Oliver Stones of the world. It would still suck your ass, but at least it would be fun to watch. It was an attempt that lost its wheels before the race ever started. Mario Andretti in 1982 Indy 500 came to mind.
