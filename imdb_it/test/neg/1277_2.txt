I stopped this movie at 48 minutes and I change ... I don't know ... maybe it's because I'm not Swedish ... or French (the Cannes commentator) ... or any of those OTHER sleepy places from which the previous reviewers have kept ... born and raised in New York. he lived near San Francisco for a quarter of a century. and now the Netherlands. i love a good independent film as much as the next movie fan ... but this, in a word, is not funny. to see? now it's fun ... you're thinking i made a mistake i said, 'in a word', but then he said, 'it's not funny' ... no. No error. if this is your kind of humor, I'd say you didn't have much life ... consider your appreciation for this film a symptom ... and PLEASE don't NEVER write another review ... I have a tendency to believe them when they are unanimous. even if there were only 3 reviews before my ... I imagined I could be able to save someone OTHER boredom ... the anticipation of a laugh that never materializes ... I smiled once or twice, but ... when I started the movie ... and when I stopped it. that should be 10 lines.
