Charles Bronson gave viewers many good moments on the screen. But this film lacks everything a thriller / action movie should have. There are some action scenes in the movie, but they are really crappy. And when the action scenes fail, does the story save the movie? Not at all, it's my answer to this. The story is even worse than the action scenes. It's very simple and boring, and even though I'm a big movie fan, I've almost fallen asleep several times. I don't know how they came to a failure like this. A low budget, perhaps? Regardless, it seemed that all the actors had no interest in being in the film. When that happens, the result is really bad.
