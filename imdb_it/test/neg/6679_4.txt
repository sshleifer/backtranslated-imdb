STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> As a boy, Mark Goddard (C Thomas Howell) sat helplessly as the his family, including the father of the police hero (Jeff Fahey), was brutally murdered by evil criminals whom he had tried to overthrow. With an inner desire to punish the evildoers that creep into him while he grew up as a result of this, Mark employs hard means when he brings the suspicions he pursues and gets into trouble with his superiors because of that. But then he learns of "Justice Incorporated", a secret group of men and women led by a mysterious man (Ed Lauter) who serves to punish the punishment that fits the crime outside the law. But, then things get out of hand and getting out alive could be more difficult than he thought. <br /> <br /> The Sweeper finds itself in problems from the off-set, because we have seen this same plot made before (and better) in films like The Star Chamber with Michael Douglas and Magnum Force with Clint Eastwood. The title doesn't make any sense either. But we also have to deal with the absolute ridiculousness of the film, including a scene in which a daughter's headset succeeds in suffocating the sound of her massacred family, an ending that involves a chase with a villain starting on the highway and ends on Wright The brothers' piano, as well as some of the most ridiculous performances ever put on screen and a very pretentious and very scenic script. But there are some interesting action sequences here and there and the involuntary laughter factor of the film certainly keeps him alive with an impulse. **
