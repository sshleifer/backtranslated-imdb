I have read almost every major book on the Manhattan Project. Most people know what it was, but few people understand the depth and breadth of the project. Its purpose was enormously immense: rivaled in the history of the United States, perhaps only by the space program of the 1960s. There were - literally - MILLIONS of people involved from all walks of life in numerous sites (most of them illegal) throughout the country, each involved in a specific and different aspect of the project which they could not talk to the person sitting in the cubicle next to them, much less to their family. Logistics is overwhelming, especially considering the considerations of communication, security and transport during the 1940s. <br /> <br /> For example, my colleague's father was a carpenter who worked for one of the companies that had a contract with the federal government for the Manhattan Project. His job was to supervise a crew of about 30 other carpenters, who were responsible for producing modules for cement casting for the massive research facilities in Hanford, Washington. This is "everything", six days a week for almost two years. These carpenters needed food, shelter, toilets, hospitals and materials as much as Oppenheimer and his audience at the top of the pyramid. Think about it! That being said, it is simply impossible to do the subject's justice in a 2-hour movie. In defense of Joffe, however, I would say that they had an impossible task, especially because he chose to have a different script with more plots, more angles and more characters. What exactly was he thinking, and how could he be so arrogant as to think it would work? That's Hollywood, I guess. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY has so many flaws that it would take a book to list them all. Horrible casting. Scary (and politically motivated) writing. Bad science. The portraits of Groves and Oppie are particularly imprecise and decidedly irritating. Despite the script's obvious agenda, it is STILL incredibly bland and sloppy. <br /> <br /> These defects have been listed elsewhere on IMDb, but I was particularly struck by the fact that scientists have had so much time on their hands - softball, horse riding, parties, semi-formal dinners, ballet, etc. ., not to mention romanticism, and of course political petitions in circulation. According to FM & LB, if these big brains got out of their teeth and actually spent time in the lab instead of seducing Laura Dern, we could have won the war before D-Day. <br /> <br /> One last complaint - - FM & LB states that "Fat Man" and "Little Boy" were the code names of the two atomic bombs, but it does not mention the fact that these names were a semi jab - Groves subscriber ("Fat Man", for heavy stature) and Oppenheimer ("Little Boy", for his short stature). Another reason why Paul Newman should not have been in this movie ...
