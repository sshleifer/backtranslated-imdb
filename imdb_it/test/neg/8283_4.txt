An interesting slasher film with multiple suspicions. <br /> <br /> Includes a typical girl who flaunts her breasts (Denise Cheshire) while changing into her bathing suit, a disturbing suspicion - none of them could do the act get a passing vote (Linnea Quigley) , a very unusual forward pass, bare breasts, an athletics event that will NOT be in the summer Olympics, and a macabre secret. <br /> <br /> Everything comes to a crashing finish. No, there's more. Will this boy not die? I bet Anne (Patch Mackenzie) no longer plans to visit home early. <br /> <br /> If you like teen slasher movies, can you be a pervert, even if all the actresses are over 18?
