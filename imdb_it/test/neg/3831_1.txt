I attended the premier last night. The film started with a bang (perhaps due to the excitement of the premier). The audience laughed for about 15 minutes, then most of us spent the rest of the time fighting sleep. This film cannot be compared to "Tap Tap" or to any Guest's work, unless you want to say that "Son of Provo" is something you hope terribly. He simply fell, he died, it was painful. The story didn't go anywhere, the jokes were bland, even if you were a Mormon and could get all the internal jokes, it seemed like a waste of time. There were two qualities of salvation: Kirby's acting was apt! And the songs were very clever (only for an LDS audience). So my advice ... Avoid the movie. And if you are a Mormon, buy the music CD.
