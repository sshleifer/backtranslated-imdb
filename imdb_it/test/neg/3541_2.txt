Do you think you saw the worst movie in the world? Think again. The person who designed the cover of this box should be accused of misleading advertising. The cover makes it look like a good thriller with horror suspense. But no. What we have instead is NIGHTSCREAM. A film that makes a "sweeeoooowww !!" noise every time a credit flashes on the screen. The biggest name in the entire film is probably Casper Van Dien, who barely has a part. I voted for this just because I couldn't vote lower. If you could vote for something like five thousand negative, believe me, I'd do it. So, for now, I'll give NIGHTSCREAM 1/2 * out of 5 just because it's over.
