He appeared to me as an extra and was on the spot as a journalist in "The Dain Curse". My involvement was during the segments of this film shot in Jim Thorpe, Pa. (Jim Thorpe was also one of the locations of the 1969 film "The Molly Maguires"). I reported the "action" in the newspaper Emmaus Free Press where I was an editor from 1978 to 1980 (the newspaper ceased publication in 1990). I remember the excellent attention to details of period costumes, cars, etc. Jim Thorpe's modern paved streets were gravel-covered to imitate a rural city from the south of 1920. At the time, I interviewed the producer and spoke briefly with the director during a changeover; I didn't have the opportunity to interview James Coburn, which has always been a big disappointment for me. Incidentally, they appear briefly in one of the street scenes with a snap hat and a tweed jacket. The producer asked me to "jump in" and it was a real thrill. I still have a collection of black and white photos I took of the production work for the newspaper. One day they might interest film and television historians. Lou Varricchio
