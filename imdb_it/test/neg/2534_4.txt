This film starts out quite promising, but becomes a bit complicated and captivated by its stylistic appeal. The set sets, costumes and music were wonderful, as close as possible to perfection. But the more they entered the film, the more I felt like all this effort was for the director's entertainment, not for the public. Although I enjoyed watching it, except for a few short musical scenes, I can't say I enjoyed it. The director shows a huge imagination, but if he had fun with this film, he could not share it with the public, or at least with me. I didn't have a sense of fantasy and I wasn't sucked into this universe. <br /> <br /> A great cause of this was (surprisingly) Zhang Ziyi. It can be said that he is working hard, but seems to have been so uncomfortable as to seem almost amateur. She is a capable actress but has her limits. I noticed in his acting that he still has to really react to his co-star colleagues, a flaw that creates a chemical void. The language barrier in this film seems to have only exacerbated things. She and Odagiri behave as if they were on separate planets. He is also not a good singer who made me shiver every time he sang, but luckily there were not too many scenes of this. Odagiri was OK, but it doesn't have a great impression. <br /> <br /> I didn't even take care of the characters separately. There really is a painful lack of characterization. The only reason to worry about them seems to be to be a good looking royalty. But without the compelling love story at the center of the film, it's hard to worry about what happens. The film also takes detours in minor scenes that add nothing to the plot and actually distracts. I had to rewind because after inserting a subplot I couldn't remember what the hell they were doing in the main plot. There were also scenes where it was difficult to say what was happening because it was so stylized. <br /> <br /> Mostly I'm just disappointed because I really like the concept behind this and there are a lot of things I like. The choreographies of music and dance are really fantastic. The support performances are uniformly excellent, fantastic in both the recitative and the singing aspects. It is simply a pity that the main actors were so insignificant.
