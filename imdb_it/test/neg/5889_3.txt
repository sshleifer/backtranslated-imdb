Having been born and raised in Odessa, and having graduated from "high school" in the late 1970s, Odessa High School, I had mixed emotions about this film. I no longer live in Odessa, but I will always be a Texan at heart. I didn't like the way this 80,000 plus city was depicted as a dirty poor town. If I'm wrong about this, don't hesitate to correct me, but I think the OHS also plays in the city stadium, and the "Permian Panther House" sign that was shown at the stadium was in the Permian practice field. I would have liked to have seen a small recognition of the cross-town rivalry of the big game in the city every year, OHS vs Permian. I am curious to know why the result of the game has been altered, I think it would have been equally dramatic if the true result had been represented. Overall, the film was fine, it made me a little nostalgic, remembering the "good old days" of MOJO.
