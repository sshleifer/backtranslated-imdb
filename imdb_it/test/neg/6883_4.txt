It is difficult to comment on this film. It is one of the few films in which Dimension has never filed (it is difficult to find a reason why) and it has crashed into an unprecedented 500-day opening theater. Maybe Dimension was afraid of how people would respond to a swamp creature by using his truck to haul a piece of house piece by piece. <br /> <br /> Ray Sawyer is just a truck driver, until he saves a Voodoo priestess from a bad car accident, and in return, he is attacked by a bag full of snakes and drowns. At the morgue, Ray comes back to life and chases a group of teenagers who witness the terrible accident. <br /> <br /> What brings this film down are the very thin characters. I didn't care for any of them for a moment. Furthermore, the dialogue was less than ho-hum. Moreover, it was very predictable. The characters have interpreted the typical stupid movie things of horror films, such as the creaking noises, the names of people and the journey on a rock while being chased. I could also immediately choose who the final girl would be. And why does the camera have those fast white flashes whenever someone is dead or when the killer was shown? <br /> <br /> What's good? Well, there's an awesome suspense scene in which the killer walks under the swamp waters to reach his victims and a tense sequence where the last one has to camouflage with a bunch of other corpses while the killer watches . <br /> <br /> But apart from that, it's another disappointment from August / September. I couldn't wait, but I didn't get what was expected.
