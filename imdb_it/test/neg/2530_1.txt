this film is rubbish because, for many reasons, it is based on the book by Mark Furman, which is also junk. I would like to say that Mark Furhman is a racist pig who is only looking for another way to get himself in the spotlight - and others that just this kind of garbage belong to the prison. because the film itself, being based on the book, was also horrible. the only reason why this murder case has become such a big book and movie is because the boy is related, through the marriage of his aunts, with the Kennedy family and it is ridiculous that people still believe that this family has in some so the ability to do and cover up murders - they are just a family and Central America needs to overcome the obsession. this poor boy, and his family, have been persecuted by the police for years, they couldn't take Tommy so they chased Michael. it is amazing that he went to prison with all the evidence to support the fact that he did not do it, besides the facts that the statute of limits, among other things, should have prevented this process from being reported after twenty years for love of God, do not look at this garbage
