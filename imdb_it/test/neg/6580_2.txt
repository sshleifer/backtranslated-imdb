I think Tom Hanks is a good actor. I enjoyed reading this book for my kids when they were little. I was very disappointed in the film. A character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of nails on a blackboard. There is a totally useless train / rollercoaster scene. There are some characters and scenes that seem scary for the children for whom this film was made. The North Pole scenes with Santa Claus and the elves could have been pretty and fascinating. There was absolutely no warmth or charm for these scenes or characters. It doesn't usually work to make a short book for children in a feature film. This film totally gratifies me.
