Oh dear. this was probably the worst movie I've seen in years. I mean what can be done more with the plot of the "woman inside the body"? he was full of clich√©s, for example the nerd who enters his sequence, the "boy" who is making him come and so on. I didn't call these spoilers because nobody could guess what happens !! the only thing that was happening was Laura Fraser, who gave an average performance. and as for the "dream" guy, that was the most humorous acting piece ever. even the bad ones were immediately forgettable. <br /> <br /> terrible movie.
