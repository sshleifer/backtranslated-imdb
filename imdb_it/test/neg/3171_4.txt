I think Homegrown is a bit of a misnomer for this movie - more like "Plantation Grown" - but it has practically not the same sound. My guide described it as a comedy, but the pathetic travails of these unfortunate fools are not my idea of ​​a belly laugh. More in the genre of the farce / drama thriller. The characters developed quite well - a cast of famous actors made it so-so promising, just a pity the plot was clearly absurd. Ted Danson provided a nice cameo as did Jamie Lee Curtis in his walk-on role. Jon Bon Jovi has this incredible ability to measure the THC content in the front seat of his car! I guess if you assimilated it a little earlier you should be able to sit through it - not for the paranoid guys who are shy of the gun though.
