***** I will reveal two "twists" at the end of the film. Don't read if you want to see this movie for some reason ***** <br /> <br /> Oh my, this is bad. And for some reason, Sean Bean, one of today's greatest actors, has sold his soul and appears in it. The only consolation is that the writers must have realized that someone ultimately pathetic like Steve Guttenberg would never have been able to aspire in his life to kill someone as cool as Sean Bean. Instead, he is killed in what must have seemed like a wonderful shot at the end, by the good boy who had to be killed by Bean, but in reality he was his boss and he simulated his own death. Don't worry I haven't ruined anything for you. The acting itself is extraordinarily compelling, with Guttenberg's tough man patented "Hey-look-I-can-pull-a-Chuck-Norris" which dominates most of the two hours of hell on earth. Added to a plot that I could have written while being tortured and hung upside down with both hands cut off, there is also a completely meaningless critical error in the fact that the virus will flee for a moment if they look at it badly, while another will moment, Steve Guttenberg is bravely running around with it, throwing, catching shots and generally abusing this "virus" that has the distinct appearance of a collection of those little balls of soap that you put in your bathroom. My last word? If you are depressed from the suicidal point of view and feel that you want to laugh manically about something that should be a bad comedy but even worse, record it the next time you are on channel 5 at midnight, then burn it when you realize that I'm really telling the truth .
