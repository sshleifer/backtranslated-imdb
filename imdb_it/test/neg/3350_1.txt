I received a copy of this film from a friend for my 21st birthday, which he had obviously picked up for 99p from a business videotape. <br /> <br /> I've never been so frustrated when watching a movie - it was boring, Adam West was wasted (literally) and, in retrospect, I can't remember a single thing about it. My lack of fun has grown to such an extent that when the credits rolled, we broke the tape and hung the tape around the living room. Only for good measure, we set fire to the cover.
