Number 1 was really great summer fun with popcorn. It was the modern Jaws. <br /> <br /> The number 2 is summarized by Jeff Goldblum in the film about being the most stupid idea in the history of stupid ideas (or something like that). <br /> <br /> Number 3 is the obituary notice ... JP has achieved everything it will ever be. <br /> <br /> Once they realized that they had no new ideas, they would have to let the dinosaurs lie. <br /> <br /> Having said that. The film is fine if you don't mind knowing you've seen it before. <br /> <br />
