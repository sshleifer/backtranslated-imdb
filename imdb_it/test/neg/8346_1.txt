Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Obviously this is not intentional though. It takes about half of the film for the main characters to realize how much the big hilly thing is in the center of the city is spreading red stuff and the other half spend diverting the flow of tears through the city using fire trucks (right at right). It definitely made me laugh. The acting makes Arnie look like an RSC actor. It is incredible that films like this are commissioned. A more interesting version would be someone approaching an active volcano and picking it up again, and it would probably cost about 20 pounds. ($ 40) I can see a guy throwing the film at a movie company "well there is this big VOLCANO and it breaks out in a CITY .... quite radical" If you can find it in the dollar containers, maybe it's worth it buying it as after watching this most movies would be nice.
