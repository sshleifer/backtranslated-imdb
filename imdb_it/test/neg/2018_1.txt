Dracula 3000 is the epitome of the painful cinema of cheese. From the beginning, I thought you were in something pretty bad. With a line-up that included Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio and Tiny Lister, what could one expect? Well, let's just say that expectations were crushed ... <br /> <br /> If I really started, I feel that this review will go on for years, so we'll keep this simple. The vampire isn't even called Dracula. The space crew transports coffins from the Carpathian sector of the Transylvania system. In his big scene, Coolio talks about the most horrible things we've ever talked about in the history of cinema. In the year 3000, everyone wears cheap clothes according to today's standards, they have nothing more advanced than a modern wheelchair and decorate with neon lights that seem to have been stolen from an ice rink. <br /> <br /> Go to the top all out ... the finish. Sweet merciful God. It doesn't deserve to be ruined. It must be credible. <br /> <br /> I voted this film as a "1" and I wish I could give it a zero ... yet I feel compelled to make you look. What madness is this?
