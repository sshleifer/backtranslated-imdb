for people who have absolutely no idea what a comedy is. This includes not only the people who liked this film, but also the people who created it. What could they have thought? Madonna playing Judy Holliday? Please, can't even play MADONNA (if in reality there is a Madonna). I hope Griffin Dunne has been paid well. He deserved every penny he got, because if this didn't kill his career, nothing will. I'm sure the few people who actually paid to watch this movie left them with the feeling that their pockets had been chosen. Apparently Madonna is not at all embarrassed by her almost total lack of talent as an actress, but you can't feel embarrassed for her anyway. It has no connection with the rest of the cast; looks like she showed up on the set and said, "OK, I'm here, I'll be embarrassed by making the utterly worse impression that Judy Holliday has ever seen, now stay away from my road" and then I went on doing exactly that I know the phrase "Madonna's rotten movie" is redundant, but it certainly fits that. It is painful to see an actress totally inept and without talent make a complete fool of herself, but apparently does not bother her, as she does it again and again. <br /> <br /> The only remotely funny thing about this "comedy" is that it actually managed to find people who gave it the money to make it. Now it's fun.
