Yet another production of Lo Wei to completely waste the talents of a young Jackie Chan, To Kill With Intrigue is a strange mix of wuxia, melodrama, supernatural action and simple kung fu fights from the old school that is quite boring despite different monsters surreal moments of the WTF and a lot of ridiculously bad dialogues. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to protect his pregnant girlfriend Chin Chin of the Killer Bees, a band of ruthless assassins who are about to attack his home, Cao Lei (Jackie Chan) pretends to be a heartless cad, taking her away , thus saving it from danger. <br /> <br /> During the attack, Cao's relatives are all killed, but he remained relatively unharmed by the gang, whose leader, a scar -the woman with the features, seems to have his ass for him. Cao then goes in search of Chin Chin, whose security he entrusted to his dear friend Chu Chuk. <br /> <br /> During his quest to find his true love, Cao befriends the head of a courier company whose precious cargo was stolen by the leader of the evil "Bloody Rain" clan. In the end, after being wounded in a fight against members of the evil clan (a funny scene with a lot of silly weapons), and then cured by Killer Bee (who shows his love by burning his face!) In the end, Cao he learns that he is a bad judge of character: his friend Chu Chuk is nothing but the powerful hungry leader of the 'Bloody Rain' clan, who intends to marry Chin Chin himself. <br /> <br /> Cue the fought culminating battle, with Cao kicked in the face several times before finally choking his traitor ex-friend to death with a scarf. <br /> <br /> Even die hard fans Chan will find this a task to sit, with only the final fight managing to show some of the incredible acrobatic skills of the star. Fans of the general Asian strangeness could dig up the ghostly appearance of the killer bees at the beginning of the film (with a character that inexplicably requires his severed hand!), Or the moment when three men float through a window to attack our hero , but, for the most part, this film will have very limited appeal.
