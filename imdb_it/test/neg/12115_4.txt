The childish plot was torn from a limping Hollywood movie, terrible acting, poor dialogues and non-equal sex scenes. Exactly, another great softcore parody! I really enjoyed this movie! Of course the acting is terrible, but that part of the fun! The plot is ridiculous, but some things must be sacrificed when the story has to revolve around female scenes. And since it's just softcore (no penetration) the sex scenes were a bit insipid. But it's like the great softcore god Russ Meyers said "who really cares what goes down under the waist". I don't know if I would agree with Mr. Meyers about this, but what the hell ... the movie entertained me for an hour and a half. I gave him a C +, it would have been a solid B if they could throw more girls to look like Russ Meyers actresses. VaVoom! VaVoom! ~
