"The Ballad of the Sad Café" worked hard on his image, but when he arrived at the crunch, he was left standing in his own self-created dust. <br /> <br /> You can't imagine saying this out loud, but if Vanessa Redgrave's Amelia were to fight John Wayne or even Clint Eastwood, my hard-earned dollars would have to go to Redgrave. His portrait of Amelia was the closest to perfection and consumed with a more detailed dedication than what most actors are willing to give to anyone with a multi-million dollar contract. Redgrave gave Amelia that irresistible accent that was a mixture of her unique voice and a sweaty South Korean woman. For the average viewer, this could be interpreted as annoying, but as the film progressed it became her ?? Miss Amelia transforms this scenic beauty into a roughneck. Was it the performance of Redgrave, as well as his interaction with the other characters, that made this film high? but not the highest. The others who followed his performance were necessary, but they were not stellar. As we passed beyond the dark cliché image transmitted by all the set designers for the post-Depression of the South, the minor characters looked like posters. The image was necessary to set the scene, but the characters of the city had no other purpose. Take for example the vision of Rod Steiger of an old, savage spoken preacher. Only his scenes will doubt the validity of this city off the beaten track. The two main players who surrounded Amelia fought with the charm for the admirable top-top moment of the scene, but because of the lack of direction ?? it just seemed faded. The most absurd of the two (although both in first place in the questionable sanity line) is Cork Hubbard who plays Amelia's "cousin" who happens to be casually a night. His character is never completely defined, he lacks the true motivation, and his loyalty remains uncertain. He plays no vital role in this film, outside of forcing us, the spectators, to question his sanity and his honesty. Will you be able to create a character simply by letting your tongue come out, making your ears snap and hitting your chest and head? Finally, is there the other end of the absurd ?? Keith Carradine. Callow's close-ups of this tormented man build a character, but our lack of understanding between him and Amelia causes his purpose to wander. These were the characters, as clichés as they were southern ?? some have come forward and tried to create an absurd vintage piece, and I can't say that they failed. <br /> <br /> Where "Ballad of the Sad Café" failed to overcome the mediocrity it was in cinematography and fiction. This film was about Amelia and her need for other souls in her life. Was the level of public comfort with his dwarf cousin's arrival fun? one couldn't help but wonder if he was honest or simply an attempt to challenge a warm heart. The character of Cork Hubbard is never fully understood, but we accept it with short strokes of him and Amelia doing little things together. It is his idea that turns from a recluse business woman into a bona fide coffee owner. The problem is that director Callow never brings us enough to the dramatic level between Cork and Redgrave ?? Is the man crazy or does he represent the whole family of Amelia? I needed something from Callow to bring these two out of David Lynch's report they had. Then our pool gets even deeper with the addition of Carradine as Amelia's "love interest". Using the flashback technique in a flashback, do we see the two marry, but never consummated their love ?? what anger Amelia against their love attracts him to the world of madness. Why was Amelia so angry? Why was there no connection between Carradine and Redgrave? Why was this also in the film? With the lack of attention to the connection of these characters, did the final scenes between the two make no sense? throw the choice of Cork and everything becomes completely out of shape. While there were some beautiful choreographic scenes created by Callow, the inability to transfer his characters from point A to point B. I lost attention, interest, and my caring for the characters collapsed when I didn't understand the last question ?? "why"? <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Ballad of the Sad Café" started with a bang, but ended with a very small crack of a firecracker. My emotional sensation of this movie has swung up and down, up and down, and eventually stayed lower mainly due to the lack of understanding of the characters' motives. Redgrave did a phenomenal job like Amelia, and while the other characters (outside of the random Steiger) did their best, I didn't really know who they were. Their motivations were so confused that at the end of the emotional end, I was apathetic. Director Callow seemed to lack the ability to import connection scenes that allowed us to understand the dynamic relationship between all our main players. Callow created some beautiful scenes where the faces seemed to overlap the scenery, which allowed us to focus on Amelia ?? or Carradine, but nothing has been explained or developed. The film was interpreted with anger, discovery, happiness, flashback, anger, anger, anger, fading. Without comparative connectors, this turned from a distinguished period film to actors playing parts in front of the camera. It was a pity, because "Sad Café" had the promise, it simply could not be delivered. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** ½ on *****
