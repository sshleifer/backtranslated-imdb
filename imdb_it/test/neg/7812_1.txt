To be honest, I couldn't bear to watch this movie until the end, so I have no idea if suddenly it gets better halfway through the movie. But the first 30 minutes or so are among the worst I've seen in a while. Children under the age of twelve could get a badly written, recited and directed kick of slapstick humor, but adults in full control of all their faculties should avoid this stink.
