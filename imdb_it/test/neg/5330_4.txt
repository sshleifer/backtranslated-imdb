I was tricked into watching this by the many friendly reviews here. Boy, they are far away! Giving this 9 to 10 points and calling it "one of the best films of the 90s" is unjustifiable. The big problem here is the lack of rhythm and a very thin plot. It's like slapstick on Prozac. Everything moves in a predictable and listless way. The plot is weak to begin with - two street sweepers peek over their skin neighbor, witness a murder and destroy a waste disposal conspiracy - and the film never manages to go much further. There are some funny situations and decent acting, but it's not even close enough to save this movie ride. <br /> <br /> It is simply a comedy that does not take your ass off the ground, so why waste your time?
