Start with the premise that you will do anything to replace your lost love with a double. Throw your scientific knowledge of a deforming disease (this is not the substance that Leo G. Carroll has contracted with the poison of the spider in "Tarantula"). He thinks that the main character, instead of finding a way to attract the young woman, engages in heavy stalking, until he draws attention to himself and has to harbor this crazy plot: if he can make the girl's father sick so help him recover, she will marry him. The problem is that most events are random and unpredictable. Anyone with a half brain would have seen through things. There is a third party, a woman whom the doctor, played by J. Carroll Naish, has treated with great insensitivity. You know it will be a factor. There is also a gorilla kept in a cage that is occasionally used for heaven knows what. Oh good. There is so little sense for this thing that is played and people get their sweets.
