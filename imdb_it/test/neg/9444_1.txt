Ed Wood, perhaps the worst film director of all time, has left us gems that are SO bad, delight, are unintentionally funny and therefore fascinating and innocent. James Lay and his financial supporters (mom and dad), seems to be in the credits) have created in "Dreamland" a film just as badly made of any film by Ed Wood, but without charm or innocence. Dreamland simply stinks, and the only good thing about this 90-minute waste of time is the certainty that James Lay and his colleagues will never take another picture. <br /> <br /> I have to mention some of the dramatic lengths that some crew members have used to avoid being associated with this horrible image. I'm sure the production controller, once he saw the complete film, asked to change his name in the credits of "Donna Snartlebutt" and the accounting of "Brutus". One can imagine "Brutus" with his 5 dollar roll paying the crew at the end of a day of shooting. <br /> <br /> I will not mention the many technical problems with this pathetic videotape, but I must mention a few comments that compare this slag with the work of David Lynch. You know you became a real stinker when you had your mom registered with IMDb and you have published some amazing BS - nobody, except violent mental patients, could "exchange" the "land of dreams" with -all-produced by Lynch. What a horrible lightness against Mr. Lynch and his work. <br /> <br /> Back to film school, Mr. Lay.
