"The Chilling", directed by Deland Nuse and Jack A. Sunseri, is one of the worst zombie movies I've ever seen. Because Linda Blair ("The Exorcist", "Witchery") has appeared in this stinker is beyond me. The plot is really stupid: the frozen bodies in a cryogenic laboratory are revived after light strikes and turned into cannibal zombies. The characters are completely one-dimensional and stupid, the zombies look horrible and there is no blood. Avoid this cheap piece of junk like the plague. My vote: 1 out of 10.
