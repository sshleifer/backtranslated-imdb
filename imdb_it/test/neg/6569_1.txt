Leonard Nimoy directed Star Trek III, which wasn't bad at all. Perhaps William Shatner thought it looked like Nimoy did. After watching this film he should have reversed this decision. <br /> <br /> Star Trek V The final frontier is the worst in the series. The acting of all those involved, including those like Shatner and Nimoy, is bad and faded and makes them look as old as they seem in real life, the special effects are in bad taste like when Spock must save Kirk on a jet pack when he falls from a mountain. <br /> <br /> Attempts at humor have been pitiful and the story is so terrible that I can't stand thinking about what fundamentally involves a Vulcan who steals the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I didn't take care of everything this film and, not to mention Uhura, does a belly dance to distract the male guards. He seemed to be participating in a grandma competition. If they wanted to make her look sexy. They were wrong. It looked grotesque. <br /> <br /> How this came into production or even written ... well, it doesn't bear the thought. The only good place for this film is in the trash. The worst in the series.
