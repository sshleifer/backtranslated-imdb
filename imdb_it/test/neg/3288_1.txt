I would mark this show as horrible if it were not for the fact that it is on the same network as Arrested Development. Because it is on FOX and is renewing itself while AD has been canceled. <br /> <br /> It is absolutely beyond words how atrocious this show is. But let me try and describe it. Get a very low rate of Archie Bunker and let him discover the humor that would have been overcome if he were in Married with Children. Then take dashed lines from AD (the son has an ugly and boring girl) and shut up because idiots watching sitcoms can understand them. <br /> <br /> If you look at this, I will have completely lost respect for you, like your family should. However, if you are a fan, you should love the new FOX comedy "Til Death". It sounds really fun, avant-garde stuff. I mean, married couples don't get along ... brilliant.
