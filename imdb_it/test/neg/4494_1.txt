This film serves every conceivable Greek stereotype. In a particularly irritating scene the magnate says "I'm just an ignorant peasant". As a grandson of Greek peasant immigrants who transmitted a legacy of wisdom and love to their children and grandchildren, I found this film despicable and hateful.
