The director Lo Wei was known to read the tender documents and take a nap on the set - he tells us something about his "approach to the cinema, eh?" The reviews I've read are divided into two categories: 1) this is such a bad movie, it's funny, or 2) this is such a bad film that it's boring. <br /> <br /> So let's get to the point we all agree - this movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> I vote for category 2). The story is almost incomprehensibly complex, and it is further destroyed and distorted by very mediocre work and camera editing, but Lo Wei was so in love with it that he slowed down the pace so that we can all have a long look at it, whether we want it or not. <br /> <br /> Maybe Lo Wei was upset that the movie (or two) had been made - he just wanted to make everyone, the cast, the crew and the audience suffer the same way. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the agony.
