If you like me I like films with plots and convincing actors, then Alien Vs Predator Requiem is probably not the way to go. In short, alien lands in the typical American city, Predator lands in the American city, both have a bit of a fight, the US government blows up the city, some run away ... I'm sorry, I think I could ruin the end. It is easy to criticize someone who is critical; people scream, I bet you couldn't do better! I bet I could! Having made this film, he looked at it and then turned to congratulate each other with a pat on the back and a job well done; there must surely have been the specter of madness in the room.
