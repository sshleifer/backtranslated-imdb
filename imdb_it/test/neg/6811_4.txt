I'll give this: I haven't stopped watching, and it's not corporate, which is pretty interesting. But my internal critic tore him to pieces - I suppose I see too many films. The wooden script, the jargon is a kind of clang that comes out of the mouth without any kind of flow. The assembly, mentioned before, is inconstant; sometimes it evokes a good ghetto feeling, but above all its irritants - jerky, eccentric corners and really boring and persistent facial close-ups. The actors were marginal, although Letisha had her moments. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why the public should care about Curtis, it's a total failure and the actor is completely expressionless and not particularly funny or engaging. The direction does not help to make you love or hate it, too; I just wanted him to shut up and shoot himself already. I didn't care about his helpless revenge when it spread. The completely predictable ending is not at all credible. I'm not sure why we should believe that some of the previous successful depositing merchants are stupid enough to fall in love with his little scams. "Oh, you just got out of jail and you're on probation? Here are thousands of cocaine dollars, go run around the corner for me. Now don't steal from me, etc." <br /> <br /> A good sex scene at the beginning gave me hope, but in the end it was disappointed. Managing a rape scene was a bit of an eyebrow, even if only slightly interesting. There are better films in this genre that do not offend your intelligence by proving a sort of real ghetto realism, while they look more like an offer from a film school. 4/10, a F.
