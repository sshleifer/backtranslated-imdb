When the exploiters become evangelists, they still exploit in the name of poverty! <br /> <br /> My first reaction after seeing the movie is ?? God bless me that I'm not eating fish or non-vegetarian products! <br /> <br /> The documentary speaks of Tanzania's Lake Victoria, where numerous varieties of adorable fish lived, and one day during the 1960s someone arrived and injected the powerful perch, which became the exportable product for Tanzania to Europe and Japanese markets. The consequences were serious ?? first, all the small and large local fish were extinct; secondly, the plane that came to get the fish could not travel empty because it has no commercial / entrepreneurial / capitalist sense, so it is full of weapons and ammunition (this is what Europe can give to this world); thirdly, pilots (like all migrants and the traveling population like truck drivers) must survive their sexual needs by making local African prostitutes flourish at low prices; fourthly, the mediators, the merchants, the intermediaries of the chain (above all businessmen of Indian origin) become richer and the poverty of Tanzania remains the same; the fifth poverty pushes children to crime, to drugs, etc. <br /> <br /> The premise for making this documentary was excellent. But did director Hubert Sauper manage to make a good documentary? It's a big NO. <br /> <br /> I say the reasons: as in India, it requires a superior group of Brahmin to stand up and project towards the world, Indian poverty and the untouchables; in the same way, a European documentary born austrain is needed to tell the world the history of Tanzania and its economy and poverty in ruins and in ruins. It is the pathetic cause of unconscious breeding of that rich class (which has never seen poverty or known poor), which survives, lives, gains and fame as a parasite clinging to project poverty to the world as soon as it sees it. There is nothing more than to despise poor people in Africa and India who see such images of theirs. <br /> <br /> Hubert's intention and motivation seem to be totally inconsistent. The images, the characters, the premises, the interviews are too serious and dark, dark and disturbing. Use exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present your case. What we feel in the end is pity and sadness for Africans. We also begin to consider the government and the people of Tanzania as evil. Perhaps some Westerners sitting in their air-conditioned rooms will find time to discuss and discuss the pathetic living conditions of Africans, but there would be nothing more. <br /> <br /> Does the director just show up once on the screen ?? so as not to be identified among the Europeans who exploit this poor country. <br /> <br /> This director Hubert can survive only as an exploiter like the media giants of CNN and today's BCC. Hubert had no guts or common sense to talk to the Europeans who eat or the companies that import these fish products. An inconsistent effort and no skids! But do I understand the reasons for it ?? Hubert just wanted to earn his fame by sitting down and smiling with prizes in his European comfort. <br /> <br /> No more words to spare for this pathetic effort. I reluctantly give the documentary a higher score of 3.5 stars out of 10, just because the theme was correct; but he was pathetically exploited and swept away by a badly designed amateur director made exclusively for a non-intelligent Western audience! (Stars 3.5 out of 10)
