OK from an American point of view, which I assume doesn't know much about rugby, this would be a fantastic movie for them. First of all, the typical good coach who tries to change the bad guy has had a good heart. HOWEVER from where I come from rugby is sport number one, it's a way of life is a game played only by the bravest and the victorious are hailed as heroes as if Americans were doing for their baseball / basketball stars. I'm not sure it was the economic budget or maybe the director or actors knew very little about rugby and being a lifelong rugby fan I see that some of the actors didn't even know that rugby existed before starring in this movie . In conclusion, this film was terrible. If you look at it and think it was fantastic, please go online and maybe Google "All Blacks" this is the New Zealand national team and those who made haka famous. Believe me, they'll make the Highlands kids look like school girls.
