I saw the biography of Ed Wood many years ago. Tim Burton paid tribute to this extremely talented but enthusiastic director. <br /> <br /> Then I saw Plan 9 and actually tickled me to the end. A stupid story, a kind of bad production value, but still fun and even fun. <br /> <br /> So this. What can you do with it? Well, since Wood has been reported as a cross-dresser, it's surprising to see a movie that treats him as a cartoon. Yes, there are some stabs in teaching the public something about the subject, but mostly this is a sort of really distorted parody. <br /> <br /> One of his problems is that he has a hundred points of view. On the one hand it is a request for tolerance. Another portrays transvestism as an illness. And finally, he tells the audience: "Okay, if you're shocked now, then wait until you see this!" The problem must be that Wood had to compromise in order to make the film. You can almost feel it when you see the producer opening title: Personally supervised by ... So, where we are. This is not a serious subject film or an all-out schocker. <br /> <br /> The value of entertainment is practically nil. The wooden voice is slightly funny, but only because it sounds so bad. This was done in the 1950s, so it can be argued that it was courageous to make a film that also mentioned the word transvestite. It all boils down to what the film itself is trying to defend. Schock. The rape scene, while the mild is simply there to do it. <br /> <br /> So, I'm sorry. This is a bonfire but it's not just Wood's discredit.
