Heart of Darkness, a short novel written by Joseph Conrad on greed, corruption and travel through Africa was, to say the least, a boring read. The Narrator follows Marlow, a sailor who travels deep into Africa to save Kurtz, a bit of an ivory merchant prodigy who presumably has gone mad, this conclusion arose when Ivory stopped entering the main port. The basis of the story is that Conrad is writing generously around, he created the scene beautifully, but maybe a little too much. The story seemed more like a water color painting, as it appealed to the slow, creeping action story that Conrad might have wanted to accomplish. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it happens that after reading a book, maybe watching the function, the film could help to match some thoughts with those in the book or vice versa. Not so with Heart of Darkness, even with the supporting role of the masterpiece actor John Malkovich, the film only confused me more, there seemed to be no main characters in the film, no one stood out from the others, not from the vast symbolism he explained . It was rather bland and unpleasant to say the least. <br /> <br /> Respectfully for the Author, The Heart of Darkness is a true masterpiece of a short novel, touching on some very strict subjects, Marlow's lies and Kurtz's greed. It is not a book to be taken lightly, and it will put you in a good mood. A book like this could be heavy for many people. I would still recommend this book to those who crave a sad story of action without a happy textbook ending.
