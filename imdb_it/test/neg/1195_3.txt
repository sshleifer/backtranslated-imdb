If the League had been unknown to launch this script, the supporters would have simply turned around and said "no - you don't have the money - that's terrible". As a fan of the League of Gentlemen, this is their poorest exit to date. Not particularly funny, not particularly funny, there are few laughs out loud. They exist, but they are few and far between. I felt that the format was tired and really enthralling. The film refers to the writers bored by the characters and shows. As for being a movie. I heard that the Christmas special had a better production value; the FX are generally quite poor and it is clearly obvious that they did not film in the original Royston Vasey (they shot this cheap film in Ireland). The musical score is weak and the dialogue is terrible. Moreover, the accents of the characters were largely far from their TV equivalents. Tubs and Edward, very underused (again), didn't look like themselves. Really disappointing, because I was hoping for something much more fun. This was really the equivalent of the league of the comedies of the 70s in which the cast went to Spain ...
