This film is certainly a strange one to say the least. The basic plot is made up of 3 old business associates who invite 2 strangers into their home to return a lost wallet with $ 10 in it. The two who show themselves fall in love. The 3 older businessmen die and return as ghosts to try to help the two young guests. Okay, so it might make sense, but then we have 3 old men who apparently have some bread that lives together ... it's really weird here ... Harry Carey plays his basic part, you can't tell if he's a good guy or really a sting. I really mean, you decide I can do it. Then there's Richard Carlson who plays James Houston from Texas .... hmmmmm, he looks more like a gentleman from southern Kentucky than a person from Texas. This is not even close ... Then we take the 3 ghosts that would have more chances to help the New Orleans Saints win a game rather than lend a hand ... In fact they are not really of any help and because they are also in the film is beyond any field of knowledge .. Silly film in which a cast of characters play totally out of character..You can avoid this ..
