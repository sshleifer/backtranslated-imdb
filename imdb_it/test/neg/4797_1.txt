I went to watch this movie on Matchstick Men, buying tickets for Matchstick Men and going to the other, because it seemed like a funny movie with action, romance, chills, jungles and exotic places. They had all this but also many films with a conception of history. <br /> <br /> All I can say is WHY BECAUSE WHY they didn't do a simple narrative instead of a story of weak flashbacks. <br /> <br /> Here are all the films from what I saw the film derived from: Naturally, Indiana Jones and Romancing the Stone, but also True Lies, Proof of Life, that old Tom Selleck movie from the 80s , Bananas (Woody Allen) and Hero (from the use of digital extras). <br /> <br /> PS the only scene in the movie that was beautiful is when the central character finds his room exploded.
