This movie is terrible. He has absolutely zero laughs. Hebrew Hammer (Adam Goldberg) leaves to save Hannukah from Evil Santa (Andy Dick). Perhaps a fairly promising basis for a plot, in reality the film does not progress beyond this premise. While there are some (very, few) nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent, it is laborious, trite and eventually unreasonably boring. This despite the fact that Goldberg, Dick and Greer (Hammer's client / love interest) all have a rather considerable on-screen presence. Despite being interpreted for what could be described as an exaggerated gag, this film is always a medium-to-high street-level den. DO NOT waste 85 minutes of your life on this. (note - the music was good ..!)
