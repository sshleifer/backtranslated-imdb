As a fan of flying and war movies, this is at the top of my list. It is historically completely inaccurate and the cast plays and behaves as if they had just emerged from a high school work. The acting, the script, the direction, the production standards and the cast are all waste. The only thing that saves is some of the flight sequences. If the people they portray were fictitious, I could classify them as 2, but if there is one thing that bothers me more than anything in the movies, it's pretended that this is history and that the great people they're trying to be, actually done! It is almost as if they were trying to write as many characters as possible from the First World War. There are many good flying films from the First World War and this is NOT one of them.
