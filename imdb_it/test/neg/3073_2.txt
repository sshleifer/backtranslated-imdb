Some films are made so badly that they are only watchable for the cringe factor. The disciples made me shiver so much that I didn't feel comfortable. I saw everything in disbelief at what I was watching, no one knew how bad it was while they were filming? Mixing the most popular performances of the actors in wood, an abysmal script were all the comments of all the "actors" played as if they came from the same character and the most hasty montage that tried (and failed bigtime) to give the film a rhythm. All this combined in a film that will rob you of a few hours of your life and will not give anything back. Avoid at EVERY cost.
