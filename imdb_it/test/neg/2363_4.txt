Now any fan of Blaxploiation will recognize the ingredients: great Afros, topless girls, surreal fashions and some 'jive' speeches. In this case add a protagonist who can't act, a plot that makes little sense, the editing of someone without hands that has been blindfolded and the most terrible fight scenes and you have "TNT Jackson". Not bad enough to be good, but not good enough to be bad, that's a mess from start to finish. I particularly appreciated the endless errors of continuity and the double white of the stunts. <br /> <br /> This is how the far-eastern bad martial arts of the 70s meet the black power that hurts, but the boy does so badly! I am ashamed to admit that I almost liked it.
