When I checked the review of this film after I watched it, I was surprised that there were people who gave good grades. <br /> <br /> This is a bad work-room movie. Everything 'scary' happens off the screen, usually accompanied by a close-up of someone shouting "Did you see / hear?" Well, no, we haven't seen it! We can not! And when there were no close-ups, the camera was doing something strange like turning upside down, or shaking really, really fast, to transmit an action or to make us physically sick. <br /> <br /> The characters were unlikely because every two minutes, they started screaming the same thing over and over again. I don't care if that's what it really is, I haven't rented a scary movie to see reasonable things! I expect unreasonable things, like aliens, demons or good acting! They too were stupid ... Let's go and have intimate relationships in a cave! With all our clothes! By the way, the ending somehow contradicts what Domingo said just before he died. This annoyed me a bit, though not as much as the fact that the ending caused a ... serious invasion of a girl's privacy. <br /> <br /> No plot, no climax, no acting, terrible camera -work. What's left? Oh right. The ending may have had a "breakthrough", but generally with horror films, the turning point in the end actually has an understandable relevance to what happened during the film. Sixth Sense fa - explains a lot. Even Hide and Seek. But the Cave had a touch of lame that served as an "explanation", if you could call it that. Explain. Everything. <br /> <br /> Not seeing it. Please.
