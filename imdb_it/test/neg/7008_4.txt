The female cast of this film is terrifying: you have Linda Blair (who is maturing well), Julie Strain (who doesn't have too many talking phrases - that's a good thing), Rochelle Swanson (just as convincing as a sweet innocent girl or a damn possessed girl), Toni Napoli, and the most beautiful of all IMOs, the amazing Kristina Ducati (the way the goofy protagonist, Larry Poindexter, deserved to be sexually involved in one of these women remains a mystery). However, in addition to the chance to see these beautiful and in some cases talented women, the film has little to offer. The plot is disjoint and doesn't really start in the last 15 minutes or so; and when Wynorski finally manages to create some suspense, there comes a ridiculous final "twist" that ruins everything.
