I have to admit that I didn't pay close attention to everything that happens in this film, but to be honest, I don't think it would have mattered. Basically local councilor Sidney Fiddler (Sid James) persuades Firecombe's incompetent mayor Frederick Bumble (Kenneth Connor) to hold a beauty contest to improve the image of the city. They face the opposition of female liberationist Augusta Prodworthy (June Whitfield) who tries to sabotage the competition, but they have advertising agent Peter Potter (Bernard Bresslaw) and the owner of the hotel Palace Connie Philpotts (Joan Sims). Soon the young, beautiful models of aspirants arrive, including Hope Springs (Barbara Windsor), Paula Perkins (Valerie Leon), Dawn Brakes (Goldfinger's Margaret Nolan), Debra (Sally Geeson) and Ida Downs (EastEnders' Wendy Richard). When the girls fight with cats, they attract the habitual residents, but after some time when they can't make those funny allusions and William (Jack Douglas) who has too active spasms, finally reaches the competition, and it's only after that I could not be disturbed. Patsy Rowlands also played Mildred Bumble, Peter Butterworth in the role of Admiral, Joan Hickson as Mrs. Dukes, David Lodge as police inspector, Angela Grant as Miss Bangor, Arnold Ridley as counselor Pratt, Robin Askwith in the role of Larry, Patricia Franklin in the role of Rosemary, Jimmy Logan as Cecil Gaybody and Bill Pertwee of Dad's army as head of the fire brigade, Charles Hawtrey had obviously left the Carry Ons, but where is Kenneth Williams? I imagine seeing Babs and the young, beautiful Pauline Fowler in a bikini, but for the value of the comedy, this fails miserably, and excessive use of the girl's whistle gets on your nerves. Poor enough!
