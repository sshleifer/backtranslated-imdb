Where to start? Some have an Indian dish that is cleaning and suddenly Skeletor attacks. Strikes a woman at the neck with an ax, falls down, but then gets up and is apparently unharmed. He runs into the woods, and it turns out that there is the basement of a shopping center out there in the woods. Meet an operator and Skeletor attacks again. Fortunately, like any good operator, he has a gun and shoots the boy. It doesn't work, everything starts to fire. <br /> <br /> Cut some people walking in the woods. Even if they have been walking together for a while, they sit and introduce each other. Wouldn't they probably have done it when they first met? In any case, they are members of the Delta team "under cover" (under cover, I suppose, because in this way they don't have to pay to dress them in uniform). Pretty girls are various things like a sniper school instructor and, oh, I can't remember the rest. It does not matter. Eventually everyone takes up arms and immediately start looking at various things. ? However, they meet an old Indian who is sitting in the woods. He wants beans. You know, like pork and beans? He mumbles some things, I can only assume that it is the premise of the film. I relied on having listened to the premise of advertising, because you can't really understand what it says. <br /> <br /> So, they still walk a little in the woods. The whole dialogue is a load of quasi-military, macho BS. I mean everything, as in every single word. Like "This reminds me of when we were in Kabul" or "This reminds me of when we were in Laos". Skeletor attacks again. Let me give you a rundown of a basic attack. One of the female characters is huddled behind a tree and points the gun at the man approaching the horse. For some reason, she doesn't shoot but screams several times for someone else. Then, as Skeletor approaches, she jumps from behind the tree so that Skeletor can attack her with his spear. Then everyone starts shooting. Bullets make sparks fly from trees. Apparently the people who made this film never shot a tree with a bullet. They don't make sparks. <br /> <br /> Then Casper Van Diem is suddenly driving a semi-truck, trying to run over Skeletor. He misses and the truck stops. Van Diem is injured, apparently he slipped the seat and hit the hip on the window crank or something, so he got out of the truck and exploded. Later it is in the woods that die and everyone says a group of quasi-military, macho BS. They meet a couple of boys in the woods and blow their "undercover" status by immediately identifying themselves as if they were in the army. They beat the boys for some reason, then they leave. <br /> <br /> Other things happen, people grumble, the camera shakes, etc. <br /> <br /> I think this is a My theory is that the Sci-Fi Channel is a bit bothered by anyone hitting their movies, so they did it to remind us all how much they really can be bad movies. Do you like it, do you think our films are bad? Well, you didn't see bad. HERE !!! Ok, now that we're out of the way, the rest of our films are pretty good by comparison, right? <br /> <br /> Well, it's just a theory.
