Frightmare begins with an icon of a horror movie that kills a director and then his servant before he is buried. This icon, which has some qualities of Christopher Lee, continues to haunt those around him when a group of students from the horror film company steal his body from the mausoleum in which it is located. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes are well filmed, good writing and lots of potential for murderous chaos. But the film drags itself in the middle (although fortunately not as much as "House of Death") and never really gets that initial injection of energy. <br /> <br /> Many deaths are confused, as they seem to cause people to be frightened when they see a floating coffin or other strange stuff. We see poisonous gas used twice. But the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters he has played. Boy, is that fake ad, unless he spent his career playing old boring naps and watching "Matlock". <br /> <br /> The general principle of the film is decent: the boys of the horror society who steal a dead body of a dead icon. A modern equivalent (digging Vincent Price or Peter Cushing) would be a great film. Perhaps a remake is in order if this were not too disrespectful. Sometimes the theory does not meet as well in the application, and this film offers that example. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming quality of this film (besides the beginning) is the brief appearance of a very young Jeffrey Combs. I saw it and thought "it's Jeffrey Combs", but I heard that I was wrong because the box never mentioned it. But surely, Combs was present. (A note to the filmmakers of this movie: quote Combs on the DVD cover, you will sell more copies if you deceive the customers.) If you are a tough Jeffrey Combs, check out this initial role. Otherwise, I can't offer it as a great selection for a horror movie marathon. Allow me to suggest "Intruder" or "Popcorn", as they are both quite decent and will stand the test of time.
