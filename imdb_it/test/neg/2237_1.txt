I went to see the movie because my boyfriend was excited about how much he wanted to see it, and how his friends had already been and loved him. So I came in neutral, not expecting the worst. Unfortunately, this is what I got. I could write a 15-page article about why this is easily the best movie I've ever seen. But to your advantage I will point out the pros and the endless supply of disadvantages. To begin with, the acting was very good, especially Christopher Waltz and Melanie Laurent. There were also a few lines that deserved a laugh and a couple of suspense scenes. Unfortunately, good acting, a bit of humor and suspense is where the good points end. The whole initial story could have been great. The family of a Jewish girl is massacred, hides, then meets the man responsible for her pain and then makes a great plan for revenge. Sounds very good. But the film would not be as "satisfying" for Americans and Nazi bloodthirsty Jews. I have no problem with WWII movies or killing the Nazis; I saw Defiance and I like it a lot. However, it is the way and the attitude with which our would-be heroes kill. I will give you a first example of the kind of hypocrisy that this film exudes. Our gang of thugs seizes a German unit and kills / scratches all but one sergeant and two other soldiers (no problem so far). They ask the sergeant to disclose information about another German unit. When he "respectfully refuses" to betray the lives of his comrades, they slap his head with a baseball bat, cheering and cursing as if they were at a football game. They took that Nazi head, yaayay! Now let's look at the hypocrisy in that scene. Here is a hypothetical situation: a group of American soldiers is ambushed and captured by the enemy. The same scenario follows and the American commanding officer would rather die than betray his comrade. The enemy hits his head with many celebrations. This would infuriate an audience if this scene were in a movie. That American soldier was a hero for putting his men on himself, and those barbarians brutally murdered him! Well, what about the Nazi sergeant? Well, he's a Nazi and deserves the cruellest possible death, right? Coincidentally, the Nazis felt the same way about the Jews. Do you see hypocrisy? Celebrating the Nazi butcher we are placing ourselves on the same sadistic level. <br /> <br /> Major hypocrisy # 2: The Nazis make a propaganda film about a German sniper who kills about 300 American soldiers. Towards the end of the film, the film is revealed. Hitler and his cohorts giggle with joy as they watch an American soldier being shot out of a window and fall into a fountain. The Nazis are cheering as a soldier after the soldier falls to the sniper's ability. This should cheat American viewers of this scene. Those evil Nazis are laughing at the death of our brave men! Well, the irony is, isn't that what we were doing (or supposed to be doing) the whole time we're watching Inglorious Basterds? Laugh at the pain of others simply because they were "the bad guys". How would we feel if the Native Americans somehow made a hit movie that sparked bloody revenge on American settlers? Or if blacks made a film that glorified the Nat Turner Rebellion? OK enough for hypocritical flaws. <br /> <br /> I will summarize other reasons for the 1-star rating. 1) There were admirable characters throughout the film. Brad Pitt even tortures a woman by sticking her finger in his gunshot wound because he suspects her of having betrayed him. Is he the good guy? 2) Scenes dragged along a path longer than necessary. 3) Brad Pitt's southern emphasis on the alleged Tennessee is HORRIBLE and absolutely annoying throughout the move. Now I've been leaving since I'm 700 words. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it seems that the general population no longer thinks, they just want blood. And this is why this film received such a high score. I recommend this film for the ignorant or if you are a Jew and simply want to see a beautiful "fantasy of justice". Personally, when I finally left the cinema, I felt like I had been scalped (or I wanted to do it so I wouldn't have suffered more than 2 hours of mental rape).
