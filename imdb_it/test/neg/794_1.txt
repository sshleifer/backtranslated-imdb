THE BOX (2009) * Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella, James Rebhorn, Holmes Osborne, Sam Oz Stone, Celia Weston. Really disappointing adaptation of the science fiction film "Button, Button" by Richard Matheson, legend of the genre, by phantasmagoric filmmaker Richard Kelly, who really puts out a small piece well done in a WTF'-a-thon! The mysterious (and ridiculously mutilated!) Man, Langella, postulates a million-dollar offer to the "fighting" couple Diaz and Marsden (both surprisingly vanilla to the hilt!): A box with a red button, which when pushed, it will kill some stranger in the world (!) Sure strings are attached but does it really count here? What is it because in the name of God he is troweling Kelly on so much strangeness (eg blood from the nose, watery transport systems ???? Watery.Transport.Systems) when the tension has to be tightened as much as possible (oh the possibility). If this sounds like a bad episode of TWILIGHT ZONE you have the right half (the re-boot of the 80s actually made a decent adjustment for the small screen, in fact we rent it instead!) One of the worst films of the year.
