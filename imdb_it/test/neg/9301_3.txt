This film is played by Ben Kingsley as Frank, a killer for some Buffalo-based Russian mobsters. He is also a furious alcoholic, and this has caused his job performance to decline. After falling asleep in his car during a probable attack, his uncle in charge of his crowd sends him to San Francisco, where he has to attend AA meetings and get a job as an assistant to a mortician. If you are thinking that this makes absolutely no sense, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Worse. Well, actually it improves, but not before getting much, much worse. Frank suddenly becomes a good mortician despite a complete lack of training, but his reactions to people in the funeral home and AA meetings are interesting. The viewer begins to take root for him as they notice positive changes in his life. Luke Wilson is a welcome addition as a sponsor of Frank, although he is given almost nothing to do (his character tells us he is gay, but this has no meaning). The film is thrown headlong into idiocy with the introduction of the character Tea Leoni. It's completely unrealistic, and his role as a love interest for Frank is lurking, as the two actors don't have a chemistry together. Around the time he enters the scene, Frank becomes far less engaging as a character. Its characterization is apparently random; there is no consistency in his behavior. The comedy is low-key and only intermittently funny, especially disappointing considering the comic's pedigree of the cast. <br /> <br /> Problems abound in this. Kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent. It alternates between Italian, Russian and Hispanic. During the film, Frank tells many people that he is a hitman (including an entire AA group), but no one seems to care, or wants to do something about it. The film is based on clich√© scenes to carry it out in his final act, particularly when Leoni's unbearable character chases Frank at the airport, just as he is about to embark on a flight back to Buffalo. <br /> <br /> Although it has a strong premise and an interesting first half hour, the film quickly becomes a total disaster and turns into total absurdity. At the end of the film, Frank celebrates a year of sobriety. I hope to celebrate many, many years of not having seen "Kill me". <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
