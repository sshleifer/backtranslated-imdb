I really don't know where to start. Imagine only a film that is so bad in every aspect, from acting to props to history that makes you angry. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen and this is very significant because I have seen some very bad ones. when I saw this movie I knew it was a snap, but I thought it was kung fu and vampires, a combination that I thought couldn't fail. That was until I entered this into my DVD player. Like Ron Hall he managed to ruin something as fascinating as vampires and martial arts are beyond me. first acting. I didn't expect much to start with, because it's an action movie and a B, but the acting here is so bad that I couldn't help but be annoyed. the expressions and tones of the voice were out of place, there was absolutely no emotion in almost the whole film and when it was so ridiculous I thought I was watching Mad TV. For example, that girly man shouts that Derek leaves out when he has to kill master kao who should never be born in the first place. all in all I saw better acting at the elementary school plays. Then there is the action. not even compared to the things that have been done in action movies in recent times. but still the action was not entirely disappointed as it seems that Ron Hall possesses some martial arts skills. but the skill he has is also overshadowed by the stupid things he does, such as the part of the film where he starts to spin and then the camera changes. I almost ripped a pillow in half and the scene of the fight in which his fellow prisoner fights against vampires by swinging his arms towards them. WOW.OR What about the part in the prison where Derek suddenly knows the magic and can preform the songs that make tap water the holy water. and with regard to props. guns look like walmart toys, teeth have been stolen from Halloween costumes and words can't describe how bad the CG graphics are. I could go on for hours on all the wrong things in this movie and believe me, this is just the tip of the iceberg. it's just a 2 because it made me laugh. even though I was laughing at how bad the movie was, a laugh is a laugh. I would say to be careful of the vampire killer unless you want to laugh at a horrible movie or are planning to be tortured for long periods of time and want to practice
