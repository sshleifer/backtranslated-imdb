This series is terrific and boring. The episodes are the same thing every week, simply with slightly different settings. Some purely evil characters do a vile act, Walker chases him and ends up in a Karate game. The bad guys are super-cliches bad evil super-stereotyped, the good guys are all pure, honest and holy, and the lines of the story are simplistic and unrealistic. After about 2 episodes, the show becomes totally unwatchable by everyone except the less demanding fans. Certainly not the best work of Norris. His other job may be a cliché, but it usually doesn't drag for weeks. If you like snooze-clichés, formal, boring and repetitive clichés, then this is for you.
