This turned out to be a rare case of a police officer made with British funding; unfortunately, the result is indistinct (except for its unpleasant approach and the excessive border field) despite the stars and the director. The first is led by a wooden Franco Nero and a surreal Telly Savalas as a pair of would-be robbers (if anyone is able to believe both actors that generally emanate cold like a cheating duo, he is more gullible than me!) . <br /> <br /> Their "work" goes wrong (ending in murder and burdened with cases of cutlery instead of jewelry!) ?? however, malformed criminals see an opening to their dilemma when they inadvertently "kidnap" the son of a British diplomat (an unbeliever Lester, who even gets to kick Savalas in an innate snap where it hurts at some point). However, in reality they do not redeem it and their only intent is to cross the border into France; tag with them is Nero's girlfriend (a wasted Ely Galleani): soon enough, however, she has had enough and decides to run away while the others are sleeping; the mad Savalas notices and, following the girl, kills her. Meanwhile, Nero and Lester have woken up ?? the first thinks that his accomplices could have crossed it in two, then he goes on the run with the boy in tow; after a brief spell in a country estate of a rich old lady (who offers totally free back nudes from both Nero and Lester!), Savalas joins them. They continue their journey, where the trio meets a family of German campers: does the situation degenerate to the point where Savalas locks them inside their trailer and throws the sack into the river ?? although he is seriously injured in the process itself; typically, everything ends with the 'heavy' that are killed just as they are about to reach the border. <br /> <br /> So does the film contain most of the typical elements of the genre? sleaze, sadism, violence, chases (the consequences of the opening robbery when the escape car causes chaos in the narrow side streets of the city and even upsets a funeral procession is decidedly farcical), etc .; a slightly interesting aspect is that, in the end, we see that Lester himself was definitively (irrevocably?) marked by experience ?? come to experience excitement when an act of violence is committed.
