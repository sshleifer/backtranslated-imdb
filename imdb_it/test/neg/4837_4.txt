And also a wonderful start, a real quick start. It keeps you craving and waiting for it to come. Unfortunately the high adrenaline dries quickly, but surely after the middle of the film is over. <br /> <br /> And it's a shame, because this film really has some good ideas and explores a lot of them. But that is also one of his faults. Exploring too many things, it gets mixed up with many things, so in the end you're too confused to follow any plot or character. It's very dark and moody, but this doesn't help much, if it's also the gender jump just to try to adapt to anything and everything in its history!
