I had seen him as a child but, not being very fan of Jerry Lewis, I had completely forgotten him (not that he was in any way memorable). The film revolves around the impersonation (which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic star!) - in this case a German official - and, although it is not as bad as Leonard Maltin (assigning a BOMB rating), it is not exactly classic both - certainly the leagues behind THE GREAT DICTATOR of Chaplin (1940), although relatively narcissistic! Ironically, the scenes before the appearance of the aspirant general offer more happiness than the rather forced humor to Nazi spending! <br /> <br /> The film was the last sigh of Lewis during his heyday; indeed, this turned out to be his last vehicle to be released for 10 years (it is painfully obvious here that his particular brand of madness would not have passed the appeal in the era of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen)!
