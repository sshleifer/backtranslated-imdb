I went to this film and I'd really like it - it was the title of a film festival earlier this year, and boasted a cast of famous actors. But (and one could say there was a "but" coming) is a failure of a movie. The exceptional character played by Sarandon and Walken is destroyed by the editing and the antics of the supporting cast. Turturro's performance is poor and much of the comedy is exaggerated. The recurring puppet shows are useless, and some scenes are completely out of place. <br /> <br /> Having said that, there are some wonderful moments sprinkled in the film. A truly moving theatrical moment, many of the seductions and some of the comic colors really work. Unfortunately, they are overshadowed by the widespread script, inconsistent and bad acting.
