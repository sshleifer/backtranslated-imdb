To sum up this film, it is LaBute who carries his sadism into the realm of farce comedy. The predictable result is that he is constantly trampling all the jokes insisting on surrounding them with bloody violence and extremely hateful characters. There is also evidence of his continued efforts to insult and ridicule everything in sight, but then apologize for it with weak gestures towards the PC. Basically the film doesn't work, its plot is beyond ingenuity, the characters are one-dimensional clich√©s, there is no coherence or development of anything, and the comedy (where it is not entirely out of place) is the worst kind of High Concept drivel. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman and Renee Zellweger are completely wasted on characters that look like studio-focused parodies - no matter what, make them funny, neutral (and neutered) and full of moral banalities. Crispin Glover is here long enough to convince you that he no longer belongs to the cinema. Chris Rock actually has a negative chemistry with fellow hitman Freeman - it's like acting in different rooms even two inches apart. In fact, Chris Rock looks like a digital insert. At least it's not as annoying as Jar-Jar. <br /> <br /> The 15 minutes of LaBute may already be over. It already seems to have passed its welcome.
