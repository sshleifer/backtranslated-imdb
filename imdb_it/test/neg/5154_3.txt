My mother took me to this movie at the drive-in when I was about seven, or thirty years ago. He had no idea that a family movie would be so violent. My clearest memory was of the pained face of the boy's father as he was stabbed in the stomach and killed. This image haunted me for weeks. I had learned that I lived in a world where a person could stab my father at any time. How could I stop them? How could he protect my father? You must understand that this stabbing is not a fantasy for a seven-year-old child. It is as real as witnessing a real event and has no place in the innocent mind of a child. It's sad that we still don't understand the impact that bringing violence to our children's lives has on both our children and our society. If only parents protect their children from images of violence with the same vigor that protect them from images of nudity and sex.
