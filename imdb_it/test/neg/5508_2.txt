I am a fan of the bizarre style of Jess Franco and even a lover of his trashy films and my personal opinion is that, in addition to several very funny films, he also created some masterpieces, such as the brilliant "Paroxismus" aka "Venus" In Furs " 1969, for example, but it is an undeniable fact that the 180 films that this very prolific director directed in his career also include a lot of big time fools. "Sadomania" from 1981 is certainly one of these stinkers, just an uglier plot in less with the ability to get bored of you despite the constant sloppiness and nudity. <br /> <br /> Of course, constant nudity will entertain you for 20 minutes, but since it continues to go on like this, it is very likely that you will get bored after a short time.The only thing that kept me from observing it was the intensity of the sleaze which is, generously spoken, slightly funny. <br /> <br /> After a couple of newlyweds are lost n el desert on some island, they are stopped by a group of topless women carrying weapons, guards of a local prison camp. While her husband is banished from the island, his wife is taken to the prison camp, a place of torture and sexual humiliation, reigned by the sadistic nymphomaniac Magda and by an extremely perverse governor. The prisoners are, of course, completely sexy chicks, most of them blond, the guardians are entirely topless women carrying rifles. <br /> <br /> The plot, so to speak, is extremely stupid, of course, but whoever looks at it anyway for a good plot. The (unique) interesting thing about "Sadomania" is the high level of exploitation, even for a film by "Women In Prison". There are probably two short scenes in the movie where we see a woman wearing a shirt, the sleaze contains all kinds of sexual perversions from rape to bestiality, and some of the torture scenes are really bad. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that a film with this extreme level of sleaze, however, can still be so boring. The sleaze will continue to look at you in the beginning, but after the first 45 minutes I really had trouble not falling asleep. I am also asked why, among all the porn stars, Jess Franco chose Ajita Wilson, who was, according to most sources, a transsexual who was born of a man (well, maybe for this reason). If you really want to see it, make sure you have enough beer at home to sit on it and watch it only for sleaze and exploitation (and perhaps for the slight factor of involuntary amusement). Don't expect to be very entertained, however it's almost unbelievable how a movie with such a high level of sleate can be so boring. I'm a fan of Jess Franco and always will be, but "Sadomania" is just ugly. 2/10
