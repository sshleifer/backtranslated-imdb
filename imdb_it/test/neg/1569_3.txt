George & Mildred - The Movie does not have the talents of its television writer John Mortimer who brings the sharp cut of the fourth and the thrust of George's class war with the Quattromili alive. <br /> <br /> The plot is cut by a standard banner - wrong hit-man / identity - and has as much tension as laughter. The producers should have taken a note from Rising Damp, (also in 1980) which was also bought on the big screen after the disappearance of the TV series, and kept much of the story in a family atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Yootha Joyce died in 1980 but should not be remembered for this piece of creaking work so burdened by his illness. Mildred lacks the sharpness of his television incarnation; the cutting of looks and persecutory looks is largely directed at Georges' lack of libido. George's incredible disbelief is lost even in the larger sets. This does not mean that they were much to scream. The budget for this film seems pathetically small; a restaurant where they go is clearly a new semi-starched home with some Christmas lights adorning the front door. <br /> <br /> For fans of the British comedy of the 70s or those who just want to revisit an old television companion from their youth this film cannot add anything to the experience and should simply be limited to the first four TV series now on DVD.
