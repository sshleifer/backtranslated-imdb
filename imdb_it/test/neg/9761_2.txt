Don't be taken because the premise of this film is good. It is, but that, it's not a good movie, to do. <br /> <br /> Comedies require a well-designed screenplay and a masterful direction. Unfortunately, this poorly executed film has neither. Leconte, a good director of other genres, does not deliver in his comedy farces (the Les Bronzes series is another example). <br /> <br /> Comic timing is terrible. Some lines are wired. Some are re-hashes from other movies. The others sit there as if they gave you time to laugh. The plot has disordered subplots (the allergic daughter, the lesbian co-owner) and does not develop or cover the viewer. It's not funny and it's not credible for a second. <br /> <br /> Compare it to any Billy Wilder comedy (Some Like it Hot, A Foreign Afair, etc.) Or Leconte's compatriot, Francis Veber, a true GENIUS to French comedy (Le Diner de Cons, Le Placard, Les Comperes, La Chevre, La Grande Blonde, etc.) And you will see the difference in their scripts, in the great acting and in the comic times, with a joke that leads to the next. <br /> <br /> Looking at Mon Meilleur Ami twice would be a cruel and unusual punishment, not a good sign for a comedy.
