Put simply, the only thing that saves this film is the settings, costumes and an OK punk concert. As H. R. Giger must feel about his cyborg image on the cover of this film, I don't want to know. Immediately, all I could do was make sardonic comments on the film's protagonists, I hoped the "freaks" in this film would perform them in a bloody way. I feel SPOILERS coming! I was wondering if this film was in the spirit of the first 20 minutes. Was it destined to be half humorously cooked like the rest? Examining all the obvious political protests (the police try to rape a "monster", the discussion of the superficiality between the "freak" and the frat boy and the punk concert with the female singer) and the use of slow motion in combat sequences ( who screams "martial arts coordinator", I really don't know. The character named "Steve" bothered me from the moment he tried to take battles with people out of the way (he should have been robbed and raped) and he would have looked bad when he broke that boy's neck towards the end (I want to that shows you how to do it?) I must say that if they had developed other characters better than "Splatter", this could have gone somewhere. If there was a 0 to give this film, he would have understood, but unfortunately it is a 1.
