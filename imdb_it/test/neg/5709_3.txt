I really can't understand how anyone could have any interest in seeing this movie. A woman meets a man, she wants to play, too, but only until she realizes what she misses. He leaves, and this really is. It took nine and a half weeks before Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) left John (Mickey Rourke). He would have to leave it after 30 minutes and end our unhappiness.
