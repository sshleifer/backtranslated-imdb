The main problem with 9th Company (9 Rota) is that he is not sure if he wants to save Save Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket. Spielberg's attempts at sentimentality are embarrassing, like the sergeant burley who cries in a field of red flowers !!! The training sequences have no intensity or realism that Kubrick gave them in his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> A further reason for contention is that the Afghan fighters are called Ghost because they hit and are hardly ever seen. Here they attack a strong Russian grip almost in formation without any attempt to use the cover. I'm sure the tactics went through Waterloo. <br /> <br /> Every scene in this film was seen in other war movies and improved considerably. <br /> <br /> I have to ask you: why do all talented shooters have to chew a game? <br /> <br /> Finally, I am always suspicious of a film that begins without a narrative that has yet to qualify the end. <br /> <br /> "We won!" ... errrr ....... no you didn't.
