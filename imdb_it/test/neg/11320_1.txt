I have never seen a film so terrible as to go crazy. It was a big waste of time to see this lousy movie. There are a lot of things I hate about this movie: the songs are so terrible (yet a bit catchy) that I hit my head on the wall (especially from the song "Grandpa will sue Santa's pants" that I hit 10 Times * shrugs *), the character design, and that wicked, greedy and cousin Bitchy Mel. <br /> <br /> I can't stand it for a second, you have to be one of the most pungent people I've seen. Although I like his southern voice. <br /> <br /> The only positive side is that Austin Bucks is played by the person who is the voice of Liquid Snake of Metal Gear Solid. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend people to watch for the holidays because it was a HUGE dishonor for x-mas.
