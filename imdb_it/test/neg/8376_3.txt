Let me start by saying that I don't remember laughing once during this play. From the opening scene, our protagonist Solo (Giovanni Ribisi) shows himself to be a self-absorbed, weak and neurotic loser completely unable to face the smallest responsibilities like balancing a checkbook, keeping his word or forming a coherent thought. I imagine we should be drawn to his fragile vulnerability and cheer him up through the process of getting rid of a deep depression. I imagine we should sympathize as he stumbles into a series of misadventures apparently triggered by his purchase of a dog, but actually caused by his own despicable nature. At any time, I didn't have the slightest clue that Solo ever had a rescue character, which became disturbing when he failed to feed his dog for a few days. No spark of humanity or glimmer of conscience gave me the hope that he would ever realize that his life is so terribly unhappy because it is a low self-absorbed and self-pityed life. I have not developed any connection with this character. He didn't seem to care, so neither did I. Actually, I wanted him to be tossed about by his routes at some point. <br /> <br /> The dog was not a character in the film. It was simply an object to be used, neglected, despised, abused, coveted and willing to whim. So be careful. Although "dog" is in the title, this film is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers. <br /> <br /> The role of Scott Caan is fun and believable as the best friend / fell. Don Cheadle is sincere and magnetic: I always want to see more on the screen. Mena Suvari was delightfully repellent. The role of Lynn Collins as a "stripper with a heart" was well interpreted, but the character was both absurd and clich√©, not to mention the chemistry between her and Ribisi. <br /> <br /> Romantic? Almost. Comedy? If you say so.
