So I decided to look at the entire Puppet Master series, and I had just looked at parts 1-3, which I thought were ALL excellent. They had a unique charm for them and a certain intelligence that I really appreciated. About a year ago, I even saw Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys, which was obviously bad, but still a guilty and fun pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of this film, I knew he was in trouble. The evil evil Power Rangers-style Egyptian skull that looks at the "Rita Repulsa" puppet style through its pyramid-shaped glass has emerged directly from the left field! All the additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd! Suddenly we have a vast assortment of all kinds of new and random characters and story lines that are a far cry from the first three films. I seriously doubt that when the first Puppet Master was written, the writers had visions of a day seeing a villain of the Egyptian Power Rangers, totem monsters, annoying twenty-year-olds who can't seriously act (and they should be brilliant scientists but they never say anything clever), and a joker puppet "Decapitron" whose head can turn into the ghost of Toulon. Another thing that deeply disappointed me in this film was that it completely ignores what happened in the last entry (Part II, since III was a prequel). Suddenly, the puppets returned to the Bodega Bay Inn, again in their case (minus Blade), and for some reason Toulon is willing to help his puppets again (he betrays them in part II for his love for Elsa). This is NOT explained TO ALL ... and so with that, and all this other stuff thrown in, I was no longer amused. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of ridiculous B movies, a connoisseur if you like. I also collect rare B movie laser disks that you can't find on DVD, so it takes a lot to say that this was one of the most absurd movies I've ever seen in my life. I still love those puppets, the original ones, Blade, Tunneler, Pinhead, Jester and the others, and if they were limited to what they had instead of trying to fix something that wasn't broken, well, the series could still be alive and well health. That being said, even though the reviews are not so great, I'm really interested in taking a look at Puppet Master Retro, it looks interesting and pays tribute to the original themes.
