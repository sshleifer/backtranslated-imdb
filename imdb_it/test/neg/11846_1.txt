First of all, I would like to make it clear that I consider this one of the funniest films I've ever seen. I saw it almost 10 times because I wanted to spread the innately delicious tastes of this film to other unsuspecting victims. It has the captivating essence of a recording of a camcorder of the seventh birthday of a distant grandchild. It has all the writings of a WWE game. And above all, it has the consistency of a face scraped along a sidewalk. This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three drunken teenagers in the desert. This scene convinced me that I was on something big when I chose this movie from the DVD rack (being drawn on the box due to the graphics of a velociraptor that screamed the word "RAPTOR" on the front of it). The scene contains treasures such as tomato sauce, spaghetti intestines, vain attempts at humor and gummy dinosaur puppets that are repeated throughout the film. This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The film contains erratic backgrounds and stage uses that cause the mind to melt at the thought that someone may have such a little shame when it comes to making a movie. An example is when a truck is parked next to a rock wall in the middle of the night. The next day, they find him in an open grassy area. The driver could not have driven him there since he was bitten by a nameless carnivorous biped (I will explain why he is unnamed in a second). So, my only hypothesis is that either the velociraptor has driven it, or the cattle transported by the driver, or Jim Wynorski does not think much about his spectators. Hell, in a part they expect me to believe that they are walking along a main road at night when the road has no gutters, the fire hydrant is placed precariously near a phone booth, and there is only one lamp. Yet, again, I feel compelled to watch and review this movie, just so I can find other things that will make me laugh the next time I watch it. This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The direction of this film is horrible. Long extended pauses. Strange cuts to the characters that weren't even near the conversation. People randomly discuss things while facing the camera (and, in turn, confronting the wall). They can't even give the dinosaur a coherent species, jumping between calling it a baby dinosaur and using a rubber velociraptor phantom (which stands out for its disproportionately long, fat, disproportionate claw). This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Assembly is important in this film. This is not a good thing. I am well aware that the film is a collection of scenes from other films, masterfully made in a single piece of shit, but there must be a limit! The subtitles end abruptly as they started. Explanations for the sudden disappearance of characters not limited to, well, are not explained at all! And a final that seemed to drive a muscle car on a brick wall without a seat belt. You never know what will happen because the film does not follow a coherent structure. This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Now, I just have to mention a single scene (the largest) that occurs towards the end. This is a spoiler, but not really. The final scene contains a showdown between the tyrannosaurus rex and Sheriff Tanner. It's like the showdown between Sigourney Weaver and Alien Queen in Aliens, except without all the emotional power / budget / epic struggle. It is rather constituted by Tanner who plants the dinosaur with a construction machine. A red lynx. In a space of a few minutes, through a series of subtle cuts, the director manages to transform that white lynx into a yellow machine with a forklift / crane. Now, as I said, I know that this film is based on scenes from other films, but which two films deserve a showdown with a t-rex in a construction vehicle? This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> This film gets a 1/10 for the quality of the film, but a 10/10 for what makes me laugh and have fun.
