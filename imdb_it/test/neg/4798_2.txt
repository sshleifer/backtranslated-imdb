I just saw Coronado ... Around here the only line they invented to sell it is "from the FX team behind Independence Day". I think this is very important. We're not talking about writers, directors, actors ... <br /> <br /> It's a pretty adventure story set in a banana republic in Central America, but the plot is subtle. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film I kept thinking about how this movie looks like scenes cut from an action computer based war game. Although the FX are beautiful, they are too often visible. Very similar to CG cut scenes like Command'n'Conquer. <br /> <br /> You know almost instantly that that particular truck, backdrop, bridge, castle or fighter jet has never existed. The appearance is fluid and pleasant, but not up to the standards we expect from Action Adventures today. The film lacks many obvious on-site footage. <br /> <br /> Acting, the plot is below average and the special effects are beautiful but not up to the film standards. I'm not surprised this thing went directly to the video / DVD. <br /> <br />
