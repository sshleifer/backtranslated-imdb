I can't really remember any details of this film except that the setting seemed terribly familiar. Then I realized that it was shot at the Lazy Lizard Hostel in Moab, Utah. That was one of my favorite places to visit when I was younger and wandered around the country. The guy who owns / manages the hostel managed to get into the film. All I remember from the film's plot is that it involves jeeps and naked women. It's nice to look only for the scenery (I mean rock formations) ... If you're looking for soft-core porn, you'll probably be better served elsewhere. I don't even know if this movie is available on tape or DVD.
