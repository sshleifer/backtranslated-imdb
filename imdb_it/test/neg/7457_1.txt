This Canadian "movie" is the worst ever! Stunningly amateurish. When the bad guys steal a boat, we see two women with machine guns and one of them says, in a whisper: "We're robbing your ship!" She blinks and is totally shy! Very intimidating. ROTFLOL !!! <br /> <br /> The two heroes who cut karate are 40 years old, twin brothers five feet tall! They are really bad actors. In fact, all those involved in this production are non-actors. <br /> <br /> There are so many errors of continuity in this incredible economic production. In one scene, the boys wear a type of swimsuit. In the following shot they wear completely different swimsuits. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible! A must see for all fans of bad movies. I have it on VHS. It's very rare. I love it.
