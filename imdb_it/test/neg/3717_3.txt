The film has strange, annoying characters, a strange unbearable craving and an insurmountable amount of dialogue about smoking. The film has a forced plot of a search for love by a bitchy, empty-headed woman (Jeanne Tripplehorn). Although those who would never want the character, personality or reading of Jeanne's dialogue, I can't really say. Except that she likes to smoke. <br /> <br /> Sarah Jessica Parker offers an interpretation of an interesting character (who likes to smoke). Dylan McDermott does his best to look cute and full of spirit (while smoking). And, hey, what is Jennifer Aniston doing? Oh, it's not enough for anyone to import. (But she likes to smoke). <br /> <br /> This is a waste of time for anyone. I don't even know how he was able to take part in much of the film like I did. I can't even believe that I spent the time writing this, except to warn others of its banality. Does anyone need a cigarette?
