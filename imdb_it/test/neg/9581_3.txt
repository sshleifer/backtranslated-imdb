Mount Godwin-Austin (otherwise known as K2) is the second highest mountain in the world, and if the evidence presented in this film is to be considered the most difficult mountain to successfully climb without getting killed. "K2" is basically a film of friends set in the incredibly dangerous world of mountaineering. While outdoor photography brings in a truly fantastic scenario, the characters that stand in front of all those glorious landscapes are an overwhelming boredom - and here lies the blame for the whole film. <br /> <br /> Cocksure's attorney Taylor Brooks (Michael Biehn) and his quiet married friend Harold Jamieson (Matt Craven) spend their free time climbing. During one of their trips, they meet with another group of climbers financed by the rich mountain enthusiast Philip Claibourne (Raymond J. Barry). Claibourne's team is training for an upcoming shot at the infamous K2, a mountain that Taylor and Harold would love to both face, but they could never afford to do it. However, during their training run, two members of Claibourne's team get themselves killed in an avalanche. Taylor and Harold propose themselves as potential substitutes. Despite the initial reluctance, Claibourne gives them the nod of approval and the couple finds themselves joining his team in the Himalayas. Harold Cindy's wife (Julia Nickson-Soul) is shocked that her husband will undertake such a dangerous climb, especially since becoming a father. Tensions on the mountain climbing team as Taylor clashes repeatedly with another member of the group, the equally brash and arrogant Dallas Woolf (Luca Bercovici). Meanwhile, Claibourne himself becomes increasingly sick while altitude sickness costs his body. Will the boys reach the peak of K2, or is their mission destined to end in disappointment, or even death? <br /> <br /> "K2" spends an excessively long time introducing its somewhat unpleasant characters. Biehn is an adventurous and impure-mouthed type, particularly difficult to love, as Barry is a hard-nosed millionaire millionaire. But on the other side of the coin, Craven is so boring that it becomes difficult to believe that his wife could care less about the fact that he is going to climb K2 - heck, it would be better if he never came back !! Completing the main characters is Bercovici, whose characterization as Dallas Woolf is campy and over-the-top like any other role I've ever played. The story itself is totally docile and disposable ?? just a simple yarn on the guys trying to reach the top of a mountain. There's a bit of masculine connection, but Harold and his wife's entire subplot is nil, and the personality clashes between Taylor and Dallas sound totally fake. "K2" marks its few merits exclusively from the splendid cinematography of Gabriel Berastain ?? during the Himalayan sequences, the scale and awe of the mountains are well captured. I completely agree with the critic Kim Newman on this, who exaggeratedly stated in Empire magazine: "On this test, getting on K2 can be no more difficult than facing it!" True enough, Kim, it's true!
