Seeing the cover of this before watching it, my expectations were not high, especially since it was among those other crappy horror films in the blockbuster phase (along with films like Junior). Okay, not only does this film have stereotypical characters without brains (the rich cosmetic bag, the bitch, the sheriff, the localist who knows what's going wrong in the city, and so on), but has such a terrible, acting dialogue direction and CG effects. The guy from Jeremiah Stone was hilarious. (* SPOILER *) I will never understand why he bit his finger from nothing when he held that chick hostage. <br /> <br /> The premise for the film is just as atrocious as the other flaws. From what I could make out of it, Jeremiah Stone was a gold digger during the gold rush and a notorious outlaw. He had a disgust of gold, (* SPOILER *) and cursed anyone who pursued his gold before he was killed by the locals after killing a girl, but not only survived, he bit his finger and ran Street. Thus, in our day, a group of incapable idiots discover this gold mine and, of course, are warned by the locals about "The Curse of Forty Nine". And what do they do? As expected, he ignored the warnings and eagerly looked for gold. They get gold, and every sort of s ** t continues. Fortunately, (* SPOILER *) the whore cuts her head. <br /> <br /> That's it. Looking at the cover of the film, you can tell what kind of film it will be. It's so terrible that it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 stars out of 5.
