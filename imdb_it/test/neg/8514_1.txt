When a friend and I saw this in the latest releases, we decided to take it despite none of us ever heard of it before. We both love Costas Mandylor and James Coburn, so we thought it couldn't be that bad. We were wrong. Was. It was REALLY that bad. No actor or actress could have made this film worth seeing. It was like taking Titanic, The Poseidon Adventure and some movies about the nuclear bomb and trying to cut and paste everything together. I have to admit there were a couple of laughs. I laughed when the head of the family asked Alan (Costas Mandylor) if he was a "marine jock". The other laugh that this film had, however, had nothing to do with writing. I would love to know how the people who made this film thought they could turn a cruise ship upside down and make it stay still. It's not a tip or anything. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something to watch for Costas Mandylor, James Coburn or any of the other actors, go ahead. Find something good they did.
