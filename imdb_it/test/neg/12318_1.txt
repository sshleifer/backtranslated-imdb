This movie made me angry! When I think of Cat in the hat. I'm thinking of the cat in the hats. You know, what a few years ago parents read to their children. Well, I think this movie would be very similar! But much to my surprise it was nothing like books! It's like a humorous movie for adults. In one part the cat is talking with a gardening tool (hoe) to which he speaks as if it were his hoe (adult humorism aginism). his car's name was a little unpleasant for a children's movie. below the score you will find: mild humor and some double meanings. I think in short this means adult humor. I wish I could get this movie back! Wal-Mart said they would not do it because the film was opened. If you are thinking of buying it, I suggest you rent it before buying it.
