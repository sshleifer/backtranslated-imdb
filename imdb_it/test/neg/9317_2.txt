Help! Once again, Paul Schrader sabotaged his intentions with a boring and pedantic narrative. I reorganized a vacation so that I could see this "world premiere". What a mistake! Why did Schrader even want to make a movie about exorcists? High intentions are good, but if I wanted 2 hours of theological chatter, I would visit my nephew's Sunday school. Father Merrin's struggle with his faith, presented in his younger days, is a potentially interesting topic. But an exorcist film needs more! The inexorably neglected presentation, along with ridiculous special effects, creates a strange production. Who is this film for? I didn't bother to see Harlin's version, but at least apparently they tried to express a kind of gut thrills. <br /> <br /> The Exorcist series was rather strange. The first film was excellent, but every sequel was unloved and useless. Why do they keep doing it? I suppose Schrader made sure he could get a lot of money. But why should we go?
