This is absolutely the most stupid movie ever produced in front of a camera. I can't believe I was naive enough to rent this piece of junk. I've seen some bad movies in my time, but this takes the cake .... Ice cream ,,,, and chips too. Omg, I still can't understand how bad this thing was. Acting was a joke ... The plot was non-existent ... and the camera work had to be done by a 3-year-old child. I've never seen a movie take so long to get anywhere. I mean the whole movie could have been shot in less than 30 minutes. I imagine this guy has had a little more time in his hands .... (Like 3 hours.) And an extra 60 dollars in his wallet, and he decided one night ... (Hey .. Let's go to make the most stupid movie ever made.) And they did just that. Give me a break. I'm going back to the video store right now to get my money back. Anyone who has looked at this piece of junk should do the same.
