I rented this movie, after hearing Chris Gore say something to the effect of "five stars!" on that show's attack. Well, when I shot the DVD and showed the 3 stages of hell, well, I had to buy it. Just to see the spectacle of a mother yelling at her son to drop his other son into a burning pit. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect ECW or CZW for an hour and eighteen minutes, but I expected at least a summary version of what seemed to be the highlight of this movie. Well, unfortunately there was nothing like that. The 3 phases of the death part take place from the beginning, and it is practically downhill from there. Nothing really happens in this documentary. It was rather raw, bare and impartial. It's not a bad thing, but there is a narrator in this. You would expect him to have opinions on the subject of this documentary, but he does not. What would have been nice to have, a message or a reason for this document. There was no real reason to have a narrator, there should have been only a text explaining some of the less obvious scenes. <br /> <br /> It really explains the lives of these wrestlers. It shows some moments of some dramatic scenes, which seem interesting, but the reality is not as big as it seems. For example, mom watches her son struggle with light bulbs and pins, for the first time, in a public park. Instead of seeing his reaction to wrestling, they show her how to react to the camera, instead of saying an interview later, or simply watching his reactions. <br /> <br /> The wise Legitamit document, this is not. The starting material was fragile to begin with. Nothing really deep or interesting really happens. No conclusion for some of the most interesting stories, No point or last thought for wrestling in the yard, poorly modified together, and it is fundamentally a failed economic repercussion of Beyond the Mat. <br /> <br /> Wearing wrestling, this is quite boring. the strongest blows are at the beginning and slowly become less surprising and shocking. If you've seen Japanese wrestling, indie wrestling or even backyard wrestling DVDs, then you won't be surprised and amazed. If you want to do wrestling don't make the same mistake I made and see this. Go instead to take some CZW ECW or XPW Dvd. <br /> <br /> The only thing I got from this documentary was how stupid people are. Not to support self-mutilation or to do dangerous stunts, but their reasoning for committing these acts. Backyarders seem stupid for wrestling. Many of them are unemployed and probably have some problems in their head, and wrestling is a kind of therapy for them. How the supporters seem even more idiotic. Mothers basically take all the reasoning "if you can't beat it" to cope with the fact that their children are practically killing themselves. The figures of the school authority support their students in their dangerous acrobatics because it is an alternative to the union of gangs and to a lesser spread of drugs, which is quite funny since that segment took place in a rural city, where people live 20 miles from each other. People are stupid. This is what I extracted from this documentary. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the reasoning and thoughts for someone who is brutalizing in wrestling and basically what the back of this DVD promises, get UNSCARRED: the Life of Nick World. It is more surprising, and interesting than the courtyard, and much more fun. Oh, it's really good.
