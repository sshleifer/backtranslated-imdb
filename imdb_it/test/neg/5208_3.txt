The forbidden film by Nico Mastorakis was rather disappointing in my opinion. The film is about a couple, who goes to a Greek island to kill all the perverted people (apparently). You know you have something pretty bad when one of the first scenes includes a guy having sex with a goat and then killing him. <br /> <br /> But things only get worse from that moment, since all the scenes look almost the same. They meet some people, so either they kill or have sex with them (preferably both). <br /> <br /> The ending is fine when the couple becomes brother and sister and she simply lets it rot somewhere but overall you would have expected more. No substance here I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
