Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It's filmed so wickedly, the attention isn't even on this supposed "true half-caste", it's more about the troupe that comes from Hollywood to make the film. No cinematographic meaning, and if I could resume the almost 1 and a half hours spent watching this film, I would feel much better. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, it begins by giving you the impression that it will be filmed in a somewhat generic way, like a true Hollywood production. However, then they enter into the narrative of the story, and it is filmed in a terrible way. It should be a real "Blair Witch Project", since they use practically what one might think is a "real photo film", it is not, don't be fooled. <br /> <br /> Worst movie I have ever seen. . on the positive side, it has a semi-scary scene, and the images of the half-caste were not bad at all. DO NOT RENT
