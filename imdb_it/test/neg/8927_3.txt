Poor action movies are cemeteries for old martial art stars. In such films they struggle to maintain that dangerous behavior that made their first successful jobs, but they all end up in failure. Seagal is too old for this kind of role but he won't let go ... no matter how absurdly it seems. Some hope that his current work can somehow bring back the magic, but no magic remains. The late 80s and early 90s belonged to Steven Seagal and his work made me a fan. I could see him fit well into a slot on The Sopranos where his overweight body, his fantastic features and the gloomy attitude could have found a home. I wonder what is the return on his video direct race ?! Since it produces them, I assume that the $$$ is more than satisfactory. If this is the deal, we will be subjected to Seagal action films badly made in the late 60s and 70s .....
