The scientist Charles and his wife (or assistant) Marissa receive some objects and a skull from an ancient Indian cemetery, and while cleaning a vase, they are attacked and killed by a mysterious being, the Skeleton Man. Then, a military team led by Captain Leary (Michael Rooker) searches for two groups of four soldiers each vanishing in the jungle. They face the Skeleton Man, shooting him while he kills every soldier. Then the Skeleton Man goes to a power plant, and Captain Leary explodes the structure destroying the supernatural being. I bought "Skeleton Man" on DVD expecting to see a funny basket, but I found a terrible boring, annoying and senseless crap, with shots and explosions. The imbecile story is totally disconnected and makes no sense, and the military team is made up of imbeciles, who insist on shooting the supernatural Skeleton Man until they are completely slaughtered. Their leader is also the most stupid, with the explosion of an entire structure, in the end, to destroy the supernatural robbery of the extraterrestrial warrior Predator. On DVD, you can use the fast forward button along the film and reduce the suffering of the viewer. My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Skeleton Man"
