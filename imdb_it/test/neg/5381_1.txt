Can they be criticized for the director's choices? <br /> <br /> All I can say is ... <br /> <br /> Why was it done? <br /> <br /> Well, isn't this an embarrassment for the Korean-American film industry? <br /> <br /> Should we be selective about who we support? <br /> <br /> Am I too strict? Take a look at yourself.
