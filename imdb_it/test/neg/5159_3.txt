Honestly, the people who gave this movie at ten would give 100 for the pulp fiction. This is the level we are dealing with here. <br /> <br /> The film is not bad, but in no way is it like "OMG, the best Pulp Fiction film!". Some people have incredibly low expectations for movies, even those of indie varieties. Personally, I discovered that my interest in the film had diminished after the half hour. The plot challenges logic and belief. You need to hear the part about why his wife did what she did to "save her husband". Yeah, for sure. I guarantee you come out of the theater thinking: "hmm, now it doesn't make any sense". This is a movie where you really need to suspend all logic and beliefs. <br /> <br /> Those who claimed that the musical score is good were probably listening to their MP3 players. He absolutely killed the film in parts. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, watch the movie only if you have nothing particularly important to do. I make a three because there is a long sequence of sex in the motel that is decent.
