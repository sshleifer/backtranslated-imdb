I just watched this movie last night at a midnight preview (working for an independent theater chain in Colorado - it's one of the advantages ...) I'm sorry, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I know there are some Bruce Campbell fanatics out there that (like Star Wars die-hard) will line you up from the nearest tree if you dare to speak ill of their beloved movie icon ... however, Campbell-teers, this particular work from The Chin is a celluloid black hole. <br /> <br /> Before making the assumption that I am a fan of cinema of people who only watch "real" films like "Ladies in Lavender" and "Sideways", think again, I am a big fan of B-movies and in particular by Bruce Campbell. His brand character Ash is one of my favorites, and his interpretation of Elvis's age in Bubba Ho-Tep was phenomenal. <br /> <br /> But hey, B movies still have the potential to be reeeeally, reeeeally bad (and not in that "good" campy way we all love) ... and that's what watching this particular is been for me and my workmates. With the exception of that one shot in which Bruce runs across the square and scares the children, there was no laugh. Overall, we found that the story was incredibly tired, the mollassic rhythm, and the so-called stupid humor of a lot of hammers. (I'm sorry, but the "Pavel" character of Ted Raimi was not a comic relief ... it was simply a retard!) Believe me, we fell in love with this pleasure, but we were incredibly disappointed and robbed of two hours. <br /> <br /> If you loved this movie, you are going to see it several times, you want to get married and have children, etc., it's great - everyone likes what we like, so you don't get judgment from me But don't questioning the sense of humor or loyalty of the fans of those who do not have multiple orgasms with respect to Campbell's latest film coupe. This film was a steaming sandwich sandwich in my humble opinion ... and as a true Campbell fan, I can tell!
