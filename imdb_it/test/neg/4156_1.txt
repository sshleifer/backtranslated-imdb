Many times the description "full of sound and fury that means nothing" is used and is right on target. Unfortunately "Code 46" lacks both sound and fury. A little fury would have been much appreciated. The character of Tim Robbins (William) is so devoid of passion that the idea of ​​immediately falling in love with Maria (Samantha Morton) seems almost absurd. These people are so passionate that they begin to wonder if perhaps the water supply of this future world has been dosed with thorazine. There is a sort of atmosphere of the film "Brave New World" which is helped by all the scenes shot with about 2-3 overexposed stops. Unfortunately this technique becomes dull and rather hard on the eyes. Even the beguiling mix of languages ​​becomes boring when there seems to be no apparent reason for its existence. Many futuristic and scifi films are criticized for being all flash and no substance. This film has neither flash nor substance. It's a code 6 all the way.
