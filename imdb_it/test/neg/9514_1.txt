It's so depressing when the directors try to be cool and it's so obvious here. This has below-average acting, ridiculous dialogues, divided screens that are difficult to watch, and many tricks in his attempt to be a vintage and autobiographical film. This film should be avoided at all costs. I was told not to go see this movie. I wish I had listened.
