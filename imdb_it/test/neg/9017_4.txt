After an astronaut dies in space, he is taken back to a military base. Within the man, alien embryos are discovered - it is the host of what could be a terrible alien invasion! This film comes from director Bernard L. Kowalski, who also directed "Attack of the Giant Leeches" (see separate review), but could be better known for his work on "Columbo". The executive producer was Roger Corman, known as the creator of much better films than this ... especially in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> This movie is poor and poorly built. What is interesting is the negative effects, not the actual film. A scene shows a close-up of alien embryos and is an embarrassing representation of cartoons. Also for 1958. And then when an adult alien appears ... you'll wonder why he wears shoes. Or if you are really insightful, you wonder why you saw the alien suit in other movies. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not the worst science fiction movie you've ever seen. And you almost have to give him a little credit - the alien host who surpasses a basic military idea precedes both "The Thing" and "Alien" by a number of years. I don't know if these films were inspired in any way (I doubt it), but at least it was ahead of its time. In addition, however, the film slips in and does nothing but amaze him when drinking. I haven't seen the Mystery Science Theater version, but this is definitely a movie worthy of their insults.
