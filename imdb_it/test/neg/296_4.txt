I've heard a lot about this new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in Southeast Asia for the past three years. Apparently he is on the verge of turning into something very contagious and millions and millions of people will be wiped out in a global pandemic. I thought I'd mention it in case you haven't finished writing your will yet. <br /> <br /> I would have even thought of talking about it since I was looking at something called CARRIER tonight that it was not talking about naval war but it opens with a scene that is a cross between OUTBREAK and an episode of THE X FILES that I have seen many years ago. I thought of looking at something with added resonance after hearing the stories about the avian flu danger, but after the non-trivial opening of CARRIERS we go down in a cheap and cheerful TVM and like every other TVM you will see that the protagonists are women, one of which she is an authoritarian figure, while the other female protagonist is a mother of small children. It goes without saying that there is also a subplot of a sick child <br /> <br /> What is irritating for the TVM format is that it overwhelms the potential of what could have been a good movie if it had been made for the cinema . There is a pretty bloody scene of someone coughing up blood on a nurse's face and a very impressive jay that is torn to pieces, but these fragments are quickly forgotten as the mood descends into the family feeling from this - and almost all of them other TVMs never made - it was made for an essentially female audience
