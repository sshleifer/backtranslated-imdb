I was completely bored with this film, melodramatic for no apparent reason. Everything becomes so serious and people are swearing with really stupid expressions. Then there's a serial killer who apparently can kill a person to get the serial killer title. Well, the serial killer loves butterflies and is illustrated by the sound effects that you might hear in the dream sequence of the most modern movies; <br /> <br /> why oh why? I have no idea. It really wants to be scary, but I think in this scary universe it's like talking a lot of people and adding obscure environmental noises. Just for the record, this is absolutely not a horror film, it is undoubtedly a thriller (barely). Nowadays film producers have to do their homework before making "horror" films or at least defining a "horror" movie. makes me say (even with ironic words) "acolytes, take forever to say nothing".
