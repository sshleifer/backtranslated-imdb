What has been wrong with Disney in recent years? Are they completely short of good ideas? Where's the magic? Where are the good animators, the good songwriters, the good directors, the good ones ... Okay, I know, Walt himself and the famous "old nine" can't come back. But is this a reason to churn out countless economic sequels and slowly but surely destroy Walt Disney's ideals? I've never rented or bought a Disney sequel of what movie, anyway. Because I had read enough about his (lack of) quality. But "Atlantis: Milo's Return" went on TV today in Germany and I watch it. He confirmed my doubts about the sequels. It was absolutely boring. Defect animation, primitive color rotation, simple characters, some failed attempts to simulate the famous Multiplane-Camera with CGI, mediocre music and a patchwork of different and simple stories. It doesn't look like Disney at all! Not like Disney, I know! It looks like one of the innumerable, cheap and simple series of animations like "DragonballZ", "Beyblade" etc. That went on TV every day for children. <br /> <br /> My first reaction after showing this shit was to load "Bambi" into my DVD player, see Disney's magic, depth, spirit and immortal appeal again, to see again Disney at its finest, to see again the fantastic art of handmade animation. "Bambi" was the first (and to date the only) film I gave 10 out of 10 stars. But "Atlantis: Milo's Return"? No magic, no depth, no charm, no spirit ... Only 3 out of 10 deserved!
