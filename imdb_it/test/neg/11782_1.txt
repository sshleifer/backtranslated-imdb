My website (www.theflickguy.org) lists this choice as the worst film of all time. Here is an excerpt: <br /> <br /> "If I were tied to a chair and forced to watch this movie over and over again, I could not imagine that hell is worse. Jim Varney plays crazy three-handed, determined to destroy the world (apparently starting with the cinema). Now let's face it, nobody expects quite a bit from a Varney movie, but this agonizing anguish made me go dry for 92 minutes, not a laugh. This is not kamp or gitch, it's not even unreasonable, it's evil, don't rent it, it could destroy your DVD player, don't even buy it from a 29 cm basket to use as a white ribbon, it's the worst movie of all time.
