Yes, Edward G. offers us a retrospective view of the world of criminal defense. First of all it is an overzealous prosecutor who sends the wrong man into the chair (he played passionately, albeit briefly with DeForrest Kelly), then is full of remorse and his only comfort is the bottle. Launch into a tired love story, a truly rapid descent into misery, unscrupulous defender, and the next thing you know - Shazam! Black Leg Lawyer (god I love this phrase). He sees the light just in time to save his misfit from his chair. Yawn. <br /> <br /> But in reality the court's action is pure melodrama. Watch him give a witness, see him drink poison, see him talk passionately as he tightens a bullet hole in his chest. Get ready for melodrama. <br /> <br /> The clamor of the film, however, is Jayne Russell. With the curves that defy the laws of gravity and an IQ approaching absolute zero, you are something to see. He also sings a little.
