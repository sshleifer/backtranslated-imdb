This must be the worst movie I've seen this year ... and I watch a lot of cables. The plot is simply ridiculous, the scenes are simply thrown at you without action, without any beginning or end of any scene .. they are just random idiots with makeup screaming in an airplane .. The "special effects" (Spielberg would laugh his ass off) they are horrible, yellow contact lenses are nice though .. I have to administer that I could not bear to see it until the end. The scene where the great scientist Bennett kept for dear life from the engine body was too much for me .. I'm sorry for my bad English .. I come from Romania (and this is my first post). I had to sign up just to comment on this film because I can't believe this is a movie released in 2007.
