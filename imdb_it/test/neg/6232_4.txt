as in so many films of the past, you would think that Hollywood would learn by now, create a very disappointing film, let alone make sure the kidnapped victim is alive before paying the ransom. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie wants to remember these basic facts in case it happens to one of us. Why can the long walk in the woods and a city boy really go through the woods without getting lost? Just an opportunity for a sentimental dialogue that in the end made no sense. <br /> <br /> I had to listen to some of the director's comments in the special features section, from the great moves that Redford has done in the past, (sneakers for one) surprised that he agreed to act in a movie like that . The director's comments and motivations were weak. <br /> <br /> The best parts of this film were the scenery, I can't wait for spring to come.
