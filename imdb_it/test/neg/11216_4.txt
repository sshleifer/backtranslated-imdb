The young Michael Dudikoff as the young Lord Greystoke was abandoned in the jungle on a Pacific island as a child. But instead of being raised by monkeys, he fell into the hands of a Japanese soldier who still lived there because he didn't know the war was over. And as young Luke Skywalker discovers that he has fallen into his hands and learned the fighting skills of a Ninja. <br /> <br /> Good thing because they were separated and the boy came down with a case of amnesia, but those fighting skills didn't go away. The orphan boy, now called Joe Armstrong, enlists in the army and is stationed in the Philippines. Meanwhile his Obi Wan Kenobe played by John Fujioka is saved and goes to work as a gardener on the planter and terrorist estate that moves between Don Stewart using a cheese accent that seems to vary between French and Spanish. <br /> <br /> As these things happen, everyone meets and Dudikoff both solves the mystery of part of his past and saves the commanding officer's daughter from the villains in this production of the Golan-Globus. Charles Bronson was getting a little long in the teeth and Golan-Globus needed a new star for their action movies. Michael Dudikoff filled the bill fairly well and made quite a few films for them including several sequels of American Ninja. <br /> <br /> This movie is all about action and Dudikoff sends the bad guys at a record pace. What he doesn't do, Steve James does his best Rambo imitation and shows his considerable martial arts skills. <br /> <br /> The film has enough holes in the plot to guide one of those army vehicles through you history. But this is what the public that buys tickets is not interested in. Dudikoff certainly looks magnificent stripped to his combat clothes. No wonder so many sequels have been created.
