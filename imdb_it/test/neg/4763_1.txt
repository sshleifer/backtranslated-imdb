The film starts out quite promising, the use of images and simple short clips convey the biggest story, which would normally require a considerably higher budget than the one here. However, he began to worry as he continued, combined with another excessively hoarse voice from Max Payne about the film that started to look not so good. I was hoping it was just the introduction to the story. <br /> <br /> History is what really captured me and led me to this movie. The idea that a research scientist created a virus that actually protects cells that is infected by other infections was an interesting scientific idea. Then those subjects who had the most bizarre ailments sought the scientist and offered to be his human experiments and made me think that this could be a great little film. Yet the introduction did not go well. <br /> <br /> There seems to be a change of pace when the film switched to the interviews recorded with the four main characters of the film, the test subjects. Although the acting was not exceptional, there seemed to be plenty of room for character development throughout the film, and the recordings were done quite well with a varied mix of characters. However these faded through the film. They weren't used again after a few short clips and I had the impression that there was a missed opportunity to provide a great development of the character by reflecting on them, however it shouldn't have been. <br /> <br /> the images become increasingly disconnected from history, often repeating to represent something that is still happening. This disconnection and repetition are reflected in the annoying and distracted comment. He began to recite the words one after the other. Short meaningless sentences and reciting too relevant or interesting scientific phrases. If there was something to describe, four or five words would have been used, it was too long, repetitive, circular, looped, ... you got the idea. <br /> <br /> Now this could have been to reflect the confusion and character, slowly trapped in his thoughts, disconnected due to lack of food and water. What he actually did was get me completely into the voice and from the final stages of the film I discovered that I hadn't listened to some of the digressions. <br /> <br /> A number of times an event occurs the camera shows all the characters one after the other for their reaction, which seems to be between confused and reflective. There are repeated fades from the same scene to the same scene, for example a sleeping character dissolves in black, then dissolves again into the sleeping character again. Look, we know the character is asleep, we know that time has passed, please go on. Altogether there are too many atmospheric cuts and long suspended strokes to fill the time. <br /> <br /> The acting was not bad, and the characters were ok, but not exploited and developed. When they interacted, there were moments really worthy of note. For example, when one of them asks if they are hungry, the camera looks at each of them and returns to a group photo, they stop, look at each other, go back to the video camera and slowly say "No". He gave a little laugh or two. Their dialogue was slow, lucid and lacked completely or completely useless, there seemed to be no middle ground in which the dialogue was well chosen. <br /> <br /> However, there were some good scenes, but they were really hard to find if you didn't see them in isolation, and that's what seems to have happened with this movie. The film was seen as a series of scenes and not as a complete story. <br /> <br /> Nowhere has this been seen more than in the main plot. The characters are infected by the virus that killed the animals, the one that had been designed for them. We have been told that it develops gradually into something dramatic, and that is what we expect. What we get are the characters who eat loads together, all throwing up together once, water pouring from their mouths into unconvincing flows, then they all fall asleep, these are the phases that all happen very early in the film. Then, everyone says "Good" when asked how they are, and that's it. This is the virus done, nothing else happens. <br /> <br /> Much more could have been done with this film, much more developed with the virus and protecting it from all sorts of damage. He could have explored a serious change in these characters as he infected them and detected them, he could have developed these characters, shown them making decisions and doing things that related to their character shown in the flashback interviews. <br /> <br /> The ending is not even confusing, intriguing or inspiring. It just shows something that just happens, even if in the long style, with the irritating voice above it. I really struggled with this film and saw some members of the press go out (including a famous television critic who leaves within the first twenty minutes), I stayed, but I regret the time lost.
