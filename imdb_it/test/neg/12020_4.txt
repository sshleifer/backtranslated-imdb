and nothing else. <br /> <br /> One of my friends bought the Problem Child Tantrum Pack (contains the first two "Problem Children" on a record), and we decided to look at the sequel because it was "more fun". <br /> <br /> There have been many funny moments in the movie (the vomit scene, that's all I need to say.), the Nippy dog ​​after eating CHOW DOWN and many others. The film is nothing but humor in the toilets, but it's fun. However, apart from the funny moments, this film has little to offer. <br /> <br /> John Ritter annoys me, because he seems to be reading a book. Man can't act in this, I'm sorry. <br /> <br /> Even if I can't say if I would find the movie funny now ... (we were out of breath when we looked at it), it's a perfect movie for a rainy day ... but nothing else. Don't expect Oscar material on this, guys.
