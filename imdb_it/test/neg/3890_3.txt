Before starting, a "small" correction: IMDb states that Richard Gere is 180 cm tall. Mistaken! I went to him 10 years ago, and he can't be an ant bigger than 165. I am 183 years old, and he looked like a child next to me. <br /> <br /> It should have been called "Wheatlands"; an appropriate title to complete the previous (and much better) Malick "Badlands" film. This film shows that not all directors have as their main objective to entertain. In fact, some of them have as their main objective to show the wheat in all its glory. <br /> <br /> The film is depressing and relatively uninspiring, with the obligatory tragic ending. Nothing but a drama of the medium and predictable love triangle, with the two thirds of the triangle not surviving the film. Praised for its visual quality; while it has that realistic feeling of the 70s, there are limits to how enchanting cornfields can be. You can shoot them with 1500 mm cameras, for what interests me, but they are still cornfields. <br /> <br /> Gere, who at first glance appears to be a mixture like a kind of low-class worker transformed into a Wheatfield worker, is quite solid, while Brooke Adams appears distant and cool for most of the film, doing wonder how much he loved both hunks. But for those looking for a film that shows all the glorious colors of a wheat field, look no further: you have found your dream! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biographies" by Richard Gere and other Hollywood intellectual heavyweights, contact me by e-mail.
