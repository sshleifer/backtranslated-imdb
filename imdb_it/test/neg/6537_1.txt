Despite many positive reviews, this is a very slow film with three substantially good actors who improvise the most banal dialogue you've ever heard. This is another road movie that does not go right where. The camera is often not in focus and constant panning in some of the long scenes is annoying. <br /> <br /> The three characters are attractive but welcome. The cast also sets what must be an intergalactic record for the use of the tired word "friend". (Even Howard Stern abandoned this tired pesudo pronoun). <br /> <br /> The three main actors and a secondary actor show great promise. They are clearly comfortable and bravely describe themselves as superficial and even stupid. The leading actors all seem to be amateur amateurs who have generously offered to express a few jokes. In fact, everyone physically adapts well to their roles. <br /> <br /> All in all a dull 90 minutes that seems more like an eternity. This is among my ten worst movies of all time.
