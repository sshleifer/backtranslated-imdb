Before the days of home video, Stan Laurel's pre-Hardy comedy "Kill or Cure" was known - as it was known - only because some sequences were included in the Robert Youngson compilation "Laurel and Hardy's Laughing". 20. Youngson knew what he was doing: the best 'Kill or Cure' gags were brought intact into his compilation, while the rest of this only slightly funny comedy remained on the floor of Youngson's cutting room. <br /> <br /> Laurel plays a commercial traveler, shouting patent medicine, cried Professor IO Dine's Knox-All: this name is the funniest joke in this film, which doesn't say much. I would like to emphasize that this film dates back to 1923, the shank of prohibition. During prohibition, quite a few Americans bought patent medicine if they had (er!) "Medicinal" properties, so - if Knox-All contains alcohol - Stan's work in this film is less desperate than he and Ollie notoriously had in "Big Business", selling Christmas trees in the summer. Too bad for this movie that it's not as fun as 'Big Business'. <br /> <br /> We see Stan (but we don't hear him in this silent film) delivering a lively sales speech to a man who seems to pay attention ... until we learn that they are outside a deaf-mute institution, and this man is deaf. A haughty woman emerges from the gates: Stan quickly tries to get his attention by waving his fingers at her. Of course she is not deaf, and she promptly hits him with an umbrella. I found this sequence offensive, NOT because it involves deaf people (the deaf are not the target of the joke), but because it stimulates the widespread idea among hearing people that they can communicate with the deaf by simply moving their fingers at random and performing sciarade without actually learning the highly complex grammar of sign language. <br /> <br /> More fun, a spinster in this film has a canary named Rudolph (as in Valentino), and there is a gag involving the photography of makeup allowing a man to hide behind an object more tight of her body. I've seen this device in different cartoons and action films, but "Kill or Cure" is, I believe, the first movie to use it that I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Stan Laurel, an undervalued actor, does some physical activity here that is worthy of Chaplin or Keaton, in which he transmits his emotions - and a change in his demeanor - as he walks away from the camera with his back to us. However, Laurel never became a first-rate comedian until he joined Oliver Hardy to form the greatest comedy ever. 'Kill or Cure' barely registers 3 out of 10.
