Bare Wench is another soft parody of the Blair Witch project (I think there are about two dozen of those things out there). He has 5 very attractive women (which includes Nikki Fritz, Julie Smith and Julie Strain), and an idiot type whose sole purpose is to provide comic relief. <br /> <br /> Okay, so I'm thinking "Cool Great looking women, having a softcore lesbian sex in about 10 minutes, this should be really good." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the producers they blew it up. There is nothing in this video that actually qualifies as a sex scene. There are a couple of false starts, but most of the action is just the women posing for the camera. I imagine that once the producers had spent their money on women, and spent more on getting their clothes removed, they had no more money to actually get them to do something. And I imagine they used all their allotted nudity times too soon, because towards the end of the video there is a huge amount of useless dialogues that are obviously not used for any other reason than to complete the execution time. "You're a liar! No, you are! Go to the cave! Don't go! I think we should go home! Well, I don't!" This goes on forever. <br /> <br /> There is much better than this.
