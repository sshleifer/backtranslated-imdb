I am an Indian resident in the United States. Because India continues, like a stupid animal, to emulate all that is American besides me !! The main problems of the film are not so much the inane plot and the stupid comedy. Is that this film has a lot of sex, moving, women who dress like bitches in the streets and a lot of blasphemies that do not belong to anyone on TV <br /> <br /> to producers and directors of this film I have this message: continue to weaken the strong family values ​​of our nation by doing this kind of garbage. Continue to let the young women believe that it is right to have a feminist attitude and not have morals. You keep making dance songs that belong to the lowest of adult clubs and bars. I'm ashamed to be an Indian after watching movies like this. <br /> <br /> In 2003, the US government suggested that the best way to destroy Iran is to "send miniskirts" there. No need to do it for India. We will destroy ourselves with garbage like this.
