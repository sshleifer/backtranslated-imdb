Hmmm, not a patch on the original by Shaw Brothers. Combat is average and looks very clumsy. The plot is as expected from a Kung Fu film of the 70s, confused and silly. Stupid voices for women, dubbed in elegant English men's accents. I turned it off early and I love martial arts movies. Take the original, it's much better than this average movie, don't be fooled, I bought the wrong movie I wanted to be the Shaw brothers movie. I have just started to comment, I'm just making foreign and martial arts movies this is just the beginning of my movie collection, personally I own the most modern martial arts movies. I hope you don't waste your time looking at this, it's only for the 70's Kung Fu fans.
