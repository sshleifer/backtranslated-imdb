Let's go straight to the heart of the matter ... This is a terrible film. The plot is confusing, the supporting cast is ridiculous and the main actors seem to have been forced to participate. History asks us to believe that there is a clandestine lesbian sexual cult in which members are killed by their psychiatrist who appears to be a transvestite. Ellen Barkin investigates crimes and develops a crush on Peta Wilson, whose work appears to be the cult recruiter. Sex scenes are the equivalent of bad porn and when Barkin and Wilson kiss, Poor Ellen seems to suffer. Barkin's talent is totally wasted on this piece of male Bupload junk and I hope he gave his agent the pink slip after he landed her in this movie.
