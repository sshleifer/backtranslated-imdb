I found this film extremely disturbing. Treadwell is delirious and disturbed, to the point of probably suffering from a mental illness. The film shown is he and not an actor, but he shows a behavior that ended with death. Is it appropriate to show the actual footage of a suicide? We are not talking about words. The film shows footage of behavior that led directly to his death. <br /> <br /> For those who think that Treadwell is a kind of hero, think again. The footage he shot is about him and not about the bears and foxes he claimed to help. He did not do significant research on their habits or numbers and did nothing to protect them. All he did was run through the bush and convince himself that he was better than the others. The reality is that, by helping to desensitize animals to humans, it exposes them to great risks. His self-indulgent behavior did not cause his own death, but even the death of his companion Amy more exposed his beloved bears and foxes to greater damage. <br /> <br /> But I'm also worried about Werner Herzog's actions in compiling this film like him. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine and I have been talking at length about this movie that loved this movie. He believes that seriously disturbed people create interesting topics and cites the movie Downfall as an example. But in Downfall they use actors. We haven't seen the real Madga Goebells put the cyanide capsules in her children's mouths. <br /> <br /> There was something about using the real movie in Grizzly Man that reminded me of that horrible tragedy of the soccer stadium where people were crushed to death and photographers who could help, elected simply to continue to record the horror. <br /> <br /> Herzog's film shows us that the Treadwell movie talks more about Treadwell. But Herzog did the same. His personality and his opinions are transmitted in this documentary, which is presumably on someone else. Scenes like the one in which you listen to the tape are not necessary. We already knew what was on the tape because the coroner had told us. We didn't need Herzog to shed a tear with one of Treadwell's ex-girlfriends. Did not add to the film. <br /> <br /> The film showed us that Treadwell was very self-indulgent, but he also showed us that Herzog is too.
