My review is divided into questions that you really should ask yourself: <br /> <br /> 1. The plants that people eat have been made hundreds of times. It has been used by Nintendo in everything from Mario to Zelda to Metroid Prime. It has been used in many low-budget films of the 1950s, on par with Godzilla's lowest franchise. And this brings him to another level of cheese with the plants that SPEAK. I don't know anyone who came out, but I know a lot of people who burst into hysterical laughter during parts of this movie. I was one of them. Does the horror genre deserve anything better than this laughable shit pile? <br /> <br /> 2. Characters could be easily copied / pasted from Hostel or Wrong Turn or Wolf Creek or from any other movie with collage children with bad luck. Yet is it called "characterizing" when the film takes hours of your time to say clich√©s that hundreds of characters have had before? Haven't you ever wanted a movie to have characters that weren't just pieces of meat you could forget with your legs? <br /> <br /> 3. This was not bloody. A boy cuts his skin. Oh my! (Not.) A boy breaks his legs. Oh my! Gasp! (Not.) I showed films like this to my mother who hates everything that has to do with horror because it makes her sick, and she said, "I've seen PG movies worse than that! Why was it ranked R? " So why was R classified? <br /> <br /> 4. Here is the only plot of the film / book: collages, children, drink, have sex, remain naked, come out, bleed and eventually die. Is this perhaps the most typical example of an economic and carefree horror film, yet people call it "mature"? What. . .? <br /> <br /> 5. I don't think I've ever seen anything less original in the sense that I saw A Beautiful Mind. <br /> <br /> You never sat there and wished that the horror genre, easily the most varied genre out there, could do anything. . . well, different? Something really original? <br /> <br /> I just hope horror movies can have a real horror, not just economic collage parties staged with some splashes of fake blood being thrown around. <br /> <br /> 1/10
