CAMPOGNE BLOOD <br /> <br /> Format: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> While walking in the nearby woods at the Blackwood Camp desert - the site of an unsolved murder ten years earlier - four young city dwellers are targeted by a masked psychopath who kills their guide (Courtney Harris) and pursues them through the woods with murderous intentions ... < br /> <br /> Low-power time-waster, shot on video camera using the sequential 3-D format of the Nu-View field. There is a plot, at least, but the script closely adheres to a consolidated project (with obvious hints of the genre to "Friday 13", "The Burning" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre") without adding anything even remotely new or interesting for the formula. Director Brad Sykes - also responsible for similar 3-D efforts such as THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES (2001) and BLOODY TEASE (2002) - mentions the early works of George A. Romero and Sam Raimi as key influences of his career, but while directors challenged the mainstream with their budgetless efforts, Sykes uses video technology to imitate his movie heroes, resulting in a home movie with delusions of grandeur. Apart from the 3-D format, there is NOTHING here to guarantee anyone's attention. Followed by CAMP BLOOD 2 (2000).
