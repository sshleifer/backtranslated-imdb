First of all, I would like to admit that Chokher Bali was not my cup of tea. Evidently this film was not aimed at the masses. It's the kind critics would like to watch. The hype and publicity were rather misleading. <br /> <br /> I was expecting something very dramatic like Devdas. Understanding that history and time require it, I found the film extremely slow. <br /> <br /> I'm a huge fan of Aishwarya, and I'm sorry to say I thought it was uncomfortable. The role of Chokher Bali required an actress who could interpret herself as subversive, innocent and naive. All others have performed well. The depiction of Tagore's human condition crosses the celluloid to give the film an interesting theme.
