Subspecies is set in Romania, where two American university students, Michele (Laura Mae Tate) and Lillian (Michelle McBride), arrive to study local folklore with the help of local friend Mara (Irina Movila). There, they rent rooms in a hotel and become curious about the mysterious ruins of a nearby castle, it turns out that a powerful and evil vampire named Radu (Anders Hove) lives there who stole the Bloodstone from his father King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm). Radu takes a liking to the three girls and begins to drink the blood of Mara and Lillian, meanwhile Michele falls in love with a boy named Stefan (Michael Watson) who by chance is Radu's brother. Michele and Stefan decide to collaborate and free the world from the evil Radu ... Directed by Ted Nicolaou, this film seems to be very appreciated among the fans of the genre and, even if it's not terrible, I wouldn't do it. I call it very well and I really don't see much to be excited about. The subspecies is a rather slow film, it doesn't happen much and while trying to stay close to certain classic vampire traditions there are all this nonsense about a Bloodstone and some little monsters that grow from Radu's severed fingertips for some reason. The subspecies could have been a half-decent film if it weren't for the fact that it's boring, I really can't remember it very well or badly. The character is fine, but some of the dialogues are silly and there is a scene that annoyed me near the beginning when the girls are at the castle ruins and it is said they have to go because it is getting dark, but it is still clearly half of the day and very bright. There is also a scene where one of the American girls finds a coffin in the attic of the hotel and she doesn't seem really bothered by this, I'm not funny but she's a guy whose house I had to have a coffin in her attic I would be very, very worried if you understand what I mean. I don't think I'd ever look at it again, there's no real threat, the plot is weak that mixes the classic Vampire themes with silly sub-themes and I was definitely indifferent to all this. It is not the worst film ever, but hardly the best. <br /> <br /> The film looks nice with nice locations and some local scenarios, although you feel that the appearance is less than the budget rather than the creators seeking authenticity. There is not much blood besides a beheading and some broken fingertips. For no apparent reason the producers throw animated monsters in mid-looking stop-motion, which actually do nothing or have much meaning for the story. <br /> <br /> Shot at low cost from the production of Full Moon Entertainment by the Charles Band company in Bucharest in Romania, the production values ​​are good and better than many Band productions later. The acting is not exceptional with many actors performing below average performances, while the regular Angus Scrimm genre has a small cameo at the beginning. There is a bit of style here on some occasions with some scenes that are very reminiscent of the original Nosferatu (1922), especially the tip that shows the shadow of Radu coming down the stairs with long clawed nails that stand out . <br /> <br /> Subspecies is a film that many seem to like for reasons I don't see, I thought it was beyond the average at best and overall rather boring. Followed by Bloodstone: Subspecies II (1993), Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994), Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm (1998) and the film spin0off Vampire Journals (1997).
