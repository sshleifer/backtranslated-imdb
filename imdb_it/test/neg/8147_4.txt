Of course, I've seen the MST3K version of this, but it's actually not too bad, at least compared to others that deserve my cinematic hatred. <br /> <br /> The story centers on a girl in distress mistakenly sent to a "reform" school "called the City of girls". Along the way races, redemption and (unintentional) extravagance occur. The plot and the acting are a bit flat, as is the action. However, the whole thing is actually fun if you're absolutely bored. <br /> <br /> In general, just a simple 50s sub film, but far from the worst film ever made, with some bright spots in the film (The Ave Maria sequence was good for me). <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see the MST3K version, you won't be disappointed. Alone, not so much, but I can think of worse methods of torture ("Spiker" anyone?).
