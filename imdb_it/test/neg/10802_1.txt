But at least this film got what it deserved - to be sent to the Satellite of Love to be ridiculed by Pearl Forrester's Mike, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot on "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" "Soultaker" is one of those lost and forgotten films that are so bad that you will be guaranteed to have nightmares or depression later in life. Although the film is not so old, it is still a very forgotten type of film. If it had never been for the clever minds of "Mystery Science Theater 3000", the film would not only appear to have never been made, but the film would not have been very pleasant for us film fans. <br /> <br /> In real life: this movie is really bad. In the Satellite of Love: this movie is excellent!
