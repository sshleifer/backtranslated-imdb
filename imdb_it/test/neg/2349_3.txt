regardless of what someone says, it's a b-movie, and the effects are scarce ... if you are a vampire fanatic, I suppose it would be OK, not 10 out of 10, do you others sincerely mean this? we must see it as a film, not read it as a book, so the effects and the characters are important, as is the story. The story is good, but the film does not carry, no wonder it has a low score. I write this because I chose to watch this movie when I saw some good reviews here on IMDb, but I was deeply disappointed. don't get me wrong, I thought that the Blade movies were fantastic and that they loved the movies of the underworld, but these characters are not close. the vampire trick is badly done and the effects are worse. this sucks I might not have been so disappointed if I hadn't read the reviews that told me how good it was. Reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something, seriously, if you think it's great, you don't mind acting or making up. this is better as a book. 3 out of 10 for a story OK ..
