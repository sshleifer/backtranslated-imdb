I was pleasantly surprised by this. It is actually quite interesting and engaging. The cast is strong, even Dan Cortese. Brooke Shields has become her actress. The black and white must have really freed her, because I have never seen her in this order interpret a conventional character. If marketed on the right, it could be a medium-sized success.
