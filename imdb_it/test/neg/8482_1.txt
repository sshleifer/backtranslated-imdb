OK, about 11 years ago the fantastic and funny movie "The Mask" was released and everyone loved it and now, 11 years later, the mask is brought back into this fantastic movie right? MISTAKEN!!!!!!!!!! this movie was the stupidest movie I've ever seen !! I mean, when I rented it, I thought I would have laughed so hard that I would almost pee pants like from the first one. but after I saw this "sequel", the barley even brought out a chuckle. I don't mean offense to the director or cast of this film, but what a waste of time and money. therefore, the storyline of the whole story was about this little child who has a part of the mask in him and this evil person is after him for something, because that's all I really have, I would have added at least some things to it therefore it would be higher than 2 out of 10 stars.
