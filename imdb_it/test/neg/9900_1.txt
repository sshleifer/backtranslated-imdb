This fact for TV movies concerns all the clichés that can be invented for a catastrophic film. The only problem is that it is not very well done. <br /> <br /> My brain is still insulted by the scenes in which Brian Dennehy is apparently looking at a computer monitor looking for weather pattern data and showing on that monitor are stock footage wing wing turbulence spots of weather channels. Why watch a local news footage of a faded side street give an idea of ​​global weather patterns? You got me. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, scattered for the first two hours are some of the worst CGI effects known to man. Look at the semitrailer and the plane that appear to have been returned to a Commodore 64. <br /> <br /> All the foreshadowing in this "movie" is done with the subtlety of a hammer, the dialogue is forced and I can't to think of a nice character that I want to survive in the second part. <br /> <br /> The character I hate most is the stupid wife that her husband is cheating. Perhaps if she had raised a finger at any time during the show instead of being a defenseless woman who is in the same 10 square meters of the kitchen all day, her husband wouldn't go to bed with the public relations representative for a rival energy company . She is so helpless, in fact, I want to put her out of her and my unhappiness. I hope everyone in this "movie" dies in the second half.
