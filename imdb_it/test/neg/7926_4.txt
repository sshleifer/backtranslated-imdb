My first impression of the trailer for the Saikano movie: Live Action (viewable on YouTube) was "Wow, maybe this could be one of the few best live-action anime adaptations." <br /> <br /> This time I was just wrong! Simply put, the live Saikano movie was a puzzle that lacked a certain number of pieces; put together just enough to get the vague image of everything. <br /> <br /> * STORY * <br /> <br /> The film story vaguely follows the anime and the manga, but the film story is just a car frame rather than a complete car. It seems that many parts of the story originally in the anime have been left out, altered or completely changed. In reality the ending is completely different from the manga or the end of the souls. <br /> <br /> Particular characters; many left out or had a different feeling. The connection between Fuyumi and Shuji is reduced to that of Shuji who knows her because she is the lady of the video store. The character of Chise already seemed too strong and only pronounced the infamous excuse for a few times in the film. The same can be said with Shuji. We have lost the shy yet high male protagonist, the song he hums and his frequent action of calling Silly Chise. Other characters like Tetsu and Akemi had a different, subdued atmosphere. Perhaps the downfall and attenuation of other characters was to focus much more on Chise and Shuji, which he did. Too much. Do you expect lots of sweet action scenes like the ones in the trailer? Well, don't do it! Those in the trailer plus a few minutes, is the only amount of action you'll get. Much of the film talks about this while I was flipping through the film before looking at it all, I thought I had a romantic drama in Asia. <br /> <br /> The pace was too fast. In the film, we see the famous scene of Chise armed with small wings and a chain gun arm, in less than nine minutes from the start. There is little time to get to know the characters and connect with them. What they should have done was split it into two films, or even a trilogy. If it hadn't been so many things they should be changed or eliminated. <br /> <br /> But once again the film acts like a frame. The anime was more than a complete car, although all those little details and these are minor that they can really add. <br /> <br /> * PRODUCTION * <br /> <br /> -Visuals- The visuals were disappointing. Most of the special effects were rather poor, especially the CGI. Unfortunately, they were like those found on science fiction channel movies. They are bearable and this film is not for the effects. <br /> <br /> -Music- The music was average. Much of it was orchestral background music, except that there were really no themes. The film dropped the gripping song that Shuji always sang in the anime. A remarkable piece of music is the final song, heard in the trailer. Not a bad song and somehow beautiful. It is a pity that it was not integrated into the film as itself or in an orchestrated version of the song. <br /> <br /> -Casting- The casting of Saikano was also so-so. The main protagonist was the actor Chises Aki Maeda, who is most famous for his role in the Battle Royale films. The actor who played Shuji was pretty good but they took his glasses off the original character. Oh yes and Tetsuo looks like Lupine the 3rd. <br /> <br /> Unlike the one I heard from a few others, the acting in the Saikano live-action wasn't so bad. Rather I feel guilty is the way the plot was presented and the series ended in a single two-hour movie. <br /> <br /> * What you can learn from the Saikano live action: * <br /> <br /> - CGI - I really wish the CGI of Saikano hadn't been so bad. But even with that, we could have got some more fighting scenes! Probably the most anticipated live-action anime adaptation Neon Genesis Evangelion will most likely not suffer as they currently have WETA Studios assigned to make the effects. <br /> <br /> -Modernism- Fuyumi owned a video store. Chise used a cassette player to listen to music and gave Shuji a mix tape for her birthday. Why? This film was made in 2006! Not only in the reality of films can they create things like Chise, so they can't take place in the 90s! The future is an age of CDs, DVDs and MP3 players. Hopefully in Evangelion, Shinji will have a Sony Walkman MP3 player. NOT one that plays cassette tapes. <br /> <br /> -Story & Pacing- As mentioned above, Saikano's film moved too fast and forced the story to drop many details. It was a smart move on ADV Films and everyone else, to make Evangelion a solid trilogy, thus allowing more time to tell the story as true to the original as possible. <br /> <br /> -Characters- Leave most character drawings alone and let those classic quotes be said! And if the live Evangelion didn't have Asuka "What are you, stupid ?!" or Shinji: "I don't have to run!" Sometimes small as they seem, those frequent quotes add and are who the characters are. <br /> <br /> * CONCLUSION: * <br /> <br /> All in all, the live Saikano action movie had potential. He really did it. Those who are not fans and see this film: you will be reluctant to start the anime or the manga (so don't watch the movie first!) The people who have seen and appreciated the anime / manga, have no illusions about this that you will most likely be disappointed. It was still fun to see the anime come alive in the live action adaptation, but it could have been much more. <br /> <br /> Reluctantly, I give a 2-out live action Saishu Heiki Kanojo (Saikano) of 5. <br /> <br /> As Chise says, "I'm sorry" <br /> <br / > ~ NekoTakuto
