When I was little, I absolutely loved The Swan Princess, reliving the same fairy tales of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, the princess and her prince who saves the day is always a timeless story that will never die, well, hopefully. But I thought I would check out the sequels for The Swan Princess to see how they were and, unfortunately, this is the typical cartoon sequel that disappoints more than fun. The only character that I found still very funny was the Queen, she was very funny in this movie and had the best part. But with the changed voice, they were obvious and even bothered me a little, I don't mean to be picky, just that it was too weird for me. The story was also more or less borrowed from the first Swan Princess, only the villain in this film follows in the footsteps of Rothbart. <br /> <br /> Odette and Derek are about to celebrate their one-year anniversary, but Derek has been too worried about fighting for his kingdom to keep him safe. With his mother's birthday coming too, he forgets why there's a new villain in town, Clavious, who hopes to go above and beyond Rothbart's powers and kidnap the Queen for his birthday. But Odette must return to her swan self to help Derek fight him and save his mother. <br /> <br /> The Swan Princess 2 is obviously more than good for children, I don't care, it's good clean fun for them. The reason these sequels are disappointing, though, is that it is usually only for children, that is for the target audience, but it is more enjoyable when jokes and history can be appreciated by everyone. Now there are some laughter and giggles here and there, but this was not so smart, in my opinion, to the first Swan Princess. I would recommend it for the little one, but if you're looking for a funny cartoon movie, I suggest you stay with the first Swan Princess. <br /> <br /> 4/10
