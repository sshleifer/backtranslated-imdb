While this is horribly dated, I MUST insist ... PLEASE, NO REMAKE! Honestly, it will not be of great help, since there is nothing that can be added or modified at the same time to make this cinematically better. <br /> <br /> The novel on which this is based, was atmospheric, well written, really spooky work, but on the film, it doesn't translate. Most of King's written masterpieces fail to translate into films. I'm not sure why this is, but when you see this work, if you see it, you're likely to understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> The book? It's wonderful. It's not a masterpiece, but it's more than fun. <br /> <br /> The movie? Do something else. You can thank me later. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 3.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
