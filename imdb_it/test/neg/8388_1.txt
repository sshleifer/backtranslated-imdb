To date this is still the worst piece of trash I've ever seen. So annoyed I also complained to Blockbuster for doing it. Some friends and I rented it after looking at the back where we thought we were making a good horror movie. The plot seems to change during the film and there were many irrelevant pads. The film ended quite abruptly, I guess they finished the film. The quality of the sound was terrible and the first female character had a strong Spanish accent, even though she spoke nonsense. The boy provided a bit of eye candy until his bizarre attempts at murder. After losing all the time to go into an in-depth discussion of the lab and its many power tools, he decides to put a plastic bag over his head. All in all, in retrospect, I think you have to watch this movie to really believe it exists.
