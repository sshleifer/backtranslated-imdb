In fact, I liked parts of it very much. He had some interesting twists. But it left me with just one presence, I saw that feeling after all the SAW movies. Assuming the ending was different from a typical Saw, but let's face it ... a bunch of guys, unknown to each other (or so they believe) put together in an abandoned chemical factory .... <br /> <br /> But then lose something. There is no intensity, there is little group dynamics, there is no sense of urgency. <br /> <br /> Some twist at the end, and definitely worth a watch if there's nothing else on your plate, but it left me blank. ... time has passed, but has not satisfied.
