The only reason I saw this is because of its stars, CASPAR Van Dien, Michael Pare & Eric Roberts and Catherine Oxenburg * and Jeniffer Rubin, all capable actors and have performed well in the past. NOT THIS TIME, a weak serial killer story, you can guess who the killer is in the first scene. Very ingenious in all aspects there is nothing to recommend in this disaster, my score is * 1/2 POOR
