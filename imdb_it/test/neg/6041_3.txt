Webs starts in 'Chicago: Present Day' as four electricians, Dean (Richard Grieco), Ray (Richard Yearwood), Sheldon (Jeffrey Douglas) and Junior (Jason Jones) are about to disconnect electricity in an unused building scheduled for demolition . While searching for cables and relevant things, they come across a series of doors that, according to the buildings, the blue prints should not be there, being nosy and all that force the doors to open to take a look and find a room full of computers and scientific machinery. While playing with some buttons he opens a portal for a parallel universe, Dean & Junior "accidentally" falls with Ray & Sheldon immediately after looking for their friends. Unfortunately they all ended up in an exact parallel Earth that was absorbed by a mutant spider creature that eats people or turns them into mutant soldiers that they use to protect themselves and do whatever they really want. In a desperate search for survival they join some of the last remaining humans including the original inventor of the portal Dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox) who says that with the help of our electrician boys could (yes he could) be able to build another portal to take them home ... <br /> <br /> Modified and directed by David Wu I thought Webs was pretty crappy, it's as simple and straightforward as that. The script of Grenville Case & Robinson Young is ridiculous to say the least and has holes in the plot where you could drive a tank, for example this film really tries to suggest that some mutant spider things are not bigger than a couple of people in size have they taken over an entire world? How did they do this? If this parallel Earth were the same as ours, where the hell was the army? Police? All our weapons? Some fragile spider objects against literally billions of humans ?! The whole imperfect, stupid and absolutely inalienable concept has constantly bothered me throughout the film. Let's not forget that there is an interdimensional portal on a parallel Earth in the basement of most buildings that have remained undisturbed for decades and remain fully functional, right? Then there is the nuclear reactor the size of a briefcase, the fact that an electrician can make it work perfectly by accident while he randomly presses some buttons in a room that was probably 100 years old spread over dozens of pieces of equipment and what to say about the thoughtful boy who blows up an explosive trap in his base without telling anyone, and if one of his companions had blown him up and found himself blowing himself up by their companions, the homemade bomb? You wouldn't be happy, would you? And the food? Do they grow their own in small gardens? I could go on and on all day about how badly designed, badly written webs are, but I can't be disturbed. The characters are clich√©s and annoying as the film as a whole that obviously doesn't help. The only decent thing I can say about Webs is that it is short and goes on at a good pace, but when all is said and done it is still crap. <br /> <br /> Director Wu has to take a big chunck of blaming here, to start the film looks cheap and the editing he is credited with is terrible. There are many annoying slow motion shots that come from nowhere, the action scenes are almost identical and become incredibly boring very quickly. Use this annoying fast cutting technique and some of the old camera movement, now I don't know anyone else, but I hate this style of editing because it looks like a complete incoherent mess. In fact, I don't know a single person who likes this kind of thing and I'm puzzled as to why the filmmakers think people do it. Forget any gore, just some gunshot wounds to soldier zombie spider soldiers and they don't have red blood anyway, so it's not related to reality in my mind. <br /> <br /> Webs was created for -TV, the American science fiction channel I believe and looks cheap, cheap and fast as you'd expect. It's all so bland, forgettable, flat and boring. The special effects are anything but special and the spider thing lacks imagination when it is finally revealed. The acting was OK considering that everything else was so poor and I still can't believe that the Grieco sweater wore in this. <br /> <br /> Webs sucks, I can't say anything good, apart from that I've seen worse movies and that's the only reason I'm not giving them 1 star and a quick look at IMDb user reviews for Webs it confirms what I already knew as it has more '1' votes than any other and there is a very good reason why ...
