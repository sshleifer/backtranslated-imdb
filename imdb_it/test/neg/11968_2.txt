So unfortunately my partner and I watched this !!! He was showing on a Sky channel here called "Horror Zone", which basically shows horrid B-movie horror movies 24/7. It was a boring Friday night so I decided to laugh and take a look at it. Apart from the atrocious acting, the horrible plot, the disastrous effects, the poor camera work and the brain that numbs the ridiculousness of all this, it was OK, LOL !!! In all seriousness it was a good laugh to dig and laugh at the stupid actors. There is a bit of semi-nudity that awakened the film a bit, unfortunately it was the heck of being topless while my partner calls it: oD If you're bored one night and it's time to play, grab the occasion, you might like :)
