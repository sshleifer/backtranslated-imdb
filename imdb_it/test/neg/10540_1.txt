The best thing about the film is the name, as it describes both the plot and the acting. At least they can't say they didn't warn you ... kind of like the button labeled "Don't push this." <br /> <br /> Segal must have exhausted the things that move like planes, trains and ships but the plot remains the same. Under cover, a boy who fights slowly, but still beats like 40 types of mercenaries and doesn't even blink when he does. What amazes me is that Segal is now as big as a barn and the bad guys still can't hit him in a corridor with a machine gun and 50 ammunition clips. Where do all these bullets actually go? The only saving feature of this film is the vision of Nia Peeples in the role of Ja Rule (real name Jeffrey Atkins does not sound quite so punk) in the floor. I could spend days looking at that woman who kicked her on the shoulder like that ... especially wearing a dress like that! It was just a bonus to watch Jeffy get is * ss kicked, and funny hoping that one of those kicks actually landed. Sorry, it's only now that we've become stupid, the tough guy can't act out of movies. Pleeeeease! Who designed it anyway? I'd like him to be the person who decided that Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore would pass as witty athletic angels. The only surprise in this film is that they don't do the politically correct thing and get Jeffy in and save the day. No doubt if Snoop (otherwise known to his mom as Calvin Broadus who still doesn't sound so loud when referring to him as Cal) had been in the movie, he would have cast some marks on her and probably saved Segal's life or something.
