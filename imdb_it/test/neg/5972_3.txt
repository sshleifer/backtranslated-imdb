This documentary was boring and quite stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean ... does the documentarian obviously not even know how Darwinian evolution works? It's a theory, and the name is simply stupid. Reading a college biology textbook could tell the director what Darwinism really is. Darwinism is a good theory, but evil if it is done as politics. <br /> <br /> Furthermore there were no concrete proofs in this documentary just interviewing some people ... no expert testimony and shady conductors ... <br /> <br /> Even the documentary was boring. I mean it could have been changed up to 35 minutes, and then it would have been much better. <br /> <br /> There are much better documentaries than this ... it was not worth looking at ... you can get better information from Wikipedia = D DON'T REFUSE YOUR MONEY AND TIME!
