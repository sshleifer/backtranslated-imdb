Last month I suffered from watching this movie at the Sitges Festival. If there is the possibility of "unfilm" to avoid its existence, this should be the first on the list. María Lidón is not a director, she is just a stupid woman who pretends to hold a camera with her hand and scream "action" makes her a professional director. What a mistake! The film itself is useless and a total waste of good actors who could do something better in another project. Val Kilmer does nothing but put his face in front of the camera. His character does not have a specific weight in the film. The same can be said of Joss Ackland, Vincent Gallo or Joaquim De Almeida. It is a pity the way the character of Rade Serbedzija was written. WARNING SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Spend most of the time alone in the tunnels talking to himself in the way (now I'm doing this, I'm running out of bats now, I'll look in my bag, now I'm turning left now I'm turning right ...) just to bring the public a clear idea of ​​his actions. It is simply an absurdity and demonstrates the director's lack of talent. END OF SPOILER <br /> <br /> The usual joke about this piece of junk in the audience was that the title of the movie itself brought the clue to the assessment that everyone should give: ZERO
