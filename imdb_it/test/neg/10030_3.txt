The prey has an interesting history, unless you remember the advertisements for him in the newspapers in June 1984, perhaps you would have captured it on the film channel in the summer of 1985, but little else is remembered. The plot is again your basic killer in the woods. But ironically, this was shot before Friday 13. The prey was actually shot in 1978, according to one of the actors in an interview years later. But released for about a week in some drive ins (yes, Jim, the namans guide showed it in June 1984). But it looks dated. Perhaps they released it later to cash in on all the other terror films that the market has been inundated since 1984. Now, in history, it has some sort of backstory, a forest fire in 1940 leaves a lot of gypsies burned to death. But one of their sons survives (our monster) so fast up to our days that it would be 1978, we have an older middle-aged couple who camp only to be sent by the Monster. The demarcation line for this image states is NOT HUMAN, AND IT IS AN AXIS, but an Ax has been used only in these first two murders. Now we have a group of teenagers who look like them in their 20-year-old campground. We all know that they are the prey and the monster hits them one by one. For an 80-minute film, it seems longer. We also have many wild animal movies to fill in the gaps for 80 minutes. Overall, to be included in a horror film of the 1980s, it seems more than ever the 70s. Hey the Prey has the potential to be a good horror killer in the forest movie, but it falls a little late .. However it has a rather scary looking monster at the end, and we have to wait until the last 2 minutes to see it. A side note, the monster continued to act in the Addams family films in the 1990s.
