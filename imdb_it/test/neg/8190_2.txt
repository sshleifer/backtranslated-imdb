I have not seen many films worse than this. The plot, the dialogues, the acting: it's horror! The story jumps from a to b to c without intermediate logical steps. Every time you think you've lost something, but no: that was how it had to be. And why is it the character that Jenny Garth portrays so in love with that non-losing boy (who currently stars in the film Cinderella Man with Russell Crow!)? Or well, it's not Spielberg, of course ... I have to write ten lines to be published. This film is not really inspiring enough to write 10 lines! It's a romantic movie, with a bad story, so if you're ready for it, you'll have a ball.
