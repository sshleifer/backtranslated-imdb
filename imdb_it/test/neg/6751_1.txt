this was pretty bad. pedestrian work or worse. I don't think he was homophobic, just very ugly. if anything, it was really amateurish, like when you are 14 and you first discover cursed words and magazines for the skin. <br /> <br /> The main point of this film, the love story, falls really flat. I can't help but wonder if the writers have ever had serious relationships before this film. <br /> <br /> plotting and walking are horrible, without going anywhere. one minute we watch these guys catch cheaters, then we're in a gay club, so we're on a date. out of nowhere the girl likes comics and then they sleep together. none of this seems real, like a Shakespeare elementary school production if Hamlet had been written by a confrere. <br /> <br /> The finale was a kind of creepy revenge fantasy from a loser who was dumped by a girl. Useless and actually a little disturbing. <br /> <br /> However, you have to watch it. Why? <br /> <br /> As others have noted, the director's comment is actually hilarious - what kind of professional talk about "banging" or "connecting" with actresses? dialogue sucked, relationships lacked chemistry. you'll be on the floor laughing at this pretentious asshole.
