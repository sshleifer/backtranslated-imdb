A man arrives in the psychiatrist's office Dr. Sammael (Joan Severance) claiming to be the demon Asmodeus (Kane Hodder), the torturer of hell level thirteen, and he would like to say strange things. He says he made a deal with Lucifer to become human again. He should take down his virgin sister Mary Elizabeth (Alison Brie) the day their mother died and she was supposed to kill six people and deliver the Anti-Christ, and then he would escape from the pit and be reborn. When Mary Elizabeth becomes pregnant, her stressed and violent sister Catherine (Denise Crosby) does not believe she is a virgin, but their father and former obstetrician Albert Martino (James Callahan) examines his daughter and sees her hymen intact. Meanwhile, the Church discovers the truth about Mary Elizabeth's pregnancy and sends the priest and former military father Anthony (Eddie Velez) to spy on Mary Elizabeth. It is dominated by the fetus and forced to kill a truck driver, Lars (Jorg Sirtl), who is the lover of his tenant and friend Jennifer (Azalea Davila), and Jennifer herself and eats their hearts and drinks their blood, but believes that has nightmares. However during ultrasound, he realizes that he is carrying a monster and asks his father to terminate the pregnancy. But it's too late. <br /> <br /> The horrible "Born" is a B-movie (actually a Z movie) that believes it's a great movie. The result is a pretentious and disappointing production, with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and terrible acting and directing. The plot is a complete disaster: there is a priest who is a hit man and a former soldier; a demon in existential crisis that goes into psychiatry; a father examining his daughter's virginity; two female demons (succubi?) that are naked as a statue with both hands covering their sexes; a character who is a whore, and exists only to expose her beautiful body. There are many scenes with free and cheap nudity. But the worst is acting: the unknown actress protagonist Alison Brie is histrionic, with ridiculous voices and grimaces. Sorry, Mrs. Alison Brie, but I hated your boring performance. I didn't recognize Joan Severance, who has a good performance, since I still had the image of his youth. Denise Crosby plays a hateful character like everyone else, she grew up but is still a good actress. I think if the writer and director had included some dark humor and believed that this film was a B movie, the story could have worked better and better. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Anti-Christ" ("The Anti-Christ")
