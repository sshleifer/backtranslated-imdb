Well, I read the other comments. I didn't think it sounded good, but decided to record it anyway. Maybe it's not so smart to read all the negative reviews before watching this movie, because obviously I'd notice all the same strange things. Excessive use of fading in black, some strange camera angles and crossed dialogues for different conversations with the same people taking place at different times! But noticing everything I thought to myself: well, it would probably be really boring if everything went in chronological order. Conversations are not so exciting, but a little obligatory. And the constant fading of black after really short scenes makes it seem that the story is also the most interesting part. Skip the boring bits. At the end of the film it also becomes a bit exciting. Will they survive? <br /> <br /> So did I really like this movie? No, not really. The director had some interesting ideas on how to prevent the public from getting bored while trying to introduce the characters. But he is exaggerating. It becomes annoying and sometimes confusing. Apparently it was just the second film he directed, so maybe he will learn and do really good things in the future. And if you're sitting there (in the future) reading this, I wonder if the second film by famous directors is worth watching. Well, if it's good in the future, sure, look at this shit and you wonder why he did a third. Otherwise, this movie is not worth watching unless you are very interested in creating movies, and you want to see a way in which you can cut out the annoying introductory scenes into something that can be watched.
