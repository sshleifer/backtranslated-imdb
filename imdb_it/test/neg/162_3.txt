I just finished watching The Edge of Love (by the way, this is one of the worst titles so far this year) and I felt like a chore. Watching Keira Knightly's unlikely skeletal-looking character made me shiver even more during the film. <br /> <br /> It took me four nights to see that it was so boring. The only positive thing was Cillian Murphy. It is always good / credible and is strictly considered in many films. This, however, was not good enough for him. <br /> <br /> Apart from the unlikely characters, boring plot, the plot was also emotionally unsatisfactory. I felt like I spent my time watching this for nothing (which I did). I should have done the smart thing and turned it off, but I kept it out of respect for Cillian Murphy and the big film industry.
