It is easy to say at the beginning of this film exactly what will happen and who will die. There are about 4 women and a man on vacation. This was done during the late 1970s ultraviolet, when blonde women had presumably survived ultra-American and brunettes deserved death. <br /> <br /> This film, like the others of that era, makes it about this, and the viewer knows it. There is no mystery or suspense. People argue, but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time, it's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The five people take on two wild young characters, and go crazy. Everyone is crazy, so the team of directors and screenwriters can justify their Nazi propaganda. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the boy is attracted to the blonde, who is not really much to look at, and ignores a super hot-looking brunette that every heterosexual man would have gone mad. It must be remembered that in the seventies, films had to appeal to women and not men. <br /> <br /> Totally disgusting and totally depressing.
