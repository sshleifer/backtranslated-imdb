This takes place on Fire Island in the 1970s. A couple Peter (Craig Dudley) and Buddy (J. Will Deane) are organizing a 4th of July party at their home. Unfortunately their relationship is falling apart and they must prepare for a home full of very strange guests. The rest of the film tells the party and what happens between Peter and Buddy. <br /> <br /> OK - I'm a gay but I was 8 when it was done. If this is a true vision of what gay life was like in the 1970s, I'm glad I wasn't there. From the mysterious opening titles that show children playing in the sand (???) this film slowly slips into disaster. There is a guru (Robert Case) who talks continuously about nothing important. I wanted to gag the boy halfway through his first long speech. There is the young Danny who is there for the first time. There is the lesbian couple (who does nothing - except for a strip without reason). There is the queen of the skin. The worst of all is the effeminate man named Jimmy (Jimmy Foster). We are introduced to him and his friend (whose name I never had) when they get a flat tire. They basically scream and scream for 10 minutes and have no idea how to fix an apartment. I know some people find this funny, but I found it offensive and rather sad. The party itself is full of people you never want to know. It's like being dumped in a party full of bad actors playing hateful people. With the exception of Dudley, no one can act. <br /> <br /> This can be useful as a portrait of how Fire Island was in the 70s ... but it is a rather boring view. This gets a 2 only for the frequent male nudity of some very nice bodies.
