First of all, no one with any police experience (not ER or EMT, but real law enforcement) takes this show seriously. Walker would have been expelled from any police force in the United States for his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics. In addition to this, he is a comic book character - no acting skills, incredibly cramped lines, no character development. The fact that Alex Cahill loves him shows how stupid blondes really are. And Trivett is the last clown in black face. Come on --- if you think Walker is a sincere show without bias, then explain why JT is treated as a traitor, it's always the subject of Walker's jokes, he's never allowed to solve the crime, and he never saves Walker , who should have died 50 times for the stupid things he does. Although it is true that many criminals are more stupid than the chasing detectives (and believe me, most cops are more stupid than filth), the smart ones that Walker encounters never seem to get the point that once captured Walker, the jerk must be put from his misery. But then again, Norris produced the show and starred in it, so how could he want to get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are. As if you're guys waiting to take it one at a time. What a terrible series! He is more demeaning than any western westerns like The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, The Cisco Kid and Wild Bill Hickock, although I imagine many of you here are too young to remember those shows. But like these shows, in the same way as these shows, Walker TR is just as offensive and simply silly.
