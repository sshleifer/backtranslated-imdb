The positive reviews on this page were developed by the directors and their friends. This film is amateur in terms of direction, acting, in fact in every aspect. If the IMDb will allow directors to dictate what is written on their films, then this is a very sad thing. This film has a commercial premise but it's absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> The film is subjective, so everyone has their opinion. But this film is on par with Ed Wood's work, but without any charm. To think differently shows the bad taste of the highest order. <br /> <br /> This is not a personal thing. I don't know anyone associated with the film. I'm just a movie lover who believes that the reviews on this page are completely inaccurate and therefore I felt the need to face the balance and give a more accurate view of the film. It is very poorly done and the management is also below the movie making by the numbers. Acting is the worst ever committed to cinema. The best thing about this film is the cover and the DVD cover. In addition, it is not worth the time.
