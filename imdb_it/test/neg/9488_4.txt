One of the most important / popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. A red shirt female falls for Khan (instead of falling dead - for a change) and then proceeds to betray Kirk and the Enterprise as if loyalty was a non-existent feature on the ship. One wonders what kind of psychology puts this supposedly brilliant Starfleet to the test to test people when they hire. We have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in "Wink Of An Eye", when a male with a red shirt takes the side of the enemy just because he falls in love! As in SS. (However, in that episode the betrayal plays a tiny role in the general plot.) This is very silly because it once again makes Kirk's crew a group of soft-headed idiots, easy to impress, that - once they fall in love with the enemy - they are capable of doing almost anything. The fact that McGivers returns to Kirk's part does not improve the illogical in any way. Lord McGiveth and Lord McTaketh ... <br /> <br /> Why is Khan kept behind a normal door when they know they have superior strength? This is one of many ST plot devices that undermine Kirk's intelligence. Why does Khan hold a knife against McCoy's throat? If Khan is endowed with such superior intelligence, one would expect him to be more astute with the way he behaves. And what can you do with a Sikh with a Latin accent? Montalban should have been accompanied by a vocal coach. I almost expected to hear "the plaaain! The plaaaain!" in the background at any time. Why the hell Kirk (or any ship captain) will provide unlimited use of the ship's library on Enterprise's most internal technical details to ANYONE? Is Starfleet an institution made up exclusively of idiots? <br /> <br /> SS is a stupid and very comics episode, so it's no wonder the Trekkies love it. It does not contain too many elements of science fiction, which is what the Trekkies hate most. We also discover that the ST franchise has chosen to revive this boring character for the second film, in this way the pleasure of the rabid Trekkies, who was so disappointed with the first film that - you guessed it - had too much science fiction for the average Little Brain of Trekkie.
