With Terrible acting, the horrible dialogue, the multitude of bad temper, the loathsome plot and the terrible film. This must be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I'm the king of bad movie searching. For the effects, they simply threw fake blood on people and things, didn't spend the time to create injuries and produce special effects that were worth something. Most people who make low-budget horror films at least do something like fabric clades or something to make a cut wound. The dialogue was anything but decent and the acting was without direction or effort. They just threw some actors on a set and said, they are there. I swear I saw better films from my film I class at school. Why did you get a DVD version?
