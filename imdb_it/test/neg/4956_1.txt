it's embarrassing that I needed 3 minutes to get to a video store job and it was 2 for 1 night and I was really intrigued by the half nekkid picture of the "star". <br /> <br /> I believe this film shows what the New York film school and Sir Daddy's luck - judging by the biography of this clown in his head - can do for you and you and you because that's what we have here and also a photoshopped photo of the protagonist "actor" with the body of someone else in a still image that does not happen anywhere in the film. it is a strange cause in so many ways that money has been thrown away, of course, with little budget change, but from the beginning when all the extras laugh in their scene of terror that does not promise anything good, he might have had some charm if it was made for 2 cents! in a short time I skipped some scenes and made a quick advance to see the image on the box which was all that really interested me. strange, why don't I just entrust porn or something? but wow there is a bad acting that is fun, i guess and bad acting is just bad. robert englund is rather pathetic in this along with all the others. makes you appreciate more the horror video is not so linear that it is out there. . . blah most of which I wouldn't worry about doing. I should have watched uh hellraiser 3 if I wanted to see an 8 pack! I imagine that the old gay guys with 2 minutes in the video store will be the main tenants of this and should start a class suit!
