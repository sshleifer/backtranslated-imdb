You have to watch this movie! It's so ugly that it's actually great. <br /> <br /> You have your crazy but brave captain who, of course, has a relationship with his worn copilot. And of course the mid-air collision occurs when the captain's enemy and rivals along the run to have your former Vietnam veteran unable to handle the pressure of another collision in mid-air and a landing . Then you have your crazy old Air Army friend flying on the fighter and trying to do well, I can't tell you what he's trying to do. The plane keeps going up, up and good and then you have your greedy and immoral corporate engineer and then you have your cool Zebra Ice Station and then Lucky saves the villain from drowing so they can land the plane! IT DOES NOT END UP - IT ALWAYS GO ON AND ON! You have to watch this. It's great! ARE YOU KIDDING! IT HAS VISUALIZED IT EXCLUSIVELY ON COMMERCIAL TELEVISION AND HOW IT WAS NEVER INDICATED ON THE CABLE.
