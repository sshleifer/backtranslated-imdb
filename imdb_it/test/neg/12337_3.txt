A real disappointment, the novel is such a brilliant laughing stock that drives the journey into madness crazy, but this fact for a TV-style nonsense is turgid and painfully slow. Follow Mike Hammer. I find it hard to believe that no body has made an ingenious version of this book, Kubrick talks about it on the cover, he should have taken over the reins on this. Stacey Keach is too mushy like Lou Ford, and it has the same production values ​​as that of the TV series of the 70s, by Planet Of The Apes. I highly recommend going out and buying a bunch of Jim Thompson novels, but in reality The Grifters wasn't too bad, this is one of his, with Jon Cusak.
