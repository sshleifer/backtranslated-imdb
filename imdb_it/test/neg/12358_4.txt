I took this movie - under the title "What Lies Above" - ​​on the Lifetime movie network last night, and I just had to comment on it. Designed as an adventurous and adventurous yarn, it is so unintentionally funny (thanks in large part to the performance of a Marc Singer chew) that I thought I was watching a cross between "Cliffhanger" and "Home Alone" 5. "L heroine Nicole Eggert makes her subtle but stupid as the dirty male pursuers resemble the three marmittoni who succumb to her ridiculous and sudden booby traps (somehow she manages to devise a swinging ram with rope and a log in a few minutes, which she temporarily takes out one of the knuckleheads who want to kill her.) It's worth watching for a hearty laugh.
