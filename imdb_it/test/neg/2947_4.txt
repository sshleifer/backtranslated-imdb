This film reminds me of Harry Potter, not style but marketing strategy. There may be part 2, the third part ... until one day the life cycle of the product ends, obviously on condition that the part is commercially successful. so many things seem to be hidden and therefore the story seems completely incomplete. action design is boring. the set is ok but not good. perhaps Edison Chen would have been a great star one day. It looks really fascinating even on the big screen. The most impressive is still Anthony Wong. 4/10 <br /> <br />
