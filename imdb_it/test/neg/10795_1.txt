I saw both the MST3K version and the full version. I loved it. However, it wasn't so bad in a movie. Of course, sometimes he moved a little slow. I liked it. <br /> <br /> As for MST3K, they only made films for which they could get the rights. Not all the movies that they ripped apart where bad movies were, it was so easy to make fun of them. Take SoulTaker as an example. <br /> <br /> Characters of Joe Estevez and Robert Z'Dar where I was so inanimate and boringly silly I couldn't help but laugh. I couldn't take them seriously. But it has really created a unique feeling. <br /> <br /> Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script. A world better than 95% of garbage in theaters today. His role has been well interpreted. Not too shouted for not being masculine but right. She really likes the camera in this movie. I would have fooled her into that role, having prepared the script. <br /> <br /> However, this film deserves a little more credit than what is given. Please look at the uncut version if you see the MST3K. It deserves so much.
