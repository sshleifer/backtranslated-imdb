How to take the fantastic intellectual journey of Charles Darwin and turn it into a fun movie. His pivotal and fundamental ideas and their radical influence on Western thought and capitalist society are intact, except for two brief scenes, in one of which it is stated that he is "killing God"; pure demagogy to make the film exciting. And the rest of the film yields for this purpose: it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes with overabundant music to which one is forced to cry. Anyone who actually read "Origin of Species" would be vividly aware of the fact that there was no violation of God in any of Darwin's works; on the contrary, there was greater fear and respect, and a new revolutionary way of looking at things. A good film about Darwin could be educational, reflective and deeply stimulating, even in a religious sense - but this would contradict the intentions of this film's soap operas. This is a film that was designed to make people with forced compassion cry and then feel transformed even if unable to understand why; makes a quick use of Darwin's big name only as a marketing influence, as one drops a famous name at a party to create an impression. Sad that sets and costumes are so good: production values, with the exception of writing, were obviously high. Watch him if you want to cry, for the loss of intelligence in American literature.
