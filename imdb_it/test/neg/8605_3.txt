I watched this movie with a kind of dangerous charm, like a hedgehog trapped in headlights. There is no doubt that (even if you liked it) it is a bad movie, but the important question is why? He has a good cast; it's lively; he is ready to face sex with his head held high, with some of the characters making something out of it here and there, which is unusual for a British comedy. He also has Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook, Marmite artists agreed, but they have had their moments in the past. <br /> <br /> What is mainly missing is the charm. The characters are incredibly idiotic, unbelievable and alienating, so that instead of a Men Behaving Badly film the producers made Game On. Any mediocre writer who wanted to make a film about the sexual attitude of British dozy and sexist men could get some copies of Loaded, Zoo or even Viz to read Sid the Sexist and it would have been written by itself. Instead, the producers have clearly tried to invent characters that are morally difficult to cure. The comedy of the characters - as opposed to slapstick etc. - it works only if the public can recognize some human truth to the situation. But watching this movie is like being told an annoying joke that you know it won't end up being fun but you can't stop it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the film is also badly made. The structure of the plot is weak, there is little delineation or development of the character, and many scenes are not funny. From time to time the same reggae charlatan splinters to divide uselessly and grated scenes. There is a lot of unnecessary repetition - when you have made a joke about parking outside a sexual party you don't need to do it again. One wonders what the UK Council film saw in the script. <br /> <br /> This is a world in which most men make rake and most women are constantly committed to this. The apartment and Alfie have satirized the same vision of the world, but the producers of this film accept it without criticism. So they ended up with some sort of lower update of Confessions of a Window Cleaner. Does any British person need to have another go to this kind of thing, and do it properly ?? a good next project for Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright I think ...
