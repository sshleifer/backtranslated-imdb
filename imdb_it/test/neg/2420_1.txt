Terrible movie. Terrible acting, cheese, totally unrealistic, embarrassing for those who played the game. To begin with, that boy is not a prostitute, he would have been shot in two. As for "I score, that's my job", well no, it's not. For the uneducated American public it might seem like a good movie. For me, well, it's a few hours of my life that I'll never come back. I read the reviews and found one in which the boy seemed to know what he was talking about. Then I read - <br /> <br /> '' And while American rugby can never reach the level of talent that New Zealand or South Africa have, the third in the world doesn't even have anything to think about '' > <br /> All I can say is, LMFAO! <br /> <br /> Continue to play American football and baseball, leave the real sports to the big boys.
