What the hell was that? My family and I have only two hours to live for this piece of trash !!! There was no plot, no tension, just a lot of boredom !!! My kids could make better movies with our video camera. <br /> <br /> But maybe we didn't understand the meaning of the film ... oh wait, my mother did. It was the only one she liked for the following reason: "At least one movie without screeching machines ..." If you're looking for a war movie without fighting, it's still interesting and compelling and has a strong anti-war message, so you should look at "The Trench". <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3 out of 10 because it's good enough for an afternoon nap and because I'm too cute ...
