Although this must be the nadir of the sixth season, this episode of Schmaltzy is not badly written or recited. It's just that many of us have watched the X-Files for thesis-thrilling horror / thrillers that end up with no easy answers and move towards obscure but incomprehensible conspiracies. The sixth season gave us a series of ironic comedies that undermined the continuity of the show and, frankly, made the Simpsons' Halloween Specials like fantastic TV thrillers. <br /> <br /> In this episode Victoria Jackson of SNL's fame plays the smug girlfriend of a man who prepares himself as a producer of rainwater. However, his head of the meteorologist is the one who really loves her and Mulder ends up giving him advice to get out of the city. <br /> <br /> There is some playful fun with the chemistry between the agents and some fun but not too sophisticated characterization of the Midwest hick. There is nothing you would like to see more than once! <br /> <br /> It is difficult to understand Season 6. The creator of X-Files, Chris Carter, seems bored by the entire narrative arc of the "Syndicate" conspiracy and abandons responsibility for writers of black comedies.
