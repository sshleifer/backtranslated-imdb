Basically, this was obviously designed to be promotional material for the film produced by the same horrible director, which seems to be even worse than this documentary and absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen, so avoid it at all costs. > <br /> As for this documentary, it's fun; fun and blatantly misleading! Most "historical" movies are probably just that, historical footage of completely independent events that have been cut and pasted sadly in this documentary to make it more dramatic than it would otherwise have been. There is no doubt that Waverly is a rather interesting place with a lot of fascinating history, but the production of a documentary to market the local and related production is, for lack of better words, terribly useless. <br /> <br /> And yes, I've lived in Kentucky all my life, and I've visited the location numerous times. Waverly Hills deserves respect; and there is nothing respectful of this lame documentary.
