Yes, this film is obviously trying to be a Conan the barbarian, and what amazes me is that this is a sequel (did people ask for another?). The first part of the film is a flashback that shows the original. From what I've seen, it doesn't seem worth seeing (and apparently Ator always kills a huge puppet in his films). Well, now Ator lives at the ends of the earth with his silent brother Thong. A girl seeks her help as this bad guy has his father in his custody. Allow me to say that this bad boy is extremely patient as the old man constantly insults the peasant and continually agitates endlessly. The villain waits until the end of the film and finally slaps the old man, leaving you wondering "What took him so long to shoot?" Meanwhile, Ator and his partner and the girl go through an adventure after another. They fight cavemen, invisible soldiers (they don't ask), rent thugs and people who love snakes. Ator also fights a giant puppet in the shape of a snake and hang glider (again, don't ask). All the while you will think that Conan would have kicked Ator's ass.
