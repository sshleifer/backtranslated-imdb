This film is widely warned as a copy of Will Smith's version of Hitch. That movie was boring. <br /> <br /> This film is not as boring as it is unbearable. Govinda looks far beyond his first. It's not his best to play roles like this. Similarly it is not as convincing as his performance in Deewana Mastana. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan is in his aching "best". And this is in the few scenes where you remember wearing clothes. It could have been only through nepotism that the scenes of this eye candy could be saved from the cut-off basket of any movie. <br /> <br /> Another case of embarrassing Bollywood with its shameless cloning. Another case of the majority of the Bollywood public is embarrassing making this a success.
