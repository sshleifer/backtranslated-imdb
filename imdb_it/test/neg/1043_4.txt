Karen and her boyfriend Jerry move into their new apartment in Los Angeles. They discover an old brass bed that Karen likes, unfortunately it has a really sinister story involving vicious sexual murders. "Deathbed" tries to be a gruesome supernatural tale, but fails miserably. The action is slow, the acting is nothing special and there is no suspense whatsoever. Even the sex scenes are lame. The climax is rather gory and violent, so the splatter fans should be happy. However, the first now "Deathbed" is deadly boring and offers some customary horror film conventions and economic bravado. Definitely one to avoid. My vote: 4 out of 10 and this is generous. Look instead at "Re-Animator" or "Castle Freak".
