Anyone who has seen the smelly, smoky piece of poop called Congo understands my title. And I try for you. This film wasn't just bad. It was painful. The book was stupid, the script was even more stupid and the cast was terrible. Dylan Walsh? Rumor has it that Julia Roberts dumped your ass because this movie had a bad blow. Huge diamonds? Gorilla killer? Gorilla talking? Hmmm. It seems a success! OH! Tim Curry's accent is so bad in this film that I'd rather be deaf! I recommend this film to bulimics who want to cleanse after a heavy meal or Kavorkian patients who just need one more reason to die. If this is true to the book, I would say that it makes us have a good old fashion book that burns and destroys every copy. If future generations look back and find this garbage, how would we explain ourselves? Listen to the others who hated this movie! Don't watch it! Escape! DO NOT WATCH this movie! If you think it's full of action or suspense or interesting effects, YOU ARE WRONG! If you think it's more powerful than Nicole Ritchie, you'd be right. So, if you keep watching Crapo ...,. I mean the Congo, I say we do it after just taking 50 Tylenol PM.
