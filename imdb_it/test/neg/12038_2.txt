A couple from Chicago, Dillon and Dougherty, are falsely accused of killing their daughter. People start to wonder if they did. The police investigate and find suspicious evidence. The couple is slandered by the public and accused by the press. The policemen speculate that they are Satanists and have ritually killed their own daughter. They are accused and brought to trial. They are represented by lawyers looking for advertisements who give them bad advice and bill them for $ 100,000. The evidence presented against them is twisted or hidden by the police. Artificial protests of sexual abuse are presented. Their other son is taken away from them and put into a foster home. Dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to find her baby removed. Verdict, she didn't, but she did. Go to the beat with a sentence of 45 years. <br /> <br /> In the last third of the film, with Dillon in prison and Dougherty wondering what to do next, we see people who have been antagonistic now are slowly coming to the couple's defense. Witnesses admit they lied. Other facts are brought to light that, in the end, result in the publication of Dillon. The killer was never found, although the film gives us a complete whacko as a plausible killer. <br /> <br /> This is a bad start to the end. Nothing seems to fit the couple. Oh, there are some happy moments, maybe a party where everyone is happy to be together and tear themselves away from joy, or some test points in their favor are discovered and people hug each other. But it never takes long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news and all faces are frozen in tragic disbelief. (Usually there is a fade to block.) There is not necessarily nothing wrong with moving tragedies, although I can't imagine what pleasure we derive from seeing people suffer. There is also a lot of tragedy in Shakespeare. I suppose all we find interesting about tragic stories lies in the way they are told. "Oh, but I'm the fool of luck!" Romeo cries after killing Juliet's brother. Here we have Dougherty running in his tunic through a hospital corridor, screaming "Where's my baby ???" There is no ambiguity or irony in the story - I'm sure there must have been real life events on which it is based. People are good or bad here. Or they are bad, then they become good. <br /> <br /> The film is not aimed at exploring human eccentricity, or the way things work. It aims to wring tears from the public. Actors provide first-rate role models. I can't remember the last movie where I saw so many tears. There are streams of tears. Showers of them. Cascades of them. A true Niagara of them. In Lake Lacrymose of them. <br /> <br /> Well, I'll give an example of how efficiently the film is made. Dillon and Dougherty hire a Chicago policeman who works alongside as a private investigator (Ed Asner). Asner is in solidarity with them, but in reality he doesn't realize much. It seems to be in the film not because of its importance to the case, but because it can provide the victim couple with a kind of philosophy - "Learn to live with it", which is fine - and because it suffers from colorectal cancer, so we can see it take his medicine, double with pain, and eventually pass. <br /> <br /> What is frustrating about the film is that by concentrating so intensely on the suffering of the couple, it bypasses one of the most important questions it raises - the function of gossip in regulating private life. <br /> <br /> Gossip is a strange thing indeed. If we call it "gossip" it is bad, but if we call it "public opinion", it seems acceptable, at least. Obviously we all have beliefs about issues that may or may not be justified. (As I write this, Michael Jackson is again taken to court accused of molesting a boy, and I wonder how many of us are enthusiastic about the news and immediately thought he was a pedophile.) But even gossip is not bad at all. It's like water. When properly controlled it is a community resource. We need gossip to keep each other in line. It helps us maintain public order. But, like water in a flood or a tsunami, it is ruinous for a village when it is unleashed out of control. <br /> <br /> This is a film that is good if you are not looking too much in the way of intuition about human nature. It is done so intelligently that, given its goal, it is difficult to discuss it.
