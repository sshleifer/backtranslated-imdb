If you've seen this movie, then you'll know it's one of the worst Bollywood movies ever made. Bollywood is known for copying Hollywood movies. Who would know that they will copy Terminator 2. The difference between both film industries is that Hollywood spends millions and Bollywood spends 100,000 (Media). This is the problem with this film, if you want to create a T2 style movie, do it correctly. The director added a fake fantasy plot about a reincarnated snake that finds its lost girlfriend (in the previous birth) dead by 2 boys, but the fault is 10 people. Suddenly he reincarnates in a ghost and together they want to kill the 10 people who blame for his death. Not to mention the fact that the reincarnated serpent type or criminal has a kind of superpower. It can turn into anything, it can fly, disappear, power of fire, wind energy, you call it, he has it. He even gets the bazooker and survives the T1000 style. You are probably wondering how it survives. it's better not to ask, and do your best not to waste time and money on this film. His best came out only to forget this movie. I think it's a shame to use a big starcast for this outrageous movie with a senseless storyline.
