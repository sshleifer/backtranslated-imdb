I think you can't imagine how these people really work ... !! Before I came to the studios to watch the guys who worked there, I actually thought just like you. But since I've seen and done the work that the guys on that TV show have to do, I have to say that they really deserve respect for what they're doing all day. It is not really an easy job. And even the actors, who in your eyes could be terribly bad, are really fantastic people and many of them can really act! I don't think the material given to them can really prove it, since I think this material is not very good. But they are really good! So I don't think you can judge them before you saw these guys working there! And I shouldn't have judged them before meeting them, but I did it and now I'm terribly embarrassed. So please don't let yourself judge these good people unless you've seen them do the work there.
