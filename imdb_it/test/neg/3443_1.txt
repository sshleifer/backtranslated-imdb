I honestly don't know why this show lasted as long as it did. ah well, humor is subjective eh? but yes, this show is incredibly unpleasant if you ask me. Tim Allen is annoying. Jill is annoying. guys are annoying Al is annoying. the neighbor is boring is just more annoying then fun. the plots are all the same, Tim drives Jill crazy and has to put things right. and the last seasons? the less he said about them the better, who the hell things cancer would be good for a damn sitcom? yes, great idea collapses. so yes, home improvement is not a very good sitcom. I would advise you to go see News Radio or Seinfeld. if I were to rate this show, I would give it a 1/10 as it never made me laugh once. never. so yes, it's still better than The Nanny.
