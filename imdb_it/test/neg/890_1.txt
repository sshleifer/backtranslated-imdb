Watching this movie, you just have to ask: what were they thinking? There are so many remarkably negative parts of this movie, you might get the impression that it's intentionally poor, like some kind of joke. <br /> <br /> I think the worst part of the film is the direction. There are so many bad uses of camera angles and other cinematic elements in this film that are badly ridiculous. The funniest example of this would be when the party guests receive their e-mail invitations - The same camera angle is used for each shot (which lasts 2 seconds in an awkward way) and the same screen as the computer with the same desktop / window / program appears etc. It even seems like the thing is shot on the same set every time. The entire sequence was also completely silent, without music or sound effects. Overall, it was a poor way to convey the idea that an email was sent across the city. <br /> <br /> If you listen carefully, you may notice that the music sounds very similar to other movie soundtracks. No wonder - most of the songs, including the one that opens the film, are actually slight alterations to the scores of other films (see if you can guess which ones). Also, I noticed that the music is not played by a real orchestra. It seems to have been written and played through a low-end MIDI keyboard. If you are familiar with LucasArts' SCUM adventure games, the tone of each instrument sounds like something from the IMUSE engine. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is simply a trick. The acting is terrible. The script is derived (Ferris Beuller?). There is no joke in the film remotely, unless you see the whole movie as a big joke, played on a paying audience. Don't rent this. Don't even look at it when it is performed again on central comedy. Forget this: it's terrible.
