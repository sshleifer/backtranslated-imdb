Just Desserts was, I must say, one of the worst films I've ever seen. The acting was terrible and even the plot was ridiculous. I gave him a 3 out of 10 instead of a 1 because I enjoy laughing with atrociously insidious films. My expectations weren't high to begin with, but it turned out to be braver than I expected. I thought it wouldn't be so bad when it started, but as soon as the name of the competition - The Golden Whisk - arrived I started to change my mind. Everything went downhill from there. The only thing I liked about this movie, besides laughing for the absurd storyline and dialogue, was watching them cook. However, being a film about pastry chefs, there were minimal scenes in which they actually prepared something. I would recommend looking at the cooking channel instead of this movie. You can see more food in preparation and dodge the pathetic jokes. However, if you like trivial love stories, which is sometimes fun, go ahead and watch.
