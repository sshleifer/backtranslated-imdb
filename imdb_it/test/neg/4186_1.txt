My friends and I have often joked that the films are in real time. But this movie is really ... They will literally show a 4-minute strait nothing but a boy digging in the ground with his hands. It has no plot and an incredible amount of free screams. I honestly don't think he won a prize for his alleged suspense. If you're like me and you've seen the first movie and loved it for its horrible acting, for hilarious exaggerations and for a "budget" economy, it doesn't matter; this is so bad that bad memories could also erase and contaminate every good memory you have of the original. You'd be more amused if I stared at an empty screen.
