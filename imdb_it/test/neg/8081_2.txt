This is what this film is. Good God, the special effects suck in this movie. It's hard for anything to suck more than the plot of this film, but the special effects manage to do it. Let me try to explain how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> First, there is the plot. There are four dirty teenage bikers who go around in a forest in Duluth, MN. One of them is an idiot and feels a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg. A paramedic comes to help him, but runs aground with them when the helicopter breaks down. Then all five realize that there is a forest fire, which we see started by a guy who dumps tons of gas throughout the forest. All they show us are his boots, and they show scenes after scene of this pair of boots that go around unloading gas and lighting fires. Meanwhile, the boys try to escape the fire, only to discover that the man in search of boots somehow managed to overcome them (as they darted through the forest on a road bike!), He discharged gas throughout the area they were going through, and more fires began. He does it several times, and the paramedic finally takes it and ignites it. I won't ruin the ending, but the resilience of this guy will make you scream "WHAT IS THE INFLUENCE BLOCKING?!?!" on the screen However, they are now surrounded by fire and their only escape is through a mine filled with methane gas. Yes, natural gas. I won't even try to describe the ending, because it's too ridiculous and you'll like it better if you don't see it coming. Which you won't, because you can't expect what happens. This is because of the second big problem with this film: consistency. <br /> <br /> Is there any semblance of consistency too much to ask? Apparently so. I can't even count the number of limbs broken in this film (they keep breaking arms and legs while crashing their bikes). I think every character breaks at least one limb and many more than one. Then they limp until the scene ends, and then they forget they should have broken limbs. There is a scene where three of them who should have broken legs start dancing. But then their wounds suddenly return when the plot needs it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the CGI. If there is hell, it is to watch the fire in this film. All they have done for forest fires is to align the dirt roads with the CGI fire. You can clearly see that the only CGI fire is along the paths and that all the trees more than two meters from the path are not touched. And then they zoom out and show that the whole forest is engulfed in flames. It is difficult to put into words how ridiculous it is, but I assure you that the ridiculousness is quite impressive. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of those bad guys. There are some occasions when he falls into the painful category, but for the most part he remains above the line and is ridiculously inept. I can't wait to take a look at the other Nature Unleashed films that came in a four-pack with this one.
