Terrible acting, terrible script, totally unrealistic. The Bumblebee Flies Anyway exemplifies the clich√©s and sentimentality that film studios love to fill the throat of viewers. Elijah Wood is unimaginably evil in the lead role, and the plot points are invented and mushy. The Cook and Wood report is ridiculous at best. But the worst element of Bumblebee is the script. This is one of the most pessimistic dialogues I've ever had the misfortune to listen to. The bumblebees that crawled inside my ears and pinched my eardrums would be preferable to hear Elijah Wood spitting his pseudo-deep lines robotically. I would like a "Bumblebee Project" to be performed on me, so I could fortunately have no memory of this stinker.
