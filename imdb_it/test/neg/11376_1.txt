Comparing this film with anything from Almodovar is an insult to Almodovar. The best thing I can say is that he desperately tries to be like an Almodovar movie and fails miserably. The script is terrible, the characters are one-dimensional and the performances are the quality of the high school drama (except for Marcia Gay Harden, who is quite good, given the material he has to work with). Furthermore, cinematography does absolutely nothing to convey the extravagant beauty of Gaudi's architecture or the contagious charm of Barcelona. If you like the grit, the pathos and the dark and bizarre comedy of Almodovar films, you won't find any of them here. Spend your money on something other than this waste of celluloid.
