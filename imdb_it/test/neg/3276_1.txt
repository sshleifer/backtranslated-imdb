I saw this for sale - NEW - in my local store for $ 6 and I said "hey! An action movie with that guy from Bloodsport and Enter the Dragon, directed by the guy who brought in the dragon - and it's cheap! " So I bought it. Oops! This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some doozies. <br /> <br /> Do you know how movies that are intentionally campy, like Evil Dead II and Dead-Alive, are AMAZING? You know how movies should be serious but they turn out to be so horrible that you have to laugh them out loud and watch them again, like Lionheart (an old Van Damme movie) or John Carpenter's Vampires, are they really fantastic? This film, Ironheart, fails to be. I don't know what the directors thought, but it seems that this film was made without the time to shoot, without a budget for nothing and without a script to talk about. (While I'm in the script note, I should point out that Bolo Yeung has no LINES in this film - the only reason he is the first to write on the box is the fact that he is the only actor in the movie you ever recognize (unless you are a Jackie Chan fan, in which case you will recognize the villain - and you would like to call him Giancarlo!). <br /> <br /> Also, sad is that this film is from '92. , T2: the day of judgment had come out, so you know that the era of the 80s was over ... but not quite ... After that, you will think that Chuck Norris' 80s movies, high school comedies and Jason / Freddy's sequels were works of pure genius. <br /> <br /> Things to know: <br /> <br /> 1) No one in this film can act for beans. The closest thing you get is Richard Norton, who seems justly rich and arrogant, and Bolo Yeung seems appropriately petty and arrogant. Everything else is terrible. <br /> <br /> 2) The martial arts scenes can be forgotten - only many examples of white boys with many muscles taking off their shirts, shouting, running from Britton Lee, being kicked by Britton Lee, being caught punched by Britton Lee, only to fall. Even the final showdown against Bolo is disappointingly short, and as creative as the design of my racing socks (and equally smelly). <br /> <br /> 3) The rest of the action is also pathetic: the guns seem as if they came from the toys department of K-Mart, and in fact they shoot with the sound of a gun. When someone is hit, it bounces a little, then still lies with patches of brownish-red liquid on the clothes. Apparently, Britton Lee gets hit on one side, but you don't see her at all, then that day you see the wound ... I had worse paper cuts than that! <br /> <br /> 4) Obviously then the girl dresses the wound, then kisses, then the next thing you know I'm in bed talking after sex. Eh? What? The credible development of the love interest, as well as any kind of character development, are completely overlooked in this film. Remember how Bruce Lee's characters didn't need to have sex with anyone to be cool? <br /> <br /> 5) Car chase is by far the worst I've ever seen. It seems that the director was sitting on the curb with a hand-held camera while the two cars were entwined along the way, oh I don't know, about 30 miles an hour? Don't try it at home, guys, these people are professionals! Hah! <br /> <br /> 6) Very bad writing. Here's a scene for you: Lee is followed, so the girl follows the followers to "warn" Lee, but her car is too slow. So when he arrives, Lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and there's a gunfight going on. Lee killed two villains, but the third is to shoot Lee when the girl has almost finished Lee, so the villain escapes. (Eh?) Then the girl's car crashes and she can't start it. He tells Lee to be involved now and that he comes with him. He points out that they can't leave the car there because the bad guys will track it down. She somehow convinces him that he should decide how to deal with this problem - so shoot the gas tank and blow up his car. (And remember, later that night they have sex.) Huh?!? <br /> <br /> 7) If you look closely, in more than half of the shots in nightclubs, the dancers are very out of sync with the music. Even the dancers are too coordinated with each other (apparently in the 80s all the people in dance clubs took dance lessons). There's a girl in the DJ booth with a microphone, but she never does anything but dance. Bouncers tell people that they are fighting to "take him out" - without moving their lips. In one scene, the only Lee and Stevo bouncers who pass are just inside the entrance, but with their backs! Also, apparently, if you are an important character in the film, you can go straight to the head. <br /> <br /> 8) Lee notices the first time he is followed, but he does not. We notice the second time - even though he is the same guy in the same car. The girl, however, notes. The bad guys are followed twice, but they don't notice. <br /> <br /> 9) Lee is worried that the bad guys can track down the girl's car, even though they have already seen him show up where he works twice. The girl continues to leave her son at work, in the care of a friend, while she does not like having sex with Lee. DO NOT learn parents from this movie! <br /> <br /> I can't think of other flaws right now ... you have the idea ... Ironheart is so bad, it's not even funny, it's SAD.
