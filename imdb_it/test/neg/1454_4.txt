Before achieving international success with The Silence of the Lambs, director Jonathan Demme made his bones by doing extravagant comedies. This was one of them and, like many American Oscar-winning comedies, I could mention, has an excellent concept, is well structured, has great performances, a complicated love story. but it's simply not very funny. Pfeiffer is a widow who moves to the backwaters of the city after her husband (Baldwin) was murdered. The crime boss who killed him (Stockwell) mocks Pfeiffer, his wife (Reuhl) is furious and to complicate matters Pfeiffer also falls in love with the cop who is following her. All this should have been a laugh at the minute. Pfeiffer, with a heavy wig, is excellent as the widow, as is the hyperactive Ruehl and Modine is also good as the cop. But the script is simply lacking in jokes, humor, humor or setbacks of the verbal or physical type required by this type of film. The result is that it brings up smiles at best rather than laughter. It exudes charm, but is boringly short on humor.
