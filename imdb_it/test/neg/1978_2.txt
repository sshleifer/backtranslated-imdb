Beautiful images and many fights are not a good film. And that's exactly what happened here. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me admit, I still have to play FFVII (I'm going to order it soon). However, I did research to familiarize myself with the characters and the story. However, not everyone has the luxury of time to look for things like this, and Advent Children requires that knowledge of FFVII is required. <br /> <br /> Despite incredible images, I can't say it's too new. We saw it in Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within and, apart from some better movement, I can't say I did a lot of super-bold things with this. <br /> <br /> Combat scenes - well, they're a little fun. Yet how could we ever doubt the outcome of any of them. This was boringly classic - there were three fights with the bad guys, following the standard procedure (the hero, Cloud, is destroyed, then he almost arrives there and is destroyed, and finally wins). The reason I said it was boringly classic was that it was used a lot, but in this case it is badly executed. I'll touch it later. <br /> <br /> The English dub seemed okay, even though I didn't look at it in Japanese, so I won't judge Japanese dub, but English only. I will say this: I have heard many better ones, even in my limited repertoire. <br /> <br /> And now, the plot. Ummm ... what plot? Let me be honest, this film is nothing but a fan service, a chance to see the FFVII characters on the big screen with delicious special effects. As I said before, the fights seem to simply happen for no reason. The opening fight is never explained, Kadaj seems to have neither the ambition to destroy the world itself nor any real motivation to do something bad. Cloud sits around moping for the entire movie, and pretty much everyone else gets a mandatory cameo. <br /> <br /> Really, FFVII was an overall piece. Advent Children is anything but. If they had managed to give everyone a significant role in history (Star Trek: the first contact showed that it was possible, I might add), then it could have been much better. Of course, this would also change the plot, which, honestly, is almost set to be better than what we got. <br /> <br /> Even the characters were generally unused or practically forgotten. Avalanche members (the group Cloud worked with in FFVII, for those who don't know) get 2 scenes (3 in the case of Vincent Valentine, and others even less). Damn, the bad guys get more lines than these guys, and that's pretty bad. <br /> <br /> The music ... well, I don't care if Nobuo Uematsu is God Himself, he ruined this time movie. Advent One Winged Angel was the only decent piece. Otherwise, he couldn't decide whether to be epic (and orchestral) or fun (with an electric guitar). When he passed from one to the other, you felt as if he had taken a hammer in your head. <br /> <br /> And the last point about whether this movie was epic or funny ... tried to be both and fail miserably. Honestly, you can't please everyone and do everything. The film also tried to be profound (you can become epic and profound, or amusing and profound, but all three are too many), but also failed here. The last scene, reminiscent of a baptismal ceremony, was thrown there for what seems to be the taste of it. You don't need to be a Christian to shake your head and cry there. That scene did not belong to the film (nor did Aerith's frequent appearances - she died, Jim!). <br /> <br /> Given how fantastic Final Fantasy VII was, this film is nothing but a huge disappointment. Because of the beautiful images, I give them a 2 out of 10.
