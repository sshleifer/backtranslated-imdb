A nice anecdote about one of the comments above: In was in Mumbai about two weeks before the release of this film, I approached (being white) to duplicate some lines of this film in a recording studio. <br /> <br /> Even if I speak German, I was kindly asked to do all the dubbing scenes in English, otherwise it would be too confusing for the Indian public ... So, therefore, all the Germans in this film speak actually english! funny enough I made more characters, so if you really want to ruin some time watching the movie again, listen carefully; <br /> <br /> all non-Indian characters are made up of 4 voices only! . . . .
