It is difficult to ruin this story. GREAT book / GOOD film version of Fred Zinneman, yet this film is TRUE! The casting was terrible before. Richard Gere should have played the same Jackal as Edward Fox was a similar type of cipher and they didn't need to confuse the original script by adding a useless (expensive) fluff. This film reminded me of so many Bruce Willis films, since you see huge expenses with NO movies to show for it. (It's his "conspiracy theory") It takes real to make a movie so bad from such a beautiful original script. EVERY person from Michael Caton Jones should be banned from making films for 10 years; such is the insult that this film is for real directors. If Hollywood had been tried for having no idea what they were doing, this movie would have been the Exhibit A. Shame on you ALL!
