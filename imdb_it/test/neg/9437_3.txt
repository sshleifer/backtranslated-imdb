This must be considered one of the most exquisite television shows in a long time. <br /> <br /> Jose Ferrer played the title character, Nemo. He played the part of justice and certainly looked the part. But nowadays, it strikes me that the Nemo that was invented to be more of a resemblance to Captain Bird's Eye, from television commercials. Or maybe it's the opposite. <br /> <br /> His nemesis, Professor Cunningham, was brilliantly surpassed by Burgess Meredith. He never managed to overcome his days as a "Penguin" from Batman. Although he does not make his penguin "charlatan" here, he is not parallel like the manic professor. Only John Colicos, of the fame of Battlestar Galactica, has improved the scenery as a manic despot. <br /> <br /> I never remember the resentment between Nemo and Cunningham, but it must have been severe, since Prof. I never missed the chance to try to blow up Nemo, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> The effects were nothing special, although Prof. Cunningham's submarine was much nicer than Nemo's. He also had a crew of strange fish-like amphibians that served Cunningham and made his every order. <br /> <br /> However, the most memorable aspect of the whole show was Prof. Cunningham's secret weapon. The Delta Beam! He always said "Fire Delta Beam!", To which a fish fisherman would have horribly canceled the movement of firing with a shrug. Really priceless! They don't make them that way anymore, and maybe just as well. But like other series of this era, for those who remember it, it will always have an affectionate place, if covered with cheddar cheese, in our hearts.
