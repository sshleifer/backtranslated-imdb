Four Guys (Jacks) enters the restaurant business with a fifth boy and loses all common sense. They let the textile workers abuse themselves at the beginning of the century without simply leaving the situation. This is truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I just hope I can sell this item back to someone who might like it. <br /> <br /> It is true that it holds your attention if you can let the illogical plot developments not bother you too much. It is very foolish anyway, especially once a stranger enters the restaurant. Who is he? Guess. <br /> <br />
