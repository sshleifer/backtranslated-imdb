Spiderman was one of the first comics to initiate a change in the genre: despite being a very well done superhero, this is the first ever series that added a real psychological depth to the main character, he had a complex moral problem, round characters also highlighted social and political problems. in other words: Spiderman was the adult age of the comic. This TV series lacks all these components. It's just a series of good successes / bad TV shows that suffer from obvious budget rersraints that make the action scene moderately exciting. The Spiderman nylon webbing is as convincing as the cardboard rocks in Star Trek. Nicholas Hammond is too old for the role at the time. I think he was about thirty, when Spider was really a teenager at the time. For some unfathomable reason the writers have also changed the names and deleted important characters from the comic, who again caused the tension between the characters practically disappearing.
