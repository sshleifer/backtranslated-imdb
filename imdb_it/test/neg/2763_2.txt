If this film is an accurate exposition of the acting abilities of J. Smits, I think he made a big mistake leaving the television. Have you not seen any film "played" by David Caruso, in particular "Cold Around the Heart"? Along the lines of acting ability, regarding Mary-Louise, she did much, much better. Yes, it is a terrible script, modified in a new way and totally without continuity, but experienced actors can overcome and overcome similar obstacles. A big disappointment.
