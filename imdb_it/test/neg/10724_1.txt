What a terrible infamy. Not just the title, but the idea is the same as Jane Fonda, a vehicle of George Segal from a few decades ago. Why? I wonder, someone with the influence of Jim Carrey, not just a star, but he will also produce this tired, ugly, useless excuse for a play. He could have taken the play to a whole new level, instead, he chose what he can take as safe territory. Money, money, cash, Christmas. But I'm sure this uncomfortable casino will have very short legs. I call it uncomfortable because that's how I felt. Aware of the desperate attempts tried on the screen to be fun. And failing miserably. It could have been an outrageous, politically incorrect, specular post-Enron days comedy, but no, it would be too high, too risky. What a pity!
