I let a friend call me to watch this movie, and all I can say is - I want to kill that friend. <br /> <br /> That is an hour and a half of my life that I will never return I will regret it forever. <br /> <br /> If you too have had the misfortune of seeing this film, you will agree with me that this is absolutely the worst movie ever made, EVER! <br /> <br /> If you've never seen this movie and are thinking of seeing it - let me save you a waste of time and I warn you: DON'T WATCH THIS FILM, JUICES !!!! <br /> <br /> Everything in this film fails, the attempt at comedy and sensuality - it simply turns out to be stupid, scruffy and disgusting. Try to have women in the film that are actually attractive and sexy and not fat, ugly and gross to watch !! <br /> <br /> Acting is as ridiculous as writing is. Obviously, this was done by a total amateur, I can't believe that these people were allowed to make such a stupid movie, isn't there a law against this? There should be. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of good "b" movies if you like this kind of thing, but don't waste your time on this lousy movie that you want to be. <br /> <br /> PEACE
