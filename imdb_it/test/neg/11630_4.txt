Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment ... and a fair game with him. I always liked his image and his ability to act in a way like Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you mean with Rourke - bad, moody, dirty. But this movie gives you so much more - and you don't want most of it. <br /> <br /> First of all - all this makes no sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who, after killing a schoolboy driver, escapes from Ireland to London. He is on the run from the police and his own army comrades. He also promised never to kill again. Looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him. <br /> <br /> However, when he arrives in London he is tracked down by a local gangster (Bates - it looks like his eyebrows and hair come directly from a Burton's dummy) to kill his main competitor for Â£ 50,000 in turn and a boat trip in the United States. Rourke reluctantly agrees to do so, but is seen by a priest (Hoskins) and confesses the crime to him in the confessional to keep the priest's mouth closed. He understands that it's better than killing him. <br /> <br /> There are many things that do not add up here: <br /> <br /> 1. Why choose Rourke for your competition? As illustrated by a scene in which an employee is nailed to a wall by a pair of guards with what looks like a tuft - these London guys are still tough enough to make their own murder. <br /> <br /> 2. Not only that, but the Mobster makes a boy follow Rourke and witness the murder with his own eyes. Why didn't that guy just kill the competitor and spare all the hassles of dealing with Rourke? <br /> <br /> 3. Hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go - without protection, can I add - to confess? Absolutely not. <br /> <br /> 4. Rourke hangs around the church (right next to where he committed the murder) immediately after the crime to go to confession. Why don't the cops check the place? <br /> <br /> 5. Rourke hangs from the church and Hoskin's blind niece in particular, for days afterwards without anyone bothering him. What? Is he on the run and gets stuck right where he committed another murder? Stupid. <br /> <br /> 6. The policemen actually meet Rourke in the church that "fixes" the organ and have no idea who he is. Don't they know he's on the run for the school bus attack? Don't they even check it? <br /> <br /> 7. Why bring Rourke to kill for you, and then tell him to wait a few days to get on the boat? You would think you would get rid of him immediately. Or kill him. One or the other? <br /> <br /> 8. Why does Bates's brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece amid all the waiting? Couldn't he stay for a few days? At least until Rourke was safely transferred to the United States? Ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 9. Rourke suddenly has an inner turmoil after all his years of murder and immediately wins the blind niece - even after learning that he is a murderer, she still loves him? Again - absolutely ridiculous. And then - she falls in "love" with him in record time - a few days !!!! <br /> <br /> 10. The whole bomb business at the end is simply silly from Bates' point of view. <br /> <br /> 11. Things happen in some parts of this movie that simply don't make sense or are just there to help the plot (and I say this as a joke). The houses of Bates Rourke in a brothel until the boat is ready to sail and Rourke suddenly shows a moral ground to respect the whore in the house - but still she will make a blind girl. <br /> <br /> 12. Rourke asks a henchman on the boat where Bates is - and the henchman shoots practically all his head's movements in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the boy was telling Rourke much more than he had asked. <br /> <br /> 13. Hoskin's priest is a former soldier and we see him beat three followers behind a pub. Absolutely unpretentious and for the umpteenth worthy scene. <br /> <br /> I will stop there at the unlucky 13 without mentioning Rourke's hair (so falsely red is ridiculous), his accent (which to be honest is not too bad at times, but deteriorates in a mumble to barely heard at other times), his clothes, he walks, he looks at the skies etc. Nor will I mention the choppy music and editing style. <br /> <br /> Oooppps - I just mentioned them. <br /> <br /> Overall - a disaster of a movie with some obvious religious images thrown in (Rourke on the cross, preaching from a pulpit) that would embarrass a first-year student of cinema no matter a top star and movie director. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
