Consider "I Know All" Action hero is lighting a cigarette in the dark. While trying to hide / search for the bad guys. (Probably to give a light signal to say I'm coming) <br /> <br /> This is one of the 100 scenes you can laugh about. (I think the film should be in the Comedy category.) <br /> <br /> Directed terrible, horrible script, bad acting, economic special effects. (They used a tunnel so they could hide in the dark) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (which also makes me laugh by looking at those pathetic mistakes)
