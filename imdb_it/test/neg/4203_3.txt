I bought this Chuck Norris DVD knowing it was one of his first films, and shows. We all know that he will never win an Oscar for his acting, but he is not the one for whom we observe him. Although there have been some earthquakes in California since this film was shot, there has never been any desert or hill between Hwy.99 and I 5. Billy should have crossed from 99 to 5 along 120, a distance less than 15 miles. I would like writers, producers and directors of these films to at least look at a map. As a truck driver who spends a lot of time in California, I realized from the beginning that the geography was wrong. However, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. So take your Doritos and an adult drink and enjoy a trip back in time.
