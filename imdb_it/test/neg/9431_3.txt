"Shadows and Fog" is certainly one of the weakest films of Woody Allen, right there with "September" and "Hollywood Ending" (although Allen did nothing he equaled the horror of "Anything Else"). <br /> <br /> "Shadows and fog" is Allen's homage to the German expressionist style of cinema, to all the dark and stylized lights and shadows and ... you guessed it ... a lot of fog. But you can say that Allen got involved in technique and parody and forgot to make a film that someone would be interested in. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, he did "Husbands and Wives" the same year, so things didn't go a total wash for him. <br /> <br /> Vote: D
