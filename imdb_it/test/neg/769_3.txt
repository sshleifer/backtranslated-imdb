Dumb is right: Tom and Jerry reach the goal of a non-stop flight in Africa, but then worry about mingling with the natives. They put "blackface", they crash the plane, they try to survive on a wing of an airplane that floats in the ocean, and then they survive the wild animals once they arrive on earth <br /> <br /> Reading some reviews before seeing this, I knew what to expect. It was simply these two guys who made their impressions with Amos and Andy / Stepin 'Fetchit. Offensive to blacks? Sure, but it's the 30s for you. Some of their jokes were funny, others were stupid. The main mistake I had with this cartoon was audio, because it was often not easy to understand what these two guys were saying. <br /> <br /> In all, a piece of curiosity, but don't let racism stop by check-out. At least it gives you an idea of ​​how times have changed .... for the better.
