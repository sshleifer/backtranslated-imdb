This is so serious that I don't know where to start. <br /> <br /> The main role is a good starting point. He is a supreme character of Mary Sue who has few things in common with the original one of the book, which was (somewhat) more credible. No, this is invincible, infallible, untamed and insipid even beyond the excessively strict standards that this "swords puffin" was the one our media is spinning out late. She is a twenty-three top model, skinny as a match but rich, already a leader in her academic field, a kung-fu master, a natural sniper and seems to have enough authority to naturally defeat official officers like FBI agents. She is God. <br /> <br /> To balance, she should be socially embarrassing (due to her typically harsh upbringing that turned her into a "Spock") that gives us happy moments where she asks what is "Star Wars", or "American Idol", but when it's really important it can conveniently prove to be a top negotiator and diplomat, because it's so superior, you know. Finally, it is played by a wooden actress. <br /> <br /> The most talented Boreanaz serves as a faire-valoir pawn for this construct, acting as a smoky remedy and home "Watson". In fact, all that is inside is a pop parody of better works like Sherlock Holmes, CSI and X-Files, from which he tries to emulate the sexual tension between the main protagonists. It's cheaper anyway, since it is delivered with all the subtlety of an elbow shot in the ribs, but a million poor factory girls will no doubt buy you, so the crazy assessment this turkey gets. <br /> <br /> In fact, the lowest common denominator has a long tradition in this sad puppy, which leads to titillating the sexual details of the legion of helpers who aim to transmit it as bold and trendy, while the general tone of the show brings an obvious neo-conservative view on things. <br /> <br /> In terms of history, there is not much to offer, because the crimes (which always start with some macabre remains) are solved using non-existent technology while the "eyes", lovable but so wrong ( women less than boys) continues on various theories, all as futile as the main character has everything from the beginning, and once established he goes out and then beats the boy, usually a real tough hombre with a spin kick here and a slapper there. The end.
