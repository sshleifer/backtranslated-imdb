"The best movie of the 90s" "The Welsh Trainspotting" .... Yes, right! I went to this movie with pretty high expectations, and it was all downhill from there. <br /> <br /> This film was to be this archetypal film about the drug culture of the early 1990s, and it would allow us all to see within this scene, and shatter the media's preconceptions by following the moral panic that followed the death of Leah Betts in 1995. Unfortunately it is not very far. <br /> <br /> Where Trainspotting was able to treat you as an adult on the subject, and the potential problems surrounding the drug, this just gave us a schmaltzy story of the wonder of the drug, and how can you, you you know, like you open your mind completely. Make a few jokes about Bill Hicks, and Howard scores to the point of nausea. Sometimes it's painful. I mean, the scene between Lulu and her aunt eventually made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Now maybe I'm just a cynic, but the way Jip guides us through this story is like listening to THAT An acid, tormented boy whom you once met at a house party, who talks to you about how "man" holds us back and how Acid freed him from the tensions of modern society. You just want to make sense of him and ask him to leave the premises. <br /> <br /> The script was a real problem for me, because where Trainspotting had Irvine Welsh's excellent book to mention, this is written and directed by Justin Kerrigan. The words "Jack of all trades, master of none" come to mind. You can see where his inspiration comes from, especially in the narrative style of the main character Jip (who defines the main character in a social situation in which he speaks directly to the camera, and outlines what goes on in his head as the scenario develops ) The problem with this is that some of the camera talk is just painful to watch. Mainly this is due to a lack of empathy for Jip, but they are so desperate to seem philosophical that they end up looking like your average level A drama project. The direction is good, and the intentions are good, but it is so devoid of any integrity that you start to wonder about what the hype is. <br /> <br /> That said, it's not bad at all. There are moments that are really very funny and fun. Moff is the film's highlight for me. For an independent film, he also managed to attract a high number of quality British actors / actresses, who perhaps delineate why there was such a buzz in the film. <br /> <br /> Best movie of the 90s? Not for a long shot, but if you're looking for a solid Sunday night movie, then this could be your bag. Inevitably, however, the film is marred by the clamor that surrounds it.
