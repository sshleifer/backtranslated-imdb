Six stars for the portrait of General Groves by Paul Newman, four negatives for the inclusion of a highly fictionalized event in which the truth is well documented. Michael Merriman didn't really exist. His character - or at least his destiny - is based on that of Louis Slotin, a Canadian physicist who did not come to Los Alamos until after the war. He conducted his lethal dragon tail experiment in May 1946. This is a critical point. The effects of strong radiation on the human body were not known until they were observed in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosion victims. If someone died of radiation poisoning at Los Alamos before the Trinity test, it is very likely that the scientists would have abruptly stopped their work and the story would have been changed. If for the better or the worse we can only speculate. Someone should ask the producers and the director if they added the Merriman character for dramatic effect or to deliver an anti-nuclear message. For a more accurate and impartial treatment of events at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project, watch the TV movie "Day One" or, better yet, read the book by Peter Wyden on which it is based.
