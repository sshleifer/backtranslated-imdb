Like his almost contemporaries "The Great Race" and "Those magnificent men in their flying machines", I always associate this film with my childhood especially on New Year's. On New Year's Day we visited my grandmother and after lunch, while the adults were talking, the children watched TV where one of these three crazy movies would invariably be. <br /> <br /> For this reason alone, I really wanted to mark "Monte Carlo or Busto", but I'm afraid I can't do it, the child is not the father of that man on this occasion. By this I mean that I can see his faults all too clearly and while I was tempted to smile occasionally, in reality I really wanted all the competitors to arrive at the end of the race long before they actually did. <br /> <br /> Naturally it is dated by its stereotype of nationality and woman as the weakest sex and I too did not care much about one or two vague vulgarities, admittedly bland that occasionally emerged. More than that, however, the cast, despite the outrageously fine, does not sell the film enough. Tony Curtis, in a test run for his "Yank Abroad" turn in the TV series "The Persuaders", seems too old to play the young gallant, Terry Thomas is not vile enough, Eric Sykes is incredible as a dirty-minded Lothario while Gert Frobe is an exaggerated Teuton, it is simply strange to play comedy when you remember that he was the best villain in Bond, Goldfinger. If nothing else the English come out better - Susan Hampshire is at least as engaging as a "bright young girl", suitably gamine as a posh flah and even though chained to the lead of the script Pete and Dud offer the funniest type of army with stiff upper lip even if the "Carry On" team did this much better in "Carry On Up The Khyber Pass". <br /> <br /> The director Annakin tries to evoke the "Golden Silent", with slapstick lashes, incorrect identity hoods, accelerated shooting, aspiring dramatic stunts and a little light romanticism, but there is no light it's real tension for such a famous race and in any case the end of the race looks like another swizz. <br /> <br /> Actually I would have given another sign if they had joined the alternative title "Those magnificent men in their Jaunty Jalopies" but in reality the animated series "Wacky Races" did this much better.
