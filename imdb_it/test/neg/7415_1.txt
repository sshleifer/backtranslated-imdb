I think this is one of my best ten worst movies I've ever seen! There is a fade every two minutes. If this were on TV, they would have a preview every 2-3 minutes. But there is a visa that I appreciated personally: that is when the blonde goes to bathe in a pit of boiling water with a man who looks and for about 10 seconds you see her whole body without a towel! This was the best scene of the whole film because you see that Sasquatch has the protagonists, but in the last 10 minutes we see his whole body. Furthermore, most of the deaths are off screen and only the scream or the roar. And I expected the Sasquatch to die. But he did not shoot him and only 4 or 5 people die throughout the film expecting 8-10 people to die. Don't watch this movie. I give him an F-. Do not waste time.
