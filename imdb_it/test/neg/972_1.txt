There comes a time in the career of all the great names of the actors when they become sloppy and accept projects that they would never have touched with a 1000 foot pole in their golden days. Remember "Taxi Driver"? That was a good movie. I can't believe that De Niro from "Showtime" is the same actor. <br /> <br /> I'd rather watch "Time Chasers" twice than watch this movie again. If someone offers you to take you to see "Showtime" or offers you free passes, or anything else, run as fast and as far as you can.
