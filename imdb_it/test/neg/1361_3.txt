This film states through its protagonist that the world is essentially sadness and pain and those who ignore this have blinders. We can discuss whether this is true or not. But even if one accepts it as true, the end of film A) disputes this by saying that there can be something good in tragic situations or B) forgets it and uses a clich√© montage to let the audience feel relieved. <br /> <br /> That the film metaphorically absolves its protagonist by presenting it as a sympathetic character despite any evidence of that sympathy showing contempt for the supporting characters who were the most compelling characters in the film. <br /> <br /> So what are you? having in this film is a script that is not consistent in its theme and in the direction that does not bring the ending in sync with the rest of the film. There are excellent performances given by all the cast members in particular Spacey, Olin, Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson. It is a pity that they were not supported by a better writer / director.
