It looks like Guy Pearce and acts like a Calvin Klein underwear model, or one of those kid boys who wear Levi Jeans and stand in front of a bunch of hungry buffalo because they realize that Buffalo is like Levi's. In every scene, Guy Pearce seems to be saying "Look at me, I'm so cute!" As a hero, his character is a total incompetent. In any scene that requires courage, Pearce gets the shorter part of the stick. SPOILERS: Yet, at the end of the film, this wimpy character with a bookworm escapes a bunch of Morlocks like baboons that can run and jump along the side of the wall (like Spider-Man). More or less in the same period, the TIME MACHINE seems to cause a sort of Nuclear Explosion that sweeps away an entire valley. Strangely, even though Pearce and his gal-man Mumba are about a foot from the last Morlock he is killed; a few seconds after Pearce, Mumba and the tribe are watching the valley blow up from the safety of their mountain. Now THAT IS FAST RUN !!! Jeremy Irons as the king of the Morlocks is great. Really makes the movie a lot better than it used to be. Mumba, the actress model is not very pretty and does not play much in this film. The scenes that take place in 1900 lack a real atmosphere. Although the clothing and vehicles of the time are shown, the characters behave like caricatures of how they imagine the people of 1900 would walk and talk. The original version of this film was much better in this regard. The characters of the period were much more realistic, and they were much better actors. The original version of this film made the PAST look like the true basis of the characters. This new version lacks substance and feeling. The scenes in which Pearce faces Emma's death and then fails to save her from his fate are very good. The fact that the Morlocks are cannibals is not very well explained, and it makes no sense to have a large dark butcher shop full of knives and cutlery, but they have never been seen using weapons except a dart. Even the fool is the giant well full of water and bones. Throughout the subsoil, the Morlocks walk all chewing fleshy bones. So how can all those skeletons be in the pit? Seems there are some Morlocks that Bar-B-Que their humans and eat them off the grid, and other Morlocks just like frayed meats ?? And where are the toilets for all these creatures? As I was watching the dozens of Morlocks gorging themselves with human flesh, it occurred to me that they had to have a very advanced system of toilets and plumbing, considering they were throwing many bones. All these problems have never been addressed. At the end of the film, Pearce is holding Mumba's hand, but you can see that he is watching his friend, Mandingo. Another totally annoying thing about this film is the non-stop music of LION KING that is in the background. Once Pearce arrives in the future (802.710 a.d.); LION KING's music never stops, and whenever the natives are around, there is that African Moaning Singer (is Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?) who starts complaining and complaining about the jungle music of LION KING. I saw the credits at the end of the film, and the jungle music was not specifically identified, but I think Elton John should probably look into it. Time Machine was a mediocre film with a good FX. Watch it once, then forget it.
