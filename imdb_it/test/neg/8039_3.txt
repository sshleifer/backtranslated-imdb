The Great War breaks out and Dad is a brave pilot who goes to do bad business to put Jerry in his place. The mother is doing her part as a nurse, so the five children are evacuated from their uncle in the countryside, where a secret passage leads them to a sand fairy and a magical adventure. <br /> <br /> Based on a book written the best part of a century ago, they no longer make stories like this. And there is a reason. Men pilot aircraft and art books; women change bandages and clean houses. The boys lead the way with their compasses and their night permits; the girls do what they are told and play the violin - badly. The fat children who wear the specs are bad. All children speak with those sharp and flattened accents that are faded and primitive, but that a certain economic class of the British cultivate. In addition to the snobbery and lust of Imperial Albion, there are holes in the plot that a five-year-old child would not tolerate. I mean literally - my son was asking why his father disappeared before sunset, because the compass simply didn't fall out of his hand when he disappeared. The film tries at least to focus strictly on children, until a monologue completely inappropriate and little fun of Eddie Izzard (what a waste of authentic comic talent) plays on the credits. <br /> <br /> No doubt five percent of British students attending expensive public schools in the UK will find this a happy hiss. For the other 95 percent of British families who no longer live in the 19th century, the good news is Wall-E, Ratatouille and Wallace and Gromit are all on DVD.
