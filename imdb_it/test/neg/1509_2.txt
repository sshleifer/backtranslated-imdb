Truly absurd garbage. This film does all the evil except it does the running time in less than an hour. FX gore escapes gravity and logic. There are no fears. The acting is abysmal, with everyone seeming to read their lines. There is a surprise ending that is simply silly where we find out that the things we have seen happen have not even happened. Guys, I hate police finals! They cover this thing with long extended shots of people who don't do anything interesting (like putting on makeup or talking about what seems like forever). Do they have to fill up a film that lasts less than an hour? Ridiculous. The story itself is pretty fucking thin. I mean, it's just a variation of the movie APRIL FOOL'S DAY, if I remember that movie well, and even that movie wasn't great. The only good thing I can say is that it seems to have been shot well. Too bad that nothing very exciting happens.
