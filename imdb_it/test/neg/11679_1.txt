This film is supposed to cover three young idealists, two of whom join the Naxalite movement and blah blah. In reality it is just another film about some beautiful and rich people trying to decide who should go to bed after; the peasants, the Naxalites and the political struggles of the time serve only as a picturesque backdrop. Literally, not hearing the villagers say a word, no one's name matters, so they occupy the same "role" as the "natives" in old Hollywood movies. Even the film is boring, and the story really doesn't get us anywhere, except in various bedrooms. Apparently we should admire the beauty of all this, which simply means that there are no good songs and routine dances, which obviously would not have saved the film, but that would have at least alleviated boredom. <br /> <br /> My friend Japna was annoyed by the immorality of the whole story, not for the bedroom but for the futility of the story. The message seems to be that ideals are not worth pursuing.
