I would have little to add to the bowlofsoul23 bud comment here. But as the first Brazilian (born, raised and residing in Rio de Janeiro, in a neighborhood a few miles from the favela of Vigário Geral, depicted in the film) to comment on the US-funded "Favela Rising" here on IMDb, I feed mixed feelings: on the one hand, it is positive that the terrible situation of Brazilian favelas is gaining more attention from directors and the media, both from Brazil and from abroad, given that local governments seem to have surrendered long ago. On the other hand, it is incredibly frustrating that "Favela Rising" turned out to be a missed opportunity to enlighten the non-Brazilian public on the issue, because first-time directors Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary (who are American and understandably newcomers to the subject) ) transform the biography of the leader of the group of AfroReggae Anderson Sá into a glamorous canonization in this superficial, unilateral, little investigated and misleading documentary. Good intentions, confusing results. "Favela Rising" looks like a TV commercial, it's as superficial as a prime-time television interview, and distorted like a promotional video. <br /> <br /> "Favela Rising" seems unpleasantly fake for a Brazilian audience, and not only because of its hype visual treatment of a bleak reality, and its happy-misplaced happy ending. "City of God" is an obvious reference here, with actors from COG Leandro Firmino and Jonathan Haagensen coming out without apparent reason over "hype". "Favela Rising" is, presumably, a documentary on the AfroReggae group and its leader Anderson Sá, but beware: when you see the scenes shot in the favelas overlooking the beautiful Rio's coastline, you may also be warned that Vigário Geral (the home of AfroReggae and Anderson) located in an area of ​​Rio, away from ANY beach. Strange choice of locations, to say the least. <br /> <br /> "Favela Rising" is probably a source of confusion for non-Brazilians, who will not know many of the interviewees (and the film will not even tell them) and you will have to wait for the credits to find out that many of the songs of the soundtrack are NOT of the AfroReggae band (although you will be suspicious when you start to hear Pink Martini, of all people!). They will not know or that the important issues have simply been left unheeded: why does the film encourage people to believe that AfroReggae is a one-man project? Why not recognize the many partners that provide substantial financial and logistical support, such as the Rio City Council, private Brazilian companies, multinational registration companies and international NGOs, without which AfroReggae may not exist? Why not clearly state that Vigário Geral is still tormented by violent drug wars and that its inhabitants still live in constant fear of attacks by traffickers and policemen? Why not clearly state that many of the archive footage showing police violence and corruption did NOT take place in Vigário Geral? HOW AND WHY did the boy Richard Murilo finally join AfroReggae? WHY, for fear of the world, he was not interviewed again at the end of the film? <br /> <br /> As for Anderson, the film leaves a lot of conclusions for the viewer: what is the story of Anderson who has "two" mothers? Is the child holding his arms? Why is it inspired by Shiva? Is he a Buddhist? Why does a Candomblé woman appear on the beach when the film talks about Anderson's "miraculous" recovery from the accident? Is he a follower of Candomblé? Why not allow him to explain the contradiction of starting a group that fights drugs and at the same time praises Bob Marley? If AfroReggae is also a movement of pride building for the blacks from the favelas, why are the girls of the AfroReggae band limited to bounce routines? No, you will not get any answers to these questions. <br /> <br /> In contrast, filmmakers are interested in turning Anderson Sá into a composite mix of pop-stars, Malcolm X, Gandhi and Christ (take a look at that last image of the statue of Christ the Redeemer at the top to the hill of Corcovado, immediately after showing that Anderson "miraculously" walked after his surgery). And this is the WORST thing that the directors could do to Anderson and his cause: turn it into a special CHOICE (when they show their scar from surgery, you're ready to believe it's a sign of God). <br /> <br /> Because what is remarkable about Anderson - who is the most normal guy you can ever meet - is that he has helped change his environment NOT being "special" but copying and adapting winning projects ( like the Olodum movement in Bahia, among others) to its own community, with the strong support of friends, artists, intellectuals, politicians, businessmen and the media. If you do not speak Portuguese fluently, you will probably not notice that Anderson is not particularly brilliant or articulate (unlike his keen associate José Junior), although he is not particularly talented as a singer, lyricist or musician. Yet his "ordinariness" may have been the true "inspiring" core of the film: to show that ANYONE with idealism, perseverance and constant support can actually contribute significantly to his community, there is no need to be Jesus incarnate. Because what really matters is the movement - AfroReggae - not the boy, you see? Have we not had enough of the cult of personality? <br /> <br /> At the end of "Favela Rising", you probably won't know much more about Rio's favelas than you did when you entered - you have SEEN what some of them look like.
