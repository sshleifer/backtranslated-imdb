Absolutely inane films with Abbott and Costello. Even our small children would become more and more annoyed by this complete movie disaster. <br /> <br /> Abbott as Dinklepuss. What a look he had on his face. Of course, it had to be part of this terrible film. <br /> <br /> Did anyone notice that Costello's mother in the film played and looked like Fay Bainter? Fortunately, for Mrs. Bainter, who was not in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is really no emotion for children. The jokes, if any, are rather stale. Some of the songs are well done but the lyrics are ridiculous.
