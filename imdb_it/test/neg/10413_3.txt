Lonesome Jim is a bit like a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two boys are totally losers. Both boys around the age of 30 live at home, with absolutely nothing for them. I live in the Midwest and I can't name a family like this. I took it because I like Buscemi who recites humor. Now I understand that I need to have an antagonist for that humor to make it work. The acting and the work and the mounting of the camera were fine. The first 15 minutes made you settle in, and the last 15 minutes helped prevent the film from being totally depressing about Jerry Springer. The women of my family were begging me to turn it off, but I prevailed on the premise that there had to be a turning point towards the end, and we watched the whole movie. The male family members, as expected, simply left after the first 30 minutes.
