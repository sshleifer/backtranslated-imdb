After seeing this film, I couldn't help but notice the parallels between it and another film called America 3000. Both were terrible post apocalypse disasters of the 80s on celluloid. Obviously in both films there are fake sets, wooden acting and stupid monsters. About the only difference between the two is that the lead indolence here (played by Angelika Jager) has a strong accent. Avoid this unless you are looking at the MST3K version. Joel and the robots barely save this turkey.
