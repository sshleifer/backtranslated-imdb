Boring, ridiculous and stupid "Submerged" is a waste of time. The shootouts were a joke, real people don't just emerge into the open without any cover, hoping to be killed first! So many things wrong or bad, it's not worth listing, except for one of the main flaws. At 500 mph for 20 minutes = approximately 166 miles west of L.A. and the water is 100 feet deep ??? Again, none of the people would have survived decompression for being subjected to 100-foot water pressure for more than 20 hours when they were raised. Just a horrible one.
