With so many good films released in 1995 (in particular "Mortal Kombat" and "Seven"), unfortunately, there had to be some bombs too, and this film really falls into the latter category with a boring and predictable storyline and a bad end . It seems that Antonio Banderas could not find a decent script from "Desperado", the only remarkable film he made. Anyone with an eighth of a brain could tell who was the DeMornay stalker from the start. His flashbacks of his mother's death did nothing but confuse an already thin story. Too bad Dennis Miller was wasted on this movie; this part resembles its strangely similar role in "The Net". <br /> <br /> The twisted ending made me shake my head, as I did practically throughout the film. Also, any film that describes animal cruelty in any shape or form, no matter how fake it may seem, automatically takes my thumb down. <br /> <br /> Long story short, if you want to enjoy a good thriller, avoid this at all costs. Never talk to strangers ... especially those who recommend this movie. 2/10
