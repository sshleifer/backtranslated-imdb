This movie was really fun even though it didn't have to be! The acting was stupid, as were the voices. Practically all that happened was a boy who walked through a corn maze for an hour and a half. They threw in this stupid super-natural thing that made him even more stupid. It wasn't even like a normal movie, this strange, disturbing music played almost throughout the film. What happens with corn maze horror movies? The wheat kids were really scary and I thought it would be something like that, but in reality it was just stupid. The main character just went around screaming aimlessly for these two girls. And then in the end he likes to kill someone or something. It's worth seeing if you're with your friends because it's really funny how ugly it is, but if you're looking for a horror movie then don't waste time
