Having been pleasantly surprised by Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality, I decided to give Murder By Numbers a shot. Although decent in disgusting and shy roles, Ms. Bullock's performance in "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed ​​2, 28 Days) leaves a lot to be desired. His character is at the same time omniscient, confused and sexually maladjusted (the secondary plot of Sandra's past appears as a useless filler that does little to develop his already superficial character). The two boys have given decent performances, even if their experience in the field of forensic medicine and the ability to catch-me-can-can is denied by stupid errors that cry "We did it!" Chris Penn as the all-too-obvious suspect is wasted here, as is Ben Chaplin's token partner / love character. <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers Ahead *** Mediocre acting apart, the biggest flaws can be traced back to a TV-of-the-week plot that never totally gets you to buy the reasons for murder in the first place, and as mentioned, stupid errors (vomiting a rare food on the crime scene, a too convenient and framing of the school janitor, the two boys who spend together in public, a convenient love interest to cause friction , etc. etc.) make the view go from being intrigued to being bored and disappointed by the killers. The ending was strictly "By the Numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the film. Using the now stereotyped tactic of showing almost the climatic scene at the beginning of the film, and then filling the audience with how we arrived at that moment, the final scenes do not surprise anyone and lack the so-called information that the film supposedly to arrive at its conclusion. A somewhat promising concept, but poorly executed and weak in almost all ways. * outside ****.
