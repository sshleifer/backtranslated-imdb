This cheapo exploit film is something genuinely tasteless, courtesy of spaghetti director Lamberto Bava, who wisely left his name behind this stuff. <br /> <br /> The crux of this release concerns the discovery of some brutally mutilated individuals washed ashore in the Caribbean. The authorities initially believe that they are victims of shark attacks, but as the investigation is revealed, it turns out to be something much more sinister. <br /> <br /> All this ultimately amounts to very little, however, we have here - the difficult dubbing complimented by an equally weak screenplay, which often consists of a senseless cover-up, and is really of little importance to most . Acting can only be described as sub-par, which is the par for the course in this instance. Even the truly negligent management doesn't help things. <br /> <br /> The special effect is mainly due to the numerous close-ups of various bloody bodies that lack limbs and so on. Of course, there is the obligatory creature that emerges periodically during the meal, which resembles something of a monster octopus monster, where its animation consists only of sharp teeth that rise and fall in rhythmic articulation. Overall, the end result is not too convincing, of course, but he admits that it's almost funny in a kind of style. <br /> <br /> It seems that what the film producers were looking for was some sort of low-cost hybrid of Jaws and Piranha, but the final product is just a bloody mess, similar to the incessantly shown corpses in this picture. I find it difficult to think of any redeeming attributes to guarantee the vision of this, therefore, moreover, strictly for the addicts of incurable monster films.
