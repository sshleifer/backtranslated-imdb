Tom Cutler (Jackson) is a retired cop who now works as a Cleaner-upper crime scene. In his latest work, he cleans up a new crime scene and destroys the evidence and is unaware that the crime was not officially reported. Uh oh, this can't be good. <br /> <br /> You have heard of Detergents all the time, but usually when a mob or a group hit is involved when the bodies etc. they must be removed and the area cleaned. This is different as Tom Cutler works with the police to clean up after the police investigated a crime scene. Hey, someone has to do it. You know the police won't do it. The film makes it quite clear and it is up to the family to clean the area. <br /> <br /> This is almost a good thriller, but a secondary storyline involving Tom's daughter (Palmer) makes this story a bit awkward. I guess they had to fill up some time. Oh, they brought this side plot to connect with the other side plot, but it was still a reach and awkward. You see? <br /> <br /> This was almost a good thriller because there was a noticeable lack of tension, suspense and the pace was a bit negligible. The music didn't help, because I noticed that the music was more appropriate to watch people go on a long journey. You know, travel music. Take it? HAS! <br /> <br /> Everyone's acting was excellent in this almost a good thriller. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, Gender: No, Nudity: No, Language: No
