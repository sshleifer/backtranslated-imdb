It is a great pity that people are also able to make movies due to cheap digital video cameras nowadays. I would usually appreciate this possibility but if you see films like this it is just a big sin. and it's also a shame if people like h.p. Lovecraft is abused by such people. I rented this "movie" of the "h.p. lovecraft" drop on it. and I'm a big fan of many of his adaptations, mainly those made by Brian yuzna and Stuart Gordon. this movie has nothing to offer! an economic setting on a beach and in an ancient cellar. digi-cam effect "red light" on the whole film. no actors, just some stupid low-quality models who have no idea what they're doing, stiff as wood. and so must the director. It is obvious that he tried to create an atmosphere. but since everything is so ridiculous, it doesn't work. and no gore-effects, just a little blood in a river (you drink = you become a demon) and you fall here and there. oh yes, the story: thousands of years ago some "big old" colonized the world and brought humans as slaves. then humanity became independent, so the "old" tried to destroy them. and now there are some survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. the only way to save humanity is to find the NECRONOMICON, that's where LOVECRAFT comes from. so those soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beach and in their basement. Incredible - everything! but as they say (German title: "Armee des Jenseits) and you can find it in most commercial video-stores it seems that you can make money with things like that.
