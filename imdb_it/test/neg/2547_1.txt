What a terrible movie! It perfectly represents the state of degeneration of French society, where the most elementary respect for values ​​and healthy traditions has completely disappeared. The plot is meaningless, the film is not funny at all and the characters are completely superficial and uninteresting. To say the least, management and cinematography are very poor and uninspired. Catherine Deneuve is a bad actress as always, even when she was directed by Bunuel in Belle De Jour. The rest of the usually good cast (Vincent Lindon, Line Renaud, Jean Yanne) seems completely lost in an ocean of vulgarity, banality and restlessness. I can not do without a parallel with the wonderful "Le Divorce" by James Ivory, with his thoughtful representation of French and American costumes, his superlative cinematography and stellar cast put to good use. After seeing "Le Divorce" you can feel a kind of empathy with the French, regardless of their weaknesses. "Belle-Maman" leaves you with only a nauseated disdain for its morally bankrupt and clueless protagonists.
