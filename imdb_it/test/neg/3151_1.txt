Barney and Friends is probably the worst show for children I've ever seen. It teaches children nothing, the songs are trivial, not educational and the characters are simply agitated. I am not one who does not agree with those who hate the show. Honestly, I've seen more negative reviews than good for this show. 75% of the reviews are negative and there are some really mature people. This show does not contain any educational value or educational material suitable for age. Other reasons why I don't like this show are because of the loathsome plots, the poor dialogue, the horrendous special effects and the sad stories. Also, he says you should eat junk food if you're sad and strangers are your friends. To say that it is a "model of what preschool television should be", as expressed by researchers at Yale, Dorothy and Jerome Singer, is a pile of shit. They don't know what they're talking about. I would never recommend Barney to anyone. The reason why some children continue to cry or become addicted to garbage is because this show poisons the minds of children around the world. For people (parents / children) looking for the real preschool mother, switch to Nick Jr. and watch "Super Why!" instead. It is much better than this asshole and Five TV once had the courage to put it on "milkshake" but luckily he took it off. I highly recommend everyone to stay away from this show as much as possible. Parents, I strongly recommend that you keep your children as far away as possible from this show. They will thank you later. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Don't worry about wasting your precious time with this stupid show. It is absolute garbage. -10000000000000/10. Rating: Z. Avoid Like The Plague! <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading.
