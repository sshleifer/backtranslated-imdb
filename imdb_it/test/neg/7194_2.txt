Have you ever had one of those sneezes that seems to accumulate forever? You blow and you convulsions and take the nearest paper product in preparation for the biggest blower in the world ... and then it turns off. "Frankenhooker" was the cinematic equivalent of that lost sneeze. Now, I'm big with B-movies, and I always look the other way when a boom microphone appears on the screen or an actor talks about his jokes with all the enthusiasm of Gerald Ford, but this really disappointed me. The cover of the video, for example, is the tag-line of the entire film. Using parts of killed New York prostitutes, Dr. Franken rebuilds his late girlfriend, only to have her escape to Manhattan as a sort of super-protective with a bad attitude. After an hour and a half of accumulation, these ten rather amusing minutes seemed a bit anti-climatic.
