Eaten Alive follows a young woman (Janet Agren) who is looking for her lost sister. It turns out that his sister joined a sect that disappeared in the Borneo jungle. With the Vietnam veteran Mark by his side he goes in search of his sister. <br /> <br /> As usual, acting is not of the highest quality, but you get the Me Me Lai cannibal poster that spends most of your time on the screen with naked breasts, the female lead Janet Agren covered in golden paint and abused by a dildo immersed in snake blood among other things. Now he must count for something! <br /> <br /> But I have to say that I find it a bit difficult to recommend this title. If you are a fan of the genre, you will most likely recognize that every gore scene in the film bar is a restricted selection. And I mean literally. A lot of gore scenes are raised directly from other Cannibal films, such as MAN FROM DEEP RIVER and LAST CANNIBAL WORLD. There are probably more movies stuck in there. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is one of the most avid fans to check their list. If you haven't seen any films from the Italian jungle, you would be better off watching CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and if you are an avid fan, you've seen most of the gore scenes in other movies.
