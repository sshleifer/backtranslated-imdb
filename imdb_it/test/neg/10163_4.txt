John Wayne is without doubt one of the most popular and loved actors of all time. His career lasted for over forty years and at that time he starred in films such as "Angel and the Badman", "The Green Berets", "Sands of Iwo Jima", "Rio Bravo", "North to Alaska" and "The Undefeated". <br /> <br /> The film listed above is hailed as one of his best, unlike this 1934 effort "Randy Rides Alone", which was practically forgotten of the past, which is not surprising, because it is not nothing memorable except for its very short duration of only 53 minutes. <br /> <br /> A young John Wayne plays Randy Bowers, who for reasons never explained, arrives in a saloon in the middle of nowhere and finds that everyone inside has been killed. As he looks around, a team arrives and finds Randy there and they arrest him, accusing him of being a member of a gang and asking to know where the rest of his gang is. He is put in prison charged with the murders. Sally Rogers, whose uncle owned the sedan and was assassinated, arrives in prison to see Randy clarify that he was one of the gang members (he hid in a secret room when filming took place). Sally doesn't believe that Randy is a murderer and doesn't recognize him, so while the sheriff is out, he slips the keys and Randy runs away. While escaping from the sheriff and his gang, Randy conveniently stumbles into the gang's hiding place in a cave responsible for the murders. Randy aims to erase his name, and even bring the gang to justice. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rides Alone" can be a fun movie to watch, especially if you're a fan of John Wayne. But at the same time it has too many flaws that it is impossible to ignore. The film is also extremely dated, as one would expect; we have the terrible click of the camera that makes everyone look as if they were moving in super-fast motion, and the dialogue is terrible. Even the acting is not great, and the character of Wayne is very wooden and he, along with the rest of the cast, looks like wooden puppets that are led by someone (in this case it's from director Harry Fraser). Harry Fraser is at the helm and does a good job but the plot is very thin. You can't help but think that there are about ten minutes to go before the film starts, when Randy comes from the living room and is trying to meet someone. An explanation as to why Randy was there is giving later, which turns out to be something like he is an IT who was sent to investigate the claims that someone is trying to take over the city. To be honest, I didn't really get it, most of the time I was hoping the movie would end. <br /> <br /> But having said that, I did not find this film absolutely terrible. I had a little fun and found it to be pretty funny at times. But in reality it is not a great film, and it is not worth looking at or tracking down. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Randy Rides Alone" is incredibly dated and is a boring western with very few redeeming qualities. It can be fun, but overall it's not a great movie and it's definitely one of Wayne's weakest releases.
