Based on a rather bland "best seller", this film - like most other Lifetime movies - was more like a historical re-enactment than a real movie. The only difference was that Meredith Baxter was not there. Women in this do not age even for a period of about 20 years and acting in general is rather ugly. <br /> <br /> The characters in this were all clich√©s and one-dimensional. The story was of a poor nature. I wouldn't recommend it, but it's the kind of thing that people who loved the book and the people who watch that network all the time will think are great. I only saw it because my girlfriend wanted to see it, so she wouldn't have to read the book that her sister had lent her. It wasn't created for someone like me - my girlfriend cried a little at the end, so she didn't think it was as terrible as me.
