In the United States there was a time when everything was possible on the film, so the films came, the films that contain horror and explicit scenes. The best known are Forced Entry and Waterpower, but obviously those were made with a little budget. All shown at the 42nd in New York, but hello, there were other grinders out there that didn't show fancy budgets. Wet Wilderness is an example. The underground scene circulated after a while, so the copies were available but, as seen on other reviews, some copies were abruptly cut off at the end. But the version I looked at was complete. Well, I'd say this is more porn, then rough, there's a serial killer around but he likes it better to watch others have sex instead of killing them, when he kills he's off screen. Acting is the worst I've ever seen. And I imagined that the so-called actors didn't love what they are doing, for example at the beginning when we have the lesbian scene watching a girl stop performing and pulls a pubic hair out of her mouth, then continues to do what was happening when the mother rides the black man, the daughter is sitting in the grass annoyed by the ants! But it is the plot that made this incest famous and made famous. When there is blood look at the two girls sitting there waiting for a cue to act, god this is worse, but still to be had if you are in Sleaze and Grindhouse. Make sure you have the full version.
