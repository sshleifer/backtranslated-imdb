Two famous actors are paired on showtime like De Niro and Murphy playing a police and an actor. Although they share most of the time on the screen, they don't achieve their expected movie performance like Analyze this, Meet parents, Dr Doolittle and Nutty Professor. The film begins in an interesting way, but becomes a subtle and ordinary comedy, which is rather disappointing. It seems that in particular De Niro doesn't like being in Showtime. It's a shame because it really shows his feelings this is what I think. Unfortunately, if the idea had been used intelligently, this could have been a more interesting work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular Hollywood movie. Well, I don't think there would be a follow up to this at least De Niro and Murpy again. ** outside *****
