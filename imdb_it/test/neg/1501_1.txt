Oh my God, this movie is amazing, it's the worst movie ever and I know what I'm talking about! I'm a fan of scary movies! <br /> <br /> The story is totally silly, a group of adults decide to have a party and a stupid boy with a terrible mask arrives and kills everyone ... the dialogues are a kind of parody, worse, they're just talking about sex with such a bad accent. The end is (oh !!!!!!) find out for yourself! you will be really very surprised ... (it is not possible! yes it is!) and surprise the film is only 58 minutes. (not possible (bis) yes it is!) Worse than House IV and Howling V. <br /> <br /> To put it in a nutshell, forget it forever !!!
