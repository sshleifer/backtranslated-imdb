The implausibility of the plot was noted by several commentators, in particular the immense amount of problems that should have gone to McKenna and the absolute impossibility of some of the calculations he should have done, including that Langdon was going to decipher every clue in few minutes. McKenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders, and a few minutes later, he is running (literally) around the operations - in real life, he would be in shock. And, as usual in the yellow, the killer does not kill the heroes, giving as their only disgusting explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed, as if all the other innocent onlookers he had been shot were. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly terrible film (the President of the United States requisitions a jet and beats aliens, ha ha), and this effort brings him closer. For a film so implausible, Angels and Demons contains a significant number of predictable incidents. Who didn't laugh consciously when the killer went to get his reward in the Volkswagen? I wanted to shout "You're about to blow up". Who didn't know that heroin would find a body in the lab? Who has not identified the villain? Even technically, the film was terrible. The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear, while the races through Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. Also, many scenes looked like mud. The only thing he redeemed were the shots of Rome and of what the Vatican looked like - a result, because I'm sure the Vatican officials wouldn't have wanted this shot fired in and around St. Peter's - and the interiors were convincing. Rome is a magical place, and I liked to see it fleetingly.
