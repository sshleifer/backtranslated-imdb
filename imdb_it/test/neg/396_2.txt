Kazuo Komizu, who did not make a decent film, directed this "notorious" shock and should be ashamed that it was a success for his Japanese version. <br /> <br /> Yes, it presents scenes of rape, cold blood and dismemberment, but then? He has the style of an ugly American porn movie shot and badly photographed by Ed Powers ("Dirty Debutantes") and is incredibly slow. <br /> <br /> It appears to have gained its reputation based on its list of anti-social acts. <br /> <br /> There is a huge difference between this and the horror that is well produced. <br /> <br /> Just because someone likes their cinema a little wet doesn't mean they'll accept crap like this. On the contrary, that kind of fan (myself, for example) tolerates even less crap than the average punter out there because he saw so much and became overly perceptive. It is a shame that production companies do not realize it. <br /> <br /> A reviewer here (ZombieKilla81) commented that the film's "almost obsession with gang rape" is one of the factors that killed him. I do not agree. The topic is never the problem. The problem is how that topic is treated. In ENTRAILS OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, it is treated unimaginably that it is boring. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like the graphic representations of psychopathic behavior (with an intriguing context) if the material is well directed, just photographed and aesthetically pleasing. This horror / pink Nikkatsu hybrid is painful.
