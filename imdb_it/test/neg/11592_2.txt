If you are looking for a movie that is fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about the "special" special effects, not so fantastic, and the typical sci-fi story ... then this is the movie for you! Not for acting it was bad, indeed, some actors were actually pretty decent. The special effects were not the biggest (to say the least); the animals seemed completely animated on the computer. There was an annoying scream that covered the oath and there was only one song played over and over during the entire movie. Overall, a good movie if you're looking for something completely approximate and fun to tease. It's not a good movie to watch if you're looking for something serious.
