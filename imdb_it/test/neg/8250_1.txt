So many fans, so little to show for this. I know, I know, these words will find me in a large minority. Many people really liked Good Will Hunting. But seriously, please, make fantastic films, not even close, and blame those who belong ... in writing. <br /> <br /> Now I know they won an Oscar for this, and the guy made them look good emoting on the screen. But Good Will Hunting is an ABC after school special with a lot of curses and a slightly bigger budget. <br /> <br /> What this film shows, is the splendor of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein could take the manure, feed you and make you believe your appetites. And that's exactly what the studio did with the film. They aroused so much enthusiasm around this, that people believed, and wanted to believe it so much - that they saw a splendor where there was none. <br /> <br /> Now, I know some people think it's a great movie, I don't think it's a horribly bad film, I like to compare it to more in the middle of road movies, and even to some great Made for movies TV (although not HBO movies, HBO movies are unusually better than Good Will Hunting it would ever have been.) It's just a good movie, with some good performances, Robin Williams wasn't good at that, they just gave him the 'oscar because he had itched to do it for a while. And, of course, the public relations machine Miramax assured Ben and Matt their Oscar for the script ... but only one person ... there are better films out there than GWH.
