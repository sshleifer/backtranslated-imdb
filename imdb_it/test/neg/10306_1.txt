I am very open. I look at all kinds of programs until the end ... good or bad ... just to give them a chance and learn from the positive and negative aspects. This show could be good. But my God, what were the writers, the casting director and the director? The cast of actors is terrible ... with the slightest exception of Meryl (Mimi Rogers) and Darcy (Joy Osmanski) who receive occasional good jokes with the best performance of the lot. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast kills the show. It is the same plot of each episode. Sam plans to do something. His boss upsets these plans by assigning him ridiculous work projects. Then the foolish ways that Sam tries to accommodate both in a way that is mainly stupid and lacking in true intelligent humor. This is EVERY episode. It gets very tiring. <br /> <br /> Season 2, abandon the candies with open eyes. The 2 "hot" girls of the show are written (yet the brother remains, please explain to me please). I can understand why they wrote them ... they didn't have a substantial role ... but they didn't add anyone better to replace them. <br /> <br /> The character of Derek Tricolli is given a continuous appearance in season 2. His acting (along with everyone else's) resembles many poor 80s sitcoms ... it may have been funny then ... but painful now. <br /> <br /> the show could have been much better with some good writers and some people who had some talent for performing them. This show lacks everything. Production quality is the only positive aspect of the show. It's great about it ... unfortunately the content is painfully sad. <br /> <br /> My god. FOX, was there really nothing better to choose? For now I'm busy with shows like "It's always Sunny in Philadelphia" or "30 Rock". The bar should be set by programs like these that actually assume that the public is smart and that they don't continue to drool over themselves using all their brain energy to keep breathing.
