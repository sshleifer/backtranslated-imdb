This film almost caused me a nervous breakdown. When I was recovering from appendicitis a few years ago, I had just started teaching in secondary school. The whole didactic activity was a little nervous for a beginner, but to prepare myself mentally to return to the classroom I decided to watch some rather horrible films. The Flintstones was one of the films I chose, and then I put in "King Of The Streets" (the British title of "Alien Warrior") on. Shortly before it ended I found myself almost in tears for the sheer waste of everything ... my life, the movie, the Â£ 2 I paid a couple of weeks ago in the rental section of Blockbuster, the time it must have taken to print the cover, the effort of the publishers and musicians involved in the soundtrack (though their efforts were negligible) ... the list goes on. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. Let me clarify perfectly: I love watching crappy movies from Blockbusters. My partner Dan and I used to sit and watch many, many horrors and laugh at them. But this was a different kind of lousy movie. I don't think anything has come close to this, not even to the "Death Trap" by Tobe Hooper (which is probably my second worst film in the world). All doing a car from the section of abandoned parts almost killed me; the repetition of music on every available occasion, regardless of the events on the screen; all .... AAAGGGHHHHHHH !!!!! I can't even continue with this "critical" dissection, since my vomiting reflex started. The uselessness of that film, even now, three years after having seen it for the first and last time, still makes me speechless (but I am still able to write). The whole "making a car from strange parts" section made me contemplate horrible things. <br /> <br /> I beg you, if you are interested in watching this film, just look at the cover of the video and imagine the worst possible version of the synopsis of the story on the back. I can almost guarantee that it won't even be half of what this film actually is. In no case, actually contemplate looking at it for any reason. Not if you are a Christian and want to see an allegory of Christ; not if you are a bad movie and you want to try the real trash nadir; not even if you want your life to seem longer (and believe me, every second that runs this film seems at least a minute). Make no mistake about this, this film is ungodly. It is the antichrist in the form of a video. As Bo Cattlett in Get Shorty said: "I saw a better movie on my teeth".
