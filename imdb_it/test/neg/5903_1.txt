This film could have been much better. It is a beautiful story set in very difficult times, yet it was poorly executed. In the past, the main actors have done an excellent job and for the most part they do adequate work in this film. Although sometimes their dialogue seems forced. The direction could have been more concise. Most critics should go to writers, who took a good story and made it boring. In short, there are thousands of MUCH better ways to spend 2 hours.
