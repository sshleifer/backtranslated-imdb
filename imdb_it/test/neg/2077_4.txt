Carmen is a prostitute who lives by seducing and stealing soldiers from the Spanish army; she is, without any doubt, the best femme fatale at the moment. When a man resists his fascinating attentions, he decides to do everything to destroy it. Eventually, he falls into his canvas and will be forced to do all the things he has always hated just for being with Carmen. Despite Paz Vega is very beautiful, she doesn't look like a gypsy (like Carmen) and neither her acting nor Sbaraglia's are good. The story is very boring and, in most cases, it is very absurd, while it intends to appear truthful. likewise are the scenarios and special effects, although they are not but are not acceptable, and too artificial for a historical film as it is. To sum up, boring and bad, with a very absurd development, there are many better things to look at.
