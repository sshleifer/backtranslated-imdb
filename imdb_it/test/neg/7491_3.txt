The C-class cast and the poorly evolved scenes, accompanied by terrible acting, also led me to believe that this would have made a good release only for TV, like the FX presentation of a smallpox epidemic. At my local blockbuster, however, about 9 copies are stored on the shelves, none of which was verified when I rented the title (I wonder why ...). However, this title was almost ridiculous in the director's "fear factor" was going for. The entire "death count" at the bottom of the screen completely contradicted the plot, sometimes, as when the helicopter was crossing Angola, and the budget was accelerating at a rate of 23 million to 24. However, while the movie ends, (maybe several hours or even a day or so after the helicopter has landed) the toll counter has been reset too much as it was when the helicopter was approaching the area. The movies have left a huge whole throughout the plot, and God knows that no one is waiting for the sequel. Anyway, don't rent this, I only recommend you watch it if you got the title without any monetary loss, and you're in the mood for a suspense movie.
