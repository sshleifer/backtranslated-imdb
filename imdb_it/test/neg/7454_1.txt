This is by far the worst thing I've ever seen in a movie. My uncle's home movies have more talent in them, so this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> The plot summary is basically that these twin kick boxers are playing a survival game sick with a man and his private army on some island. The man has a hand with a very cheap paper look. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious in this film. There are changes of scene when the hat falls. For example, for at least 30 seconds we see a guy humming a song that adds NOTHING to the movie. This is the worst dialogue I've ever heard about in my life, I don't think this movie could get worse than it already is. I would describe it as a desire to be a Chuck Norris action movie gone wrong. And I hate Chuck Norris.
