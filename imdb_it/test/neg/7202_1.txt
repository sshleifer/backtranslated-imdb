This is just the MOST IMPORTANT piece of trash I've ever had the regret of sitting down. The story was awkwardly amateur, the graphics were horrible and the acting ... I've never seen worse actions in my whole life. A kindergarten class might find a scarier concept, written better and more fun than this. Too bad for anyone wasting their time on this film, as well as the actors who agreed to do the job. It was obvious that he had not been given an appropriate direction. The writers must have spent their time at the film school in the "back room" playing surprise. Many professors have lost a lot of time on these two. I would be really embarrassed to admit that I knew them.
