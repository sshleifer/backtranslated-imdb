or my dear god I had to watch this film FOUR times in my sisters house and it was a terrible story of sex and guns and inexplicable inexplicable acting unless you are told to watch it to avoid it Ja Rule has just shown being able to act Even Ving Rhames played the most terrible acting in any of his films, there was not a part of this film that made me laugh or make me jump or feel any emotion I would be surprised that people had really liked me, I looked like terrible movies in my life but this would be in my five worst movies ever the music in it was not good and the plot I think was made up of a couple of guys who ordered pizza and as soon as they sat down they wrote ten points list and then made it an absolutely terrible movie
