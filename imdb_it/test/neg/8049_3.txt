The best way to have fun in this movie is to count how many clich√©s it is reshaping. Snarling Chinese gangsters. A female vice president. A fan duct that appears to be large enough to fit a large Caucasian male. Shoot through the wall to kill the villain. A situation in which it is necessary to turn off some innocent people to prevent Armageddon. Independence Day scenes in which you write down some memorable landmarks in a fireball. The vice president in a beautiful well-lit room surrounded by subordinates, while the Chinese premier practically alone in a dark room with only a little dim light, snarling snaringly like the slimy gangsters. A lone hero left alone on a ship (building, plane, whatever) wreaking havoc on clueless villains with large automatic weapons. Etc, etc, etc. <br /> <br /> The second best way is to count how many zeros you need to enter after the decimal to accurately assess the probability of the film scenario. I counted up to 45. A president who accepts a meeting aboard a private ship. The impossibly non-overwritable command of the atomic box. The part where the Chinese decided to play shoot. Etc., Etc. Man is more likely to fall into the sun than this movie. <br /> <br /> I admit that the film was interesting to the point where the evil Taiwanese gangsters kidnapped the president. Then boredom came. The suspension of disbelief ceased, and I started thinking about the fun that I would torture this movie ...
