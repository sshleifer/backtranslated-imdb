After seeing this piece of shit you'll understand why the limeys drive on the left side of the road ... this movie is an absolute NO-BRAINER! Jokes (if that's the right word for this ...) are mostly sub-standard (around 98%) and absolutely miss any punch-line. Save money and get drunk. You could enjoy this totally wasted movie, maybe!
