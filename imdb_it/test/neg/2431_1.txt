This show is not in my opinion, well, then again I didn't like any Disney Channel cartoon. Except for "The Proud Family" because it is so for a normal teenage female This show is very similar to the one I feel for Lilo and Stich the Series. It was a mistake to turn the film into a cartoon because the film was excellent, the cardboard is terrible. Disney Channel was going great before adding all these stupid cartoons like Dave The Barbarian, Brandy and Mr. Whiskers, Lilo and Stich the Series, American Dragon Jake for a long time, and where it all started: Kim Possible. The shows would have been better if they had come to Disney's PlayHouse! As for this particular show, Kuzko will never leave school as Dave The Barbarian's parents will never come home again, and like Brandy and Mr. Whiskers they will never get out of the jungle.
