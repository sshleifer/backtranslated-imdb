Michael Caine could have tried to make a character bigger than life to a level of success, but the whole plot and character surround him where he is not at all nice or interesting. It was all very boring and rather predictable. Martin Landau, my favorite actor, had no role. It was useless. Michael Caine became a bit irritating after a while and the film failed to decide whether it was a comedy or a serious thriller. Caine tries hard and well, but I felt the direction and the plot disappoint him. Do not waste time. Start well for the first 10 minutes and that's it. A film for Die Hard Caine Fans Only. Stay away from this ...
