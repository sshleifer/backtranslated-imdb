To begin with, I have to admit I've never been a big fan of the Dutch film genre. Unfortunately watching De Dominee didn't change my mind. It shares some common flaws, like having a plot that is too predictable and linear for my taste. <br /> <br /> Worse, however, is that the cast has their dialogues as if they were theater actors in a comedy. Unfortunately this is also common in many Dutch films and, at least for me, makes it impossible to try any kind of involvement with the main characters. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays Adri (I'm sorry, I forgot his name right now) is at least providing a decent performance, and it's one of the reasons why I don't consider this movie even worse. Another reason is the fact that at least it seems to have had a budget, and the production seems professional <br /> <br /> Ironically the fact that acting is often too complex may not be a problem if you don't speak Dutch, even if you I have already warned that the plot is not spectacular, but at least it could make it an acceptable film to watch.
