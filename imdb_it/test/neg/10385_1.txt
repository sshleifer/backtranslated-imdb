As the metaphorical flies fled from this watery vapor of a film, I found myself wanting to join them. <br /> <br /> From the opening sentences, quickly gather that the actors are without talent. The script editor was probably dead and the director should be. To be honest, I couldn't finish this film because twenty mournful minutes at the sight of the main actress running on the floor like a Shetland pony who was hit in the ass was too much for me from the stomach. <Br /> <br /> I never, and I never mean, seen such a sweaty movie and I watch a lot of shitty movies. <br /> <br /> Turd.
