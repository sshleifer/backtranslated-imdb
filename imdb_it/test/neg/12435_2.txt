I've never been a big fan of Larry Clark, but somehow, I've been dragged into almost all of his films. Now, I like independent films, and I've grown a lot in punk rock, and I'd like to say that this film is disappointing for both audiences. Not all punk songs incorporate "Oi!" in his choirs, as they do in this particular film. <br /> <br /> But the real problem with this film is that it changes mood every fifteen minutes or so and lacks any kind of cohesion. Clark has made his living by pretending that his fictional stories are "how children really are" and as such, you will give them ten minutes of scenes of stupid dialogues that are not going anywhere, because that is the cinematic sentiment that is trying. However, when shooting at a ridiculous scene of death (choosing some, with the exception of the opening drive-by), the excessively stylized attempts of what I assume are intended as black humor are completely out of context, ridiculously shot (in most of the cases, much worse than a student film) and absolutely ridiculous in terms of history. John Cassavettes and "Date Movie" make the poor bedfellows, while the raids in the second style take you out of every kind of reality to remind you that you are watching a movie - really, really bad.
