A young and refined cast is wasted in this hollow, mushy and manipulative film that tries to be a combination of a pretty comedy and a perceptive drama. The plot moves so slowly that the 90 minutes seem endless while the characters do nothing but cheat and emulate. The dialogue is full of rigged clich√©s and fortune-cookie attempts at pseudo-philosophy. <br /> <br /> Apparently aiming to be a moving and profound look at life and love, the film ends up being simply pretentious. The only real weight is the weight that the talented cast is forced to carry as best it can. But never fear: they are held back by the threads of the puppet of the invented plot.
