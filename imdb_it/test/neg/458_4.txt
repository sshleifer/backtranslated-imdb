After the turning point of NIGHT MUST FALL, Robert Montgomery (most of the time) entered his most beautiful films and performances: ECCO IL SIG. JORDAN, THEY WERE LONG, THE LADY IN THE LAKE, THE RIDER OF THE ROSE HORSE, THE CHARM OF SAXON, THE BRIDE OF JUNE. Even some of the failures he found himself in were interesting enough to still be watchable (RAGE IN HEAVEN, MR AND SMR.). But Montgomery wanted to do more and more production work and direction. In 1949 he realized what would be his last film performance - he played Collier Lang, a self-centered movie star, who was dragged to help the authorities investigate a young girl's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Apparently my vision of this film is a minority view. Most of the opinions provided are favorable in this regard. I thought it was a boring and lackluster script, with the Ann Blyth group's heroine not very attractive as a character. He admires Montgomery as a star, and this "helps" when he is called to assist the authorities, but after a while I discovered that there was no interaction between them. Even the script was lacking in fun, although Montgomery and Roland Winters tried. The only thing I remember until today as a joke was that Taylor Holmes is Blyth's wealthy father, and he is an admirer of Winston Churchill. So he always dresses like Churchill, and we see him with a wide and wide-brimmed hat, smoking a big cigar and painting (Holmes's bald head helps to mask). That was the most memorable line in this film - not much of a real memory. <br /> <br /> Montgomery entered the first television, and eventually won the attention and respect he had always deserved in the movies. His last contact with the films was directed by THE GALLANT HOURS on Admiral William "Bull" Halsey, starring his friend Jimmy Cagney. It's a much better film than this. For his film and television career, I will give this mediocre film a "4". This seems to me equally generous.
