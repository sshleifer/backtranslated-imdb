As a Michael Dudikoff fan, I sat and watched one of his good old actors - I'm still waiting. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a group of US commandos trying to get rid of a group of Syrian terrorists who have detected a nuclear reactor. Maddie Reese (Felicity Waterman) was a British member of the commando unit and, of course, she became romantically involved with Tom Dickson (Dudikoff). I have to ask since the British had female members of SAS - as far as I know they ever need, they come from other sources. Even if they did, I can pretty much guarantee that they wouldn't be as wet as Maddie Reese. I would also think that Tom Dickson would be a little more responsible in his position - or did I lose the plot ?! I know there is always a romantic corner in these films as it helps provide the feelgood factor, but it must be everything, especially when there are more important things to consider - such as nuclear war! <br /> <br /> The signing of the US aircraft carrier treaty intrigued me. The "sacred pen" carried by one of the alleged television crews - there were no security checks to find out who or what goes on board one of these ships, especially with the caliber of the people who were there. Mind you if there was, I suppose there would be no story. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but when it came to the "internal bombshell" to safely remove a bullet I gave up the action drama is a bit welcome and enjoyed the comedy that it was actually. <br /> <br /> By the way, would a journalist really say "Downtown Damascus" ??
