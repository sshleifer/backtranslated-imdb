* Spoilers herein * <br /> <br /> Where do I start with how stupid this movie was? 'Mole-sized people, who live under the garden attacking the residents of a big house' !!! When I first sat down to watch this movie, I wasn't aware that the protagonists weren't poltergeists etc. But 10-inch tall goblins that seemed mighty easy to kick hard and far. I kept watching it because I like to see the movies even the terrible ones to the end. this film was terrible. My girlfriend, who went to sleep in the first ten minutes, besides finding a good sleep aid, thought it was exhilarating that I had taken the trouble to look at everything. <br /> <br /> Tiny goblin even in large quantities (the thought is silly I know) are scary and threatening like flat cola. They succeeded in tripping a guy "fatally" and killing a cat before they were blown up, The End. I said it sucked right?
