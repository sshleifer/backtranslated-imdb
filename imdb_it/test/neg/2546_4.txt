They can be spoilers, so don't read if you don't want to. Just like watching TV news, everything has already happened, a great tsunami looms over a bay in the city and CUT, there is no more to see, Tokay suffers from a great earthquake, someone saw more than 5 seconds that I saw? If you want to make a love story, make a love story, but if you want to use a catastrophic movie title, please be so kind as to show me THE DISASTER, pd after watching this movie watch JISHIN RETTO or any movie of GODZILLA to satisfy the part that was willing to see people screaming and buildings collapsing that they didn't have the chance to do in this film. I'm not wrong I like catastrophic movies and I love the original Nihon chimbotsu and Jishin righteous, I even like the last Poseidon, not a great story but a very nice and graphic sequence of disasters, New Nihon chimbotsu loses many times as Pearl Harbor or the day after tomorrow but at least these two films show good sequences of disasters, and even enough with the expensive FX that showed nothing, give me fake buildings if you like them as long as you destroy them correctly, I know I must look like a sadistic maniac, anyway I went to see Love actually when I want to see a romantic movie, grrrrrrr also kimpachi sensei makes me cry and this movie didn't do it: t. there is also a TV series called napping chimbotsu made in 1975, I have it on DVD and it is much better
