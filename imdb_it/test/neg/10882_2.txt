Obviously the Raw Feed Videos are smarter than all of us who wasted our money by renting this movie! They will earn millions from video rentals and their low budget investment will pay large sums, which they will "Rest Stop II" (unfortunately). I imagine they spent a maximum of a few hundred thousand dollars to hire the actors, rent the parking area and burn a truck and drag a motorcycle behind the truck for a while and pay for technical things. That's all. We should all be as smart as these guys, I won't fight them for having the genius of promoting a stinker in good monetary returns. The premise of the film was good, and could have been a truly adequate horror film, but failed to provide a clear plot. I'm always looking for a jewel of the most advanced film companies, but I haven't found it here and neither have you. I'm just sorry I wasted $ 3.99 plus tax to find out.
