As a "fan" of Genghis Khan I couldn't wait to see this movie. Having devoured Conn Igguldens's epic novels on Genghis and read a lot of historical documents, I feel I know something about the subject and was thrilled to share my knowledge with friends through this film ... <br /> <br / > a deception. This film is practically composed from beginning to end. There are some things that seem correct but mostly it's pure to make writers believe. This doesn't have to be a problem, I like good entertainment just like everyone else unfortunately is mostly boring. Nothing of greatness comes out of this film. <br /> <br /> I would NOT recommend this movie if you know something about it.
