I saw this movie last night, I'm a big fan of the book, and I was pretty happy with the version in which they played Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon. But this is simply horrible. Oh my God, I don't understand how they dared tear this classic story and made the characters totally different, starting with the transition from Beth to her younger sister, and making Amy the third. And Jo's interpretation, terrible, Jo was a young feminist, intelligent and rather angry, and the actress who plays Jo in this film behaves like a silly and very annoying little girl. And what's going on with the war with Laurie? I'm fine with the fact that when a book is turned into a movie there must be some changes, but not rewrite the whole story. very badly done.
