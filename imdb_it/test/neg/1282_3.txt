All Grown up has had a lot to live and there was a lot of hype when this show was announced. Now it's easy to explain why it doesn't live up to expectations: first, this show failed to create a realistic world of pre-teens in the way Rugrats captured the world and the imagination of young children. Secondly, the characters of the show are stereo (Angelica: white spoiled blonde as opposed to Suzie: colorful girl of modest family, ...) or boring (Tommy, Chuckie) and boring (Dil). Finally, there is not an ounce of innovation or an original plot. To sum up, All Grown Up is a waste of time and a bad idea for a series of sequels to a show like Rugrats. It's boring, it lacks imagination and it seems that producers don't even know how 10-13 year olds behave. To be precise, Angelica and Suzie shouldn't compare the size of bras rather than arguing over who is better at doing household chores?
