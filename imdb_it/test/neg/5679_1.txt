Can't touch NRFPTP! The new harvest is simply horrible. The jokes are not funny. Some of the crew make me want to stop watching TV all together. Lorne, you let your creation go down in the bathroom. Guests are sometimes good, bands are mostly junk. Weekend update, Seth has to tell the audience when to laugh ..... Seth would get a proper reception at a Baghdad cafe though ... Make sure Andy goes with him ... The show has about 10 bars in all and them keep turning them over and over again. Even the segments that are obviously not fun. Offensive people have become the name of the game, but they can't even do it the right way. Only in an offensive way. I'm so disappointed with what happened at the show, but now I also know it's safe to go out on a Saturday night!
