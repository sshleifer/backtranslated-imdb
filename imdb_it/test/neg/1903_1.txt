Plunkett and MaCleane are two bandits who rob the rich to give ... well, the rich; relatively, they are the rich. But we know they are good guys because the guy behind the forces of law and order, a Mr. Chance, is so wicked. He rapes women - or he tries. Beats his subordinates. He commits a murder. He has bad breath. Don't shave properly. It has no fashion sense. He tortures dog puppies. The latter is just my deduction: we don't actually see him torturing dog puppies. But I'm sure he does. Little of Chance's nastiness has a lot to do with his search for Plunkett and MaCleane. It's just something he does in his spare time, a kind of hobby that he takes to be absolutely sure he doesn't like us. He must not have felt so much. No one in this film is nice. <br /> <br /> Let's take stock. Captivating characters? There are none: I believe we have covered it. Cloak and dagger? Not a lapping. Instead we have a kind of sweaty heavy breath. Dash? Sparkle? Force? They've all moved on to bravado, I'm afraid. Realism? None of this, either. I think they were rehearsing for realism, since everyone was so dirty, but the characters and the action had all the plausibility of Errol Flynn - with no sense of euphoria to support them. Beauty? No. Excellent photographic work? For a TV crew, maybe. Humor? You could laugh once or twice if you're in a benevolent mood. Then again, you might not do it. Dialogue? See 'humor', above. Music? Don't even get me started on music. The music in "Ladyhawk" was, by comparison, strangely apt; and at least the wrong aesthetics of that score was consistent. <br /> <br /> Ugh. I apologize to "Ladyhawk" for THINK about this too in this context. <br /> <br /> To summarize: there is a lot of positive nastiness here and NOTHING well - unless you count Liv Tyler, who are in two by the way. <br /> <br /> I feel like I've just written a smallpox review. "Not very good," the review says. It would be much more interesting if I could somehow DEFEND smallpox, to say that smallpox critics have it all wrong - but I don't know how I would do it.
