An example of all the worst gay stereotypes in a single movie. <br /> <br /> And Charles, why do you speak in that bizarre pseudo-British accent / high-eyebrows, and insist that even the boy talk like that? Has anyone else noticed that all the music on the soundtrack is exactly the same? You should stay with the good old Hollywood resistance camp that you're so good at! Die Mommy Die II, the sequel !! I don't see the value of spending time and money on a project like this; there are so many stories of young gay life stories to tell and we should see them, not this junk. Sheesh, what a waste of time. An embarrassing example of gay cinema.
