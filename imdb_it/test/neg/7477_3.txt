Perhaps the best part of the show is the fact that it creeps in just after Conan O'Brien and Late Night fans suddenly looked at the Carson show. Carson Daly can't hold a candle to Leno, Letterman, O'Brien or any other late-night talk show host, and Last Call seems to be missing more than success in this kind of success. The show that only redeems quality is that it is so short. But I wouldn't call it shit. Carson Daly is sincere and does not hide the fact that his show is not exceptional (that honesty is of great help here), while some of the skits and Last Call material seem to be stolen, sometimes they find the brand sometimes. In fact, some of Carson's montages have been pretty funny, and the skits occasionally have their moments of decent comedy. <br /> <br /> As an interviewer, Carson is ok, even with only one guest, not exactly late-night material but still above the level reached by a high school AV team. However, he doesn't have the quick intelligence that makes Conan so funny. I don't like his musical guests, but that's more because I'm not a fan of that kind of music so I don't hold him against him. <br /> <br /> On the house group. I don't know the band of Joe Firstmans and I wouldn't compare them to the CBS Orchestra, the Tonite Show Band with Kevin Eubanks or the Max Weinberg 7. Even Cleeto and the Cleetones are better. But the bandmates of the band Firstmans still do the show in my opinion. Especially the alto sax player who sometimes shows up (he has long dark hair and sunglasses and always plays in the upper register), if anything, watches the show for him, I do it. <br /> <br /> In summary, this show is not even worth a bag full of n bit bits. But it has an audience and appeals more to the younger "mtv generation". If you don't have the cable and you're at 1:37 am, there's really not much else to choose from and, surprise surprise, there's worse out there at that time. So if you're waiting for Poker After Dark to arrive, 30 minutes of Last Call won't kill you while you wait.
