Despite the excellent cast and the potential of the story, this film fails on many levels. I was convinced that the director was a beginner. The film is very badly modified, shows a lot of unimportant and annoying flashes, has very visible goofs and has no atmosphere of suspense whatsoever. The question that came to my mind many times while I was watching this was: "So what?" I don't care about the protagonist and what happens to him. It's not that the story isn't compelling, it's simply the way it is told. The film tells the story. PERIOD. He's like an actor who mumbles his jokes, not knowing what he's saying. The film simply tells the events that happen, without any soul. And the manager is to blame. He doesn't know how to make something interesting, suspenseful or pleasant. (And believe me, I'm NOT someone who wants to see 8 or 2 fast 2 die hard, but on the contrary, I particularly like slow-moving movies.) So I was convinced that the director was a beginner. But to my surprise this man has years of experience and has worked as a cinematographer or camera assistant in many wonderful productions. I guess he had a bad year then.
