This film didn't do it for me, a passionate SNL fan for the past 14 years. The portrait of Jamie Gertz was OK, but there was something so shocking about the film itself. The facts presented in the film are totally distorted. But Merv Griffin produced it, so it would explain a lot. He was never on SNL, nor did he have anything to do with it. The points in his life when he was on SNL are back. When we first see it on SNL, walking through the studio with Lorne Michaels, the logo on the wall is about 1988-1989, not in 1975. And we talk about the cast - who are these people ?? I've never heard of one of them. Really unsatisfactory. This film shows why TV movies are just that, TV movies.
