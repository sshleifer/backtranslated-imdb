Mr. "Uwe Fail" strikes again, he turned a classic game into a piece of shit. Poor acting; Bad direction; Terrible adaptation; I mean, the Far-Cry game was fantastic, it's like a real FPS game, fantastic weapons and lots of "spikes". In the film we had nothing compared to the game .. Well, we had some of the things "point and shoot" but ... I don't know how to explain it, but if you've ever watched another movie "Uwe Fail" you'll make it clear. If you don't believe me, go to the "online petition" website and check for one named "Stop Uwe Bowl". <br /> <br /> That movie made my eyes bleed, someone has to stop it for once. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time.
