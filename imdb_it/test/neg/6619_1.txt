I didn't really take this movie because I'm not a bit perverted like you, which is part of lesbian things. <br /> <br /> The girl with the red wig struggles too much to be funny (her lips are so siliconized!), but she is really lame and insecure. Try to go out like a surfer (better than dressing up as a slut, but still strange and definitely out of fashion); the film does not explain why he is trying to pass himself off as a man. Oh, right, to "take" the poor, stupid girl. I forgot. She makes all these stupid inventions that aren't funny, and she's a really crappy actress. Also, that cool look is so OUT! <br /> <br /> This silly blonde girl from Melrose Place plays (surprise) a stupid blonde. <br /> <br /> Do you think the girl with the wig is a guy! They do it outside too! Ewww! I guess that part was fun.
