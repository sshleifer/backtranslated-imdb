The film is nothing extraordinary. Actually, it's an insult to the horror genre. Nothing beyond the frightening borders ... not even close to the frightening threshold ... <br /> <br /> It's just another case of "another teenage horror movie" - seen one and you saw all. First minutes in the movie and you will know what will happen next. The worst part is that the script is more blogger than the most recent series of scary movies. It would have been better if it was written in Spanish. And don't let me start with the jokes and inside jokes. <br /> <br /> Even if I give some credit for the special effects. But believe me, like any other Hollywood horror movie, CGI and special effects, it has little or no effect on the ability to scare a horror movie. In fact, it makes it worse. <br /> <br /> Between the fresh Anita Briem and the ghostly position, there is not much to see in this film.
