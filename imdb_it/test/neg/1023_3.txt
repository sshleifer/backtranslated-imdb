A terrifying production and a beautiful comic performance by George Clooney cannot save Joel and Ethan Coen's oddly detached, sometimes clumsy quasi-comedy. The road-story of the Depression era returns to talk about yesterday with three prisoners fleeing from a chain looking for a hidden fortune, and inadvertently become country music stars in the process! The film moves long but never creates momentum. He gets a great boost from charismatic, Gableesque aggression from Clooney, and also from the artistic direction and lively music of T-Bone Burnett. Otherwise, the script (of the Coens) is seriously devoid of humor and interest, the cameos supported by John Goodman and Holly Hunter fail to add any effort, and the second half of the film slips precariously into self-indulgence. ** from ****
