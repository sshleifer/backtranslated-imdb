This is a terrible movie !! Some people told me that it really wasn't that bad, but I certainly don't agree! The monster is incredibly cheap (and fun), but this is something we all knew I imagine. In addition to that, the dialogues are horrible and the writing is simply terrible. <br /> <br /> As bad as it is, this movie is the quality of being fun. Not always for good reasons, but it's a good "so bad it's fun". <br /> <br /> By the way, there is no such thing as "La Castagne". According to a minor character in the film called Pierre (described in the film as a French Canadian), there is a legend among French Canadians about a giant bird known as "La Castagne". As a French Canadian, I can assure you that I have never heard of such a legend. It sure made me laugh though ... :))
