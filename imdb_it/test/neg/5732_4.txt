Sometimes intentionally campy, other times unintentionally silly (as in the opening scene, where a woman is "informed" of being raped and that her family has been slaughtered, only for reasons of exposure), this film is ultimately neither fun enough or competent enough (like a simple adventure story) to be really nice. I'll let you decide what the highlight might be, but the lowest point is probably the fight with a silly metallic dragon. Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for Sonja, with her fresh face and firm and slightly muscular body (and I think her dark red hair fits her perfectly), but Schwarzenegger gives her one of her few colorless performances like Calidor.
