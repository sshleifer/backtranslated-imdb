From all the rave reviews, we couldn't wait to see this show. We love extravagant humor and creative material, especially from Australia and New Zealand. I admit it might not be a good review since we only saw the first 15 minutes. But we couldn't bear any more suffering - it was certainly the most boring and painful 15 minutes we've ever seen watching a television program - it seemed like 15 hours. The songs can be (slightly) interesting on their own, but inserted for an interminable 3 minutes each in the middle of a story scene does not work. <br /> <br /> We are working hard to clear the memory. If you want a wonderful humor in a delightful and engaging movie, see "The Dish" instead.
