Killer Flood: The Day the Damn Broke: 1/10: Finally a movie whose title is spoiler-proof. Even for the poor standards of catastrophic films, excuse me to correct myself, even for the low standards of movies for television disasters, it's really terrible. Where do I start? <br /> <br /> The dam modeler may have seen a photo of a dam once, but I doubt it. Most dams, especially large ones that generate electricity, do not have a power plant nearby, some water gates running through, even a high-voltage electrical wire or two. <br /> <br /> The dam is also a bit short of staff. Two, count, two employees occupy the entire dam, all three shifts. And the employees were apparently imported by a clich√© dominated by two WWII films, as heroically and rather unnecessarily they have long eulogistic death scenes complete with photos of floating grandchildrenn. Heck one of them can get shot from the dam itself in a way that escapes the description. <br /> <br /> The special effects consist of flowing water superimposed on photos of the city in a method that makes a Godzilla movie of the Sixties look like Matrix. A three-year drawing with a blue crayon on the film would have produced better results. Since the disaster money shots are useless how is the rest of the movie? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the script and the acting follow the special effects. This is not a rough diamond. This is rough. So is it a guilty pleasure? Killer Flood is horrible enough to make you laugh and the film itself has that serious incompetence that is a good cult classic, but disaster films must have aged like a good wine. (Avalanche, The Swarm, Meteor) It is also doubtful that Michelle Green hiding from the flood in a dumpster with a golden retriever could ever match the great Henry Fonda who is targeted by raisins that should be a killer bee. Come back with me in 2024.
