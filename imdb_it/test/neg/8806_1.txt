I can't believe Isaiah Washington and Ice-T were in this mess! The plot (and I use this term very freely) focuses on an army of mice that terrorize an urban apartment complex - at least I think that's what it was about. The script made no sense, I couldn't care less about the characters and the work with the camera consisted of repeatedly showing shadow images of mice standing on their hind legs or running. Running is what I should have done. As an African American male, I often read the requests of my brothers and sisters to "support African American films". I try to help, but enough is enough. No one should look at the garbage this way for any reason. Please, brothers and sisters, you no longer produce rats like this directly in video. Please!
