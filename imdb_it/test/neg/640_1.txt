This is a really terrible movie. Lou Diamond Phillips simply calls this in. The use of miniature train models is ridiculous. The plot seems to develop at a run (there is an alien on board, oh, there is also an eco-terrorist on board, oh, and the conductor is dead and the train is out of control, oh, and the train is going for run into another train an hour ahead, oh, and that train has nuclear waste on it ...). I mean, you really come! Alien monsters are not scary (although there are many) and the acting is abysmal. Take a look at the guy who plays the "next president" - do you really think he could be the president? For heaven's sake, he spent his entire acting career playing bad guys!
