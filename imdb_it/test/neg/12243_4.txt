This film is a nonsense or joke comedy, in the lines of The Airplane or Naked Gun, but it doesn't even come close to this two, because it lacks originality and jokes a little smarter, rather than simply throwing yourself with the same old easy jokes . <br /> <br /> You can understand some references to other films, I found Dodgeball and Rocky, so you can have some fun trying to find out which movies are spoofed. <br /> <br /> The film also offers you an occasional laugh, but nothing that can cause injury, so nothing really funny. <br /> <br /> I liked the iPod character somehow (even though some of the jokes with him are the standard comedy 101). <br /> <br /> I think this movie (and like most nonsense / spoof comics) depends on the mood you're in, so if you think you'll laugh at any joke watch this movie. If you are in a serious mood, forget about this (re) look at the airplane instead, it will surely make you laugh
