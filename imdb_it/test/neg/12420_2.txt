This is basically your ride of the cyclist's violent motion hit, complete with slang, crash and music. OK, so just slang and crash. It is a slight notch above most of the other tariff on MST3K but it is still the equivalent of putting a nail into your kneecap: slow and painful. Giving away the plot would exhaust my energy, so I'll just say you're better off skipping this.
