... you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie. What was the reason? The details of the murders were used, but never explained. I guess the team got mixed up in the atmosphere, which is great, but the story is definitely lacking. There is no thread to follow. I imagine that if it had been done correctly, the film would have lasted a little longer, but it would have been worth it, at least for me. <br /> <br /> The casting is very good, I loved Wilson as a vulnerable Vicky. <br /> <br /> Not much else to say, really. But I'd really like them to concentrate a little more on the less obvious. <br /> <br />
