This is a bad excuse for a movie. A noir film made by Busbee Berkeley? Please! First, let's forget about the plot, a really simple version of a tough cynic turned into a saint with the love of a beautiful blonde. Yechh. So what drives them to despise him for loving him? Together with a group of other boys, it helps to prevent a child from drowning while they all swim in a water tower and try to survive while the water is expelled by nocking them. It is not exactly heroic, but it is suddenly hit. It's really painful to see Claude Rains trying to play a tough, crazy, noir-type cop. A crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting tool, along with a snarling voice. Most of his energy seems to go in an attempt to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles. Why did you talk to me about taking this job that I will never understand. Have fun, if you can, for some vintage details, the old cars and petrol pumps, but don't expect a decent movie experience. He wasted 1-1 / 12 hours of my life.
