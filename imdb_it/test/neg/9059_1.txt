John Candy and Eugene Levy are inept security guards chasing a big gangster. Inetto is really the right word for this supposed comedy ... some laughter but above all moans and thoughts to yourself as "why am I watching this c ** p?" Yes, Meg Ryan is also in this ... I'm sure she doesn't want to be remembered ... a waste of a talented cast ... on a scale of one to ten ...
