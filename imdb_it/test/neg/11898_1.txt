I was surprised after seeing this piece of shit, if you saw an episode of TOM and JERRY in which Jerry pours liquid on him and becomes invisible than you can see the same cartoons with the addition of EROTIC that makes a man invisible and that makes S * i * is the conclusion of the film. involving too much sex in a cartoon-themed movie does not increase its value :(, and above all I was surprised when the same cartoon ending was used to show the Mr.Invisible and this was really terrible I have to say, drops of flour out of the rack and our Mr.Invisible becomes visible "look at ZACK and MIRI make a porn" I bet you won't get bored, <br /> <br /> 1/10 from me
