Irwin Allen, a former master of schlock cinema, pulled out every obstacle in VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. Walter Pidgeon, of very low age, who may actually have died when he played this role, is the commander of an atomic submarine that must be the size of the Empire State Building. Every room is gigantic and some even seem to have no ceilings. You could scuffle and hold a formal ball simultaneously in some of these rooms. The submarine, called Seaview, is at its debut when all hell breaks loose: Van Allen's radiation belt catches fire and the Seaview has to launch a missile into the belt within a certain time or the world will fall into the flames of global warming! Along with the race there are a lot of really terrible actors, many borrowed from TV. This makes them television hackers. The worst is probably that Stella Stevens, Barbara Eden, the poor, as a naval secretary, has slipped into too tight clothes, showing off high heels and acting as if she were appearing in a beach party movie. Perhaps because Frankie Avalon is also present for the trip. Joan Fontaine, a middle-aged woman, almost unrecognizable, plays a visiting doctor with a big ugly secret, but really who cares? VOYAGE is a really bad film, obviously made for small children, but which child will still be sitting for endless shots of a miniature Seaview model that moves repeatedly from right to left on the screen in what is obviously a studio tank? There is no scene in which we believe that these people are actually aboard a submarine. When the Seaview shakes, the actors throw themselves, sometimes in opposite directions to each other. Just like in the old STAR TREK series, when the bridge shakes. If I remember correctly, you don't see a fish or a sea creature - except for an octopus that momentarily attaches to the submarine, a nod to 20,000 LEAGUE UNDER THE SEA. The octopus, if true, was probably about a foot long and shows. Worse yet, when people are standing in front of Seaview's glass nose, the ocean that they are supposed to be looking at is obviously a close-up involving an invisible bubble-blowing air tube, probably turned in a fish tank . You've never seen bigger bubbles in your life. You would think that only these bubbles could destroy the damn submarine. Unfortunately, even Peter Lorre, badly aged, is traveling. Towards the end, when the missile is entering the flaming belt, Lorre is enthusiastically congratulated with Pidgeon while everyone else is still waiting for their cue to start shaking hands and hugging each other in victory. A single scene if I've ever seen one. What a stink. It's not even good for a laugh. Attack with SILENT RUNNING.
