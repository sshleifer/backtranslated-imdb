I usually like underground movies and anti-heroes, but this is a bad joke. I wonder how this movie can be called. All these people are losers and the director fails to make them any interesting. They are not funny, not tragic, just stupid and boring. <br /> <br /> I might have missed something but I won't look at it anymore to find out what. Anyone with a video camera can do better than this ... <br /> <br /> I give them a 1 for originality. All the rest is crap.
