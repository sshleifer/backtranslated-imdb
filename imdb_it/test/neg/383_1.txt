What do you do with all the material that doesn't make the final modification of a movie? You could keep it aside in case a director's cut or an extended version is released one day. You could sell it as archive material for use in a part of another film. You could simply bin. Or you could collect it, accumulating more and more from every movie you make and then use it to make another movie, ignoring the coherence or any other sense. Launch a very primitive skeleton of a narrative and align a number of opportunities (indeed, excuses) to insert yourself into your celluloid launches. Excuse the senselessly absurd nature of the plot framing everything in the mind of a horror film director and you made yourself a terrible film. All this can be done with a few days of shooting. And idiots like me will waste two hours of their lives watching it. And then come here and try to warn the others. The whole chain of events is a big waste of time.
