About five years ago, my friend and I went to the video rental store to get something to watch. My friend saw Space Truckers on the shelf, so we got it. Once we got home and started watching it, we realized how much a piece of shit it was! Can a beer float in space? A guy who makes a dump in a bathroom? A guy with a mechanical sniper trying to arouse a woman by saying "Whiz, wizard!" WTF !!! The most stupid, stupid, the most retarded, horribly throne set of rubbish my eyes have ever been exposed to. My friend and I still refer to it as the worst movie we've ever seen. Only another film came close to its crap (and that would have been the stupid film by Jackie Chan, "The Medalion"). If your eyes see this piece of trash on the shelf of your video store, proceed as follows: 1. Take it off the shelf and throw it on the ground. 2. Stomp on it for at least 30 seconds. 3. Proceed to ignite it in a contained structure (bathroom stall). 4. Finally, take it immediately to your local hazardous waste management center so that it can be properly managed. <br /> <br /> YOU'RE AWAY FROM "SPACE TRUCKERS" !!!!!!!!
