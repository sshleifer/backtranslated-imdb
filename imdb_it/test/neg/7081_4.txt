As a documentary, this is ridiculous in a campy way - a schlocky collection of recreated biblical tableaux mixed with solemn interviews with so-called "experts". Think of it as an infommercial that pushes Jesus in place of thigh masters. <br /> <br /> However, the detailed crucifixion scene is, in terms of historical accuracy, superior to similar scenes in large-format cinematic shows such as "Ben-Hur", "King of Kings" and "The Greatest Story Ever "he said." For example, rather than dragging his entire cross on Golgotha, John Rubinstein simply carries his crossbar tied on his shoulders to his outstretched arms. The nails are not guided through the palms but through the wrists. feet are not nailed separately, but one is placed over the other so that only one nail is needed. Incidentally, Rubinstein's flogging before his crucifixion ranks 35th in the book "Lash! The hundred great scenes of men being mounted in the movies ". <br /> <br /> Of course, Rubinstein and the two thieves wear modest loincloths, which is probably not faithful to the shameful reality of the Roman crucifixions, but you have to make odds. , the "good" thief is placed on the left hand of Jesus, which goes against a long-standing tradition.The reason why this thief is played by a fat and overweight man is, however, a mystery, especially considering the fact that the "bad" thief is something of a "piece".
