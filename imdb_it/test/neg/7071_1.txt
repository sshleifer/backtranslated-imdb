This film was such a mess that I actually repaid my friends I dragged to see it. The only reason I went to see is that my friend was a filming apprentice fitter. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this film had to be encamped, but the approach was so heavy and self-reflexive it turned out to be really flat. Judd Nelson plays the role of an absurd scavenger who is a hacker comedian on the side. His life is hellish and aggravated by his obnoxious and overbearing partner Bill Paxton (who I feel embarrassed about this - it was a really insipid role for a talented actor). An anomalous accident alters Nelson's career and chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> Attempts at humor were trivial, predictable and often vain and insignificant. Wayne Newton in the cast as a talented agent is new, but adds nothing - comically or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a very weak and non-creative attempt at humor in the fields that goes like a main balloon. At least you could laugh at AT Plan 9 From Outer Space. This only makes you think of those who thought it was a good enough idea to finance and film. One of the worst bombs of all time you've ever seen.
