I bought this movie in a garage sale when I was 15. I hated it then, and looking at it again, just for the fun of it, it's even worse now. You can hear the director and the cameraman in the background shouting commands like "Zoom, zoom, zoom !!!". There are no special effects, just a piece of raw meat that should be a brain. This is crap, and initially I thought it was a one-of-a-kind home movie or something I bought. But this has been distributed elsewhere and it is really strange to know that other people have seen it. Whoops I need 10 lines .... well .... this can be an interesting thing to see to see how films without a budget were made before the invention of digital cameras. This sucks. In fact, look at this just to see if you can stand the worst. If you can get over it, you can do it with anything.
