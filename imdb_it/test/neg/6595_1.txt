This is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. I hope the REAL family and other characters played have lawyers who denounce the VH1 for their portrait. The acting is horrible, the writing is worse and the portrait of the characters is scary. It should be a drama, but for me it was a comedy, you have no choice but to laugh at bad acting. I usually like to play in Flex Alexanders, but this time he has completely lost his mark. <br /> <br /> You could argue that he played this role for a few laughs, because it was so horrible. If you really want a dramatic movie for the night, DO NOT CHOOSE THIS ONE. But if you feel like laughing about bad acting and stupid writing, stay tuned. Apart from that, don't waste time.
