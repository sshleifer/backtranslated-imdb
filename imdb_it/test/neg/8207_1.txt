Why can't a movie be evaluated at zero? Or even a negative number? Some films like "Plan Nine From Outer Space" are so harmful that they are fun to watch. THIS IS NOT ONE. "The Dungeon of Horror" could be the worst movie I've ever seen (a bit anyway. Fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my old age, there could be worse movies I've seen, but luckily I can't The sets seemed to be made of cardboard and finished with spray paint cans, the special effects seemed to be the C + diorama of a fifth grade set in a shoe box.The film contained unforgivable gaffes like when the marquis shoots and kills his Then he immediately starts a fight with his fleeing victim, who takes his flint battery and shoots at it, without the gun being reloaded! This movie was so bad that my DVD copy he only had credits. I guess no company or studio wanted to be charged, even though I imagine that when you film in your garage and create sets of cardboard boxes, you don't need a stove. God. This film is definitely in my all-time winery, the worst movies with horrible sacrileges like "The Manipulator", the worst movie I've ever seen with a real Hollywood star (Mickey Rooney). The only time I would recommend watching "The Dungeon of Harrow" (or "The Manipulator") would be if someone paid you. (I'm a bit cheap) I should have $ 7 or $ 8 dollars for "Dungeon" and at least ten for "Manipulator". phil-the never released by the director of photography
