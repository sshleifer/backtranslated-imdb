When Legends Die is a powerful moving story of an orphan Indian Ute who becomes Tom Black Bull, a bronc rider champion. Raised in the old ways, Tom is given the name of a white man and must adopt the language and the ways of the white man to live in that world. Loving of the role in which he was forced, Tom finds satisfaction in realizing something, breaking horses, riding them to death, in the rodeo. The film has Richard Widmark as Red, the man who makes friends with Tom and acts as a manager. Red is a drunk who eventually dies in history, which is where the film ends. The real story is completely ignored, the dark side of Tom Black Bull that develops a reputation as a killer of horses in rodeo arenas. Oh well, you should read the book, this movie doesn't come close to doing justice to the story.
