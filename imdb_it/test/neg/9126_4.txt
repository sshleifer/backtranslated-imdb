The last frames of the original "American Graffiti" provide single-line summaries of the fate of the four central male characters in the film. While a bit sexist omitted the female characters, the ending of the original film provided all the information about those people that even the most ardent fan of the film would have wanted. However, someone thought that mega-bucks could be made by describing the sad lives of these characters after the end of the original film. Wrong move. Being an insurance salesman and his wife, a private nerd in Vietnam, a dragster pilot and a hippie too grown up in interesting characters in interesting situations was far beyond the talent of those who wrote this almost unwatchable film. While most of the original cast is back, with only Richard Dreyfuss having the good sense to stay away, "More American Graffiti" is a mess of silly situations involving protests, car races, country singers and the Vietnam War. The use of split screens, once thought innovative and bold, is abused to the point of distraction and adds confusion to the already confused one. This is a sequel that demonstrates almost everything that can go wrong with a sequel. Perhaps it should be shown in film schools as a lesson. Even the use of period music, which was a delight for the original, is badly done here. If you want more "American Graffiti", look at the original twice.
