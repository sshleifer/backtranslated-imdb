The artificial melodrama with a screenplay adapted by Mel Dinelli in his comedy "The Man" concerns a pension owner in a troubled handyman who could be a murderer. Despite the solid work of Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan (both at their best), this boring yarn is not very inventive within its only primary set (which becomes visually boring) and cast of underpopulated characters (there is still a little dog astute feeling the worst!). Hokey and without sense of humor, with a rigged direction by Harry Horner (maybe Lupino should have directed it?). Where is all the suspense promised by advertisements? Dinelli was also a co-producer. * 1/2 from ****
