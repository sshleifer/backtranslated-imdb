Leatherheads is an apt title, however a leather strap would be more useful to self-pronounce yourself after purchasing a ticket to witness this harmful entertainment attempt. Clooney's attempt to humiliate himself is felt with a quiet thud as his behavior implies that he is anything but. Perhaps with another actor who plays the role of Clooney, the film could be marginally acceptable. Excuse me, George, I doubt that there will be an issue of Oscar this time. George Clooney is definitely a fish out of water when it comes to comedy (unless you refer to his politics). However, only the most ardent Clooney fans will enjoy watching the Leatherheads, all the others will want the days of the silent film.
