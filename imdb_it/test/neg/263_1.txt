This is officially the terrible, boring, trivial and ridiculous movie ever created. The film is about a crazy kid and his friends, and they land a 747. His dreams are very trivial and make no sense and are very badly done. Every special effect seems to have been made without any modern technology and could have been created by the child who plays the main role in the film. If you watch this movie, it will surely make you more stupid. I advise you never to consider watching this movie, and if you do, good luck and don't lose the brain cells you killed. My comment does not even fully grasp the terrible creation from the hell that was made. The person who wrote the comment before me didn't watch the same movie I watched terribly, and I wish I'd never seen it. Peace.
