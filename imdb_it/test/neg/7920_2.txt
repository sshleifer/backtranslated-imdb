First, they ruin it with exceptionally poor animation quality, so they get voices that don't resemble the original. They make so many cinematic mistakes. When Sasha sings in Count Me Out, the drummer disappears and then reappears, Itchy's shirt continues to change color, his hat keeps changing position, one of the bridges is white, everyone in the background appears fat, the halos continue to change color and appear and disappear. Even heaven looks different. I don't care if this is a low budget movie, they shouldn't cut the corners of the animation. They completely ruined the first ADGTH. The only positive thing about this film was the soundtrack.
