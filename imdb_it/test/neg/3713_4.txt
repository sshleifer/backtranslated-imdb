I love Juan Piquer-Simón! He is my favorite bad director and, throughout his career, he has incompletely tried to take advantage of every successful contemporary trend in horror and fantasy genres. After the great success that was "Superman", JP created his exhilarating "Supersonic Man", came across the violent madness of the slasher movie with the crazy "Pieces" and really put make-up on "The Return of ET" the unofficial and even ridiculous sequel to Spielberg's science fiction blockbuster. "The Rift" is obviously inspired by the series of deep underwater monster films such as "The Abyss" and "Deepstar Six". From start to finish, you can have fun discovering all the stolen ideas and shameless scams of these (and other) classics. When a completely new and fancy type of submarine vanishes near Dannekin's deep rift, a second mission with the sailboat designer Wick Hayes on board is sent to investigate what really happened to Siren One. In the dark depths of the ocean, the rescue mission discovers an underwater cave in which the government makes secret experiments with mutant sea creatures. The monsters are quite aggressive, but there is also the danger of a government enemy among the crew members ... "The Rift" is a forgettable film, but still has some genius ?? even if very doubtful ?? monster models. Blood and blood fans won't complain, either, because beast attacks are rather gruesome and merciless. The acting is very wooden, although many of the cast names can certainly do better. It is recommended that you simply like the clichés and the gory effects in "The Rift" because, if you start contemplating the script, you will find that it makes absolutely no sense.
