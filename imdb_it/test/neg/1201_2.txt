Without actually giving my age, I saw it for the first time more than 20 years ago when it first came out on video (maybe it was a beta tape ??) and I was old enough to drink (barely) and maybe I had some because I remember thinking how beautiful this movie was! Since then I've seen it sober and I have to admit it's a pretty bad film. As mentioned in other posts, the plot is absolutely ridiculous and poor acting makes things worse. It is a poor attempt to fantasize that even teenagers can be "Mavericks" (although I am surprised to find that in reality it had to be released at the same time (aprox) as "Top Gun", and in reality it did not want to be a bad imitation. ) But for everyone it's worth it - I find myself looking at it if it's on and I have the time. It's one of those movies you watch because it's so ridiculous and so desperately tries to take itself seriously. Like that other "great" movie - "Moment by Moment" with John Travolta and Lily Tomlin ... don't get me started on that!
