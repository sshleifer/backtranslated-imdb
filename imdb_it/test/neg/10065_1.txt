The Adventures of Hercules must be one of the most insignificant excuses for a film I've ever faced. You should look far and wide to find everything that comes close to the level of ineptitude on display in this film. To act ?? Bad. Editing ?? Bad. Direction ?? Bad. Special effects ?? Bad and laughable. Plot ?? Bad. Lighting ?? Bad. Cinematography ?? Bad. Costume Design ?? Bad and foolish. All the rest ?? Bad. Watching The Adventures of Hercules is as much fun as a root canal. Even for a fan of bad movies, it's a real test of endurance. This is one for Lou Ferrigno's masochists or completers (if any). <br /> <br /> Eight things I learned from watching The Adventures of Hercules: <br /> <br /> 1. If you don't have the budget for real special effects, rotoscope a scene from the previous movie. It will look fantastic - trust me. <br /> <br /> 2. When you are on a quest to recover Zeus's lightning, take time for the frequent stops that fill you with oil. It worked for Ferrigno and his two Amazon comrades. <br /> <br /> 3. Any sword fighting, use of magic and almost all other daily activities in ancient Greece have created a sound very similar to a game of Pac Man or Asteroids. <br /> <br /> 4. Some of the ancient Greek gods dressed as Star Wars extras. <br /> <br /> 5. If you need to run the runtime of your poor movie, extend the title sequence by adding Star Trek style titles and entering excessively grand music. It also helps if you have a previous movie from which to extract scenes. <br /> <br /> 6. Combat scenes move much more smoothly if villains attack Hercules one at a time. <br /> <br /> 7. William Berger did something for money. <br /> <br /> 8. I didn't think it was possible, but The Adventures of Hercules made the first film, Hercules (1983), looks like an Academy Award winner.
