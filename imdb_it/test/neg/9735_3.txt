I was hoping to learn something from this film, but I was disappointed. It's about Rommel and praises him as a great general, but at no time in this film have we ever had an idea of ​​why he was great. What made him so successful? Was it his drive, his reluctance to accept defeat, his discipline with his men? I was looking for a performance similar to Patton's that really gets into the character, but this has become flat. Much of the dialogue is conceived and sensationalized, and seems stale and artificial. There is some good action here and there, but not much. The final part of the story, which talks about his involvement in the plot to assassinate Hitler, was the most informative and probably the most interesting part. But as a history lesson on Germany's biggest general, this was a failure.
