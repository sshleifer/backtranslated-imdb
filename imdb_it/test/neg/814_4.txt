"Jaded" offers a premise with potential as it considers the rape of a woman by two other women and raises the question "when is rape not rape?" Unfortunately the film seems to be suffering from bad direction, as it lashes out on legal minutiae as it tries to weave a sort of story with a handful of characters with a dirty mouth and poorly portrayed only to end abruptly. "Jaded" is lame stuff just for the potato-eyed sofa clouded in the mood of some dark drama.
