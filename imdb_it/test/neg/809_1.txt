Don't see this movie! It's ... repulsive! The departure is really very good, but in the middle everything falls and I'm really sorry to spend 80 crowns (about 11 dollars) on the ticket! Peter Dalle should consider this as his last chance to gain interest in people. Naughty image! The only bright spot is the splendid work of Robert Gustavsson, Lena Nyman and GÃ¶sta Ekman. <br /> <br /> I hope you take my advice ... The photo is garbage.
