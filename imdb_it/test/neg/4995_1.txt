I can't give it less than a star, I've tried. Right now, I'm not sure if I'm halfway or not, but I stopped paying attention when a part of it turned out to be a dream. Or not. Or maybe it was. I think viewers who have posted a comment that doesn't include the "horrible" or "horrible" or "made me want to swallow a bullet" descriptions are probably nice because it's an independent film. Don't listen to them, listen to me - there is no nakedness in the film, jump. I needed ten lines to send this notice, so I'll also say that the goth girl that some users have described as "hot" is fat. He has fat elephant legs.
