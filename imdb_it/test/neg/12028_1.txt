This was honestly the worst movie I've ever seen. the acting was terrible, even the plot was ugly. it was still a good idea. if this film had better films and much better actors, I could have had something better to say. Edgar Allen Poe was a great Gothic writer, and this film just destroyed him. because people must always kill good stories by making bad movies. the only good thing was when the killer put his head under the floor with a tape, which was pretty good. the swinging ax was simply horrible, there was absolutely no suspense. and even when the killer is chasing everyone around, he was going from place to place in seconds, it makes absolutely no sense.
