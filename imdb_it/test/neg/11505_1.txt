Of course Sadie is by far the worst show I've ever seen, it's such a piece of sh ** and full bullsh load **. I didn't find any of the gags to be funny or a little clever, they were all horrible jokes. <br /> <br /> Acting sucks, many of the characters sucked into acting, Charlotte Arnold (Sadie) is such a terrible actor, even the other characters suck (Magaret, Rain, Hal). <br /> <br /> The plot is not unique and creative and the show is very predictable. This is one of the worst shows of all time, it shouldn't even have been done, the idiots who are responsible for writing this junk should be fired (if they didn't already) The first season was actually watchable but the second season was just a disaster, it is too difficult to see this show, it is beyond terrible.
