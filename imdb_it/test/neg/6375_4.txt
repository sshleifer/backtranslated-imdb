Don't get me wrong, the boy is a successful dynamo, but he came to the top selling expensive plastic toys to impulsive brats. So I'm a little upset when I look at comic book fans as an extension of that same market. <br /> <br /> See, "The Invincible Iron Man" would not be bad if it had been inserted on Saturday mornings and oriented exclusively towards non-interested children. But it is not exclusively for children. The characters of the suburbs are killed every five minutes and there is enough blood and half-naked bodies to make the censors of the network jam, so it is not cut enough for children's television. <br /> <br /> So, which audience is this video that aims to then? It's the public that likes the almost intelligible stories about the awakening of a Chinese emperor tyrant with 5 arcane rings, that's who. And I think the public is limited in a restrictive way. <br /> <br /> Many great writers have crossed the leathery skin of Marvel over the decades. So it's a shame that Marvel would risk their expensive animation investments on so many questionable storytellers and writers who, like Mr. Arad, are used to passing off action figures during Saturday morning cartoons. How many tepid receptions does Marvel have to endure before they come up with a better strategy? <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> Animation: only passable cels, some segments are better than others, a low budget aspect in all - this is not Bakshi (Ralph) and it is not a Bluth (Don)! The CG animation is ok, but far from impressive. <br /> <br /> Story: a litany of commonplaces, everywhere, twisted, invented and uninspired. <br /> <br /> Characters: then why is Rhodes also here if all it does is add to Stark's sexual ambiguity? Hmmm ... his dad is in a wheelchair ... Tony misses his mother ... Asian girls are hot and, apparently, little else; the female protagonist is completely objectified by the end of the feature film. <br /> <br /> Shows: you can't blame competent vocal actors for a bad script. <br /> <br /> Art: very western musculature, very clean lines, the faces are very derived from oriental art, very dull opaque, very bland CG. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Not exceptional, but worthy of a watch for fans and for those who love the myths of superheroes. A "must-buy" for collectors. A precious "what not to do" course for junior animators.
