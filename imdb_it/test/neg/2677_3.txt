There is a lot wrong with this movie. It can be said that following up on "Halloween" was a bad idea in the first place, and we should feel lucky that the previous rumors, even at their lowest level, were still watchable. But still, "Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers" - even today - it's so ugly, it's shocking. Poor making films at worst, indeed. There is so much guilt to make around. But where to start? Whose shoulders are you to blame for this fault? <br /> <br /> Was the style directed over the substance of director Joe Chapelle? Well, at least, the sixth installment is new on the visual front. And as for the visual effects, you can see Michael kill in some rather gruesome ways, even if it doesn't fit the general tone of the series perfectly. <br /> <br /> So, could Daniel Ferrands' turbulent script be the culprit? Well, to be honest, he did the best he could. The moment you reach the sixth item in any series, you are running out of places to go. Finding a rhyme for Michael's reason is not a bad idea as much as it is uninteresting, especially the way it is handled here. And it doesn't really help that the film was torn to pieces and stitched up so many times that the story was completely lost until the end. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Dimension / Miramax could have ruined everything. After all, this was the first studio movie in the "Halloween" series and we all know what happens when too many cooks come into the kitchen. Heck, look at the incredible basses they dragged to "Hellraiser"? I imagine that everyone is to blame, because apart from the actors and the visual effects, it seems that no one is committed to providing a decent film. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, however, is that no matter how you cut it, slice it, tear it to pieces or lighten it up to make your head explode, "Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers" it was never a good movie. Scoring a record low for the series that almost killed any credibility for Michael Myers, "Curse" is just that: damn. The angle of the plug was never interesting, nor was it probably extended. The useless gore is so out of place and replaces the tension that is the trademark of the name "Halloween". Towards the end, the film stops making sense, stops trying to push a storyline and simply tries to find a way to kill the characters and finish the movie before anything else is lost. It is sad that Donald Pleasence's final performance is immortalized in this film, even though the man did the best he could in the worst possible conditions. And for the most part, there are other strong cast members in this film. Paul Rudd quite naturally interprets the strange, anti-social adult Tommy Doyle while Marianne Hagan does a good job in portraying the sympathetic female lead. On the other side of the coin, the remake of Jamie Lloyd was a shame, and thank God Devin Gardner no longer makes films. While the child in the film is chased by "Man in Black", Danny is the anti-Jamie in that he is annoying, whining and absolutely incredible in his role. It's sad when you can't even feel sympathy for a child in a horror movie. But I guess it's "Halloween 6" in a nutshell. In essence, this is the anti-"Halloween" made by a director who didn't know what he was doing and a studio that had its own program. Hell, music is bad too. Many will try to paint this as the sharp "Halloween" because of its sci-fi touch, but in reality it is simply stupid. Save for some good images and decent characters, "The Curse Of Michael Myers" is almost as bad as it gets. And this comes from a fan!
