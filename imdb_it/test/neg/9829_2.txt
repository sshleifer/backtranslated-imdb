A day in the life of a taxi driver deceived a little around for Christmas: the taxi driver takes a fare ... they have a "really insightful" interlude ... leave the fare ... take another fare .. A another interlude ... and so it continues for 90 minutes cold ... none of this is convincing (or interesting) even for a minute ... SKIP IT!
