This is the last Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I've ever seen! I'm giving this movie too much credit! My best guess as to why I made this film is that someone wanted to show someone else's martial arts skills, but he realized that you can't just film one guy fighting another and get people to do it. look. fighting ... and people still don't watch it. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film was as thin as an onion. That acting was silly and stereotypical of any Kung Fu movie. Dubbing was literally the worst I've ever heard. It seems that if you played a secondary role in this film, like the fat guy or the two guys who tried to capture the main character with a net, it didn't matter who made your voice. He could have been a dyslexic with a stutter and nobody would have said anything. But besides all this, the film compensates for the rather fantastic fight scenes. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were certainly the characteristics of this film. But the instigations of the fighting were totally absurd! In most cases, a boy either appears out of the tall grass, or looks at the main character from a distance, and then attacks him. But once the fighting started, things got balanced. There were only two things that really hindered the fight, though. Those constant "wooshing" sound effects that have been added to every swing of a fist or foot or sword, and the poor editing that made 25% of the fight VERY nervous and rough. Someone would be in the middle of a roe deer and then suddenly being grounded is kicked, and then being immediately standing blocking a fist. But while cutting and pasting was more annoying than anything else, it didn't affect the movie much. <br /> <br /> In the end, this wasn't a great movie, but I wasn't, I was expecting a great movie. A great movie is not something you should expect when you see a box cover like that of this movie. Everything I saw in this film was a way to spend an hour and a half of boredom. I rarely say it, but this was just one of those movies for which you have no practical use, so watch it whenever you have free time. Enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it! Good morning gentlemen. <br /> <br /> -Scott-
