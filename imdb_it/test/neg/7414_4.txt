Bigfoot movies tend to be bad, so I'm not inclined to watch them. However, there were some good ads on The Sci-Fi Channel, so I decided to watch. A climbing expedition heads to the northwestern Pacific to find a fallen plane carrying the daughter of the expedition leader (played by Lance Hendrickson) and brought a revolutionary DNA detector that could be used to prove the existence of the sasquatch . And actually it generates some suspense at the beginning. The sasquatch is not visible, but sees the body heat of the climbers (like the alien in "Predator"), and I wonder when it will hit. Acting is acceptable, as is background music. The dense forest location is well used. And when the creature is finally seen, the costume is not bad, even if nothing exceptional. But as the film moves, it becomes increasingly boring and absurd. Most of the characters are unpleasant people, rude to each other and only in the expedition for money and publicity (except the character of Lance Hendrickson), so it is impossible to worry about what happens to them. And their behavior becomes increasingly stupid. A man shoots the creature (not fatally), then gets drunk and sits alone in the dark. A camper puts on a silk robe before slipping into her sleeping bag, so she can barely be dragged into the woods by the sasquatch, without getting her hair and makeup messed up. Then, the survivors conclude that the sasquatch is actually behind the DNA detection machine and will let them live if they leave it behind ("a creature knows what the threat"). Obviously, instinct does not apply to these actors, otherwise they would not have appeared in this film. And the ending is so stupid, you'll want to kick the TV screen. If it weren't for the script, it would have been a decent horror movie.
