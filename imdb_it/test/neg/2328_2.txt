I had stifled the high hopes for this David Lynch film, which I really like, but everyone's bad acting, except for Naomi Watts, was the first clue that it was a useless effort. Some characters in Twin Peaks were recycled in this film, but it wasn't scary, it wasn't interesting (except for the Watts' topless scenes) and the oddities were poorly performed. <br /> <br /> I will probably give Lynch one more chance, but the clamor surrounding this film is not enough, especially for those of us fans who saw Eraserhead when it came out.
