The film is very fast, bizarre and colorful, it's like Mad Max in speed with tons of dyes and tricks. Also very Cartoonish, as mentioned; sequence of cartoons opens here and there. The plot is also very impertinent, but I think it's also for me. The thing that really drives me crazy in this film, it's the characters, they're painfully irritating, especially Rebecca played by Lori Petty, it's really boring (I think it's the most annoying creature I've ever seen). Even the assembly is annoying, very stylized for MTV. Another thing that is missing in Tank Girl is an exciting adventure. Even humor is not very funny. However, some images are nice. <br /> <br /> However, many people love this movie, most of them are women, and it's not strange at all, because this film focuses on the power of girls .. Tank Girl this is a real movie as a girl, and the best example of a hate / love movie.
