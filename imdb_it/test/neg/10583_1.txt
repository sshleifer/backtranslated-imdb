The film begins with a parody of Spiderman which is your introduction to Rick Riker (played by Drake Bell of "Drake & Josh" fame, personally I would have given the film to Josh which is much more fun) and "Rick Punchers' joke "It is lifted just off the airplane, so the writers were obviously already scraping the barrel to get ideas for this movie. Rick's lesson is on a scientific journey to The Amalgamated Genetics lab and this is where we meet the name of the 1st star in the film, Brent Spiner (Data in Star Trek TNG) in the role of Dr Strom. Rick is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly from which his powers come. <br /> <br /> We meet our next big star names at Rick's home, his aunt Lucille (Marion Ross of the fame of Happy Days) and Uncle Albert (Leslie Nielson of Airplane, Police Squad and Naked fame) Gun). And we are introduced to Carlson on the board of Amalgamated (Dan Castellaneta of The Simpsons) which is then killed very quickly. We were told that Rick slept for 5 days and got some cheap, lousy scenes designed to get the attention of the male audience. The scene of the Stephen Hawking impersonator is painful to watch and it's really a bad idea that it doesn't work and it's not even remotely funny. <br /> <br /> We get another parody of the Spiderman (Rick catching the girl and all the planets) but the movie should end right there, when Jill was hit in the head by a bowling ball that would have broken her the skull and killed his dead stone. You get to see the first powers of Rick emerge (compelling speed and skill) and then his first rescue that goes very badly. We also receive an incest reference that is really in bad taste. We receive a flashback and a parody of Batman in which we discover that Rick is solely responsible for the death of his parents. Spoofing Spiderman again Ricks Uncle is shot with Jeffrey Tambor (from Hellboy) who plays the Hospital Doctor. We then get a parody of the X-men (very badly done, given that Patrick Stewart is almost as white as he is), Barry Bonds is played by another double. <br /> <br /> We meet Invisible Girl (played by Pamela Anderson looks incredible in her costume!). Ricks 1st outing in his costume (once he has solved his ability to see and breathe through it) is another parody of Batman. Tom Cruise's interview clip on YouTube is played by another look-alike (and not very nice). There are many modern references like Youtube, Facebook and Wikipedia that all show that the film is set in our days. There's a very weak gay joke (it's never a good idea to do it too) when Jill is helping Aunt Lucille prepare Thanksgiving dinner and the piss scene isn't very funny, just childish. <br /> <br /> The aunt's fart scene is not particularly fun, just incredibly childish. Anyone who finds it amusing must have a mental age of about 12. It is killed and then we have a bad necrophilia skirmish (isn't there any argument that these people will not try to use to get a cheap laugh?) At its funeral , and the joke of cremation even worse. <br /> <br /> We get the 2 worst look-alikes in the whole movie (Prince Charles and Nelson Mandela) at the awards ceremony and if I didn't already know how childish or stupidly lowbrow the movie is Landers wins the "Douchebag Of The year ". Landers is revealed as The Hourglass (in a really bad scene where the same girl manages to overtake Jill twice in the same direction). <br /> <br /> Obviously The Hourglass is foiled, Jill is saved from certain death and only the fun scene of the entire movie is the last.
