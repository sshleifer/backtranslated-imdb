Poor guys on a summer break in a small Ohio town can't find meaningful ways to fill their time. Some consider driving in Chicago; others are content with drinking and bullying their peers. In a random act of arrogance fueled by alcohol, the bullies tear a homeless man to pieces and steal a strange book. The manuscript text appears to contain archaic spells designed to evoke demonic forces. One night or two later, one of them reads a spell and is quickly possessed. He turns into a ferocious killer and begins to loot his former peers quietly. <br /> <br /> "Demon Summer" is an amateur production with a microscopic budget. Production values ​​are low, but filmmakers were smart enough not to be ambitious. A small network of special props or shooting positions was needed. The acting is particularly weak and there is practically nothing original in the script. On the positive side, special makeup effects are surprisingly good from low-budget film standards. Despite this, blood is minimal. Apart from the effects of makeup, there is little to do for this film, even for the ferocious hunting dogs. Not recommended.
