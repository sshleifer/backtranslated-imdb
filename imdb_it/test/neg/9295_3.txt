**** Contains Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> As a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook, I watched for this show to finally enter so that I could see it. I recorded it to see it several times, and there's something on this show that really annoys me! <br /> <br /> I recognize that it was a TV movie. Not only that, but it was made for Lifetime, which is a channel I dislike. Because it was created for TV, I can ignore the huge holes in the plot. I can ignore the huge lack of character development in the character of Ally Sheedy. I can overlook the fact that George C. Scott and Rachael Leigh Cook, both very talented actors, were certainly not reaching the best of their abilities. I can look beyond the fact that Don Diamont's character was so cliche, that you knew when you saw him that he was the villain. I can also pass the obvious error in the timeline (she was raped during her winter break, and then more than a year later got the baby from it.) <br /> <br /> The most important thing I can't get beyond this is: there are two tests for child custody. In the first trial, custody is assigned to the child's father because he is "better educated, has a college degree and has a full-time job." In the second trial the judgment is reversed because the Judge feels that there is no proof that Emma (the character of RLC) is an unsuitable mother and that the custody should not be taken by the primary custodian and given to someone without any previous interaction with the child . <br /> <br /> The problem is this: nowhere in the course of these tests is the fact that a thirty-year-old man raped a 15-year-old girl and considered her for his pregnancy! Whether it was a rape or not, he had sex with a minor! Shouldn't it be taken into consideration when the judge chooses him for custody because he is a "mature adult?" Mature adults don't have sex with minors! <br /> <br /> Not the worst cable movie you can ever see, but it's not even a great show. ** outside ****
