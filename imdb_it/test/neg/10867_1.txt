The worst movie I've seen all. Like other honest reviewers, it's just an excuse to get naked birds with their jugg. Make no mistake, naked women are not a bad thing, but there is another kind of film for this. <br /> <br /> Boyfriends are attentive. I sold this to my girlfriend as a classic gang bike party (due to reviews) to be greeted with every other scene full of naked women running around the place. Slap in the chops for me. <br /> <br /> What makes me laugh the most is that all the dogey bike dives they went to in the movie were full of models with aesthetic works - which biker bars do they have? They are usually a bit haggard with tattoos and distant stretch marks! Completely unrealistic. The acting is terrible, a lot of useless curses and a complete wasted story. <br /> <br /> Has anyone checked Vinnie Jones's attempt at an American accent? It's as embarrassing as his soccer skills. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. The only reason you watch this film is if you are a guy who has no access to p @ rn and you have scratched it from the parents' movie collection for some perverted kicks!
