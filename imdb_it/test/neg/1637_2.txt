This was the second MST3K movie I've ever seen, and still retains a place in my heart as one of the most exhilarating cinematic experiences you've ever had. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keeffe (sp?) is in this, using his chiseled physique to mark another mortgage payment on his condominium. It is stiff, wooden and unconvincing, but still looks like a nice likeable boy, and at least it's photogenic. This is the only decent one I can find on the film, so I thought I'd get it out of the way. The fact that he is in the film adds another point to the score and saves him from being a "1 on 10". <br /> <br /> In no particular order, examples of how badly put this film together are: <br /> <br /> 1) OK, Tanya Roberts (Mila) clan searches at the "ends of the earth "'to find Ator, which takes 3 minutes for the screen, including the time it takes stumbling to die from a poisoned arrow in his shoulder (which I assume would have slowed it down a bit). So Ator heals her and takes his trusted help Thong and sets off to return to his castle ... and proceeds to take the next 50 minutes of the film, recovering the land that Mila went through in 3 minutes. How does it work??? I know that the intrepid crew is harassed by magical and enemy forces etc. On the way back, but still ...! <br /> <br /> 2) Apparently the writer / director felt the need to add "depth" to the film by adding an ongoing debate / Socratic dialogue / game of 20 questions between Zor (John Saxon's bad aspirant) and the sage Akronas (the aspiring Richard Harris). But Joe Damoto apparently got his Hallmark card philosophical training, t-shirts and stickers, and he doesn't understand time, rhythm or timing ... or even actors. (Crow's observation during one of these exchanges is the tag line for my entry). The scenes with these two drag back and forth, bringing the movie to a screeching halt and killing any momentum or excitement generated by the sword fight and the search for the heroic trio. <br /> <br /> 3) Once Ator arrives at the castle (and is captured), things go even more downhill. Zor decides to feed a group of female victims, along with Ator and Mila, to the God Snake he keeps in his cellar. This scene had some potential for excitement, so the director immediately kills this potential by instilling the scene with all the drama of people waiting in line at the DMV to pay traffic fines. Ator continues to have a great battle with the Snake that is just more convincing than the battle of Bela Lugosi with the octopus rubber doll in "Bride Of The Monster". <br /> <br /> 4) The climatic scene, in which Ator invents the hang glider with twigs and animal skins, is so clearly stupid as to make the observer completely out of the film and roll you on the floor, laughing until your sides do not hurt. <br /> <br /> 5) Oh, yes, and the directors decided to include a video of an atomic explosion at the end, with the moral that Ator decided to destroy the McGuffin "atomic nucleus" that drives the film because humanity was "not ready". ("Zzzzip! ARRIVAL MESSAGE !!!") Just like "Bride of the monster" again, come to think of it. All he needed was an observer to observe: "They have tampered with the dominion of God". <br /> <br /> 6) For some reason, the version of the film I saw shows introductory and closing homo-erotic credit sequences that have absolutely nothing to do with anyone or anything else in the movie. I have no idea where this video comes from, but in reality it is DARKER than the actual movie it holds. <br /> <br /> Watch this only if you're a big Miles fan, or if you like the way MST3K skewers are so similar.
