God, I hated this movie! I saw it a preview three years ago, and I STILL have bad flashbacks. It was, without a doubt, the worst movie I ever paid to see. It was poorly written, misdirected, and (surprisingly considering the cast) acted badly. I'd rather be thrown off a roof on razor-sharp points, and then peel off my skin, rather than put it back. Can you guess that I didn't like it?
