I am easily satisfied. I like bad movies. I like movies that show attractive young women in small amounts of clothes. <br /> <br /> This movie gives this a bad name. Yes, you know that what you are getting is not a high art or something. But, even for the type of film, Beach Babes From Beyond is not very good. <br /> <br /> Some have given it 10. I can only assume that these are people who have had organs allowing rational thinking to take place surgically removed. <br /> <br /> Not very good. It is simply not very good. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 exclusively for reasons of novelty value for the famous relatives and Burt Ward and b) some girls are nice. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, did I tell you it's not very good?
