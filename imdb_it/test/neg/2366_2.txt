A good old movie for boys is almost obliged to have moonlight, car chases, a plot that has a vague resemblance to "plot" and at least a very pretty girl, barefoot with shorts and a low shirt. The pretty girl is here (dressed in designer jeans) - but the redneck prerequisites stop there. Jimmy Dean is as natural as a sausage spokesperson but as a former sheriff, a tough guy, he comes closer. Big John is great, but does not convince with the "bad" part of his moniker. Jack Elam with staring eyes is a scream as always and Bo Hopkins has played this part for decades; Ned Beatty also does his part in a small role ... but there is no HISTORY. It looks more like an episode of In The Heat Of The Night than a feature film. Cornball cornet with an easily predictable feeling. Perhaps the most sensational problem of this film is Charlie Daniels singing the theme. You know the one; was made famous by ... Jimmy Dean.
