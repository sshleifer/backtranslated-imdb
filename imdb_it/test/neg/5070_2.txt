Another example of the gender of women in prison. This is not exactly a genre known for quality films, but this is a notch under most. A group of women is taken by the brothels where they work in a prison on a rocky island. Once there, they are subjected to a lot of badly directed and atrocious "dialogue" sex. For a film with an incredible amount of sex and nudity, there is nothing erotic about it. The sex scenes are awkwardly handled and some scenes, like the shower scene, seem to drag back and forth. That being said, there are at least some minimum production values. On the W-i-P scale I would put it over Frauen Zellenblock Neun's fur, but under Chained Heat.
