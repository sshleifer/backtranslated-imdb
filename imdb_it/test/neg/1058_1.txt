Well, you know ... Rutger Hauer and Robert Patrick are both good actors. But WTF with this movie? The story was lame and the script was simply terrible. The poor actors had no material to work with! <br /> <br /> The DVD cover invited you to a flying action movie. You would expect something like Top Gun ... Huge disappointment! The flying action in this film is so cheap that it makes you vomit. The aerial scenes are clearly drawn from documentaries and other film sources, not made for this film. And they didn't even care about the brands or models of fighters, assuming that the public didn't notice. <br /> <br /> As I said, the story was lame. With a little effort on the part of the writer and director, it could have been very interesting. In short, it looks like a B-movie made in the 70s. <br /> <br /> I'm very sorry for these actors who put their names here. They must surely be ashamed.
