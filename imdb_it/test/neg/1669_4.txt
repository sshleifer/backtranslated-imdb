It was an irreverent comedy from 1970, which made fun of the psychiatric profession and in Beverly Hills. I didn't mind, but I objected more to that irreverence about marriage and religion: two arguments that the lay directors (who mean everyone in Hollywood and elsewhere) can't stop trashing. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau plays a scuzzy character, "Donald Becker", who goes around with a cleric collar, which offends me, but when did Hollywood ever bother to offend Christians? <br /> <br /> However, despite these absurdities, the film has its funny moments and even a little charm. Dan Aykroyd is good at paying a fool and Donna Dixon ("Laura Rollins") is a knockout. I'm sorry he didn't have a bigger role.
