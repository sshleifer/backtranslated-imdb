Although I like the work of Steve Carrell, Evan the Almighty, like so many other exaggerated films, it turned out to be much worse than I hoped it would have been. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be a kind family movie that employs famous comedians to improve their image, but ultimately fail to deliver. <br /> <br /> Carell's usual humor is almost absent from the film and although it made me giggle a few times, there was nothing hilarious about him in Evan the Almighty. <br /> <br /> His 3 sons, though probably somehow important to a biblical character, were really quite useless in the film and terrible actors. Even his wife was a bit of a third leg for such a simple storyline. <br /> <br /> Spending a lot of money to make a comedy was a huge mistake. Although Carell's career could benefit from this film, there is no real reason to go and see it. <br /> <br /> If only there was a little less of his family, a little more than Carell, Molly Shannon and maybe some other cast of SNL, it could have been a lot more fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10 for some laughter here and there.
