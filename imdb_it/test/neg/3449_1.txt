I'm glad I never saw this show when it came out. I wondered why it lasted 4 years. It reminds me of the terrible 80s with fake people, fake clothes and fake music. How did I survive growing up in this era? <br /> <br /> The acting in most of the episodes I've seen are forced. This makes shows very boring. The lines of the plot are not very interesting as shown by the old Twilight Zone. The old show inspired the imagination and took a look at the next show. <br /> <br /> Follow the old Twilight Zone shows and save the pain of looking at the trash.
