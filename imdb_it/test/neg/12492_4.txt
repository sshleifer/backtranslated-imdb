I was expecting a lot from the role of SARKAR of Mr. Ammitabh Bachan, but I am disappointed. Being a director of Ram Gopal Verma, I was not ready for this type of film. Sarkar should be a strong character, but the film shows that Amitabh is too dependent on the power of others rather than his. There is a film in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of God the Father and Kamala Hassan had the main role. The film is well directed and the power remains until the end in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be too defenseless in the film and only accepts everything instead of changing things. The film does not show the strong impact of God the Father.
