The only reason I'm giving a second star is for the first half of the movie. This was a good interpretation of history. I like to see some fictional characters added to add some color to a well-known story. But the second part was horrible !!! Yes, there were violent aspects of this story. But the authors of this film have chosen to include only violence and to forget the good things that God has done for the Israelites. Towards the end of the film, Scott looked as if he was receiving messages with a big giant head instead of talking and listening to God. This interpretation had HUGE problems with deviation from the Scriptures. And great surprise, there are no favorable detours! Their portrait of Moses as this screaming madman who did all this against his will is totally false. He showed a Moses who had to shout to convince God to talk to him. WRONG The Scriptures say that God spoke to Moses all the time and not only after an outbreak of anger. They made people complain, but they did not show that God spoke to Moses at Sinai with an audible voice that the followers could hear and believe (chapter 19). They also forgot the pillar of fire and the cloud that guided them day and night. <br /> <br /> What was the whole thing about Joshua? The righteous Jew who loves peace and does not want to fight until Moses threatens him? WRONG (He was known as a great warrior) What about the great speech that Moses gave the army telling them that God had helped them enough and now they were alone? WRONG (They won only thanks to God's help as shown in their own scenes with Moses raising his staff) And what was that Ark of the Covenant that seemed sorry? Instead of superimposing it with gold, this film had a limited budget and attacked small gold coins! Oh yes, it was a "melted veal", not a straw one with small chips attached. Someone forgot that he came out of Egypt with a huge amount of gold tributes from the Egyptians. You wouldn't know from this sorry group. <br /> <br /> By the way, the part about them that kills the Israelites after the golden calf incident says "men" and does not mention women and children that the movie is happy to show viewers. Oh yes - the manna was not the only thing that was sent from heaven - do not forget the birds for meat. Also, the Bible mentions Jethro who brings his wife and children to Moses and then says that Jethro returned to his homeland. He does not say that Moses left his family. Well, if you don't know anything about the real story, read Exodus for yourself. If you know the real story, you would hate this version.
