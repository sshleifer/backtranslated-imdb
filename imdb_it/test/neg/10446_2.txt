Hey, what a nice idea to open a movie - show the movie at someone's home. Acting schools must be full of idiots! , they are taking theater lessons hoping to become the next big thing in Hollywood when all you have to do is send a movie at home in the studio. Hey, I think I'll send the video of my wedding and I'll call it THE LARGEST ROMANTIC YOU ARE SEEN or I'll send in a tape of my honeymoon and I'll call it THE GREATEST SEX ALWAYS SEEN. Oh wait, I'm not married and I've never been on my honeymoon! Don't worry, I will send a wedding video of someone else / honeymoon <br /> <br /> !!!!! MILD SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> Would you think with an opening like the one that SHARK HUNTER could only improve is not you? Shocking as it may seem, the original film is the best part of the direct film, better written and better interpreted, unfortunately it is all downhill from here while the family goes to the beach (in reality a fog shrouded by the pool) in a foot yacht where mom and dad are eaten by a CGI fin and their son Spencer swears revenge against the fin. We go on until today and the French are using an underwater research base for oil exploration. The only thing is - And it's so obvious that you can't miss this - it's not shot underwater !!! , the director made no attempt even to use the unconvincing technique of shooting the scene through an aquarium. The underwater research base is detonated by the shark (perhaps hired by Greenpeace?) Killing everyone inside and Spencer now an adult man is hired to hunt the shark that killed his parents and a group of French. What else is happening? I have no idea why I decided to look at something else <br /> <br /> No problem if someone from the cast and crew is reading this and I hope Matt Codd becomes a big fish in Hollywood. Do you think you know about Matt sharks? You have not seen nothing yet
