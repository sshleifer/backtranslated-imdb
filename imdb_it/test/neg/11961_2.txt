I saw the first scarecrow movie and I didn't get one, even though I knew it would be a decent bingo and the guy who played with the scarecrow was a fantastic acrobat and had good skills going on. The effects were better and the costume looked much better than this movie. <br /> <br /> I borrowed this with an open mind, I'm also a fan of ken shamrock (ex superfight champ ufc) and I was hoping it was a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Boy I was wrong, the movie sucked, the monster was pathetic in appearance and actually scary, the plot was so predictable that it was like watching the movie in preview mode, as I would already guess what will happen, the music was so bad, with a horrible lip-synching song that made me want to punch the screen. <br /> <br /> Overall we avoid this lousy movie. <br /> <br /> Save.
