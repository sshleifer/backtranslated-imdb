There were many "ghostly" westerns made in the 1930s and early 1940s, and although this has a strong start, it is not. Randy Bowers (John Wayne) stops in a "Halfway House" room, finds it full of corpses, the bartender's body draped over the bar with a gun, eyes looking at Randy from behind the holes that cut the eyes into a photo, and a piano player playing "The most beautiful night of the year". <br /> <br /> It was the result of a robbery by the band Marvin Black, to get $ 30,000 from Ed Rogers. Randy is an investigator who "works alone", who wastes time to be arrested, flee (with the help of Ed Sally's daughter) and literally land in the middle of the black band's hideout behind a waterfall. Everything moves quite quickly. Just too much chase after Randy slows down. <br /> <br /> We also have George Hayes, clean-shaven and in two parts: Marvin Black, the meanest villain, as well as the good citizen, Matt the Mute, who communicates via handwritten messages. Having him play two opposite roles was a good idea, but the writing of the messages became very fast, even for him, given that he finally gave up doing it almost at the end telling Sally: "Ah, I'm sick of this!" You can find George playing a vile, vile, double cross in the serial "The Lost City" (1934). I think this is the only "Lone Star" movie in which the title refers to, or is mentioned in the movie! Sally offers her hand to Randy and says, "He's not alone anymore!" Then they hug each other as they look towards the lake. Sally is running away with Randy looking too abrupt and not sufficiently prepared for. Too much time spent on horseback to escape the sheriff. <br /> <br /> Not bad considering everything, but not even that. I would really give it a 4 and a half.
