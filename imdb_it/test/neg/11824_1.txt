This film is embarrassing. Nothing works at any level. The direction, the script, the acting and the editing work together to repel the eyes from the screen. Everything is inappropriate and inconsistent. At first you can sit there with and moan, wince and laugh, but very soon the whole effort to look becomes too ponderous.
