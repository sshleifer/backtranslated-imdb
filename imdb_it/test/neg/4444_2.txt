The Altman Quintet must be considered more than imperfect: as many other reviewers have pointed out, the ideas behind the film, even some of the choices in painting those ideas, should work - yet very little in this difficult film does it. The objective of the partially clouded camera - I pointed out to my wife that it must be the most distracting fantasy of a director I have ever seen - she never allowed me to "enter the world of film. <br /> <br /> in general, there are serious problems with the staging employed here.It is clear that no small part of thought has entered into factors such as costume and production design, but neither is very effective in evoking a credible world. it's a question of scale, the film is so dramatic that I laughed loudly when it was said that "five million" people lived in the city (yes, I understand the limits of the film's budget, the opaque paintings here and there might have helped ) In all the most disappointing Altman movies I've ever seen, great ideas and great metaphors are not always present in art - it's just part of the game.
