First of all, I'm a big fan of shit movies. The class B vote is always good for a laugh. Unfortunately this film is simply ugly. I dressed as a Zombi for a party and my makeup looked better than this one. Especially the big boy at the beginning, he looked like a little boy who had drawn his face with crayons. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that I don't need to comment because. The effect is also extremely amateurish, with obvious blood tubes that shoot a jet of blood directly at the back of the zombie heads when they are hit. <br /> <br /> It also seems that many people commenting on this film are trying to increase the rating. No one without a finger in the cake will evaluate this film over a 5/10. Frankly, it's shameful that the people who worked on this film are increasing their ratings. <br /> <br /> I suggest everyone avoid this movie, it's not worth wasting the 90 minutes of your life. <br /> Absolutely terrible.
