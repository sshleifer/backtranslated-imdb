This film would receive a much higher grade on my part in general and I will talk about why, but first of all it receives four stars and should remain four stars due to the ridiculously bland portrait of rape and sexual violence directors. Not far away in the movie, Oyama sexually assaults a woman he previously saved, and while she remains a little offended by his actions, this attitude only lasts five minutes before worship enters and takes his character into the rest of the film. I know that many say it's not that important in a kung fu beat-em-up, and as a fan of genres I can't say it's all so unusual, but that doesn't stop it from being completely tasteless every time I see it. <br /> <br /> What I will say in the defense of this film is that it is rather refreshing to see a martial art, or even action movie of any kind, that does not offer a true hero for the viewer to fall behind. Oyama is portrayed as a rapist and a murderer; a social outcast whose only student becomes completely mentally unbalanced before being killed by the police. The last shots of the film leave with the feeling that Oyama is ready for a severe exhaustion and no longer seems to worry about the woman who had attacked before to love him and since then has followed him with a puppy dog ​​devotion. <Br /> <br /> If this was really the expected message of the film or not, you can't help but feel a little hope that Oyama could be on the verge of suicide when the film is finished. This is a rare emotional treatment of the martial arts genre and it is interesting to see a film that leaves you with the feeling that its violence should not be celebrated. If only the Karate Bullfighter had dealt better with the issue of sexual violence, both by creating more emotional depth and recognition between the two characters involved, and leaving it all together, this would have been a much more interesting film.
