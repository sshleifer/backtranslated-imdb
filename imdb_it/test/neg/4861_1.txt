I would have liked to put 0.5 but unfortunately I can't. Who can write such bad screenplays (I saw the film five seconds and knew that the "bad guy" would be Sutherland - I had to pay his taxes, when you see how good he was in Redford's film, "Ordinary People" and others!). <br /> <br /> Although I don't like it, but I had no choice, I saw the film in French, but I know that hearing the real voices of Sheen, Sutherland and Hamilton wouldn't change things, except maybe make it more pitiful. <br /> <br /> What disgusts me is that people make their living doing these bad things (I forgot to mention Mr. Waterson, far from the Woody Allen films he once used to play in). <br /> <br /> We had another film about another French channel: a fool James Bond with Brosnan (I'm not talking about real Bond with Connery (please it's the end of the holidays, wake up!).
