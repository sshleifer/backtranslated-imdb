I found this a tremendously disappointing version of a fascinating story. I thought the acting was pretty good overall. Reginald Owen chewed the scenery, as mentioned by others, but found it moderately funny in his short scenes. TCM has made me a fan of Ann Harding, and I thought he was fine as usual here. Jessie Ralph had a field day like the old war ax, ordering everyone around, and Frank Morgan, as always, played Frank Morgan with a sparkle. <br /> <br /> For me, the problem was the script and / or editing - the transitions were awkward, the motivations were obscure. The film was too damn short to correctly convey the story! I was totally disappointed, especially since I had such fond memories of the next version.
