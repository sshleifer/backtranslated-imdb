First of all, the title has no relevance for the film. It started well with good development, but it became annoying when he couldn't tell his girlfriend what had happened to him. Even his attempt to tell the police failed, which only added to the value of annoyance. There were too many pregnant breaks in the film that seemed more laden than anything else worth it. The plot never revealed who committed this crime for him, although a good plot would have allowed the disclosure. The ending was nothing short of "hey we ran out of budget, let's stop it here NOW !!" ... If I had written a novel that ended this way, I would have won the top. TRASH TRASH TRASH !!
