"Revenge of the zombies" is a zombie effort that is quite weak and barely viable. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Traveling in the Bayou, Larry Adams, (Robert Lowery) and Scott Warrington, (Mauritz Hugo) are informed that a friend has died. Meeting with Dr. Von Altermann, (John Carradine), who repeats the idea that they died mysteriously. As they stand there, they realize that the help consists of zombies, reanimated dead people who are making offerings from their master. As the bodies accumulate, he reveals that he created the creatures for use in various experiments and everyone tries to stop it before it's too late. <br /> <br /> The good news: here there is very little. The opening is easily the best thing, given that he got many excellent grades. From where it begins, with the gruesome silhouettes that walk in the darkness to the revelations, this works wonders both for its mystery and for its fantastic images. The big one is a scene in which the creature emerges from a coffin in a long, slow and disturbing stroke. These are all done before the opening credits and it's a fun show. The scenes in the middle where the creature wakes up inside the coffin is pretty chilling and looks really great. The last big positive is the really fun ending. With that kind of ending that is reminiscent of Universal's many attempts, it adapts to that style. From the gruesome reanimation to the real action involved near the swamp, this is fun and really works with others to give its true positive sides. <br /> <br /> The bad news: this one has only a couple of flaws, but they are the most important. The first is the main boredom of the film from inactivity. Almost nothing happens here, mainly due to the tendency to do everything with talking rather than with anything else. There are only intermittent scenes relegated to the zombies, yet there is nothing here that dedicates an action to the film. This simply has no action, and this is what hurts the film. It rarely generates scenes that keep the interest alive, and sometimes this makes it feel much longer than it actually is. The last flaw in the film is the pathetic apologies for the zombies. Those used to more modern dishes will find it difficult to frighten these creatures, and in reality they only need different scenes. This one doesn't consider zombies as threats, making them even less scary. The non-invasive nature of the screen, the non-threatening nature and the non-modern behavior of these zombies really destroys this. These here are what really hurts the movie. <br /> <br /> The Final Verdict: With bad zombies and almost nothing worth watching, this one is a curious effort. Those accustomed to modern zombies will find little interest in this and will come out the same way as this, while only classic horror fans are invited to give it a shot. <br /> <br /> Rating PG-Today: Mild Violence
