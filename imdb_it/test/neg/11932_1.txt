This film is a cash movie. A cash on a wild theme melody created for a previous classic. Yul Brynner has long since skipped the ship and so has most of the production values. Lee Van Cleef takes the lead role of Chris. I can't think of any actor who looks less like Brynner than Van Cleef. Hey, he could at least have shaved his hair and lost his mustache, just for continuity reasons. Some correctional centers show this film to punish offenders. Step out of line and The Magnificent Seven Ride! it is brought to the fore and handled. They didn't even bother trying to make this movie look like a TV movie! Abysmal.
