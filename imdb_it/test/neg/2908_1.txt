This is horrible. No really, this is, without exception, the absolute worst ... the worst ... I also hesitate to call it an @ and $% in "_movie_". It is a ninety minute visual radical channel. The plot is practically non-existent: a mad scientist who looks like the frontman of "The Cars" impregnates a woman in his secret laboratory, a garden chair in what I think may be a garage, through an injection of Palmolive. In a few hours he hides an adult monster that then goes on a rampage. This is the whole movie. The scenes of death: these are poorly organized, take _forever_, and acting ... how can you ruin _screaming_ ?? The victims are there while the snarling, panting and congested growl advances on them and proceeds to stifle them in silence for about three days. The sets are poor, the lighting of most of the film consists of a single maglite (yes, a big flashlight), the sound quality is poor, there are only about 40 words of dialogue for the whole film and the acting it is generously described as wood. The film is shamelessly recycled to fill the film. And the special effects would make the BBC science-fiction production shake its head and proclaim "They haven't even tried it". The 'monster' is a bit nameless in a $ 3 Halloween rubber mask with some slapped bandages. In his encounter with the film's lone cop, the policeman shoots invisible, smokeless, invisible bullets that apparently travel so slowly that the monster can dodge it at five steps. Don't see this movie. No really, this is not courage. Don't see this movie. The director should be shot. The writer should be chained to a giant rock where his liver will be devoured every morning by Ed Wood. Just rent and there could be a sequel, don't let it happen!
