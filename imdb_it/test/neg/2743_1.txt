In the wake of the classic film, well received and loved, concerning the lives of adolescents as they headed towards adulthood, American Graffiti by George Lucas, we have Cooley High. An adaptation of a certain Eric Monte, co-creator of the popular 70s CBS sitcom Good Times. <br /> <br /> Cooley High was, and is, seen as a black version of American Graffiti. Instead of central California, as in American Graffiti, we have the black slum of Chicago Cabrini Green as a backdrop for the story here. In 1962, instead of America, Cooley High is set in 1964. Movie stars Welcome Back Kotter's, Lawrence Hilton Jacobs and Glynn Turman are the main protagonists of the film and its protagonists. He has Garrett Morris who plays the lead role trying to keep Jacobs and Turman's characters, called Coceise and Preach, in trouble for most of the time. <br /> <br /> You know, I'd like to say that Cooley High is a worthy piece of comparison for American Graffiti or that it's a great movie on its own but I can't. The problem is that the producers of the film could not or did not want to hide the sad lower part of the black life in America. Having the movie in the Cabrini Green part of Chicago doesn't help things. <br /> Not even the crass attempts at humor here. When Coceise looks for a letter of intent from a college, he finds that his little brother has thrown a toilet. When the gang visits the Chicago zoo, one of the gangs named Pooter, he has a manure thrown over him by a monkey. When Turman's character, Preach, is chased by two hooligans in the school haunt (a dirty and depressing place to eat less food than they meet), he opens the door to the girls' bathroom while a girl is lightening as she flees through the window of the same bathroom! The high school, the character houses, the bathrooms, almost everywhere in the film, shows the unfortunate aspect of urban decay and poverty. <br /> <br /> If that wasn't enough, there was a harsh display of humor in the film. The use of violence and vulgarity in the film. Cooley High could be a training film, but it's a tough and rough film of its age, with little or no wit and sympathy for the use of nostalgia that has made people love and love American Graffiti so much. <br /> <br /> Motown Records contributed to the making of the film. The company music was part of the soundtrack of the film. But even here you have the feeling of having the same old old man as you have listened to these songs a million times before. Not that they weren't great songs within themselves but black music, of that period was more than just Motown. Especially in Chicago. The song that approaches the end of the film, edited by the Spinners' G.C. Cameron, it wasn't all that impressive. There have been better Motown ballads that have been made, by Cameron's best Motown artists no doubt. <br /> <br /> The last part of the film shows where the characters went to pay tribute to the Cooley High movie aimed at being, American Graffiti. It shows that Preach, a clever but poor student, went to Hollywood and became a successful television writer. Eric Monte may have modeled himself as Turman's character. The last film in the film Preach runs away from Coceise's funeral, which took place on a dark and rainy afternoon, and all the desolation of Cooley High. Eric Monte, through Preach and that final scene, had a little lesson for us all watching Cooley High and the love of the past. Do not look back.
