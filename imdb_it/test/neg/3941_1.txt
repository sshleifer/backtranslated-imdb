Honestly, I was a big fan of the "Stay Alive" trailer when it was released a few months earlier. I kept telling my friend how this movie has a fantastic plot - and maybe a good movie. Anyway - this film is a little below my expectations. <br /> <br /> The plot has great potential, but as the story unfolds, along with acting, directing and bad CGI - this film is a disaster. The ghost makes no sense, including the killings - it's all too hasty, creating a sense of "unrealistic" in the mind of the public. <br /> <br /> This film could be scary for some viewers - but fear in the sense of shock (due to the sound effect, etc.) rather than enduring fear due to certain valid factors in the film. <br /> <br /> You should re-consider watching this movie.
