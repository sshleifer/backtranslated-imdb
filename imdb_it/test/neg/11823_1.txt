This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Writing and acting are just pathetic. He sits right there with Uncle Sam in the worst movies ever. However, when I see crap like these being able to make videos, it really inspires me to pursue my wild dreams of making films because I know I could do a better job than what the Killers producers did.
