Being a big fan of the three TV series, I was very interested to learn that LoG was moving to the big screen. In my most honest moments, however, I had my doubts about the probable success of the concept, and if the writers would be able to sustain the high level of humor, comedy and horror that infuse the original series. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, my fears were not unfounded and the film was a huge disappointment. I struggle to understand the other comments on this site. Of course, people have a right to their opinions, but the guys with whom I looked at them all agree with me, and they're big fans like me. <br /> <br /> Acting lacked conviction, but they are so good that even when they are not at their best, they are still highly watchable. The main problem was the plot - and the script. There was some laughter, but not enough, some moments of disgust, but not enough. The worst thing was the feeling of emptiness after leaving the cinema. So rarely did I feel so totally uninspired from a movie and so groundless to discuss it with others. <br /> <br /> I write this comment as a warning to other fans of the League - get a wide range of opinions on this film by first going to see it. If you love the League, you might be able to convince yourself that they haven't completely confused their move to the cinema. If you cannot convince yourself of this, then you will have obscured in your mind the otherwise immaculate genius that exemplifies the TV series. <br /> <br /> LoG at the cinema? More like the register. (or small brown fish).
