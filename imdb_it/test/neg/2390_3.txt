Even if it's not a complete waste of time, "eighteen" really wasn't as sweet as it claimed to be. Nor are the ages of the actors portraying ?? 18, my ass. McKellen could actually have appeared in the film telling us he was 30 and asking us to believe it. Even Michael J. Fox was more credible as a teenager in "Back to the Future", parts II and III (okay, maybe not: probably they are equal credibility). If you can overcome the obvious age defect, you will either have the complete emptiness to act or simply exaggerate (the so-called anxiety of Paul Anthony, the moments of Lifetime of Clarence Sponagle, and even if I prefer Brendan Fletcher, it is better to watch it and more , in 'Freddy Vs. Jason,') incomprehensible scenes (faster than the marriage of Britney Spears, incest to prove a point and a man who needs help to urinate, but still has a free hand? I think it was the fantasy of the writer,) a whole movie of despicable characters (Anthony could play someone who is 18, but behaves as if he were 12 and some strange "john" thrown so that the character of Anthony Pip can save the day ?? was there really a sex scene in front of a child?) and virtually every character questioning sexuality from strange actions / scenes. On the positive side, I liked the voice of Ian McKellen, seeing a straight / gay friendship (rarely well represented), puppy love (from someone collecting stuffed puppies, that is,) good score, some decent dialogue (I love the separation of gays and pedophilia, I want more people to understand it) and to act from female roles (and also from Cumming). Can't really recommend it because it really tries to be too much ?? tolerance gay, hustling gay, homeless, epic of the second world war, priesthood, first love, imperfect judges, etc. etc. etc. ?? with a reduced budget.
