As someone who loves the history of baseball, especially in the early 20th century when Cobb was a leading figure, along with a ton of colorful characters, I couldn't wait to see this baseball movie. Well, it wasn't a baseball movie, which was disappointing. No, it was just a sports journalist's story of being with Cobb in the baseball player's last years while the two collaborated on a book. Again, this could have been a more captivating film than they did. <br /> <br /> Grant Cobb was anything but a good guy, a very talented but brutal player in the fact that he would do anything to beat you. ... and he was sticky, intimidating and had a lot of demons to fight. He was so hated that his teammates tried to hinder his chances of winning a batting title a year. Nevertheless, this is an amazing portrait of man. It turns it into something almost a cartoon. <br /> <br /> Watching and listening to an old rant, rave and profane for two hours is entertainment? No it is not. One day, I'd like to see a real Cobb biographical film showing him in his run-off days and if they want to portray him as an evil man, so be it, but the way they did it here only with an old bitter, blasphemous man who gets an ass in front of a reporter is not fun to watch.
