The Emperor's New Groove was a big hit for Disney. It wasn't a musical! He had clean, fresh jokes and no political turns. It was just a damn movie. <br /> <br /> Kronk's Groove, on the other hand, is tired and weak. My 3-year-old still loves the Emperor's New Groove, but fell asleep during the Kronk period. There is really no conflict (which in the first film leads to all the extravagant adventures). Due to the lack of conflict, it seems as if the animators have thrown out the writers and simply made the plot as they went along. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for something to happen that made the movie fun. . . and still are.
