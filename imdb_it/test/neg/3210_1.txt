Now this is a real turkey from the overestimated director Franco, who gave us classics like "Las Vampiras / Vampyros Lesbos". Yes, I think bad movies can be a lot of fun. I love the hilarious screams of Doris Wishman, Dwain Esper and Ed Wood jr., But this proved too much for me. This is the first film I voted for 1. Where should I start? The script is at most idiotic. The dialogue is incredibly bad. The direction seems non-existent. The best musical inspiration (repeatedly used in this film) was taken directly from the film "Der Hexer" (1964). And it is AGAIN! Poor Shirley Eaton and George Sanders! In one shot Sanders reads a Popeye comic while his henchman tortures a girl (this aspect is probably the intellectual strength of this film). The only thing that has puzzled me is that Franco promptly showed female nudity whenever I thought the film would benefit from it - this is a real directing ability! However, I fear that a film in which the actors pretend to shoot with machine guns shaking them is not really worth it.
