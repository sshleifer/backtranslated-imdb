Of course, this film has been delayed. But you were expecting it from the moment you looked at the cover-box. It's a B movie, and on the T&A factor this movie was delivered. Honestly, it was more fun than expected. Although it was not at all a comic genius work, like "The Party Animal" or "Orgazmo", as far as B films are concerned, it was worth looking at, if you are still interested in this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Morally oriented Christians and parental groups, this is soft-core adult entertainment. If you don't want your children to see sexual content and nudity, then you should keep your children away from this movie.
