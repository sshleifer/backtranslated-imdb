Film based on the best-selling novel by Jacqueline Susann. This is Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) a ruthless TV presenter who makes his way to the top. He describes his love life focusing on Amanda (Jodi Wexler) and Judith (Dyan Cannon). He also shows his total inability to engage with anyone and instead sleeps with any woman he can get. <br /> <br /> The novel is not a work of art (it is not even good literature) but it is a quick, silly, light trash way. But this movie makes it look like "Gone with the wind"! This is a textbook example of how NOT to make a film adaptation. First they condense the novel terribly. The inability to commit Stone is addressed in the book and the why is revealed. Here he grew up ... and ignored. Also there is a really disgusting scene in which a woman is brutally beaten. It's in the book - but there's a reason totally left out of the movie. And the book had to do with three women - not two. Don't even get me started on homophobia. Adaptation Apart from acting is quite terrible. The law is just as horrendous as Stone - VERY wood and boring - you seriously wonder why all these women are chasing after him. To be honest with Law, another actor was chosen, but he had a very bad accident before filming began and Law intervened at the last minute. Wexler is as terrible as Amanda; Maureen Arthur is really incredibly bad as Ethel Evans; Shecky Greene is as unbearable as Christie Lane. Only three shows stand out: David Hemmings (who had a GREAT time) plays him as a gay photographer; Cannon is actually very good and Robert Ryan is just great. Dionne Warwick also sings the catchy opening song ("He's Moving On"). <br /> <br /> It is bad but I looked at it all and it is (in a stupid way) very funny. I'm giving a 3. <br /> <br /> Even Jacqueline Susann has a cameo as a journalist.
