This is a poor caricature of "Lonesome Dove" - ​​and Larry McMurtry. <br /> <br /> I love your books, with "Lonesome Dove" in the top three. I admired the way you see yourself, through your characters, with an honesty so resolute, balanced by never taking it too seriously. I am therefore spoiled. <br /> <br /> Why did you come to this? <br /> <br /> "Comanche Moon" is not up to your standards. I see you are credited with the script, but this is so different from you, I prefer to think it is written by someone else. <br /> <br /> Dialogue makes me claustrophobic, wanting someone to escape with a naturally stated sentence. The "genius" part was distressing. McCrae was unrecognizable - mostly because of the silly words that came out of his mouth. <br /> <br /> Well, I also miss Call. <br /> <br /> The most important missing factors are Gus and Call and men are: their concrete courage; the underlying vein composed of ethics and honesty; their lack of self-delusion. Hard men lead a hard life with a certain undeniable grace. <br /> <br /> Some blame must bind themselves to the hard-working direction here and everywhere. The whole cast needed dialect and dialogue training. <br /> <br /> As I try to imagine Robert Duvall as McCrae, talking about this same dialogue, it comes off better - but not much. Try to look like a cowboy-of-few-words shy, sly-ghyn witty, but can't do it halfway ... <br /> <br /> How can it be so different from "Lonesome Dove"? Could the writer have forgotten his characters? You tricked some people, Mr. McMurtry, but not this one.
