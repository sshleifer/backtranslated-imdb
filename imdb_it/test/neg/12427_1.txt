I think this is one of those few films that I want to evaluate as low as possible just to make it a compliment. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie in about 25 years, so I can really talk a lot about it. It still seems very hard to find on video. But I remember that my brother and I came across somewhere in the toxic UHF television mix late at night in the mid-1980s when I was about 10 years old. So I've never seen the beginning of the film, but I've seen most of it. The first thing I remember is that this couple is sneaking out of a campsite and rowing towards an island to be discovered, and then being attacked by a mad henchman in a kilt with an ax! They flee from him but are attacked by the Loch Ness monster, which in this film is just a head and a neck without a body. The monster's eyes and mouth don't even move, it looks like a pi√±ata. <br /> <br/> I mean that I had never seen anything so big before and it completely upset me. I saw some bad movies on TV in the early 1980s but I had never seen anything so totally inept and so casually and thoughtlessly constructed that it seemed as if the people who did it spent less time and effort on it than we did watched. I had already seen some of the Troma movies and the kind of things that were purposely trying to be "campy", but this was pure and real stuff and it was my first encounter with a really bad movie. This film was like the last jolt of the drive-in era and I caught it just in time. Actually when we were watching, we couldn't understand if it was made in the 50s or 70s. Turns out he came out only a few years before I saw him. <br /> <br /> I later came into contact with the Mystery Science Theater and discovered many of the old movies and TV series B, but I had already seen it in this movie. The movie is so funny that I never even laughed so much at the Monty Python crew or at Bill Murray or any comedian. After watching this movie, I always tried to look for "good bad" movies and involved many of my friends. But this film was and basically is impossible to find. I never really found out what Larry Buchanan was or was until the 1990s, when IMDb took off from IMDb and the Internet took off and the information started to be transmitted. But this film has yet to be discovered by many others who might appreciate its transcendental qualities. Look for it.
