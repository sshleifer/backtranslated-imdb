In the cold and gruesome early 90s, a show called "Family Matters" aired and became an instant classic. The trick was to buy a manual in standard family situations and their solutions and insert some attempts at sarcastic remarks in it and you had yourself a delightful little theft-is-wrong, parents-are-show-right. So it worked, so Bickley-Warren had an ambitious new plan: to make the same show the same. <br /> <br /> But here is the difference: "Family matters" had Urkel. "Step By Step" has the guy from those "Kickboxers" - nobody saw anyone. He says things like "dudette" and "the Dane-meister", and somehow the public should still not hate him. I mean seriously, "dudette"? How can you get it on your lips? <br /> <br /> The rest of the people were mostly white versions of the whole Winslow deck, combined with other one or zero size characters, like the dumb guy (JT. Well, Eddie), the smart girl (Laura), and a cute girl who spends her days in a nice way (in theory). The development of the character was simply horrible in this show. Grover and The Cookie Monster have more depth than the Lambert family. Everyone has simply taken their stereotypes for what they were worth. They were not worth much. <br /> <br /> Powered by a huge ribbon of laughter stolen from something funny, this show was broadcast for 7 years, which was humiliating for the competition. We will have to note that this is the time when family sitcoms were practically all big hits, everyone just ignored their crap because, back in the 90s, another crappy show didn't hurt.
