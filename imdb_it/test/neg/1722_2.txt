'Tycus' is almost as bad as a sci-fi movie can go. <br /> <br /> I can barely find anything good to say about this movie. The premises are completely wrong. A comet is supposed to hit the Moon and cause catastrophic damage to the Earth, but no one believes the scientist who predicts it. An entire underground city plus a nuclear missile launch pad is built in the mountains of California without anyone noticing. When the comet approaches the Earth, the news arrives on TV and newspapers just a day before the event. And so on, and so on ... <br /> <br /> Not even any kind of emotion comes on the screen. The genius who discovers the comet and builds the underground city as a savior of humanity or a beast? The director or Dennis Hooper who plays the role does not seem to have decided until the film was made, and in reality it makes no difference because acting and directing is so confusing that you finish by asking yourself what you feel to say this movie. The special effects are so cheap that not only can they not be convincing in the era of computerized effects, but they could not have been convincing even in the 1950s, four decades before this film was made. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time.
