Although promoted as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur cast, Ice-cream, I Scream is more like a caricature of sincerity. <br /> <br /> The plot opens with Ali's dream, a traveling ice cream seller in a city of western Anatolia, where success is seen with the same marketing methods as the great ice cream parlors. He dreams of playing in the TV commercial of his product with beautiful models in bikinis, dancing around him. While his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gigantic wife, who refuses to have sex with him for 6 years for no apparent reason. Is it because he is not successful in his work? Apparently, because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global ice cream companies. But this is what he says; in reality we do not see him suffer so much: he still sells well traveling to nearby villages while his apprentice remains at the shop, selling ice cream to the people of the city. Ali blames large companies for the use of sweetening and coloring agents while using "sahlep" (powdered roots of mountain orchids). Ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a street vendor and advertises a local television channel that prefers to broadcast the bulletin in local dialect. His wife does not like his ways of doing business, they always fight, and Ali threatens to be able to do very bad things in a moment of frenzy. <br /> <br /> On a very successful day, his bad bike is stolen by bad kids in the city. In search of his stolen bike, Ali goes to the police, blames the big companies for theft, but, of course, nobody takes him seriously. Annoyed by his wife's annoyance, Ali goes to a tavern and gets drunk. One of his friends at his table, an aspiring socialist of the city, gives an educational and critical discourse on globalism and, without a real connection, jumps to the theme of global freezing. Ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison. His wife wakes up and prevents him. An old neighbor takes him for a night walk and advises him about life. According to him, Ali can even sell hot sahlep drinks if the world is faced with global freezing. When he returns home, we suddenly see that his wife has understood his worth, treating him like a hero and praising his manhood. Meanwhile, the thieving boys got sick by eating too much ice cream. They confess to the doctor that they stole Ali's bike. Ali forgives them and the happy end arrives. <br /> <br /> Although the plot may seem promising in a sense, it is the story that makes this film insincere and trivial. First of all, the director does not show much effort to tell the story visually; everything is based on dialogues. And the dialogues never stop showing us that cinema is actually a visual art. Even Ali's problems are not convincing because we don't see it, we understand it from his words. The director commercializes his film as a fair fight of Ali against the great ice cream parlors, but there is nothing in the film about the big companies. We don't see their pressure enough. The film actually ridicules Ali for believing that big companies are behind theft. And when his bike is found, he solves every problem: Ali becomes a happy and powerful husband. Not a real criticism of globalism. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film is poor for its crude humor. Perhaps the people of that part of Turkey are swearing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily lives, but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a movie fun. I could have accepted it if they were both vulgar and "intelligent", but they are not clever jokes at all, they are simply cheesy. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe the American people could appreciate the oriental version of the American Pie style humor. But American Pie has never had any claim to be an Oscar candidate, or to have a political message! If you think you can just laugh at seeing a man's big erection in his shorts (and we had to put up with this joke twice!) Or an old woman from a village who said "f ** k you", then you might find this movie funny .
