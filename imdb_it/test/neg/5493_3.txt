The best in the middle, when most of the characters get angry and chases someone they never had before. It is around this point that we can see the majestic breasts of Susan Sarandon (though through a veil). Strangely, Beverly D'Angelo who is not shy about nudity does not show at all, while Aida Turturro ?? of all the people ?? it does. On the other side of the spectrum, the less he talks about Walken playing a homosexual, the better. The film itself has little plot; dialogues from theatrical play and "normal" dialogues often intersect and this is not the kind of thing I would consider a good idea. Life in the theater: who cares? From time to time the dialogue has something to do, but the film drags on at times.
