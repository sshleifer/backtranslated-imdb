I always try not to be tough while I criticize something I don't like, but after seeing this mini series I was so disappointed that it couldn't help my irritation. On the one hand, it is true that the series remained faithful to the novel and obviously I found it very beautiful, but on the other hand a terrible casting, a mediocre acting, especially of key characters ?? like Funny Price, the impression of a theatrical performance, I mean the theatrical way of acting, irritates you from the beginning to the end. I'm sure that with this budget, even if it was low, something much better and more useful could have been done. it is up to you to watch this series, but personally I don't advise you to spend your time in this disappointing ecranization.
