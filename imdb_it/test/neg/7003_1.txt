It is hard to believe that a film can be so bad, but you live and learn. What is more surprising is the fact that the people who put this together probably had a university education. Meanwhile, the fruit of their work exposes the appearance of something that a group of five third-graders might have devised. On the positive side, (if there is one) the soundtrack has some good moments, which is another reason to wonder how the rest of the film can be so horribly bad.
