A good friend of mine said: "A monkey is fun, always and everywhere." There is an exception: GOING BANANAS. It's simply the worst movie I've ever seen. It's worse than PLAN 9, worse than THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS. It's terrible. The talking gag monkey ages after about three minutes and believe me it's all there is. Make sure you have a group of people around to revive you after joining TOXIC SHOCK from GOING BANANAS, the worst movie ever.
