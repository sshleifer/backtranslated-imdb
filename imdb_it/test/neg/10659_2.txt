The rhythm of this film is rather slow. It takes about 70 minutes to bring Katie to China (which we know she will do) and leave 30 minutes to get things done. The plot is so predictable that you know everything after about 5 minutes. Nothing surprises you. I imagine the film is a training film, but the film is full of stereotypes that are somewhat exaggerated: <br /> <br /> Katie - A beauty that realizes that looks, kids and shopping are not everything. He realizes that she can "hear" and "see the real world". Touching. <br /> <br /> The mother - tall, nervous, screaming mother (very innovative wow) who needs to take care of a strong man. <br /> <br /> The father - patient and always understanding and caring for the incapable woman. <br /> <br /> The guy who just wants to get into his pants. <br /> <br /> The Chinese comedian clown boy who doesn't know how to speak English correctly and made a rice broth. Thought Hollywood dropped those characters in the mid-fifties. <br /> <br /> The nurse who sometimes knows everything about how to move in China that in the next instant is a carbon copy of La madre, that is, a woman who cannot manage the situation or knows anything. <br /> <br /> The deformed Chinese girl who with the help of us Westerners gets help and becomes a beautiful girl. Because in China (a third world country according to the film) it has nothing and therefore needs our charity. Gah, wake up and smell what you're shoveling. <br /> <br /> Sure there is a bit of poverty in China, but the portrait of aid from Western countries (US law) is so superficial and happy-ish that it is sad and disgusting. Shanghai (where the film is set) is the most expanding and evolving city in the world at the moment. <br /> <br /> The Chinese father who is so kind and generous that he eventually has a desire ... to be a cowboy with a white hat ... <br /> <br /> The teacher (Sean Astin) who has this story of jerking (not) that he says without hearing. Why Sean? WHY!? <br /> <br /> Etc etc. It is difficult to find a "real" person in the whole film. <br /> <br /> This is nothing but a good movie for Americans under 15. If you want to learn something about the world look at Hotel Rwanda instead. For a better life story or training film I suggest you watch the Italian "Cinema Paradiso" which won the best foreign film academy rewarded a few years ago. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the film was the small urban scenes that really capture some (not all) of the beautiful Chinese countryside. I was there and saw a little.
