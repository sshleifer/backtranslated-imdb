Eh. I watch this movie in class because someone recorded it and brought it. I expected some half-attempt to portray the myths of Herakles, and since the commercials looked serious, I was expecting something that was halfway. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes into the film, I realized that it was absolutely CRAP. The only things in the film that are halfway true to the myth are the minimum (and I mean the bare) minimum. Parents, siblings and labors seemed to be named correctly. Apart from that, the rest of the film seemed to be a gigantic inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> I would say it wasn't much better than the Disney version of the film. The Disney version was created for small children, so it wasn't too serious. This film, with all the sex, violence and nudity, was clearly intended for an older audience, however the story presented in this was almost as inaccurate as the Disney movie.
