What a stupid waste of money! 30,000 square feet of rebuilt ancient Rome, 2 million cubic meters of 50 foot tall buildings, 10,000 costumes, 2 years of work, a committee of ancient international history (sic!), Some first class actors and actresses. The final result? An empty TV movie for a single digit IQ presence.
