Compared to other "sand and sandal" rates, the Egyptian leaves much to be desired. The film is very FANTASTIC based on the well-studied novel by Mika Waltari, focusing on the adventures of the Egyptian doctor Sinhue at the court of Akhnaton and on his travels in Canaan, Minoan Crete and Africa. Unfortunately, due to the moral criticism of the time, much of Sinhue's history (which is full of romantic and sexual stories) remains on the cutting room floor and instead, the audience is treated with reels and reels of Victor's wooden acting. mature. Even Gene Tierney ?? a protagonist "staple" of the time ?? he fails to look or do his best in this film and gives a rather somnambulant performance that can only be justified by the fact that at the time the actress was having serious psychiatric problems. There is a great deal of rhetoric and theological machinations on the idea of ​​monotheism against polytheism, but Michael Wilding is as tiring as the revolutionary Akhnaton, who is surely encouraging someone to break away from him and restore the old religion before the second reel. My advice: buy the book from E-Bay, rent something more fun like Solomon and Sheba and then call it for a night!
