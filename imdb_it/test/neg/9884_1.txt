This film was boring. Very similar to Underworld, only less interesting. It's not so much a werewolf movie, nor is it close to a horror movie. The main couple was boring. I didn't care at all about Vivian and Aiden. And there was so little development of the character that I didn't care about any character in the movie. The plot was very thin. The transformations were practically nil. I liked the wolves themselves, I could have also made a documentary about the wolf, I would have loved it. I would not recommend this movie. I didn't find it funny or interesting. It drags on and everyone in it is a boring resistance. This movie could win a prize for how not to make a werewolf movie.
