Ask not to watch this movie ... Start with a promise and, as you continue, you want the movie to end ... Predictable, not funny, wasted movie ... Save time and watch better thrillers. ... The synopsis sounds good and that's why I watched the movie ... But it was too predictable with nothing to give you a start ... No great suspense .. no fantastic direction ... nothing phenomenal with acting. .. avoid this ... low rating ... Nothing to write about this film, so I'm filling the remaining lines of text so you can imagine how long this movie is ... really annoyed at how good a premise it was and how much bad was written by a script ...
