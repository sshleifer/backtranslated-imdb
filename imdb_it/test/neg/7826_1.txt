The story is disjoint and badly written. We are given some wires and a possible connection in act one, only to see it fade away. If the writer had taken the trouble to read his work carefully, it would have been obvious that the initial problem of Madsden's character and the encounter with the "bad" girl suggest that there will be a troubled alliance between them as they try to solve his problem. <br /> <br /> The problem is not going anywhere. The relationship is not going anywhere. And there is no sexual tension in any of the relationships. Nobody digs anyone and nobody is attractive. Writing and directing are ridiculous. You can hear someone struggling with chaos and shift the focus of the story on trying to extract some excitement. There is nobody. The writer / director is simply a beginner whose confused efforts have somehow become a movie. From simple errors like "... have taken polaroid ..." - in Japan in 2007? to insult errors such as nakedness for eroticism, this film is an insult. You can't make them much worse. <br /> <br /> And by putting "Madsden" on the talent list, the producers thought they would have some success. He's barely acting. Asia is certainly ... and the result is a panto eroin-chic. <br /> <br /> Give it a big miss.
