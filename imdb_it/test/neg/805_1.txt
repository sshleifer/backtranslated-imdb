Drab, sad and a total waste of my time. The plot is incomprehensible (so don't think about it too much). The acting is weird and wooden - I could have sworn that they were all professional body builders trying their luck at acting, but that could be an insult to body builders. There are no interesting special effects to redeem this disaster, but a lot of fires, explosions, a free sex scene, etc. The only thing that caught my attention is that it takes place after a war between the United States and Iraq that somehow becomes nuclear. ..hmmm. Is Roger Corman psychic? We hope that "Iraq" was only a lucky choice for Corman and that the rest of his scenario does not come true. <br /> <br />
