This is an excruciatingly slow and boring film. We can feel sympathy for the socially and sexually inexperienced and embarrassing Tomek, but Magda's motives are rather hard to see, and the ending, at least for me, was inscrutable. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's about how we all need love, but I'd like to get more from a good Busby Berkeley. <br /> <br /> I was told that the comments must be at least ten lines, so I will add that in the background there are some interesting shots of the relationship between Polish citizens and government employees and institutions. I wonder if it should represent this before or after the fall of the communist government. <br /> <br /> Finally, look at the clever way in which the men of the gas company investigate whether or not there is a gas leak in the Magda stove.
