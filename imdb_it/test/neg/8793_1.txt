I just understood why the colors and the sets of "Sakuran" were so flashy and gaudy, and simply painful to watch. The story is about a high class prostitute known as an oiran in Japanese. Their kimonos were always more conspicuous and showy than the other kimonos, so that the aranan would stand out. But the director, Mika Ninagawa, had to make sure that the director distinguished himself even more from the main character, or even from the story. <br /> <br /> What Anna Tsuchiya did in the film gave me the creeps. You can't call it acting. It was nothing more than satisfying his huge and high school fan. Hey Anna, good luck with that when you get older. Yes, right, an oiran like a coarse and vulgar biker chick, prone to violence. Have we not already seen you portray this character in a more appropriate film? <br /> <br /> The story was painfully boring and predictable. What is the story of "Sakuran"? A hateful little bitch always remains true to herself that is precisely this: an unpleasant bitch. He discovers that, inexplicably, men are attracted to her and that she has an inexplicable ability to manipulate men and becomes a successful, classy prostitute, even if she speaks and behaves as if she were a member of a motorcycle gang. We talk about this so-called seductive ability, but we never see it in action, probably due to the ineptitude of the main, fake-cyclist-biker, I mean "actress". <br /> <br /> The main character in the film angers a rich and powerful man because she keeps him waiting while a much more modest client is needed. Not much oirano, right? Why would such a woman ever become an oiran? Oh, because the previous oiran got himself killed and the house needed a whore that could demand a high price. Who would pay a high price for such a cheap slut? The voices go around. How could there be repercussions on what he did to the powerful? Because the writers are sweets. They just made a lot of shit. <br /> <br /> Then an even richer and more powerful guy falls in love with her (why?) and she throws him for a penniless boy who is generally cold and distant towards her but Respect to who he really is (which It doesn't make sense. How can you respect someone so useless? Speaking of crap, it's as if the director had crouched and taken a huge dump of psychedelic color on the aesthetics, culture and society of the Edo period. What about things like sabi, unknowing mono, wabi, subtlety, elegance, a rigidly hierarchical society? All taken by a director who presents himself as a senseless, nouveau-riche parvenu. The surprising thing is that many other Japanese, watching this film, crouched around the director and took steaming spoons of this smelly, colored shit and exclaimed how tasty it was. <br /> <br /> Argentine tango music with violin and bandoneon as a backdrop for the Edo period when Japan was totally isolated from the international world (except for the 3.7 acres of Dejima)? Why not just have Anna, the bad-life biker oahan, answer her cell phone and the rich and powerful Daimyo character escape into a hiss in his red Ferrari? The music we had to listen to was disconcerting and anachronistic (the same as artistic design). <br /> <br /> Near the end, I liked that there were only two or three small flowers on the cherry tree in the sanctuary. But first, the second said he would leave the dwellings when it blossomed, we all knew exactly what would happen. What a bore, to wire the ending so clearly. But what is the point of the old tree that blooms? That rich and powerful boy has already made the palate of cherry blossoms bloom like the Yoshino mountains in the spring. Didn't that affect her at all? No of course not. I already know about whores. The boys who treat them well are kicked in the balls. Perhaps it annoys the whores because people idealize them when they themselves know the truth of who they are: only cheap and worthless. <br /> <br /> Considering the director's obsession with the goldfish, the penultimate scene would have had a bowl of goldfish on a veranda accidentally fell. Two fish fall into a stream that takes them away to escape the walls of pleasure quarters, watching how the goldfish are stuck in their bowl and cannot survive outside (just like the denizen's relationship with places of pleasure) . Otherwise the discourse on the fate of goldfish has no meaning. <br /> <br /> In the final scene the cherry trees were in full bloom, but the brevity of the blooms is a special thing for cherry blossoms. I could not help but think that soon the twilight would have swept away all the soft pink color and the warmth of the scene. The sky would have passed quickly from signs of shadow, into ever deeper darkness, and the night would have fallen. It would become cold, very cold. It is dark. It really wasn't a happy ending, was it? Romantic love (in the Edo period?) It could survive in the face of terrible poverty and be ostracized for about the time these cherry trees bloomed. Maybe a couple of days, unless it rained first. But the romantic love not consumed that we see here? Its existence in this period is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Does Anna Tsuchiya walk as an oiran? She couldn't do it. Literally. Watch the scene of his "promenade" where he seems to have the right shoes, but she has to hold on to a boy's shoulder to keep it from falling on her ass. <br /> <br /> I was going to give this film two stars for the art direction but then I understood what it was: the ill-feeling domain on the part of the director. Those colors and sets are just like the director shouted, "I'm the most important here! Me! It's all about me !!!!"
