I remember when I first heard of Jack Frost. I was in Video Ezy in Miranda with my family on a monthly video hiring tradition. It was at this time that I found the courage to venture into the horror section of the store. Flipping through the various titles, I finally met Jack Frost. The cover was enough to convince me that the film was beyond my visual pleasures. Years later the film disappeared, only to be replaced by the inevitable but useless sequel. I ventured once more into the horror section and took the case just to reach a conclusion: would the film be scary ?? but not intentionally. <br /> <br /> Jack Frost 2: Revenge Of The Killer Mutant Snowman (a nice title) follows where the predecessor was abandoned. Sheriff Sam is looking for advice after his tests and Jack is now in the form of antifreeze. To escape his past, Sam and his wife make their way to a hotel on the island, where they find themselves in the company of a wide range of slasher film stereotypes including female busty models, big-headed sports athletes and personal Caribbean. However, Jack is released from his liquid grave and returns to his icy methods. He heads for the island and proceeds to kill anyone who can experience an extraordinary death. Only Sam can stop it. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that this is a straight-to-video movie, so it's meant to be bad. But this is terrible even in the eyes of other top films. Camera operation is poor, using a camera that could make a soap opera majestic. Half of the actors seem to come out of a porn movie and the other half seems to have come out of a nursing home, but in reality they came out of an asylum. There is a wide use of special effects used in the film, which tends to alternate between a bland puppet and a CGI that can be improved by a child, and the scenes of death are mostly off-screen and show us little of what is happened to the unfortunate but deserving victims. But the film is the most memorable for his deadly jokes like "There is something that needs a little Christmas filling" and "I know I declare you officially dead!" Ultimately, the whole purpose of a film like this is to make a popcorn movie for those boring Friday nights and even this one fails. Making a sequel to a movie that was a bad slasher with a concept that a child would find incredible would have to get on the nerves of steel ?? or a total frontal lobotomy. To the director Michael Cooney ?? Thanks for making me waste time. For all the others ?? avoid like arsenic.
