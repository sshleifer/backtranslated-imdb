Films on the banal are often the most interesting of all the films for me, in the hands of a perceptive artist who examines all the small twisted details of the banal. French cinema often seems to be very good at this kind of thing, and I love French cinema. <br /> <br /> This film was about banal. He didn't have much of a storyline. They were just characters who lived in a city, very normal people, and things that just happened. But it was not very interesting stuff, and it was not examined very perceptively. The film captured a bit of a mood, but it wasn't a particularly captivating mood. And even if I can't think much about the fact that the movie has made a specific mistake, it has failed practically at every level to do something right. <br /> <br /> There were many characters in this movie. Many of them looked the same, so it was difficult to understand who was who and what was their relationship to one another. I don't care about devoting a little effort to understanding a film, or even watching a particularly complex film more than once to smooth out the details, but this was a puzzle that wasn't worth solving for me. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can really say about this film is that the cinematography was pleasant, functional, not brilliant, but pleasant. The camera often captured some nice postcard photos. But he rarely found the small details really interesting. <br /> <br /> I have seen a handful of not very good films so far at the Seattle International Film Festival, but this was the only one that failed to get any applause when the credits were launched. I felt a great collective sigh when the film was finally finished. But I suppose there are probably some people who would like to. <br /> <br /> 4/10
