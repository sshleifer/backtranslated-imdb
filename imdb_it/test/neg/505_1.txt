Now infamous Western who was (in his time) the biggest disaster in the budget in Hollywood history. I was "lucky" enough to see the full 220-minute version in a theater in 1990. It was really amazing how BAD was the movie! <br /> <br /> They had an exceptional cast, a story based on a real accident (a struggle between foreigners and Americans in the 1800s), magnificent landscapes ... so what went wrong? Three words: director Michael Cimino. He was so full of himself after "The Deer Hunter" that he came out and made this god a horrible Western. It is not totally to blame. His previous film "The deer hunter" was considered a masterpiece and United Artists gave him free reign to do anything. They left him all alone ... and everything went wrong. The cost went out of control and Cimino insisted on repeating the sequences again and again until they were perfect. <br /> <br /> First of all, the sound is horrible. They pass whole sequences and can't make out a word that the characters are saying. For example, the Jeff Bridges character is presented during a dance sequence, but I STILL have no idea who he was! Dialogue in its introductory scene is incomprehensible! This is the director's fault - he should have made sure that the dialogue could be heard. Some scenes are filmed with so much dust that it flies around you barely understanding what is happening. The plot doesn't make much sense and Cimino took great liberties with the facts - only one person was killed in the true story - Cimino turns it into a massacre. There are some certainly beautiful sequences here totally destroyed by the lack of incomprehensible stories and dialogues. Even the bad sound wasn't the theater's fault - all the prints sound this way. <br /> <br /> This garbage actually closed United Artists and was the end of Cimino's career. A textbook example of a director so full of himself that he doesn't realize what he's doing. Jeff Bridges said this is the worst movie I've ever made. This is from a guy who did "Tron"! A must-see. <br /> <br /> There is a nice book called "The Final Cut" which describes the whole disaster. This becomes a 1. I wish IMDb had negative numbers - this deserves it!
