I managed to avoid reading Hemingway in college. From what I have been able to say, together with his reductivist verbosity, he offered reductive narrative lines. This film transfiguration of AF2A in a simplistic, rogue and careless narrative does not distract me from my suspicions: a boy who barely sees an action on the European battlefield (Hudson) falls with a nurse (Jones) and conspire to spend time together. Was Hemingway's great contribution to fiction the romantic travelogue? Who knows what these two lovers have in common? They are so generic. The film never brings up the absolute irresponsibility it takes to leave the front in favor of a lover's adventure. The two have a season in the Alps, directly from a catalog by J. Crew. A number of better scenes are undermined by a conventional and conventional melodrama elsewhere. The film continues to accumulate tiny, unlikely and non-specific details that fight epic treatment. The cavernous hospital where Miss Barkley works is practically empty, so that no secondary plot can possibly distract from the weak main story. Complicated, it is not. <br /> <br /> Camera work is better than average, with some fantastic position photographs. The director Charles Vidor (or maybe Huston?) Does surprising things in the first hour with a panoramic camera, on the spot ... there are no cop-outs of the second unit. Vidor shows huge panoramic tableaux, panoramic on a row of hundreds of soldiers who wander among the mountains; and then with a 90-degree swivel of his camera he reaches Hudson's ambulance that rages on him. <br /> <br /> Hudson looks fantastic. He is a better actor than the one to whom he attributes the merit, but with a material not shaped like this, he can become very mechanical. Mercedes McCambridge plays a one-dimensional shrew. Jennifer Jones is swollen and misplaced in the lackluster female lead. The film is the best when it's off screen. The love scenes are as interesting as those of a cafe.
