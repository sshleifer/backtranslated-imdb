I'm writing it 10 minutes from the end of the film. I feel comfortable writing it now, because unfortunately I know exactly how this film will end. <br /> <br /> The premise is quite simple, rabid dog in a small town, kills people. Fantastic - simple plot for a horrible horror of the field very funny. <br /> <br /> Uhh ..no. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that it is based on a book (Stephen King) and you can say that it should not have been adapted to the film, at least not with the same storyline. Why? Because it's boring! The first 45 minutes try to increase the depth of the main characters and create suspense. However it lasts too long (half of the movie!) - the characters are unlikely and we never take care of them anyway, and creates almost zero suspense. The simplest film (according to the plot and the time) to compare this with the classic Jaws. Everything that Jaws does, Cujo is wrong. Jaws has created good characters and a genuine sense of terror. Cujo doesn't do either. The jaws effectively create a disturbing, terrifying evil in his shark. Cujo has a dirty San Bernardo running to growl and jump, and not much else. Jaws is exciting and unpredictable. Cujo is a tireless boredom that remains predictable until the end. <br /> <br /> Also confusing is the plethora of subplots that behave like boring red arids for the main plot of the film. <br /> <br /> If this film was rewritten for the big screen and had a better director that could have been good. But it wasn't. It was a waste of 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The people here say this is one of the King's best adaptations - I'm sorry you couldn't be more wrong. The fog is a hundred times better, the thinner is 10 times better and even the one with cats is twice as good! This in my opinion is one of the worst! The only positive thing was that the action scenes with the dog seemed real, even though they were boring. <br /> <br /> The movies were running out now, and it wasn't better. To avoid.
