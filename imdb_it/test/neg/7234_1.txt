Greetings, spectators! As I watch Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the genus Octopus / Croc / Dino Horror. Many viewers can blame the poor acting, the senseless script or the poorly constructed plot like the reasons that cause the OCD film to be in danger. These reasons can actually be problematic factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD film that is at the center of the lameness. <br /> <br /> You see, the technology does not yet exist to make it realistic, the full-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by the studios do not have the ability to integrate perfectly with the real world environments and characters. Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the semi-dark sea / forest / semi-dark cave / semi-dark corridor so many times before the science fiction fan is bored completely with the genre 'OCD subgenus, that is). <br /> <br /> What can you do, ask? I would not suggest that the genre surrenders to generosity, but another way must be explored. We can't really go back to the days of the "Fade to Black" signal that someone was killed. Or can we? If we fail to achieve the goal of realism, we must compensate in other ways, such as twists, insinuations and photo-ingenuity. <br /> <br /> It will be through ingenious and alternative methods that the lameness disease, so common to the OCD subgenre, will be treated.
