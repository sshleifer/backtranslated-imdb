Live version of Dragonball via Taiwan. <br /> <br /> The evil lord comes to earth to obtain the seven magic spheres of the dragon ... pearls that when brought together make a dragon appear and fulfill your desires. A lot of action and bad comedy ensues. <br /> <br /> What can I say that "the best way to watch this movie is with many drunk but witty friends" no? I do not know. This is really bad but fun in the way they can really be bad movies. Come on, this is one of the few martial arts movies I've ever seen where the wires are seen. It's a live cartoon and it's not so far from what I've seen of the show that makes me scary for the big American version of the budget that's running. <br /> <br /> If you have drunk friends and you feel like picking up a movie, see this movie. If you see him sober (like me) avoid him.
