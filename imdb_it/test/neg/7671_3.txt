My Take: The most foolish of the AIRPORT films, and probably one of the worst films of the 70s. <br /> <br /> How to milk the franchise with all it has, the producers of this third AIRPORT sequel launches in more action, silly sub-themes, free star appearances and more funny elements. In his attempt to be the biggest AIRPORT yet, CONCORDE: AIRPORT '79 is the worst so far, and probably one of the worst films of the '70s disaster. With its bad box office results, it's no wonder the genre has outgrown its welcome. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a rather catchy score by Lalo Schifrin supported by some impressive shots of the plane's former glory (the same plane used in this film would have been involved in an accident in July 2000 ). But then the credits appear, and we can take a look at the "all-star" cast, which is not composed of faded Hollywood stars, television actors and B actors who are not too famous. The plot is more silent than ever: George Kennedy is back in the role of Joe Patroni, now a Concorde pilot (co-piloted by co-pilot Alain Delon) en route to France after the Summer Olympics. On board is journalist Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely), who has just discovered that her fianc√©, famous arms manufacturer Kevin Harrison (Robert Wagner), sells his weapons to the terrorist. To keep her from revealing the news to the world, Harrison sends his most advanced missiles and the best saboteurs to prevent the Concorde from landing. <br /> <br /> Casts / subplots are dumber than ever, even more foolish than an alcoholic Myrna Loy or a singer nun. We have Cicely Tyson carrying a living human heart in a cold room (!), Martha Raye as a woman with a bladder condition (and the character does not go deeper than that), J.J. Walker a smoker saxophonist (probably the most annoying character in the film), Eddie Albert married to "old" wife Sybil Danning, Avery Schreiber as Russian coach with a deaf daughter and finally, a love story between journalist Jon Davidson and gymnast Andrea Marcovici (very keen looking at the eye of coach Mercedes McCambidge). Moreover, the film becomes much closer to the LOVE BOAT episode than ever with the more silent cameos of Charo (and his pet Chihuahua) and Bibi Anderson. Fans of the field will undoubtedly have a real kick-in-the-balls in this stupid voice in a long series of films about the disasters of the 70s. This is, in more than a sense of the word, a real disaster. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: * 1/2 out of 5.
