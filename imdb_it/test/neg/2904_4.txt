I remember capturing this movie on one of the Showtime channels. What stands out for me is that this film takes place entirely in Phoenix, Arizona. I come from there, so I can easily locate the premises. <br /> <br /> Regardless, a ninja kills a scientist, because he wears yellow sweaters and golf, which is pursued by the police. It takes about half the police to bring it down and when they kill it, there are no bullet wounds. Her spirit still lives when a woman finds her and touches her katana. From that moment on, she is periodically possessed and kills police officers who killed the original ninja. Then another ninja from Japan comes to kill the evil ninja. This could be a plot device from the previous two films, or maybe a hole in the plot. All I know is that this movie is very campy, bad and funny. This is something to look at with a tub of popcorn, and several friends and give him the MST3K treatment.
