First of all just to say that I didn't have the edition I thought I was doing - I chose the Italian version compared to R2, but what actually arrived was an English version from 1998 - which claims to be a special edition - I never knew there was DVD release in the UK - but the promised biog was not actually on the record - just a couple of trailers. However - as far as the film itself is concerned - just as I was recovering from "Night TRain Murders" my second genital mutilation thriller appears in the same month - this time in (an Italian) female students from the United Kingdom are fired and teacher Fabio Testi - (unhappy) married but nailing one of his students - becomes the main suspect. Joachim Fuchsberger is the detective on the case. I'm sorry to say that I was less than ecstatic. It was watchable but more than equally impeccable and, apart from the already gruesome nature of the crime, the "surprise" of the killing of Cristina Galbo that had been "spoiled" by the DVD cover that I was talking about - Grrrrrrr !!!! and a surprise that threw the "victims" into a new light - I thought it was very routine. However he didn't put me off the two "sequels". with Karin (Hannibal Brooks) Baal and Camille (I Spit on your grave ") Keaton.
