I couldn't really get into this movie. The plot is that an old woman tortured someone so long as to be deformed. He dies and is left in the basement to die of hunger. Months must pass and a family moves. The daughter is blind due to an accident caused by her father. Well, anyway, this guy in the basement, who should have been dead for all time, is still around. Eat a cat and it's superhuman now. Now he wants to eat people and have sex. And when a prostitute dies, the father is at fault. I don't always like movies where someone else is blamed for killing because you always here the typical lines "I didn't do it", "I could never do such a thing", blah blah blah. And the plot of the family could be a cinematic plot of a lifetime.
