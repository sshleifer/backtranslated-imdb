Everything this film has tried to do is done better - and superbly in "Run Lola Run". The Red Haired Hip Cutie, the deadline (s) criticism (s), The Lover in jeep, and the message "Crime Pays-Sometimes". BUT, unlike "Lola", it is not credible or well done. It is a tiring labor that could have worked for me if I had seen it before "Lola" - but it has nothing in comparison. Yup! The Falling Beetle was beautiful! But that was the only surprise in the movie. Do yourself a favor and see the Real McCoy - (And the real hip Red Head!) - in Run Lola Run!
