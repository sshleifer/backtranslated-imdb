I should have realized that it was a sign of things that would come when the trailer for this film bored me. <br /> <br /> After seeing several "indie" films on the strength of the reviews here, and later finding it my opinion is completely opposite to those of other reviewers, I started wondering if it's possible that I'm watching movies completely different from these people, or maybe they are friends / family, etc. of film producers trying to "do a great job"? Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Interested in seeing an amateur's tribute to Pulp Fiction at 11:14, except for the worst actors, a silly score (undermines various scenes) and incredible leaps in logic? If not, skip this movie. <br /> <br /> Here is my open letter to two of the players in this movie. <br /> <br /> Alfonso Morgan, please, please, please, stop trying to 'be' Samuel L Jackon at the Pulp Fiction. No one can do what he does better than him. <br /> <br /> Director, please come with something original. It is a disservice to churn out this stuff by pretending to be Quentin Tarantino. Simply terrible, and I really can't see how anyone can say that this is a good movie. It is a disgrace that people have somehow managed to score 8.5 on this, the same as films like Pulp fiction or Goodfellas. It is not close to these films; a 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating, I give it a 3.
