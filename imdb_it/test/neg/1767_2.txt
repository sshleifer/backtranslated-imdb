First of all, I'm a big fan of Alien and Alien II - in my opinion both of these films have created and defined the Si-Fi Horror Genre as we know it today. I noticed that Lifeforce has often been compared to the Alien saga - after seeing this movie I wouldn't agree at all. There are some good special effects with alien vampires and the plot may be acceptable. I can't get past a naked space vampire throughout the movie, this is absolutely absurd (even if it looks good). Add some bad British acting and it's almost OVER. Most of the film takes place in London or somewhere else in England, so after the first 20 minutes you lose the outerspace setting and any hope of some real Si-Fi Horror action and suspense. <br /> <br />
