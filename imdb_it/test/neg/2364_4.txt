A young woman nicknamed "T.N.T." to be virtual dynamite in a fight and a knockout in terms of look to boot, it goes to the most lawless part of Hong Kong in search of his missing brother Stag Jackson. When he learns that he was murdered, he decides to hand the murderer to justice in a way that only she can. <br /> <br /> Sounds good, doesn't it? Well, there's really nothing wrong with the basic premise as a starting point for a martial arts action thriller / blaxploitation, which is what this wants to be. The derivations prove to be quite good also with Jeanne Bell who fits perfectly into the role of "T.N.T." and Stan Shaw behaves well like Charlie's ambitious and energy-hungry. Where this fails miserably is in terms of the fighting action it offers. The fight scenes are totally and completely unconvincing and / or sometimes so completely over the lines that reach the point of ridicule that does not help at all when the main objective of the film is a hero of action of Kung Fu. Even the poor lighting, the actors with sporty accents that make them difficult to understand, the confused camera and the sometimes poor sound do not help this obvious low-budget effort. This in a sector that can delight some fans, offers a lot of T in "T & A", in fact virtually every fight scene in the film is preceded by some kind of nude scene and Jeanne Bell actually has a fight scene extended in which it is completely topless. <br /> <br /> In the end, this fails to be something you want to revisit because the fighting scenes are so pathetically, ridiculously bad.
