I left the theater and I was only 10 years old. It's so bad that he sucked. The plot was horrible and the acting was worse. Leslie Nielson should be ashamed of himself and so should the person who made this film. I was only 10 years old when I went to see this catastrophe with a friend and even at that young and innocent age that I didn't laugh once at the film. We (my friend and I) still laugh at how bad the film has been. We ended up getting into the "R" movie where my parents were. Conclusion: this film was a little worse. Mr. Magoo, more like Mr. Ma-chi? This film could have marked me for life if I had seen the famous cartoon on television as a child, but fortunately I had never seen it before, so I was spared the agony, but I could never get back those precious minutes of the my life that I lost.
