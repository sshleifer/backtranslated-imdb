This is one of those extravagant comedies full of stars that could a) be hysterical, or b) wish you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled instead. Unfortunately, One Night at McCool's is a classic "b". Goldie Hawn recently commented "Town and Country" that it is a big problem in Hollywood to start by hiring actors and putting together a deal before a script is completed. You must understand that not only did they enter this image without a complete script, but they also crippled it every day. Maybe we need to send papers and letters to the heads of all the studios that say "It's the script, stupid". <br /> <br /> This is also one of those movies where you feel sorry for the actors almost all the way. They are working hard trying to make this look hysterical, but they know that most of it will be accompanied not by belly laughs but by the sounds of crickets that you can hear inside the silent theater. <br /> <br /> Is it an absolute disaster? Not entirely. There are some smiles along the way, mainly due to the actors' efforts. Probably I would have left the cinema thinking: "Eh, it was fine". So why the undeniably hostile tone in my review? The end. If, as has been noted, the rest of the film is all a setup for the finale, then it is spectacularly missing. I really wish I could talk specifically, but I hate people who give too far (even in warning). Suffice it to say that as soon as you see John Goodman behind Paul Reiser bent over (there is nothing obvious here. He is in the trailer), get out of the cinema and go out thinking: "Eh, it was fine." The rest of the film is attacked and creatively bankrupt. And you will be upset that in this mess there will really be people laughing. <br /> <br /> If you loved "There's Something About Mary" or "Meet The Parents" (both of the GREAT films), then don't worry about seeing this movie. Go instead to treat those teeth.
