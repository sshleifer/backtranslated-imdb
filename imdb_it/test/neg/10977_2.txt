"Go Fish" has won Rose Troche rightly or wrongly the reputation of a director with many promises. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to understand how a film made up of stereotypes associated with lower sitcoms can be made. The whole movie sounds empty. I did everything possible. <br /> <br /> It should be a look into the 90s of human sexuality. Well, there's not much else to learn than from "In and Out". By now most of us know that there are men sexually attracted to women and men who are sexually attracted to men and that there are even men sexually attracted to both sexes. <br /> <br /> Seldom has this revelation on the screen with so little spirit and style. <br /> <br /> Pathetic.
