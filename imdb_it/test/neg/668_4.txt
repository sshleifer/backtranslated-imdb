Okay, we're realistic about this. No one enters a film produced by WWE Films (whose owner challenged God to a wrestling match), directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the Tra trance cheek), played by a wrestler named Kane, and he expects a little piece of art on a golden plate. If you do, you probably need to find something different to watch movies to occupy your time. <br /> <br /> So what should we expect from a movie like this? Well, here's what I was looking forward to: <br /> <br /> 1) Bad acting. 2) A fairly non-existent plot of clich√©s. 3) Kane walks with a sour and peeling face indicating that her nostrils have just found the potato salad she lost a month ago. 4) tons and tons of blood. <br /> <br /> Well, if you are hungry for such "bad" entertainment then this could satisfy your appetite because it offers all the points of view. <br /> <br /> Obviously, films like this are seen better for free, but if you choose to sacrifice the dollars at the box office, have fun and play a game. The directors are kind enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by showing their names and their legal offenses on the screen. This makes it easier for you to write which ones you want to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are more accurate. <br /> <br /> I also suggest you and your friends to write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity you can find. Reorder at the end and see who gets out more. I think my overall total was 107; can you beat it? I personally want to know how after 35 years and a fire this abandoned hotel still has electricity, running water and a working elevator? <br /> <br /> I know, I know, the directors assume that if you pay to see this, obviously you don't care much about what you spend your money on and so you probably won't think much about how silly it is the movie, but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it. <br /> <br /> I also like how the city wants to transform this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by every reasonable inspector) into a homeless shelter and think that the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks some mops and brooms. Uh-huh. <br /> <br /> I think you know pretty much what to expect, but I need to give you a couple of warnings. First of all, if you hate interaction with the crowd, regardless of the movie, you may want to stay away. People in the audience acted like they were at a real wrestling show. Cries of "Kill him, Kane!" and "I hope you die first!" and "Chokeslam!" echoes through the theater, showcasing what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer. I don't usually appreciate these interactions with the public, but for a cheesefest like this I thought the comment added value to the fun. However, I can see how others might be annoyed. <br /> <br /> Second, and this should not even justify an explanation, the film does not avoid the gore. If watching a big ugly guy snatches dark circles out of their sockets doesn't shout "funny night at the movies!" for you then you know well and well to save your pasta. <br /> <br /> I must say that I was a little surprised by Kane's extreme lack of dialogue. I didn't expect him to go to an acting clinic, but I was hoping he had some nice catchphrases like "Say goodnight" (his character's last name is "Goodnight") just before he killed a victim. Instead he uttered four words in the whole movie - "Nooooooo!" and "I see it". But hey, he delivered them flawlessly! <br /> <br /> If you were a bad guy in a movie, then my slogan would be something like "Place your BETTS!" or "All BETTS are turned off!" <br /> <br /> It will reign and you know it. We need a new genre for bad horror movies like See No Evil that induce so many involuntary laughs that you almost have to label them as comedians. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now we'll call them HOR-lari!
