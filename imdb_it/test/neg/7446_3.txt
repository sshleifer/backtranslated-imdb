I recently collected all three Robocop films in a rather cheap box set and the only reason I did it was for the special edition of the first superb. I saw Robocop 2 before but not for 17 years, the year it came out. Since then I've never looked at him because I still remember how disappointed I was when I discovered how terrifying it really is. It's really a complete disaster, it has all the signs of a problematic production with so many sub-stories going on at the same time. It also has a very uneven tone and is also one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't mind a bit of violence, the first one was incredibly violent but this is simply ugly. Even the SFX is terrible even in 1990, greets ugly stop motion. Even having a drug dealing, cursing the child as a villain is just a little too much. At least Peter Weller had the good sense not to come back for the next. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has a couple of nice gags, like thanks for not smoking one and the kiddie baseball team stealing an electrical goods store. To quote the child who plays the villain "It sucks"
