My wife and I watched this after doing the DVR from Encore's action last week. It must be the worst horror movie that none of us has ever seen. Predictable dialogues (my wife and I were guessing the lines before they were spoken), special effects hokey, a script that drifted everywhere. I think the most annoying part was the stereotyping of the various plot characters, not to mention the free sex scene between two of the film's young heroines, none of which had any real purpose other than to discover some parts of their anatomy for the cameras. This film should be classified as a comedy, not a horror, as the villains of the film (the spiders) were animated in stop motion and not credible at least. I can't say that I would have done a better job making a movie on my own, but it was very amateur and it wasn't even a "B" movie, somewhere closer to a movie "d", or "f" if that's possible. I think even Science Fiction 3000 should pass this!
