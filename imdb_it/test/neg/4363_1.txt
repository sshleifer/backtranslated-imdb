<br /> <br /> This movie has been sucked! The first was much better. No one from the first is back in this stupid sequel and somehow it's a good thing because of bad acting, but the characters in this movie aren't even better. Killjoy in the woods? Come on! Give me a break! I'm surprised by Killjoy's friend Blair Witch didn't show up to make a cameo. Bad acting, bad story and just silly and boring. DON'T REFUSE YOUR TIME!
