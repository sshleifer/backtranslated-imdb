Reading the other two comments, I had to ask myself if I had seen the same movie! <br /> <br /> Maybe life is drastically different in Australia, but, wow, call it science fiction or fantasy, but people don't do anything else I can't give up this review without commenting myself .. better after the first half now, but I doubt that most could get this far .. <br /> <br /> Yikes.
