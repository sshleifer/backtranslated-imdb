The book of revelations starts very well. Daniel, an Egyptian dancer is kidnapped, abused and sexually raped by three masked women. After that, nothing else happens. There is some indication of rediscovery but the film gives neither explanations nor a real ending. Daniel's reactions after the abuse are very basic. He stops dancing, has sex with all the women around and finally starts a relationship with a very simple and common woman. <br /> <br /> I've seen a good part of auteur films but this one has something missing in it. br /> <br /> The main leads are fine; but some characters don't seem to be completely defined.
