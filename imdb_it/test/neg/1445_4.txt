I rented this film for the first time in the infamous day of September 11th 2001. Since then I've seen it several times. My only complaint is that it is too short. "Strangeland" would be a complete piece of horror art at two hours. As it stands, the execution time is only an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Sister Ex-Twist member Dee Snider wrote, produced and starred in this shock set in 1998 in a small Colorado town. He plays Carleton Hendricks, a crazed sadist who has psychotic ideologies about human evolution and a love for pre-death experiences. Hendricks is not a pushover, he is a "modern primitive" pumped six feet. Someone who has tattooed and pierced his body to the extreme. When he makes his first appearance in the film, it's a truly terrifying sight. <br /> <br /> Hendricks' main hobby in life is to share his "spiritual awakenings" with his kidnapped victims. Visit the chat rooms on the Internet with the name "Capt Howdy" and then invite people to your home. They think they're going to a party. Instead, they find themselves in a house of pain and suffering. Hendricks sow their eyes and their mouths and torture them by attaching blades and hooks to numerous parts of their bodies. If he looks sick, it's because he is sick. <br /> <br /> One of Hendrick's victims is Genevieve, the teenage daughter of detective Michael Gage. Gage not only manages to save her, but also arrests Hendricks. Four years later, Hendricks is released from a completely rehabilitated psychiatric institution due to community disapproval. A group of rednecks led by Freddy Krueger himself, actor Robert Englund, decides to kill him. They fail and Hendricks returns to his old self. <br /> <br /> I leave the rest of the film, just to say that the conclusion is satisfying and will leave you shivering. With the exception of Snider, acting is not too good, but it is useful. The management is also fine. There are some humorous parts in "Strangeland" and they are very funny. I also loved the soundtrack, it's fantastic and worth buying if you love rock. Overall, this is a movie that is worth watching. If you love low-budget horror movies with a sense of humor, take a look. You'll probably like it.
