Flight-to-Mars, inexpensive, little acted and unimaginably directed, is still fun, despite what is going against. A flight to Mars is planned with five people (three old ladies, Cameron Mitchell as a journalist and a scientist / obvious love interest) who "arm" the ship: the spaceship arrives there and discovers that there live very human Martians. have technological advances that would make the Earth blush, but not everything is rosy in the underground cities of the Martians (shown here as some caves and some rooms). The Martians are a dying planet and a faction wants the Terrans to solve the ship to take it away last moment and then mobilize for an attack on the Earth and another faction wants to talk about peace and see if they can't persuade the Earth to give it living space. The special effects here are pretty lousy even for the sci-fi standards of the years '50 complete with slow-moving rocket, pastel / neon alien clothing in which women wear shorts that would make them blush (except men of course), and slightly less offered. Cameron Mitchell is the journalist and is affable if nothing else. it Chapman is beautiful with short shorts but adds little room for acting. The rest of the cast is full of old science fiction veterans like Arthur Franz and Morris Ankrum who do useful work. This is not a science fiction film from the early golden age of any level, but it is very watchable and runs at a fast pace.
