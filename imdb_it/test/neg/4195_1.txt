Besides the comments on the technical merit of the production, or on its lack, the acting is absolutely horrible. What is really scary about this film is that I actually owned a copy, obviously, it was in a business basket and was renamed "Dark Harvest 2", and after seeing it, I can see why it was in the business basket - they should have paid me for removing it from their inventory. <br /> <br /> Most of the film, if you want to call it that, is spent by a frantic father running in a cornfield maze looking for his daughters because he has the premonition that something will happen to him. I suspect the camera the girls were playing with at the beginning of the film was probably one of the production cameras for this fiasco. In the maze, he runs into the ghost of some children, who are badly made, and the film goes horribly to the south from there. <br /> <br /> I can understand why they renamed this film, otherwise they would never have got rid of them. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever had, and it wasn't worth the $ 2 I spent on it.
