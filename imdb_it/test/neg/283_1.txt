Unfortunately I think this is one of those movies that if you or I took it to the studio and said, "Can I make this good movie with my friends Mary, Mungo and Midge from school?" the studio would have killed you on the spot. However, if a group of massive Hollywood names says "look, I want a trip to Italy with my friends, what do you say?" the firm writes a check. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the boss of the Ocean's 11 casino by tracking down the robbers who came out with his money, and then Brad Pitt is fucking Catherine Zeta Jones, and then there's some monkeying about in Amsterdam and in Italy and so and so and then everything ends in some way. <br /> <br /> The film, however, includes the most shameful moment of the careers of Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis, which is a gem movie. I almost vomited in my lap and tore my eyes off when Julia Roberts, playing Tess in the movie, pretends to be (you guessed it) Julia Roberts! Bruce Willis is clearly wondering when he can leave, and how much control will be. <br /> <br /> Ah well, to be honest, I would have done it for the money, so I guess I can really criticize the poor loves, but I'm a penniless bum, not a Hollywood legend. I guess what really annoys me about this movie is not that it's boring and useless and has a terrible story, but I think the actors probably had a lot of fun doing it! I think the whole job of the actor is to project the emotions outward ... I feel like I paid to go to the party, but I had to stay out in the rain. Booo! <br /> <br /> See if you like Como, or CZJ or something similar, but otherwise go for a walk.
