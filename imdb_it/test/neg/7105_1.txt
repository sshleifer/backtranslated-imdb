Maybe because I'm not a fan of comics (but if the comics have the same "quality" as the film, it's hard to believe), but this must be one of the worst films ever made. Non-existent storyline, ridiculous acting, stupid dialogue ... This film is so bad it hurts. A lot. The fact that some people have actually given this 10/10 is an insult to any good or at least mediocre (or at least bad) film. If you hate yourself, then look at Tank Girl! To another thought, if you hate yourself so much, maybe you should commit suicide ... My vote: -34/10
