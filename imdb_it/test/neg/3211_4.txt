Take the secret agent / maniac James Bond of the sixties, mix some concepts of the Sax Rohmer female, Fu Manchu femme fatale and mix in some absurd distorted revisionism of the director Franco - you have the man who hates Sumuru lesbian, or secrets of ... "- better known as" The Girl From Rio "in the United States, recalling" That Man From Rio ", which has nothing to do with this. Yes, this takes place in Brazil, we have to give it to him. Sumuru, or Sumitra, as also reported, is like an evil version of "Modesty Blaise", played here by the actress Eaton with that familiar coy smile that most of us first met in "Goldfinger". There are numerous close-up shots of his gaze fixed outside the camera, slowly opening his mouth, probably while watching something unpleasant (however, it has doubled in his key lesbian scene). Control an entire army of female warriors, with colorful costumes, and rule a city called Femina or something (just outside Rio de Janeiro?). These concepts, which had previously appeared in "The Million Eyes of Sumuru", are fantastic, but, despite some intriguing sets and images, they follow the same rural atmosphere as, for example, the dated "Some Girls Do", which arrived out more or less at the same time and which also included a female army. At first glance, the sight of all these armed females, usually lined up in a row, captures their interest, but, after about 15 minutes, one realizes that there is nothing else besides simply setting the view. <br /> <br /> The plot follows what looks like a secret agent, a male, who arrives in Brazil with 10 million dollars. Capture the attention of the local crime lord (Sanders, turning him into a bad old Bond guy), who sends dark thugs into a bowler hat to pull him over. This prepares everything for a 3-way conflict between the agent, the crime lord and the mysterious Sumuru (the crime lord wants the secrets of Sumuru). Sumuru also holds several prisoners in glass cages - perhaps this is one of the secrets. It sounds exciting but there are problems that go beyond a slow pace; there are many shots that could have used a lot of locks: a shot of an incoming plane, for example, remains on the aircraft while it stops at a nearby stop, as if it had never been captured before. There is a similar approach to a typical sunset, as if there was something unusual about it. The fight scenes are very poor, as if the directors were to use the first shots. To add some value to the production, halfway there is a scene from the real Rio carnival. I imagine there have been various budget problems, particularly evident in the culminating battle, in which fake sound effects and smoke cover a lot of fake actions, such as the lack of even real weapons - brings to mind those times when children use guns of plastic and fake bullets are fired, falling unconvincingly. There are touches of sadism, such as torturing a character to get answers, and female nudity, an anticipated representation of this after some restrictions have been lifted. But above all, you will roll your eyes. Hero: 3 Villains: 5 Femme Fatales: 5 Henchmen: 4 Fights: 3 Acrobatics / Chases: 3 Gadgets: 4 Cars: 4 Positions: 6 Rhythm: 3 overall: 4
