This is one of the most terrible films I've had the misfortune to pick it up. Don't get me wrong, I love a good zombie movie, but this wasn't one of them. <br /> <br /> ... It could also have been called "Titty" (at least from the opening scenes) Zombies from Outer Space '. It had absolutely nothing to do with the other movie or video game (as far as I know.) <br /> <br /> The best aspect of the film is how the two main characters can be covered by so much blood and remain so awkward. I would certainly suggest giving this one and losing and being with a safer zombie pleaser like "28 Days Later" or "Dawn of the Living Dead" (the remake, of course, unless you're involved in some serious campy action) .
