This film was an embarrassment. Ulma Thurman seemed to have some kind of illness and John Travolta seemed to be walking in his sleep. I expected this to be such a juicy sequel to Get Shorty, not a semi-cooked remake of the exact same movie (except that some of the characters have different names and clothes) <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend this at the cinema for my worst enemy. I feel like I've been robbed and Hollywood has once again tricked me into seeing another horrible sequel (I also suffered with Alien Vs. Predator). <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say about this movie is that it has my vote for the worst movie of 2005!
