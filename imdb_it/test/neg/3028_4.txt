I've seen this movie over and over since it came out. I was fifteen and even then, I knew it was poor. It had great potential and I constantly rewrite the script in my head. Capoeira has ruined what could have been a good drama. I loved the fact that it was shot on the spot. Too bad the characters were underdeveloped. It is as if they had written a first draft of a script and then made the film immediately. At fifteen I could have written a better script! Some scenes and dialogues seemed to come from nowhere and there were many questions left unanswered. And was it just me, or did it seem that Lobo was sexually attracted to his cousin? "Elena has become a kind of woman!" And the way he always touched her. It would have an interesting twist, Elena working for her cousin who is also a pervert. Too bad they missed the mark on this.
