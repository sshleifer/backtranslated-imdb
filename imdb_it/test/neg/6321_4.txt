I was ready to love "Where's Poppa", it is the nexus of the sitcom actors of the series Normal Lear who, when I was little, felt like extended members of my broken nuclear family of raisenette size. It would be fun to see Barnard Hughes, Vincent Gardenia, Ron Liebman, Rob Reiner and a pre-SNL Garret Morris without censorship. <br /> <br /> But alas, "Where's Poppa" drags. It is claustrophobic and tiring, and breaks the cardinal rules of farce, the lightness of mood and a fast pace. <br /> <br /> The plot involves the efforts of a lawyer (George Segal) to get rid of his overbearing Jewish mother, who lives in her giant New York apartment. Along the way we are exposed to characters and ridiculous situations: a comedian group of robbers who repeatedly attacks the protagonist's brother, the rape of a policeman involving a gorilla dress and the subsequent gay love, Ruth Gorden pulling down Segal's pants and he bites his ass while he serves his dinner. Because it does not work? Part of the explanation is the sense of ruin generated by the narrow, dark interiors and ancient decorations. I absolutely eat the New York cinematography during this era, but watching this movie it felt like I was leafing through the Police Gazette in an obscure bus terminal. <br /> <br /> The main reason is the slow pace. Modern MTV-style quick cuts have changed what viewers believe is a comfortable editing time, but even taking this into account, camera shots are kept for an excessively long time. Even the plot developments are very slow. There is a situation in which it works: a strange love song that George Segal sings to Trish Van Devere, sweetly, very close to his face, and for an excruciatingly long period of time. It reminded me of those extended and sweet shots in the English version of "The Office", in which you find yourself mentally begging for the camera to be cut, and at the same time you can't stop searching. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, much of the film is more "hasty" than "can not look away". Which made me wonder if it's possible to have a black comedy that is also a farce. The dilemma is that the gravity of the subject in a black comedy tends to weigh on the lightness of the farce. Movies like "M * A * S * H" by Robert Altman and "Dr. Strangelove" by Kubrick show that it can be done. They do it not only through speed but also through interlacing, something "Where's Poppa" neglects. <br /> <br /> Although the film features multiple characters, stereotypically amusing, almost everyone is directly involved in the central drama of how to deal with the recalcitrant mother. The scenes of Garret Morris and the Central Park robbers are so close as the viewer reaches a mental break. The robbers seemed almost Shakespearian, following the tradition of ne'er-d0 comics. If the rest of "Where's Poppa" had remained a little closer to the theatrical tradition, it would have been a better film. Edgier is not always better. It's as if all these talented actors and director Carl Reiner were taking in just before the creative vortex of the 70s. Random notes: after having covered up Ron Liebman's clothes, the crooks mention "The Naked" by Cornel Wilde Prey (1966), a great action movie that was a stylistic precursor of the "Planet of the Apes" of 1968. < br /> <br /> As politically incorrect as it is, it is disturbing to learn of the death of a formidable action hero like Charleton Heston, Linda Harrison, who played "Nova", Taylor's mute companion, said that James Fransicus, in sequel seemed to be cute and tiny compared to Heston.
