This belated effort by Freda is a modern Gothic thriller (70s), but not exciting. Certainly it is not a terribly bad film, but it has the feeling that many of Freda's later films have someone who gave up when he saw the first newspaper. It starts quite well, almost as yellow as it sounds, then takes a turn in Gothic territories with a decent set (even if terribly clich√©). Then suddenly Freda seems to have lost interest in the film and all we get are prolonged shots of Camille Keaton and burning candles. Then about an hour into the film we get a sort of violent climax with decent special effects. This is followed by a slow-paced outro with a very obvious ending end (if it is also meant to be a breakthrough?). And he throws some very timid explanatory scenes along the way and you have the Tragic Ceremony. So in some parts it has its qualities. But then he suddenly stumbles and collapses in front of you. Such a pity. <br /> <br /> we will stay away from the SHAROMA DVD, an insensitive pan and a scanned edition that kills what could be a good visual experience.
