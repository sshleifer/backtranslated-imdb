ATTENTION ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The Lord knows that I have seen some bad movies in my time and this makes me equally angry. This is an insult to people who are looking for a bad movie. The "story" involves a stewardess who discovers her boyfriend (badly played by another great Robert Wagner) is a murderer, a thief and just a face from vomit. After the Concorde takes off, it sends guided missiles to destroy the Concorde. So while the Concorde travels at the speed of light, our "hero" (played with extreme stupidity, George Kennedy) opens the window in the cockpit, then, he puts his hand OUTSIDE THE WINDOW to shoot the missile! I'm not a rocket scientist, but it seems that his hand can at least catch fire. Then towards the final "climax" when the Concorde is headed towards a certain disaster and everyone will die, a passenger turns to his fianc√© and proposes marriage. A priest seems to be sitting in the next row and proceeds to marry them as the planes crash! (I'm not making up anything) Wow, the guy who wrote the script must have sniffed glue for a week.
