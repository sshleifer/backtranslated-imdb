Now television programs (at least in England) are full of home improvements, hunting for agriculture, home hunting and cooking shows in the afternoon, the possibility that any terrestrial broadcaster can dig a complete darkness like this to occupy a couple of hours of screen time on a slow afternoon are slim, to say the least. But in the 1980s, the BBC did just that, and guess what, I looked at it. And it is a testimony to the overwhelming strangeness of this Hungarian-American co-production of which I can still remember great pieces, over twenty years later. To begin with, the eponymous hero appears briefly during the opening credits, only to disappear again for at least half an hour. (Imagine that an American TAIL is modernized, so Feivel is nowhere to be seen, and you'll appreciate how confused it is.) There is a bit of an animation in which one of the characters gets his elaborate waxed mustache touched up and lengthened, complete with a boingy sound effect that makes it go with bulging eyes. Probably funny if you have been stoned, but for a child, quite disturbing. By the way, the infamous 'hippopotamus' scene is represented in an abstract way - clouds in vague forms of hippopotamus are struck by lightning - but it is still quite unpleasant. In reality, this film is rather cold and uninvolving, a sad difficult situation due to the strange production design, all the muddy colors, the wobbly lines, the swollen shapes and the squalid European singularity that reminds Jan Svankmajer, but not so convincing. So, to complete everything, we get Osmonds songs! This film is not as terrible as it is profoundly wrong, not so much a phantasmagorical as a rather ugly journey.
