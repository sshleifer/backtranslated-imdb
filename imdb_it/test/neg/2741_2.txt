I'm a pretty tolerable guy when it comes to movies, even movies B. I usually watch some B-movies for fun, and they can range from surprisingly good, to just terrible. Usually, my expectations were very low before watching these kinds of movies, and even after I did that, Descent was just terrible. I really didn't mind that they were tearing up the Core to some extent, but they were doing absolutely nothing interesting with the material. Some scientists are concerned about earth's seismic activity and must travel deep into the earth to stabilize the mantel. So what we get is a long monotonous set in which two dueling scientists played by Luke Perry and Rick Roberts have to work together on a top secret mission, called Project DEEP. The man in charge, General Fielding, played by Michael Dorn, is secretly hiding vital information from Assistant Marsha Crawford, played by Mimi Kuzyk. Rounding out the cast is Natalie Brown, who plays Jen, a mission specialist who created the "Talpa", a drill that is used to sink into the depths of the Earth. <br /> <br /> In addition to some pretty good special effects, and set the designs, it is not worth descending to Descent. The film starts out pretty funny, but quickly gets bogged down in a tiring story of uncontrollable seismic activity, which has been killed in other films like the Core. Descent also has a poor screenplay, with a useless and forgettable dialogue between the characters. To make matters worse, there is literally no action, no real threat or danger. Attempts at comic relief are painfully unpleasant. The plot has gaping holes and some subplots are left loose at the end leaving a bad taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> In closing this film was just a cheap way for everyone interested in getting a salary. There was no thought behind this film, no innovation, it's just there. In addition to some good-looking special effects and sets, this film fails at all other levels. The story comes from the Hollywood trash bin, and the characters aren't interesting to boot. The descent will simply reduce you to boredom and frustration. Avoid at all costs.
