I knew I wasn't going to see a quality movie when this title was included in a "category B video evening" in a place of friends. Despite the warnings, I was still surprised at how bad this film was. It was fortunate that many of us were there to share the pain with one another ... The film tries to tell the story of a dark future, in which Hawk (a Mad Max type character) goes off to save a damsel in distress. In reality, the plot is a subtly disguised excuse for producers to promote their philosophies of life (looking at the credits and the "disavowal of these people is not true" in the end for a real laugh). The film often lacks direction and fails to develop its characters in any way. What is even worse is the editing of this film. The film repeats scenes (often from 10 to 20 seconds) up to 4 or 5 times in a row. I think this was an attempt to emulate things like Jean Claude Van-Damme's fight sequences, but if he fails completely. The film would probably be about 1/3 of its length if we were not obliged to see the main character move his head in front of the sun setting half a dozen times (yes, that's all that happens in that repeated scene). I give this film my "worst movie I've ever seen". I doubt it will soon be overtaken.
