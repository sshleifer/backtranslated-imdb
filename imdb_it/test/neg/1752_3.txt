Some movies are not for everyone. This accurately describes the film by Igmar Bergaman, Skammen (Shame). At only 18, I still have what I imagine you can call a minor form of ADD and well, I watch movies for fun. Shame was a film with a very interesting premise, of trying to convey the effect of war to ordinary people, but failed to do it for me. I don't know if it was the subtitles, the black and white shots, the length of the film, or the fact that it took two hours from my studio for a huge chemistry test, but I didn't like it. I understand that it is considered a great film and very important in the history of cinema, however, I think that, as my teacher pointed out, not everyone likes or likes everyone. I guess I just wish I had finished all his numerous side plots. Perhaps the translation has lost something, but I felt that there were endless small shots that never reached a conclusion. You'll meet characters and you'll never see them again, or you'll really understand why they were included in the film. My general recommendation for this film is that it is worth seeing, but only to formulate its opinion on it. Whether you like it or not, you need to respect the point it is trying to convey.
