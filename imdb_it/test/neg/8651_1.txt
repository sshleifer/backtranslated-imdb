This film is worth nothing. I mean, if you want to see this kind of thing, switch to Hollywood movies! This is totally a dishonor for the Bollywood name. Neal N Nikki has seriously sucked! Never watch this movie. As for the actors, it seems that acting genes have missed a generation. Tanisha could not have worn less and Uday Chopra was obviously chosen because he was the director's spoiled son. (All that Halla King was incredibly stupid) The songs are eh, and I hope the director didn't spend much money on it ... In conclusion, I hated the movie. Don't let your kids look at it, and if you have it at home it's a stupid movie, so throw it away! Buy the CD if necessary. (As I said, the songs are eh.) At least it's better than the movie.
