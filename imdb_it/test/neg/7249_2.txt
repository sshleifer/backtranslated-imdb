I bought this movie at Blockbuster for $ 3.00, because it looked interesting (a bit Ranma-esque, with the idea of ​​someone dragging a skeleton), because there was a cute girl in a miniskirt at the back, and why there was a sticker with a Restricted View on it. I thought it would be a sweet or at least a sincere story of old age with a strange indie side. I was 100% wrong. <br /> <br /> After looking at it, I wonder how it got the adhesive with restrictions, since there is almost no vulgar language, little violence and the closest thing to nudity (Honestly! usually not go around hoping!) is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties a lot in this movie, because it doesn't matter, wear a miniskirt of some kind). Even antireligious humor is docile (and lame, caricature, insincere, derivative, not original, and worst of all it's not funny at all, it would be better to simply listen to Ray Stevens "He would like to wear a Rolex for him TV Show"). This could barely qualify as PG-13 (not classified), but Blockbuster refuses to allow anyone under the age of 17 to rent this - as if it were pornographic. Any kid could come in and rent the modified version of Requiem for a Dream, but they insist that Zack and Reba are worse. <br /> <br /> It is, but not that way. <br /> <In a sense, this worries me - the only thing that can offend people is the idea of ​​suicide in the beginning. If anyone needs to see films with honestly suicidal portraits (not this one, but rather those like The Virgin Suicides), they're teenagers. If both films were classified as R only for the suicidal aspect, then I have little chance of turning a story I wrote into a PG-13 film (the main characters are half past eleven and twelve). Suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in adolescents (I think it is number 2), so it is likely that most adolescents have been or will be affected. <br /> <br /> Just say no to this movie, though. 2/10.
