This is a television series for children about a Mary-Sue that is both bad and bad at the same time. I couldn't sit through 3 episodes of Zoey101. Not to mention the fact that Jamie Lynn Spears can't act to save her life! What message does this show bring to children? If you are not as perfect as Zoey, you are unworthy * rollseyes *. <br /> <br /> It is absurd how Zoey's character is exactly the kind of person who would be scorned in real life and yet manage to become so popular. Then there is Chase who is basically a puppy in love who loves the land on which Zoey walks. Then there is the fact that all the other characters seem to have been minimized to prevent them from eclipsing Zoey. I'm sorry but the characterization of this show is extremely unrealistic.
