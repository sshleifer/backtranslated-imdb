Friend, I went to this movie because of the big preview. He seemed to have a good story and beautiful special effects. <br /> <br /> Boy was I wrong. I wanted to get out of the theater because of those horrible special effects. A dino cartoon made from cartonboard would also do a better job than this. The story was fine, if it had been taken by a great film producer. Who could add a little more money to make the effect more realistic. The only thing I liked about this movie is that plants sprout everywhere. Worse still where the machines, in a scene 2 characters walk along the road. If you look at those cars you will see the following: Taxi, car, motorcycle, tri-pod, big bus. And about 4 times in a row! <br /> <br /> And then there is the "death of the butterflies" that will set all the "evolutionary changes" in progress. If that guy hadn't stepped on the butterfly, the next dino would have eaten it anyway! So this is the absolute bull. So if you change something in the past, the future will be different at the same time. Not in those "waves of time" they did. But hey, if the future changed in a fraction of a second, the film would be even worse, but more realistic. This is just one of those movies that you should see when you want to have a good laugh. I spend a lot of money on this film in the theater. And then they told me that this movie had a budget of $ 80 million dollars. WHERE ALL THE MONEY ARE FINISHED ????
