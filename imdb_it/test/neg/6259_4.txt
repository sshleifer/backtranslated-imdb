As CURSE OF THE KOMODO was for the genre of creatures, the CHEERLEADER MASSACRE by Jim Wynorski is a parody of slasher films, such as SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE. A psychopath, who has escaped from his padded cell, (... was sent to the asylum by killing eleven people) is going through the mountainous countryside of Bobcat County attacking anyone within his reach. A cheerleaders van, their teacher, two hands of equipment and the driver are going to a race when their vehicle runs out of fuel while escaping a supposed shortcut to avoid having to go back. Fortunately, the group finds a cabin ahead, but falls prey to a killer who attacks each victim one by one. The psychopath in the county could not have killed a girl because she was in the cheerleader's locker room while she was elsewhere, which means that some of them are the culprit. Meanwhile, the county sheriff and his deputy chase the place where their psychopaths are, as they also try to find the position of the missing cheerleader team. <br /> <br /> Turned to cheap on video, Wynorski does what he can with the limited budget that must find clever ways to assassinate characters off screen without the luxury of properly effective special effects. In other words, many melons have been stabbed, the sound effect used to let us know that certain victims fled into the darkness from a fiercely black gloved hand. Wynorski incorporates a scene from SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE concerning the character of Brinke Stevens Linda, who is chased by a killer with a drill (... that the killer and Linda are both dead, but I suppose Wynorski wanted to link his film to that one, too if quite bad) .. however it was nice to see her, even though it was a glorified cameo. Tamie Sheffield, like Mrs. Hendricks, the teacher of struggling students, has a long bathing scene in the shower, soaking her naked body and fake breasts. The girls who make up the cheerleaders are a little unconvincing, because obviously they are twenty. The aging of soft-core pornstars Samantha Philips (like a police officer being attacked by the psychopath she's looking for) and Nikki Fritz (a hiker victim of jogging on a dangerous bridge) surprisingly don't have to crawl. Wynorski controls Bill Langlois Monroe (.. as Sheriff Murdock) and Melissa Brasselle (.. as a detective who assists Murdock in his case) contribute to the secondary plot of John Colton McPherson's serial killer search. Interestingly, McPherson's story is that of a McGuffan because, in reality, the flesh of the film is dedicated to the cheerleading group and their dangerous situation. I'm not sure that slasher fans will embrace this film because it takes too long for the killings to ignite and when they eventually enter the movie, the violence isn't powerful enough or shocking to satisfy.
