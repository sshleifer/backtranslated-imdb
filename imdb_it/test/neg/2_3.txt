It seems that since 1982, every two or three years we receive a film that claims to be "The next agent and a gentleman". There is not yet a film that lives up to this claim and this film is no different. <br /> <br /> We get the usual scenes torn from OAAG ("I want you DOR", the instructor gives the Richard Gere characterizes his overdose of exercises in the hope that he will stop, the character of Gere returns for the girl, the Gere's character realizes that the instructor is fantastic, etc.) And this film is as predictable as the sun rising in the East and is horribly wrong at the top. Costner plays his usual "wise teacher" character, the only character he can play, and you really have an idea of ​​his limited acting skills here. Kutcher is terrible in the character of Richard Gere, just a mixture with his acting skills barely a difference from Keanu Reeves. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this aspiring OAAG is that the two main characters are so extraordinarily one-dimensional, they don't take care of both and when Kutcher's character eventually turns (just like Gere did in OAAG ) you just have to "so what?" The film leaves no point pending and never seems to end as if to say "oh wait, we forgot to close the story of the girlfriend, or what happens after her graduation thesis, or the other six points of the plot in the film .. . "The strangest thing is the" reviews "I see here. The opinions of the general public never cease to amaze me.
