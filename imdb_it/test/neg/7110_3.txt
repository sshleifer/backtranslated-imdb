This 1988 movie was recently shown on a cable channel. We wanted to see another movie, which was supposedly starting, but because a fight, Rent-a-Cop, was shown in that time slot. I never saw it when it was marketed, we took a chance. Bad decision. <br /> <br /> One wonders what made the people behind the image go ahead with "Rent-a-Cop", or how they sold it to the studio behind the distribution. It seems that this film has been a great success. This film does not add anything new to its genre. It is absolutely predictable, given that once the basic premise is shown, we know how it will end. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds plays a wooden church. This actor can do better, but who knows what was going on behind the scenes, or perhaps the direction Jerry London had given him, had the opposite effect. Mr. Reynolds has an expression throughout the film. It simply doesn't register any emotion. <br /> <br /> Lisa Minnelli, like the prostitute who witnessed the original massacre in the Chicago hotel, makes absolutely no sense. The love story between his Della and Church seems fake from the beginning. She and Mr. Reynolds play one-dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this turkey.
