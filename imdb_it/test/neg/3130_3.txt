The Dakota incident must be one of the strangest westerns I've ever seen. Not good, but definitely strange. <br /> <br /> A driverless stagecoach arrives in the city of Christian Flats with all the passengers killed. It's set to go on, but very few for obvious reasons want to risk the Cheyennes on the warpath out there. But Linda Darnell, Regis Toomey, John Lund, Whit Bissell and Ward Bond each have their reasons for moving forward. And Dale Robertson, who killed John Doucette in a fire fight after Doucette and Skip Homeier shot and left him dead in the desert, is so eager to be willing to lead the team. <br /> <br /> Of course the attack of Cheyennes the intrepid group of passengers if forced to dry clean for coverage. Who will live and who will die is the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The Dakota incident came at the end of Republic Pictures before Herbert J. Yates pulled the plug on his small studio. Westerns were their specialty, but normally of the kind of Roy Rogers made. This would not have been a Rogers product. <br /> <br /> Actually it's unbelievable. The characters are not rooted in any kind of reality. Whit Bissell is taking mineral samples from his complaint, but Robertson discovers that he is iron pyrite, crazy gold. Toomey is a guitar that sounds cynical that goes crazy with thirst. Darnell is looking for a swindler, but really doesn't know what to do when he finds it. Lund is trying to bring Robertson who committed a crime for which he took rap, but he must make it live. For this he would need help, but he has none. <br /> <br /> But the worst is Ward Bond who is a US senator on his Cheyennes peace mission. In real life, Bond was an extreme right-wing individual and I'm not sure this wasn't some kind of caricature of what he would have perceived as a liberal. It's really a bit crazy, but I think it might have attracted him to the role. I tried to get into the Dakota incident, but I couldn't. And the ending was a bizarre fantasy to say the least. <br /> <br /> From the three stars for the involved cast.
