OK, here's the short ... this movie is full of trivial dialogues, beyond acting and a worn screenplay. <br /> <br /> There are moments that want to be very dramatic but simply freak out because of excessive acting and badly written lines. I couldn't help laughing at moments that had to be very serious. The bright spot in this film is the circus. Seeing the circus in its heyday was certainly a pleasure. <br /> <br /> There are moments that come as well. But then go back to the B-movie territory. I was tempted to stop looking at him several times. <br /> <br /> I certainly don't know how he got the best image, anyway. It must have been a slow year!
