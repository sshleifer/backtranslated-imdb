First of all, if you want to make a good movie, don't fill all your exposure in the last 10 minutes. It is expected that the viewer will remain perplexed for almost two hours, just to have Margo's father explain everything to Alex very late in the movie. To make matters worse, the writer decided that it was not enough to solve the basic mystery, but to add a completely useless murder that we knew nothing about (involving Alex's father!). <br /> <br /> There are also some serious motivation problems with the characters. Margo's father's choices don't seem to make sense once the film is finished. Why didn't he just kill Philippe's father and finish with that? Instead, a complicated plot to obscure the truth is invented, but one that guarantees that everyone will be physically endangered for years (including the completely innocent photographer, who is murdered by the thugs of Philippe's father). Although Alex is a doctor (who is thought to be relatively brilliant), he chooses to flee from the police, during which he not only endangers his life, but also those he involves in a bad heap on the highway. Why was Margo's friend so enthusiastic about keeping the promise made to Margo once all the shit hit Alex's fan? And should we think that Margo's father would rather kill himself than go to jail? What about your wife? Did he consider his wishes? These are some of the main problems. <br /> <br /> Then there are some unpleasant details, such as: why was his father there the night of his fake death? How did he grab the junkie's body at such short notice and quickly retrieve it to bury it with the other two? Alex's friend, Bruno, seems too eager to be part of the chaos, in which he and his friends must kill for Alex, despite the perceived debt he owes to Alex for saving his son's life. What are Margo's photos for? They don't involve Philippe at all. And why would Margo have the key to the safe at hand that night for his would-be kidnappers? Did I miss anything else? Probably. Less irritation includes the fact that, although Alex is a doctor, he smokes like a demon. Which makes his marathon run away from the police even the most impressive. Moreover, when riding the cabriolet with his lawyer, neither of them wears a seat belt. How bright could they be?
