This must be one of the most dramatized movies I've ever seen. It is basically a remake of The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (1953), but made with your standard snake-like monster-puppet instead of a shiny creation by Ray Harryhausen. Combine the storyline of that classic monster with the production qualities and acting level of The Creeping Terror and get an idea of ​​what this movie is like. <br /> <br /> The film is nicknamed, albeit by the original actors (I think the film was originally nicknamed in Italian for that country audience, then renamed for release in the United States, which makes the film seem strange ... the sounds, like in a Japanese monster movie, don't perfectly fit the action on the screen, even if the actors' lips move correctly. <br /> <br /> Poor Ray Milland ... is surely arrived very far from The Lost Weekend or Dial M for Murder or any of the number of excellent films he was in. Add this to his other sci-fi films (Panic in Year Zero, X The Man with X-Ray Eyes ) and you can see a once-good actor who fell into a Boris Karloff syndrome ... stuck doing really bad horror movies in foreign countries just for work.
