Unlike one of the reviewers listed below, I don't think a great and brilliant career should anticipate the director of this inept and boring observation piece of the navel. While it's nice to see a British director trying to get out of the confines of the convention, AKA's only claim to innovative fame is based on the novelty of the triple screen. At first you think this might be an interesting device, but its only real contribution to the film is to test your vision and your patience. Seeing the same character from 3 different angles in a two-dimensional film does not make it more revealing or complex. If you can forget the triple screen (which, it is obvious, is very difficult to do), then you have to handle the script unintentionally funny. The public is beaten in submission by a chiche on a list of the British class system. The film has the political and emotional sophistication of an episode of Upstairs and Downstairs. To sum up: the Emperor's new clothes. And also rather poor clothing.
