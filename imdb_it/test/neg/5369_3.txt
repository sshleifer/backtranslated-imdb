"Paranormal State" is an interesting sight for most paranormal believers. I like to watch what the "team" has to say and what they "find", however, I know that the whole show together with its accumulations and its stories are completely set. They go to real haunted places and suspect they talk to real witnesses. I commonly feel as I watch that I am not looking at non-fiction but a real movie that is in contradiction with reality. Personally I would not recommend or recommend anyone to watch this show unless you are just a fear-seeker. <br /> <br /> Interesting show. Attack on "Ghost Hunters"
