Dear Mr. Seitzman, or anyone I could hold responsible for the fact that Mr. Seitzman did not respect his just fate of being eaten alive by Rabid Wolverines; <br /> <br /> I don't know you, so I can't comment on your character; as far as I know, give charitable organizations and small elderly ladies cross the street. However, I must insist, for the common good, that you never write another script as long as you live. Put down the pen, get away from the laptop! <br /> <br /> If you refuse to listen to the plea of ​​injured brains, I have seen a movie or two in my life, and I believe you will find my advice useful: <br /> <br /> 1. Do not include love scenes in which overuric kids call the body parts of their girlfriends after the American states. If you have to write such a scene, please don't name the breasts "New York" and "New Jersey"; it causes useless speculation about which cities occupy the nipples. Moreover, it is almost incomprehensibly stupid and annoying. <br /> <br /> 2. Do not rely solely on John Hughes films to reinforce class distinctions. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not overwhelm the public with exhausted clichés. Yes, yes, Kelley and Sam stand out in the rain and purifies them from their worries. We have it. Yes, roses continue to bloom in the greenhouse of Kelley's dead mother, even though all the other plants have started to rot. It is a symbol of their love. It is also very painful when applied through blunt force trauma to the back of our heads. For the love of God, Mr. Seitzman, we understand. We all get there, all over the country. Amish, deaf, unborn children - we all understand. <br /> <br /> 4. Do not ask the actors to perform mime sequences. Never. Never. <br /> <br /> 5. Did I say that you should loosen the trivial symbolism? Because the public can draw the parallel between the reconstruction of the restaurant and the construction of the relationship between Kelley and Sam without any help. Really. We understood. <br /> <br /> 6. Go through your script and find the following lines and lines that look like it: "I don't know what we are anymore." "I do not want to lose you." "It's just like the rest of them!" (And his corollary, "Dad, you don't even know him!") <br /> <br /> 7. Yes, yes, she is in heaven, running in a field. We understood. <br /> <br /> 8. And in other news, we understand. <br /> <br /> I have seen dozens of terrible films in my life; I never expected to suffer for your art, and I would have just left the theater, but an elephant with the words "DOOMED LOVE" painted on one side fell from the sky and nailed me in my place. <br /> <br /> In closing, your writing bites, you owe me ten dollars and I hate you.
