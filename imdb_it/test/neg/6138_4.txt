This film is likely to be a real disappointment, unless you understand the circumstances in which it was made. The Marx were chosen to be included in the film version of a play that was not originally written for them. They are a bit forced in the roles. Ironically, it might have been more fun if he had used different actors who didn't have such high expectations on them. Instead, it was forever embedded as part of a canon to which it actually does not deserve to belong.
