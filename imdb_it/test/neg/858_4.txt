"The Duke" is a film based in the heart of the British aristocracy where an old duke (John Neville) dies and to avoid his great property and the immense riches that are taken from him after his death by 2 devious aristocrats (Oliver Muirhead and Sophie Hey friend); passes his Dukeship to his dog. The "best friend" of the dog, an American girl named Charlotte (played by Courtnee Draper) whose parents die, becomes an orphan from the former Duke due to the fact that he was her great uncle. A young chef named Florian arrives, with him and Charlotte who connect instantly creating a romantic secondary plot that, in its own way, serves as subtitles for the main plot of Hubert's activities, the "Duke" and his many activities and love interests with other dogs. All this is revered by James Doohan who plays a butler determined to try to serve his old duke doing his best to serve his new master, Hubert. Doohan acts as the oldest character there to comfort and advise the younger ones as he looks further and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master. A beautiful comic performance mixed with dramatic elements to end the career of a refined and influential actor. <br /> <br /> Although from a technical point of view, I don't like this movie, since I only saw the role of James Doohan. Although the plot is good, the elements of writing and directing must be obscured. Ignoring the absurdity of a "Doggie Duke", I personally don't like the excessive use of comedy and outrageous jokes about "bad" characters because of their giggles. The dependence on humor related to hygiene that you like is too obvious and the general stupidity of many characters does not appeal to me. The director, Phillip Spink uses medium-long shots too often with an overdubbed voice or that affects the overall quality of the sound. Furthermore, the acting of Muirhead and Heyman, even in dramatic and romantic sequences, is drastically short, satisfying wholesale requests for the role. <br /> <br /> But as a fan of mature movies, I find it easy to be too critical of a simple family movie designed to make you laugh. I can admit to having found some funny bits and other bits that touch on a plot that can be far-fetched, but has definite connections. I don't recommend this movie to fans of mature films, but I highly recommend it to dog lovers, families who want to enjoy a fun movie for their children and James Doohan fans who want to see "Scotty" in his final role.
