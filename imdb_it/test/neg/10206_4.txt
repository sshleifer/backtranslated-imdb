No Holds Barred is that film that when you were nine or ten was the best movie on this side of arnold schwarzenegger. But then when you grow up and look at it you feel embarrassed that you were so naive as to have appreciated it. You feel cheated, embarrassed and stupid. If you have a little brother and show him this and he tells you he's gay, give him five and take him to the bar for his eleventh birthday.
