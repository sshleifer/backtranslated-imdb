I feel conflicted about this film - it's one of the most beautiful films I've seen, and it provides insightful looks about a lost culture. There was a first scene of men with caps and mustaches sitting around a table, with a woman serving, and an accordion playing, which brought tears to my eyes, precisely because of the way it captured a lifestyle which must have been incomprehensible to many today. It presents the life of the characters as inextricably linked to village life, another concept lost in today's world. The symbolism is always fun but seemed a little dated. The fatal flaws of the film for me were the lack of an irresistible dramatic push and a total lack of humor. I never felt that I knew any of the characters beyond basic universal things like mourning the loss of a loved one, etc. People were a stylized figure in the director's scenes involving natural disasters, wars, etc. The film was just one splendid after another tragic scene, without narrative and without humanity. As a result, it seemed very abstract, irrelevant to the lives of real people. In the end, I was too bored to finish looking at him.
