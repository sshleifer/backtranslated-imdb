I have two minds about FOLLOWING, Christopher Nolan's film debut. Part of me admires him for having cost $ 6,000, but a part of me hates him because he's too artisan. In many ways it reminds me of the cult PI movie, a film I didn't like, and I can't understand the central plot of a man who wants to be a writer by following the people around. Wouldn't it be more logical for someone who wants to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write? <br /> <br /> Oh well I suppose the following registers independent producers hoping that just because they made a film without a budget that cost $ 6,000 out of two thousand IMDB members will vote for this and over five hundred members will comment, but you have to ask me would this film be so well seen if it had not been made by the MEMENTO director?
