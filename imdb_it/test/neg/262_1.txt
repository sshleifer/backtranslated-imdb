There are no - NO ransom qualities for this movie. They didn't check a single fact - NOT ONE about ... anything. I'm sorry for Larry Miller, and even more sorry for his agent for not being able to find him a more suitable place. <br /> <br /> Adults are all idiots. The effects are approximate and devoid of any sense of reality. The music is honestly poor. The plot is incredible. <br /> <br /> I want to see something good with your family, see anything else. Take some time and check the mold in your attic. My ten-year-old is mocking this movie as we watch it. Unfortunately, he is learning that not all films deserve to be watched.
