This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. Everything about it - acting, directing, screenplay, cinematography - is terrible. The alien (a human in a shining dress) claims to come from a nearby universe; it is assumed that the writer meant "galaxy" but did not bother to get a dictionary to check the terms. A better title for the film would be "It came from the plot plot plot". The plot is too silly and almost non-existent. Humans all have magical MacGuffins that conform to a tortuous series of unlikely restrictions just to move the bare plot. Any thoughts on the passage of time are ignored. Now a couple of days have passed since the meeting with the alien, then BAM! suddenly there are only a couple of hours to the zero hour. Do yourself a favor and lose this movie. You'll make yourself more stupid for having seen it. The ending is particularly silly, and should have been accompanied by someone who recited "Ta-Da !!!!" how the writer pulls something random out of his ass. I think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so much that you get sick from cancer. If you can watch the last 10 minutes without discrediting yourself ("enemies of freedom" - honestly) laughing, you're retarded.
