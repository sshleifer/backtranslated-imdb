I know it's hard for you Americans to find European films on video / DVD, especially in the 1980s, but look for the original version of Vanishing - title Spoorloos (1988) - and you'll see why the Hollywood version of Vanishing up bigtime screws in particular at the end. <br /> <br /> I really like Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland and in particular Jeff Bridges, but this is so disgusting compared to the original. What are they thinking? Can you imagine Seven with a happy ending with Gwyneth Paltrow happily running into Brad Pitt's arms in the finale? The whole point that the original was such a huge international success was because of the shocking ending. So why do you accept this kind of shy remake? Really, avoid this and GET THE ORIGINAL.
