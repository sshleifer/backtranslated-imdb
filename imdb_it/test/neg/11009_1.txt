Let me first say that I really WANTED to really like this movie. For the most part actors and actresses have looked at their parts, and have done quite well in their roles, but the film lacked a real plot. It seemed so wrapped up in seemingly 'weird' that no interesting story has ever shone. Furthermore, camera work was often sloppy, trying to get back to work with the camera and failing miserably. Most of the time, the shots designed to look cool ended up being confused. Maybe something was lost during the translation, but some of the characters were just ... stupid. The crazy handsome guy who sniffs people like a dog? Uhhhhhhh. OK. Overall, a 1/10 smelly fat. It's not worth your time.
