Sheba Shayne (Pam Grier) receives a telegram informing her that her father could be in trouble. Sheba, a private investigator and former policeman, goes to help her father. But someone will stop at nothing to make his father fail. An attempt to show their muscles goes wrong and Sheba's father is killed in cold blood. These guys messed up the wrong woman. <br /> <br /> If I had to describe Sheba Baby, the best I can invent is Pam Grier Lite with some really bad acting. For a film by Pam Grier, Sheba Baby is incredibly docile. It's not even remotely violent like some of his previous films. Gone are the over-the-top images of Pam putting a small revolver or razor blades in his afro. The pilot (D'Urville Martin) and his crew cannot hold a candle for some of the real villains that Pam faced in his previous films. It is strictly by numbers and almost has a look made for TV. As for bad acting, the bad guys that Pam faces are an unnatural sound in their delivery as I've seen. As a result, characters like Pilot don't make themselves as threatening or need the movie to work. <br /> <br /> It does not mean that there are no moments or elements in Sheba Baby that he did not like (Pam in a wetsuit and Pam wielding a lance gun), this is exactly when compared with other films of Pam as Coffy, Foxy Brown and even Friday Foster that the film fails. <br /> <br /> final remark - maybe I'm just more sensitive to these things after 9/11, but I don't remember a time, even in the security laxity of the 70s, when you could take a suitcase full of rifles on an airplane. When Sheba flies to his father's aid, he has an arsenal in his luggage!
