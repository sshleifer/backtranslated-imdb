Fear and desire are mainly of interest to Kubrick's obsessives, who can fathom this fake trap for the signs of his greatness to come. Kubrick was right in trying to ensure that the film was not shown or available on legitimate videos. He considered it embarrassing and amateur, and he was right in his assessment. This is a weak and boring film - at 68 minutes it seems even longer than "Barry Lyndon"! - however it is of historical interest and has its authentic and absorbing moments. It's a difficult film to find (only "unofficial" copies are in circulation), although perhaps this could change if Kubrick's estate fades and is published on video. Recommended only for Kubrick fans.
