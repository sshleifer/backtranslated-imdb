This show is just another bad comedy that will probably be canceled after two seasons. It's not just that the jokes are sexist / racist / homophobic, they're not even fun and clichés. In the first episode the Father said something like: "I wish women would not go out and find a job and have the same rights as men Then he was making fun of his son by saying he was weird. Which parent says their child is weird? So overall this show is boring, not original, offensive, cliché and above all NOT FUN. Yes, American dad is out of the game. But it also makes you laugh and is obviously taking micky. This is the difference
