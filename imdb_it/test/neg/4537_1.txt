Comedy is a tough beast to conquer. Ishimoto fails on all counts, as a writer and director. Some things, like making funny movies, must be left to the professionals. 1 out of 10. Terrible. It wasn't fun. I tried to laugh but it wasn't fun. I wasn't the only one, no one else at the Chicago festival was laughing, at least at the screening I saw. Simply bad, sorry :(
