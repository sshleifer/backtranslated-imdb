this movie really sucks, you really, really suck, this movie should be in the bottom 100, but it's so bad that almost no one has seen it vote for her so many times that it should be at the same time as "Manos - the Hands of Destiny." having him in position 1 (horrible), but the reason why I entered him 2 was for Eve, the girl from the city who, in addition to some nudity scenes, I thought I'd vote for 3, but as they killed Eve, I'm back to 2. is that films like this should not be financed by anyone, since they have not even taken fame or other productions for the main actors, great falsity, jaja, the story of a mining ghost that kills for "mansalva" and after putting an end to their misdeeds, he reappears, because with the end they have ugly very ugly. <br /> <br /> FINAL SCORE (VOTE): 2 (for the nudity and performance of the beautiful Eve)
