oh well ... it's fun. it should have been a sadistic comedy, many horror films lacked common sense, but I think a retarded caveman would make his way into the situation. Don't really expect Hitchcock or anything like that. this is a good idea for friends, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything else. this film lacks the substance of a real horror movie, of suspense, shock and good characters. the killer was not the unstoppable force that I expected him to be, and he seemed to be the average angry "D" student capable of outsmarting only stupid people. and the really funny thing is the horrible acting and the lack of emotion of the so-called "victims" <br /> <br /> 3/10 expect only this in everyday entertainment.
