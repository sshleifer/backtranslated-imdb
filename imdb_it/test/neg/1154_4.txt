Most likely "Cleopatra 2525" will be of little interest if you don't watch the series when it was broadcast; and I don't think many people have done it. But if you're still a little intrigued, it's a premise of "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" with no spaceships and no budget for wardrobe or production design. <br /> <br /> In this case the part of Buck Rogers (Cleopatra) is played by Jennifer Sky. What could be expected to be a good thing, since Jennifer is very beautiful and talented; and has a nice comic touch. But a quick look at the promotional material will show that you are somehow worse for having a bad haircut and a wardrobe of the second-hand store of salvation. If you remember how Jennifer was taken during her time in "Xena", her sloppy Cleopatra look will be a huge disappointment. With a target audience of "teenage boys trying to burn their eyes by watching" girls with a hot fetish "it's not a good idea to skimp on the exploitative value of your heroine or her costume and wonder why some series don't attract much the public, love it or hate it, "Buck Rogers" had hotter costumes and much better-looking guest stars. <br /> <br /> The other two elements of exploitation are the two associates of Cleopatra, Hel (Gina Torres basically his "Firefly" serial character) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt - another "Xena" connection - an extremely wooden version of Natasha Henstridge). Torres does a good job interpreting the character of Cleopatra, supplying most of the comic relief of the show. <br /> Torres sings the theme song, a somewhat limping parody of "In the Year 2525 (Exordium and Terminus)" by Rick Evans (1969). You remember the one that opens with the words "In the year 2525, If man is still alive, if the woman can survive, they might find ... "I suspect they gave the title its title so that they can slaughter this catchy little song even if who knows, maybe the title is a tribute to" Buck Rogers "and they thought of using the song later. <br /> <br /> Thus, the premise of the show is that the Earth's surface was conquered by aliens called Bailies (not WKRP) and humans were driven underground. Our three heroines fight against the Bailies under the direction of a female voice (presumably) disembodied (appropriately called "Voice"). Unlike Buck Rogers, Cleopatra is a bit of a weak henchman, still dazed and confused by his cryogenic sleep or perhaps just bewildered by the disturbing haircut. There are many beautiful close-ups of Sky with eyes wide and bewildered. Like "Buck Rogers", the running gag is Cleopatra who uses a common expression of the 21st century and everyone finds it totally or deeply disconcerting. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Firefly", the action is more like the "modified Xena" garbage that is neither realistic nor particularly fun. A good trick is that the girls travel around the "Spiderman" fashion, a sort of spider web that passes through tunnels and wells in the labyrinth of their underground world. <br /> <br /> Strangely (or perhaps not considering the budget) these are only half-hour episodes and with the exception of a two-part show there is not enough time for subtlety and nuances. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
