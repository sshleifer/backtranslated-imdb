He gave my ass back but probably because I was stoned. Apart from that ... this is absolutely not a horror movie, there is no horror in this whole movie and the potholes are so huge that even a person under the intelligence quotient would be considered stupid. Besides, I live in Denmark and I've been all my life and I can assure you that Denmark is too small a country so you need GPS and maps to find your way back if you get lost. I would estimate that, unless you really try, you could never be further away from the city or other people than a maximum of 3 hours on foot. Secondly, I do not think that any part of the film, apart from two Copenhagen shots in which none of the actors was present, was recorded in Denmark. The woman in the swamp speaks Swedish and not Danish. The helmet on the first bog body is brand new. The girl in the forest hides under a type of rock that does not exist in Denmark. This is simply stupid.
