This is easily the worst, the most offensive piece of shit on TV. I'd like to ignore it completely, but Fox has included it in their Sunday lineup, forcing me to find something else to watch between American Dad and Family Guy. The male stellar boy is the least evolved pathetic excuse for a human I've ever seen on TV. Nothing on the show is in the least fun and pretty much everything has already been done and much better by other shows. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that their strategy is to push it deep and hard on Sunday and hope someone starts to like it ... but I have to break it, Fox, this is the wrong hole. The scam didn't work on me - I simply look elsewhere - but come on, you're a lousy headheads, this show sucks SUCKS, and it sucks even worse compared to the rest of Fox Sunday's lineup. <br /> <br /> CANCELED DEVELOPMENT ARRESTED FOR THIS STEAM PILE?
