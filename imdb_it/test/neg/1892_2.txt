I'm not fussy about movies, oh I saw so many crap that I could see anything. Perhaps this was why I saw this until the end. I'm a big fan of role-playing games, but this movie is a shame for any self-respecting RPGer. The security camera footage of a game would make it look more realistic than this movie. The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong. In some scenes you can see that it was shot in some photos when !!!!! (spoiler in advance) !!!!! the running people do not disturb the people sitting near the computers. I mean, would you continue your job if you had ninja around you? oh and the pirate jokes, this is the worst yet in the movies !!!!! (end of spoilers) !!!!! At least the first one looked like a documentary, now it looks like someone's home video experiment. You can find better movies on youtube. Top: don't waste your time and money on it, it's as bad as it comes.
