Directed by the same Jin Ishimoto who put Neoedision and flixer.com (a once promising online movie community) temporarily out of business and off the net due to his directorial style and directing method in the next film GIRL'S BEST FRIEND . <br /> <br /> THE HOLE suffers from this cinematic style of "look at me, I'm a filmmaker" that is becoming the closest standard in today's hollywood, at the expense of content. <br /> <br /> START THE HOLE with a unique concept, but this concept and the promise of engaging content are soon destroyed by the directorial style of the "look at me" movie. <br /> <br /> There are some funny moments that still shine through fiction but it is a painful short circuit to watch. <br /> <br /> How sad it is when the new generation of "directors" chooses not to be a servant of history but rather to try and dominate on and off the screen. Heck, they don't care, as long as they get their contract in the studio, beach house and a new car, the content and presentation are secondary issues. <br /> <br /> The real sad part of all this is Hollywood embraces the "look at me" attitude so much that the whole aesthetic of cinema is changing. Rather than presenting a story in a direct way that puts history first, today's filmmakers are becoming "experimental" ie "look at me". <br /> <br /> It's me or I'm the only one who's really been put off by SENA's opening minutes of SWORDFISH. That film went beyond Sena's attempts to direct the film "look at me", unfortunately this short film by Mr. Ishimoto is not. <br /> <br /> 3 votes out of 10 of Elec TV.
