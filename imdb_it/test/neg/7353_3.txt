Why would Burt Lancaster allow himself to play a poor schnook who was eventually undermined by the femme fatale Anna Dundee, played by Yvonne DeCarlo in "Criss Cross"? The same reason why Robert Mitchum lets himself be cast as another loser who falls in love with the femme fatale Faith Domergue in the 1950 noir, "Where Danger Lives". Perhaps they both felt it was a good way to show that they had "gamma" as actors ?? that by playing against the type, the usual "hard type" role they were known for, would have improved their image as actors who could play any role. But the problem was that roles like Steve Thompson, the pathetic love patient from Criss Cross, didn't help improve Lancaster's career. Lancaster is not only completely miscible in the role of a single note by Thompson, but there is something intrinsically unpredictable (and I can say pathetic) of the main character of the film in the first place. <br /> <br /> 'Criss Cross' is an endlessly slow film. Among the many useless scenes in the film is the beginning: the flashback that recounts Thompson's fight with Dan Duryea's Dundee at the nightclub. Everything that happens in that initial flashback is explained later in the picture: the illicit affair between Steve and Anna, Steve's tense relationship with Martinez the cop and his ugly blood with Dundee. If the director Siodmark felt compelled to start the film with a flashback, why not keep it in less than three minutes? I think it would have been more effective. <br /> <br /> In "Criss Cross", it takes quite a while before the protagonist engages and steps out of the "ordinary" world of Act One. Is that the scene where she "passes" and "meets Anna" at the nightclub and notices how Siodmak spends so much time cutting back and forth between dancing Anna and Steve staring at her? In addition to the cross, he also spends a lot of time focusing on Esy Morales and His Rhumba Band that move the story along. <br /> <br /> Until the crisis of the second act, the plot limps along with Thompson having various difficult encounters with Anna and then drowning her usual water hole pains, at the midpoint of the second act, learns that Anna she escaped and married Dundee. At this point it is becoming clear that one of the main weaknesses of the film is that Dundee is never on screen during most of the second act. There are no clashes between Thompson and Dundee during this period and we were left with the rather less exciting machinations between the two lovebirds. As it turns out (and Anna 'explains' this later to Steve), the reason he left was no Just because he disappeared for eight months, but he also felt the pressure of Steve's mother and direct threats by the policeman Martinez who hinted that he would make sure it ended up in the Women's House of Detention. Anna returns to Steve because he realizes he made a big mistake with Dundee, it turns out he is beating her and now he is afraid of him. <br /> <br /> One of the silent refrains pronounced by more than one Criss Cross character is that you can never hijack an armored car. But everyone behaves so surprised when Steve points out that it can be done if it's an "internal job"! You would have thought Dundee would have known about Steve's "profession" as an armored car driver and proposed it in advance. But obviously Steve needs to make the proposal so that Dundee doesn't kill him after he finds out about his relationship with Anna (if they're so afraid of getting caught, why do Steve and Anna meet in his apartment where Dundee can find them so easily?) . I really enjoyed myself with Finchley (played by Alan Napier), the "brain" of the operation. Dundee is so stupid he has to hire this kind of alcoholic ex-professor who tracks the robbery on a map. Oh, there's the problem of getting the ingredients to build the gas bombs used during the robbery and of course Finchley is good at that too! <br /> <br /> The only scene really well made of the whole film is the robbery armored car. The assembly was quite good as it represented the growing action of a hit gone bad. As the gas bombs explode, the brutality of the band is shown in high relief when Dundee kills the innocent Car Armored Car Guard. <br /> <br /> The culmination of the film is like the rest of the film. Why does it take so long before one of Dundee's goons kidnaps Thompson? There is that nurse, so the goon is waiting outside, then he enters and pretends to be a friend, Steve falls asleep and finally after he wakes up, the goon kidnaps him. <br /> <br /> When Steve finally meets Anna at home, we wonder how Anna got her hands on the money. Did he steal it somehow in Dundee after the robbery when he went out for dinner? It was never explained Worse, Anna suddenly becomes the evil femme fatale from nothing. First, his selfishness and attraction to Dundee can be explained by his perceived rejection of Steve and Martinez's threats. But after returning to Steve because he fears Dundee, he inexplicably excites him when he's more vulnerable. Just as there is "instant coffee", you have "femme fatale instantaneous". <br /> <br /> In "Film Noir ?? An encyclopedic reference to the American style" of Silver and Ward, the authors greet Criss of Cross' as "one of the most tragic and compelling film noir". I beg to differ. To have tragedies you need characters that have a great depth and to be compelling you need a plausible story. Criss Cross has neither It is an overrated "B movie" that somehow found itself in the pantheon of art noirs. Once again, the herd mentality triumphed in evaluating images of the past.
