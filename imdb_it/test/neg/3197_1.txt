I'm watching this horrible movie as we speak. it's probably one of the worst movies ever aired in my house. I'm sitting here with 3 friends and I agree. it's not scary. it's not funny. it is not dramatic. it contains nothing attractive. we're 49 minutes into the movie. we saw only 2 creatures. only one person is dead. this film is a big disappointment. nothing about this horrible, horrible film made me want to look at the rest. I'm making a movie. I hope that anyone dealing with the making of this film dies. I don't just mean the actors. I mean the director, the producers, the presidents of the studio who financed this film. it is in full, the worst movie ever. should make the IMDb worst of 100 movies of all time. to the number 1.
