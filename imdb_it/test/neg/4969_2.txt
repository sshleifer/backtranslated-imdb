I finished watching Mandy Lane about an hour ago, and felt the urgency to come home right away and come up here to warn anyone about to spend money on the DVD - NOT. <br /> <br /> The supporting characters are superficial, the failure of the acting is superior to that of the Matthew McConaughey films and, until the end, the plot is anything but obvious. In nine out of ten, you can see the next scene that comes 5 minutes before it starts. The whole film is more or less devoid of motive or message, and the half revelation of "the murderer" simply erases the little interest you could have left at that point. What could have saved this boring and superficial film is a decent splatter, or at least a guru worthy of the "Slasher" genre - It fails there too. <br /> <br /> If you need a background movie for a party that you can jump in and out without losing anything, I suggest you buy All The Boys Love Mandy Lane. <br /> <br /> If you're trying to sit down and focus your eyes on the screen for more than 15 seconds, I don't.
