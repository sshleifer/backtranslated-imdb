OK, when I say "wow", I mean, "Jesus, please help me." I have an old VHS copy that was printed before Troma had a copy of the title. The film is about an alien incident that lands on Earth to terrorize us with a gun that blows people into oblivion. CAREFUL!!! And by that I mean to pay attention to those special effects. There are an incredible number of errors. The acting is terrible, but I would say that the only one who makes an effort would be the sheriff. The film itself is really grainy and poorly lit. In a particular scene, it is day outside and then the shot shows the Night Beast shooting at his gun with the night behind him. Then show the day again. * He shakes his head * I usually like low-budget horror movies, but I had to force myself to finish because I never watch a movie without finishing it. The only result achieved by this film was an alien that was not stereotyped. So for that, and ONLY for that ... I give him a 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie if you've had a bad day. You will be even more depressed about the failed attempt to make this film.
