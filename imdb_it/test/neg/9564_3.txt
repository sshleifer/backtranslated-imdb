It's funny how instinct alerts you to something. For example, as soon as the company's credits read Nu Image, I knew instinctively that I had seen a shit movie from them somewhere before, but I couldn't remember where. Nevertheless, I just learned that JUDGE AND JURY would have been bad and it was. Maybe I'm psychic? <br /> <br /> !!!! MOON SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The opening is quite violent with several people being swept away without more reason being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of some exploitative violence on the screen nowadays along with bad language, especially if it's spit by actors as bad as those in this movie. In any case, the plot revolves around the bad guy who is executed and who goes back to revenge on the man who shot his wife. Oh, did I mention the bad guy and his wife killed a couple of people on their wedding night? Yes, he's a serious mofo guy. In fact it is so bad (and I don't mean acting - I'll come to this in a moment) that it's impossible to take it seriously and this is before it is only performed to come back like Elton John, Elvis, a French chef etc. I wonder if Keith David was paid for this? because it seems that he enjoys so much on the screen that it is the only reason he plays the role. Too bad this reviewer never enjoyed watching JUDGE AND JURY. Hey, maybe the producers could send me Keith's commission? Gawd knows only that I deserve it. <br /> <br /> I didn't really like this movie as if I hadn't guessed it and my main meat is not with the stupid plot or the low production values ​​but with its attitude to violence. If like me you have had a bottle of wine broken on your head or you have been kicked in your ribs very strong you will sometimes know that violence is obscene and painful, but JUDGE AND JURY will make you believe that if you throw a window, you will crash through some railings and falling twenty feet on a table it will not only hurt you, but you will be able to beat a couple of rabid devil dogs. It could obviously be argued that any film with Sly, Arnie or Bruce also suffers from this same dishonest manifestation of violence but with JUDGE AND JURY has pulled my chain
