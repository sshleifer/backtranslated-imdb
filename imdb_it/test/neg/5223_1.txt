Recently I had the idea of ​​making a short film with a man who gets hit by a car and wakes up thinking he's Chuck Norris himself. This meant that I would have to do extensive research on Chuck and find out as much as I could about man. Later I discover that he is not really a man, but an angel sent from heaven. With such a face, who could ever doubt it? I've seen more Chuck Norris movies in the last four months than any person should. I am proud to say that Bells of Innocence ranks quite close to the top of the worst list of all time. I spent most of the movie wondering if I could return my copy to the local Wal-Mart without the receipt, that I kept biting myself so as not to swallow my tongue. The main reason I chose to buy this film is that not only Chuck, but his son Mike. I was anxious to see if Mike was a chip from the old wet paper bag block. I came to the conclusion a long time ago; Chuck Norris is one of the worst actors in the history of cinema for a simple reason. The only character he plays is himself, Chuck Norris. No matter what movie, no matter what situation, it's always Chuck Norris. The only thing he has about his son is that he is consistent. Mike doesn't seem to understand how human emotions work. In the scene where he's talking to his dead daughter's baby, he seems to be extremely happy! Perhaps because he pushed his daughter through traffic, as depicted in one of the most bizarre flashbacks of all time. His actions confused me throughout the film, making it very difficult for me to concentrate on that little plot that was there. The other two main actors were just as painful to watch as the son of Norris. The boy, who constantly wants to eat or tell a stupid peacock joke, was simply one of the most annoying characters that has ever graced the Direct-to-Video screen. The only thing I remember being in another film was an episode of Walker Texas Ranger, in which he plays an equally annoying character. Maybe Chuck owes something to this guy. The other boy, who is the only name I can think of because he was so forgettable, was your average Christian fanatic. I have nothing against Christians, in fact I am one, but this boy was too much for me. To complete the story, you have a multitude of citizens who like to call people "friends" and a couple of villains who don't seem able to decide which of them is responsible. Not to mention the creepy children who remind me of the dollar store version of every other group of scary kids in movies. All in all, the film is probably one of the greatest failures of all time, at multiple levels of Chuck Norris who can kick people's asses. Despite being one of the worst actors of all time, I can't get enough of Chuck. Maybe it was really sent from heaven ...
