I admit it now. This is one of the blandest films ever made. But, in Mr Sjogrens' defense, the "Not really" -scene was not bad at all! <br /> <br /> And you must love the effort to go all the way to Sweden only to find a sweet 15-year-old Swedish blonde, make her speak in Swedish like Henry's Jewish mother (dennis hopper). <br /> <br /> What makes this scene so perfect is that Henrys's father responds to the Swedish-speaking blonde girl (Jewish?) in German ... <br /> <br /> The best actor / actress of all in the film must be the nun who takes care of Henrys's mother, this is a woman who has never had any acting experience, but still puts the most convincing performances of all! <br /> <br /> Everything and everyone, this film is nostalgia for me personally, after all it is what gave me a post in the IMDb database. : D <br /> <br /> // Feelin like a movie star *
