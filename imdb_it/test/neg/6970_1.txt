Considering the film's reputation as the worst of the worst, I couldn't wait to watch Wood's Crappus Opus (my word); it is not necessarily more inept than the other Woods I have seen - however, being from the REEFER MADNESS (1938) film production school, GLEN OR GLENDA does not present itself as "pleasant" as its gender efforts. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, this surely emerges as the horror legend Bair Lugosi's nadir (his first of three "collaborations" with the director): one wonders if he was really aware of the type of film he was ( considering the history of the actor of heavy drugs and the pure senselessness of his cameo). Moreover, the idiosyncratic expression of Lugosi is perhaps somewhat embarrassing here ... although Wood's script is mostly to blame for this - given the impossible dialogue (with repeated absurd allusions to "baby tails" and "big snails") ) delivered the sick star! By the way, Wood himself plays the central role (under the pseudonym of Daniel Davis) - and, not being equally useless in this area, he proves to have been a well-rounded dog! Dolores Fuller - his wife and co-star - was equally talented (she would also have appeared in JAIL BAIT [1954]) ... but, at the very least, the image in which she finally lets Glen wear his angora sweater gave Tim Burton the biopic affection ED WOOD (1994) his famous poster! <br /> <br /> Incidentally, this last film presents a supposedly fictionalized meeting between Wood and Orson Welles - well, for all intents and purposes, GLEN OR GLENDA constitutes the CITIZEN KANE by Ed Wood (1941) given its cheerful propensity for deceptive narrative techniques: in fact, the shorter thread of the plot is filled with abundant quantities of repertoire material (many of them irrelevant, such as the disconcerting instances of S & M) and inane dream sequences (highlighted by the presence of a fluffy demon who shows off thick and outrageous eyebrows that would make Martin Scorsese cry with envy! The film's sincere attempt to invoke tolerance and psychological probing on the affliction / phenomenon of disguise is, however, sabotaged at every turn by the simple enjoyment of the 'approach. <br /> <br /> For what it's worth, the edition I saw the "Extended Re-issue Version" which included six minutes of "depraved" footage (directed by W. Merle Connell) censur talk about the original version! Also, my copy went out of sync every once in a while (which forced me to rewind it slightly to get the audio back on track) - although, fortunately, this was the mistake of converting the DivX source code to the movie same.
