Feeling Minnesota is one of the worst films I've ever seen, it's also one of the most disgusting films ever made. It has to do with a woman forced to marry a disgusting man. At the wedding he meets his brother Jjaks. They have sex at home after eating the cake they decide to run off together. The other brother, of course, comes after him with guns on fire and kills his wife. Jjaks wakes up to find his body in the bathtub and bury it. He seems to be friends with Jjaks and they try to make money together because someone is blackmailing them because he saw them and the body. This circulates and many characters die or come back to life, but it is never combined with something that could be called a good plot. The performances are horrible to almost everyone. Cameron Diaz, Keanu Reeves and Dan Akroyed. Direction, dialogue and visual effects are simply horrible. A disgusting and horrible film.
