Maybe I was young when I saw it. Maybe I didn't grow up with the Grease and Elvis movies. <br /> <br /> I couldn't figure it out. I get a "black" comedy (Black Adder etc.). I get the irony and the bad words. But I don't have this. <br /> <br /> I did a search to find out the name of this movie (enlisting the help of people on usenet and the most famous IMDb forums) so it could be my first pointer 1. Terrible!
