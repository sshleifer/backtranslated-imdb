Never before has such a large cast of ugly people gathered to make an equally ugly film. <br /> <br /> Something huge and horrible is free in the waters off the coast of Florida, something that leaves half of the bodies chewed behind in its wake. Bob dependent on unshaven beer thinks he has captured the "evil voice" of Thing on tape. Bob's assistant, the astonishing and unattractive Stella, decides to enlist the help of the slimy Mr. Peter, an electrician whose equipment might be able to help them locate the mysterious creature. But anyone who gets too close to the mystery ends up dead, killed by an assassin with a bad permanent. What is the terrible secret behind the Sea Killer? <br /> <br /> Ugly scientists have torrid affairs, inept cops and doctors who rack their brains on the growing number of corpses, Stella and Peter go out to the beach and characters that we don't mind are killed or chewed. The Sea Killer, a strange combination of an octopus, a shark and a pair of large dentures, never seems as threatening as it should. The conspiracy behind the creation of the monster makes absolutely no sense. None of the characters is particularly nice, and those that could be killed immediately. This is a wrong shot, badly retorted, less mess plot. The whole thing is so rude and smelly that it made me want a hot bath. I had scarier sushi dishes than this movie. Avoid it, unless it's the MST3K version.
