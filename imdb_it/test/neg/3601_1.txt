This is the worst waste of time I have ever experienced. not even close to the first. The plot is difficult to follow - the plot was weak - at best. It all sounded like three stories looking for a way to tie them together and make a movie. It had some good lines here and there - and the attempt to convey the message was admirable, but they went from Houston to New York to get to Dallas. It was really hard to tell what time period the present took. The film was just over an hour and it seemed we were sitting there watching the movie all afternoon. Mayve indicates he is honest - but a child should not do everything Kronk felt he had to do. Do yourself a favor - look at Kuzco again.
