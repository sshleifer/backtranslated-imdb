This film was a film that was anything but exciting. It was a non-moving story that surely does not make you think of anything other than where all the strong material that other critics say about the movie is The 3 main actors are good, and there is some laughter but once again it becomes a another film that you keep watching in the hope that it will improve and it doesn't. I saw this movie last night and I wished we hadn't lost any precious time (while the baby is sleeping) watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I am going to not recommend this to my family and friends, as well as of course to anyone trying to rent it. I was pretty impressed with everything about this movie.
