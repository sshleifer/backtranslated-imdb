No one can say that he was not warned because I read the reviews (both user and external), but like most of us attracted by horror movies ... this cat got curiosity. (Come on, we all shout at the people in the movie not to enter the dark room, but you know that horror fans always die from the desire to know what's in there even if we know it will be bad). <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this movie has left me angry. Not because it pretends to be real (who cares ... tricks are allowed), or because the actors and dialogues are so disgusting (is it an unusual event in horror movies?) Or even because the film is so ugly (and I i am being polite here). What really drove me crazy is that the film is not just a BWP rip-off, but also a lukewarm and lazy rip-off to that. <br /> <br /> I don't believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could pass BWP and then their compliments, but they didn't even try. The film was made with little effort or attention and this is the most unpardonable sin of the horror movie (or any)!
