I should explain that with regards to this tendency to snatch Asian horror films, this Shutter is a head above The Grudge, and Dark Water, while not getting the same amount of disturbing atmosphere that The Ring establishes. <br /> <br /> However, films, like life, do not exist in a vacuum and are therefore to be compared with other suspense / thriller / horror films. Honestly, I am not writing a long synopsis here and I will say that this film tries to rely on the "scared" music rather than the atmosphere, and the "ghost" itself is not that extraordinary. The plot is rather simple and predictable and there is nothing to say about it. While there are some suspense scenes that border on fear creatively, most of the film is rather vanilla. If you liked The Grudge and this is your case, you might like it. <br /> <br /> Vote: C-
