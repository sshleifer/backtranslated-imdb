Humor is non-existent in this film loser. Carrot Top plays a surfer inventor who constantly blows his rent money on his silly useless inventions. Then he helps an old guy hit the roadside, and voila, he inherited a large corporation. And ahead and forwards and forwards jealous relatives, humanizing society, hostile acquisitions, obligatory love interest .. aargh ... let's just say that this film is practically unwatchable. What Carrot Top has done is to convince me never to go to his theater shows.
