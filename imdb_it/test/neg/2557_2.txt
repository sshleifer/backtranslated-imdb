I thought that maybe a film that boasted a cast including Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig and Harry Andrews could be worth watching. Alas, I was wrong. Assert fake absurdities from beginning to end, with O'Toole and York shaking wildly. I looked at it twice and I still have no idea what it is. I have the feeling that O'Toole plays the Laird of a Scottish castle that has a problem with drinks and loves to relive childhood games with his sister (York). He's also barking mad. But apart from that, your hypothesis is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> The film has no saving feature whatsoever. I can only assume that the cast and director have been blackmailed into making this bad dish, without imagination and seasoned. Clearly a waste of time for a talented cast and director. Laughable.
