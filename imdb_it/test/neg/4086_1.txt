The only thing that redeems this film is Steve Carell. Like John Wayne, I've never seen Steve Carell go too far as an actor, but it doesn't matter. He has always played his role perfectly. <br /> <br /> As Marty Feldman once said, the comedy must have internal consistency. You can have 4 men on stage sitting in garbage cans, and that's fine, but if you bring a fifth man on stage who isn't in a garbage can, then you have to explain to the public why he isn't in a garbage can . <br /> <br /> Why doesn't Evan accept his role as God's messenger? Why, when he accepts it, is he so deeply embarrassed by it? Because nobody is more impressed by the way the animals follow Evan around (they are explained by the doubters who don't think like "animals trained" perhaps by a circus). There is a terrible flood at the end, and most of us all see the hop on the ark and it is saved, but surely thousands of people would have been killed by the flood; there is no post-disaster emotional atmosphere at the end. Instead, most of the congress has finally seen the light and is about to pursue the solitary incorrigible parliamentarian for "profit". I have to admit: I also liked the fish in the aquarium that reacted to Evan's presence.
