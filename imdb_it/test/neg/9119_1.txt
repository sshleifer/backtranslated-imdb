Were it not for the fact that this came as a 2-dvd set paired with the original American Graffiti; were it not for the fact that I have been here in Iraq for several months and, at this point, I will watch practically everything, I would have thrown this film in the garbage after the first ten minutes. This film was terribly bad on so many levels that I don't know where to start. Poorly acted, shot, directed, written, marked, modified. My first 9-year-old daughter's forays into film production are superior to this - and she was filming the sleeping dog. (Come to think of it, I give that piece of cinematography 9 stars, but I'm biased). If you also have the slightest appreciation for making quality films, avoid this piece of junk at all costs. No character in this film has only one saving quality saved for the Icelandic girl who doesn't even have a single line in English. I won't waste any more time describing what a bad movie is.
