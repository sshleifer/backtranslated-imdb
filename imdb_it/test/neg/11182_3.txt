On the purely theatrical side, Last Stand was great, since the re-enactments and the soundtrack are a lot of fun, but there are better accounts of this battle found elsewhere that, although not so long or flashy, are much more historically complete. <br /> <br /> Some small details, like the improper use of the word "hoplon" for the Greek hoplite shield and the mispronounces of various names and words, really ate me. <br /> <br /> My hypothesis would be, because "Last Stand of the 300" aired on the eve of the theatrical release of "300", the History Channel was just trying to ride the heights of the movie clamor. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a historically accurate representation in all possible aspects, you would have better luck elsewhere.
