"TNT Jackson" is not completely unwatchable. But either the version I saw on DVD was modified with a weed-whacker, or the script itself is the lowest level of grinding sausage / blaxploitation. Or maybe both. <br /> <br /> Jeanne Bell should have been a Playmate at some point in her career, and the film takes full advantage of the connection by showing her breasts at least twice as much as was really necessary (including a scene of hilarious topless wrestling that I'm pretty sure had to be fun). I have to admit that they are very nice. However, he has a medium appearance and does not have the charisma of a Foxy Brown, not even a Cleopatra Jones. She does have her moments as an actress in the film, though, but it would have been nice if the director had pushed her a little harder or the script had given her the chance to do more than emulate "attitude" and kick her people. <br /> <br /> Speaking of kicking people, the fight scenes (the other supposed reason for watching a movie like this) are pretty bad. There is no real choreography to talk about here, only people who pose and stick feet and punches in the general direction of their opponents. A minor exception is a beautiful moment with an opponent equipped with butterfly knives; another is a sequence near the end where an obvious double stunt for Bell (and perhaps for Stan Shaw) jumps around and makes some decent sweeps and bases for a minute or two before Bell / "Jackson" hits his liver enemy, Shaw collapses and the script stops. (Again, I admit that this is very much in the tradition of Shaw Brother's quickies from time immemorial). <br /> <br /> There are a couple of secondary actors that are actually better than the movie deserves (I'm thinking of "Joe" and the partner who plays the drug lord's right arm). There is a soundtrack full of funk halfway that completes the action on the screen and adds a star to the evaluation by itself. There is a semi-dodgy sex scene that manages to be effective almost in spite of itself. <br /> <br /> This is strictly for hardcore blaxploitation enthusiasts. I saw it out of pure curiosity, and I don't mind having found the time. But I can't imagine wanting to take the time to see it again unless he decides to write a dissertation on the intersections of pop culture in "Kung Fu Theater" and "Foxy Brown".
