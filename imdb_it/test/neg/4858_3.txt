This 22-minute short, apart from a precursor of the last much better "Rock and Rule", presents two mice folk singers who go nowhere. The female mouse, Jan, signs a deal with the devil to become a successful rock star. So it's up to Daniel Mouse to save his soul. Made in the late 1970s, this one has all the traps of this decade (shit music, shitty clothes and hairstyle, horrible folk melodies). This comic is present in the second disc of the 2 disc edition of "Rock and Rule", it also comes with a Making of that lasts almost as long as the show itself. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
