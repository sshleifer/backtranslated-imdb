This would probably be a good movie to watch .... as long as you have already seen all the other existing films and have thoroughly explored the navels of yourself and those around you. God, this movie was incredibly insipid, with some of the worst (or non-existent) scriptures ever captured in the movie. There is no grace for this film; even the animatronics are a bit crippled, and it's just a complete waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Run. Fast. It's beyond horrible. <br /> <br />
