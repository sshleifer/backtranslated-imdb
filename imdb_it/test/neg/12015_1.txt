"Problem Child 2" was a total waste of my time. The original film was not very good but it is a classic compared to this film. The first film went over the top with scenes of a diabolical child who destroyed the greatest chaos in the lives of everyone around him. Here, it goes even higher. And a scene in this film demonstrates this theory. That sequence of the carnival ride was too much for me from the stomach. It's horrible. This film should not have been made. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
