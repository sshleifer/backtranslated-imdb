a really terrible movie about a 30 meter long shark. bad story bad discussions bad characters bad plot even a complete confusing ending. a lifetime of time in my point of view I thought it was a TV movie, but then I saw that I couldn't imagine having paid to see this shit load, please avoid this movie at any cost. even if you liked the jaws, which I did on average, don't see it even if you have interests in paleontology, don't see it even if you like sad films with mischievous actors, banal plots during the time of the horny TV, make humanity a favor and not, I repeat, DO NOT pollute your mind with this ridiculous excuse for a science fiction thriller yet, some people gave a joke of ten ... I don't know if they were serious or not (but honestly they expect they weren't)
