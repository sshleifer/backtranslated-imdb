I must say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, I can't believe I wasted $ 10 on the blockbuster; this film should be burned and those who have ever thought of it have problems. Who ever spent money on making this film was crazy = D This film has TERRIBLE actors and some scenes make absolutely no sense. Well, the whole movie doesn't make sense. Even the part where those "men" enter the diner (department of national titles) which was the worst part of the film. How dare he say the name of Frank Sinatra in vain? Also, what's up with those glasses? When the boy and the girl are in the car and she "drinks" water, you can say that she is not even drinking! Also, what's up with the freaky dinner guy. And everyone knows that you don't stab the tires, the cutters.
