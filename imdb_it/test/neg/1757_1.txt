Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renne Zelwigger. They are all horrible. Especially the star, Jude Law. <br /> <br /> It is directed by the same boy who made the English patient and is based on a best-selling novel by a man who risks everything to return to his lover but unlike the wonderful English mess, this film sucks . It's really bad. <br /> <br /> The worst dialogue ever. "But we only know each other for a moment" "But they were a thousand moments, like diamonds in a bag" <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> "In some cultures you only have to say that I marry you 3 times and you are married "lovey-dovey-" I marry you, I marry you, I marry you, I marry you ... "<br /> <br /> I'm ashamed I sat through everything. <br /> <br /> the whole movie was horrible, horrible ... Ughh no words, I'm sick. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (the one is for the really strong bullet sounds, the sound crew did a good job)
