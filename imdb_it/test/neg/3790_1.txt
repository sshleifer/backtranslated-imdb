I think I finally saw the worst movie ever made, and it hurts to say it. As a big fan of independent cinema, gay or not, I had high hopes. A few minutes into the film, however, the sheriff appeared and I have my vote for the worst actor of this or any other century. His performance and the dialogue he was forced to perform caused me the unusual step of stopping the DVD on his track. A few hours later, when I broke the courage to press the play button again, it was no better. <br /> <br /> In addition to the sheriff and his racist deputies, the film has an attractive cast for which I felt sincere sympathy since they had such a miserable script. The idea behind the film is fine - using the lynching of homosexuals in the "New South" in the same way that it was used on black men in the Old South, leaving "strange fruits" hanging from trees. <br /> <br /> With a skilled writer and director, we could have had a movie. Instead we get a fake detective job, banality on homosexuality and a clich√© with the only good white man trying to save the situation. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that racism continues to thrive. The FBI is investigating a white school bus driver in the woods at the back of Louisana who forced black children to get on the back of the bus. But this city is a cartoon, and it's hard to believe everything you see or hear. <br /> <br /> There are some subplots in a weak attempt to try to make the main character more three-dimensional, but for the most part, they fail miserably. <br /> <br /> For the real masochists, the DVD contains some deleted scenes that will let you run to the shelter. <br /> <br /> It is probably the first film that makes me believe that a writer / director should pass a test and get a license before he can make a film. Although I can't wait to see many of the cast members in the best films, I would be driven to testify to something else by this director.
