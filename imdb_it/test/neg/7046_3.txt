It's really a pity that there has been so much controversy around this image (in other words, the infamous affair between Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini), which has attracted a lot of attention on a truly forgettable movie. The story is incredibly slow, economical and uninteresting. And finally, the film is full of amateur actors who barely speak English. I really would have preferred the subtitles - it would have made the experience less tiring. Back to marching acting. The neo-realist movement was great in Italy at the time this film was made. Many of these films are absolute masterpieces (like Umberto D. from De Sica, I bambiniset and Miracolo a Milano) because they have achieved so much from non-professional actors. They behaved like normal people, but in Stromboli they behave like normal people. They try to be actors and they go very badly, like children in a school play. <br /> <br /> By the way, ... if you hope the film has a good ending (making your time commitment to the film so important), DON'T worry. The plot was absolutely not engaging and silly, so much so that I discovered that I could care less about the characters. Like the island where everyone lives, the film is desolate and without color or life.
