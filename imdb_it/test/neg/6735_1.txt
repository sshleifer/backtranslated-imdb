If I could have given this movie at 0/10, and this is the first film I wanted to vote so low. It's worse than terrible. If I went to see it at the cinema, I'd like the cinema to pay ME to watch it (at least the minimum wage). Some of the camera shots were quite effective, but many were garbage for example. Reflexes in a mirror that separates the head and shoulders from his body (see is believing). Several killings of innocent civilians totally useless. 2 murders that made me laugh out loud due to the victim's actions / facial expressions when they were shot. I only looked at it until the end (about 10 minutes fast forward of the boring, meaningless dialogue) hoping to see Seagal in a discreet hand-to-hand fight, but there was almost nothing of that (I had to know when I first he threw someone down an elevator and was shown in slow motion with the music - end of the 'action' scene). In one scene we see Seagal's hand cut off someone's neck in slow motion, which makes it clear that his hand never even made contact). The bad boss keeps coming back to life. He is hit in the chest on 2 different occasions. The first time is with a gun that pushes him out of the 2nd and 3rd floor onto the road. To sum up, this film is a total waste of time and a total joke. It looks like a very low budget (even for Seagal). The color is opaque and gray. I could go on and on .... just like this movie, but I won't. Watch this movie if you have insomnia. It is guaranteed to put you to sleep.
