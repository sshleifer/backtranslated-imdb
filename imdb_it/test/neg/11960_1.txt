Ken Shamrock is destroyed. (does not die that is sad). 4. It leaves you wanting more ... aspirin. 5. The creators of the film are the kind of people who don't care about their monster.

The Scarecrow uses a volleyball pole like a javelin and impales the guy who doesn't actually play the guitar or sing. 9. The Scarecrow can choke a guy in about 3 seconds. 10.
