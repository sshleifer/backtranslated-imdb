One commentator said that if you like Austin Powers you will like this movie. I liked Autin Powers and was disappointed with this movie. The film works hard, maybe too hard for laughter. Maybe it was that all the villains in this movie screamed as if the scream itself was fun. I go where they were trying to go with this movie. A cross between Zorro and the Scarlet Pimpernel, but it doesn't work. Austin Powers foolish but clever, Zorro the Gay Blade lacks the Austin Powers savvy, The Big Lebowski or Kingpin. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for a laugh and as I waited I was surprised that someone had been paid for the script. My 15-year-old daughter also thought the film was flat. My seventeen year old who selected this film came out after 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> It seems that many people on IMDb have enjoyed this movie, but for me it lacked the good timing or the jokes of a good play.
