But I can't say how I really feel about this stack of steaming dung. Where to start The quality of the film, there is none. I've seen clearer images on FUNNIEST home movies in America! The acting is below standards, the effects of blood are in place. The clown mask is the best part of this film, the story is repetitive. The same thing over and over again. At least on a Friday THE 13TH or HALLOWEEN we mostly stick with a main character. There are no main characters, only victims. Friend, now we get to the worst part of all. The last survivor kills the clown and discovers that he was one of his friends. Then when the police finally arrive, they don't believe her and she's locked up in a rubber room. What kind of ending you call it, shit, that's what. In my opinion, there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie, it was just sloppy writing. The excuse "must end badly, it is a horror film". or "We must end badly to leave it open to a sequel" are just stupid excuses and that's it. I have to give CAMP BLOOD TURKEY THANKS.
