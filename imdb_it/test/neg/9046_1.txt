This film contains real animals killed, like a monkey that was eaten by a snake and a crucifix was opened. I find this totally unbalanced and sick, and I seriously question the mental health of the director of this junk. <br /> <br /> This movie is so stupid and silly, that it has no logic. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of tits and sex in this movie, but don't worry about seeing this garbage for this, if you want to see tits and sex, watch a porn. There are also scenes of rape in this film, which I found disgusting, as women were raped, cut and eaten. This film is for sadists and for those who take football, seeing people cut and eat. <br /> <br /> Many of the animals, like the monkey that appears in this film, there is none in the jungle of New Guinea. Local characters, many of them looked Asian and no one seems to come from New Guinea. It looks like this movie was made around a resort, and I bet it was. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this junk, sick and unbalanced.
