This is another one of those films that I remember from when I was a child and recently I managed to get it via ebay - 20 years later, it's not even remotely as beautiful as I remember it. <br /> <br /> The story is a "vaguely" kicked off, from a "cosmic event" (there is another extra member of the film crew in the credits for the "development of a weak story") which makes collective ants extremely intelligent. The species of ants that used to quarrel among themselves have ceased rivalry and are now working together. The thing I wanted to know was, TO DO EXACTLY? Never find out what they want. Nigel Davenport and his companion travel to the desert where a bizarre activity of the ants was noted and they begin to study ants from an impregnable igloo-shaped laboratory. Probably the most chilling scene in my opinion was when the two scientists visited the giant crop square (like a square version of a crop circle) as a result of the biting ants. <br /> <br /> This film was not very scary simply because you don't know whether to fear the ants or like them. All you know is that ants want people to leave the area so they can get on with their hijinks, but don't find out if they are really bad. It is not a sci-fi because the explanation of the cosmic event is too vague to be properly taken into account. It is deffo more than a cooler. TBH the flares, the silly hairstyles, the tight-fitting shirts with the big collars and the unnaturally large facial hair of Nigel Davenports make me crazy more than the ants! Have you noticed that there are only six actors listed in the credits? Yes, that's right - YOU ARE, and you will not see any other human being in this film. Not even in the distance! This is clearly a low budget movie that is a little watchable because you probably haven't seen one like it. I can't think of it anyway. The filming of the ants is pretty good, they must have done months and months of filming before they got the shots they needed to stay in the movie. You could say to yourself "how the hell do they take the ants?" over and over again, but it's all quite simple. You will also notice that the filmmakers have sacrificed millions of innocent lickle ants to make the film, so animal rights peek at STAY AWAY! Good for the value of the novelty, but you may not see it more than once.
