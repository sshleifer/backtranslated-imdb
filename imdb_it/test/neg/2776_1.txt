In the Muslim country of Khalid (imaginary), his benevolent leader / dictator, Reed Hadley in the role of Amir, is dying of cancer. Amir dies and a desperate plot unfolds. His body is wrapped in aluminum foil and carried into a clandestine operation (the population does not know of his death) composed by his doctor (Nigserian) and Mohammed, outside the country to perform a risky brain transplant. The surgery is performed by Dr. Kent Taylor, who believes there is no chance of failure and has two assistants. One of them is about 3 feet tall (Master Blaster has actually performed Barter Town) and the other is a mutilated and traumatized 7-foot giant called Gor. What could go wrong? <br /> <br /> I forgot to mention Amir's deathbed, the blonde American Barbie, Tracy or that Dr. What about a brain transplant you didn't take? There's a lot of double-sided games in this and people are killed, but I'm not going to lie to you again: MISSION MADE. The end justifies the means. If you can accept it, you won't have to waste 80 minutes. I hope it's enough warning. Don't say I didn't warn you. If you have to look, don't look alone and have lots of medicines waiting. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
