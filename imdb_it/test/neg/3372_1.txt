Jack Frost 2 was a horrible, terrible, sadly pathetic excuse for a sequel to a great film. The original was a low-budget horror movie about a murdered man who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste. And the snowman went around killing people and avoiding hair dryers like the plague. This, however, was very different from the quality of the original. It seems that this also had a lower budget because for some reason, after an hour in this film, I had not yet seen the snowman. A sort of revenge he is receiving if it is always in the form of ice cubes with a background voice and a bit of shaking the cooler in which he rests to give the character animation. Disappointing for no conviction, even for a fan of bad cinema.
