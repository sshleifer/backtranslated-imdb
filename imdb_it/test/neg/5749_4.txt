A wallflower is thrown into the sea and you dream in a pirate fantasy like a damsel in love with a pirate's apprentice. Energetic and good-natured, perhaps, but a poor business; a failed musical expatriation of "The Pirates of Penzance" with an economic feeling, from a backlot, songs of bubblegum swollen and constant, apparently exaggerated. The film career of Kristy McNichol has taken a real success after this, while the leading man Christopher Atkins fails to capture any particular emotion, his voice wobbling in search of an appropriate tone. You have to ask yourself, if this is the best title they could invent, what is the level of wit that will be in the current script? The "Grease" affection of the film for the musicals does not gel with his predilection for the "Airplane!" For the most part, it's an embarrassment. * 1/2 from ****
