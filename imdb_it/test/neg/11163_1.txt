It claims to be the life of Paul the apostle. He opens with him involved in a fight for the loin fight with a priest. The Pharisees were so named because they "separated" from Hellenism forced by the Jews by their kind rulers. The point is that Saul would never have been involved in the Greco-Roman struggle. PERIOD. <br /> <br /> Then we have the two men (Saul and the Priest, Reuben - a totally extra-biblical fictional character) who are shown being naked in a Roman-style bathroom. Again, the Torah, which Saul adhered religiously, condemned in the strongest possible terms by looking at the nakedness of another man. <br /> <br /> Ruben is shown as the one who pushes Saul to destroy the church. Again, the text of the scriptures does not matter, for them it is PAUL who says he devastated the church and expiated threats and massacres against the church. <br /> <br /> The film shows Barnabas "sprinkling" Paul - not baptizing him (dipping him), when the Text of Scripture says that it was Ananias who did it. <br /> <br /> Theirs is not a reference to Mark or his turning back so the writers of the script are obliged to have Paul and Barnabas discuss Paul's desire to preach in Rome as the basis of their separation. <br /> <br /> No Silas on the second and third mission of Paul; No Timothy ... NEVER. No Titus; No Apollo ... No, NO, NOOOO !!! It is said that James "had known Jesus for a long time" rather than saying, as the text of the Scriptures says, that he is the brother of Jesus. <br /> <br /> Because it is not enough to call the film "Frank, the fictitious apostle ?!?! "At least this would be closer to the text of the Scriptures.
