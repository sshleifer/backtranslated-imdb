When I saw that Icon was on TV, I was surprised. I know the first clue where it was headed was the fact that it was on the Hallmark canal - I have to say - sorry !! I was confident when I saw that FF itself was the Exec Producer, but I saw very quickly that the only real way the TV movie and the book were similar were only in the name and names of the characters. The television plot was a ho-hum to say the least, but I agree that in and of itself, the action was worth a 3-star rating. In my personal opinion, Swayze could have played a good Monk, but I think that to do justice to the film, it would have been a much longer film, and I don't think Hollywood itself would have gone to the subterfuge discrediting plot. A case in point is the terrible film version of The Sum of All Fears - should I add anything else?
