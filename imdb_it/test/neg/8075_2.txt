Stephen King TV movies can go to 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? So why give Stooges only 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS mini series, but would a two parter kill someone? The film was taken up by events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that may have been omitted. I want to say hello to the stars' performances ... they had a hard job because they didn't really look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there. After watching the movie, I pulled out a tape from American Movie Classics that got the real deal and I enjoyed laughing. The film was rather emotional from an emotional point of view, especially after Curly had a stroke and Moe needed to keep the business going. When Curley started crying, I lost it ... Like I said, the movie was good, but it could have been and SHOULD have been much, much better. Maybe it's appropriate ... the Stooges were robbed when they were alive and now, 25 years later, it still happens.
