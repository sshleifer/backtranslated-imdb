When I first saw it I thought it was a bit scary. But the horror is a little undermined by the fact that teenage dozes are so irritating that you don't really care what happens to them. There are some really good moments like Angela's speech about demons, and the demon briefly seen is effective. But this actually does not hold up to repeated views or close analyzes. It's all a bit sticky, economically and often even silly, pornography and unconventional jokes that too often replace horror. The music is excellent, however, and the epilogue is certainly fun, but this film doesn't have much to recommend, it simply looks like another type of Jason-type stem-and-slash.
