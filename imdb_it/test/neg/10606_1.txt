Being a fan of the series I thought, how bad can the movie be? Well I got my answer. Some films should never be made. Why call it a remake of the series when the only similarities are that there are three main characters. The character of Pete in the series was not a small child seen in the film. The only good thing about this film, besides the music, and that Clare Danes is pretty, was that it was short. What's in that dance scene ??? The only reason I didn't get out of this movie is because it was so bad that it became fun. Maybe that was the plan! It's really bad when a cheap 1960s TV show is better than a 90-million-dollar movie. El Mariachi costs only $ 7000 and is a much better film. Don't waste your money even when it comes out on tape, it's not even worth renting.
