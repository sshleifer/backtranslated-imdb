The production year says it all. The film is a pillaging mess of a politically correct and authoritarian left-wing feminist nonsense, of a symbolic variety so heavy that it now appears ridiculous. Each scene aims to shed light on one of the burning issues of society, mainly the role of women in the working community, the role of women over men, women as sexual objects, consumerism, politics, war, etc. Each scene is commented on by the inner dialogue of one of the main actresses, or by transforming the scene into a surreal joke. I have no recollection of any plot, or of who the main characters really were. It is the kind of film, in which consumerism is derided by having a couple making love in a window of a furniture store while the sales agent gives his speech, or where an interview revealing a theatrical actress turns into an all-round act of striptease, for "Of course" the offensive gentlemen of the press are up to a vulgar club audience. Then we move fast, because we need to see the war explode in a peaceful forest, we need to see more public inflammatory feminist speeches that have drowned in the (male) blowing of car horns or tumultuous crowds, and of course we need to see Stalin's newsreels cinema and all the other usual suspects. You have an idea. But all this has no importance. The film is an unsurpassable eyecandy piece for all (male) fans of Ingmar Bergman. A film that boasts boasts Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom at the height of their beauty makes this reviewer surrender completely and simply drivel ?? and I delight in watching them so generously use their acting skills in a film I had never heard of before today. It is hard to believe how in particular the face of Bibi Andersson is the owner of the screen whenever it appears. Cinematography is a beautifully orchestrated bh, which often enjoys an overexposed white (?) Without dimensions, and you never tire of watching artists. It is absurd that a film made with so much attention to the feminist agenda, which tirelessly supports that women should not be seen as a mere object of desire, has nothing better to offer the spectator of the 21st century than a parade of girls extraordinarily beautiful. As mentioned, I'm not complaining. I could see him again tomorrow.
