I say "flick" because this does not deserve the title "movie", and certainly not "film". I regret paying the rent, and even though I've never seen a movie before, it would have been like that, had I seen it in a theater. A society that lives underground in the future (oooh, it's original), a lot of barrels thrown into flames, inexplicable ambient light that shines through the windows, an ungrateful woman and her shocked son ... the list could go on and on . C. Thomas Howell strikes the hoarse voice of the stereotyped solitary; you know how Eastwood was done to death. He needs special sunglasses to remember his wife and son, but in flashbacks he's the same age! Talk about a poor memory! I stared incredulously when little Abe randomly pushes a code into a door and opens it! No tension, concise religious (which religion?) Under / overtones ... the saddest of all: I expected better from Roddy Piper; <br /> <br /> Most likely the worst cinematic experience of my life.
