One of York Entertainment's most recent (disasters) films, "El Chupacabra" excels in making his viewer want to die after losing him two hours watching him. It seems that this film was filmed with a backup camera normally used for birthday parties. The only reason I could say that it wasn't was because of some scenes where the cameraman's shadow is in the frame. <br /> <br /> Almost every aspect of the cinema is plagued by this film, and I'm sure it brought the film industry back another ten years. Actors are delayed to the limit, often stopping while they wait for the off-screen cue-card to change. The actor who plays Navarro not only insults and skips word in his dialogue, but stumbles across the plot of Swiss cheese with a cross-eyed and confused look on his face. Other actors break the wall and overall show the acting ability of a twelve-year-old boy doing a scientific project in his backyard. <br /> <br /> My friends and I intentionally look for the worst movies possible, and this gave us more than we expected. The humorous parts are not funny and the rest is full of horrible clich√©s and holes in the plot. As a friend said so humbly, this film is the aborted fetus of the industry. I highly recommend this film to people like me who are intentionally looking for these films, but for everyone else, be careful!
