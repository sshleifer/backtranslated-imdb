This TV show is probably the most pathetic shit show on TV today. Horrible and predictable obscene use of slow motion photography, poor plot lines. Chuck Norris is an abomination that should never be allowed to shoot in anything. The way he chooses to make every episode a public service announcement is really annoying. His acting sucks so much that it makes a person shiver with embarrassment. I'll give the series some credit ... but sometimes it is fun, but not enough to make a difference. With all the negative points of this series, I still prefer it to the TV reality, it's not really worth it.
