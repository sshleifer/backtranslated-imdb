I had heard nothing about this project until I saw that it would be turned on, so I looked at it with a completely open mind. And, gee, the cast is full of strong players. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately. . . it's horrible. I do not mean that it is not good; I mean it is extraordinarily ugly - sometimes ridiculous, but mostly it's simply boring. Its strongest appeal comes from having attractive nude people like the American television network will allow, but it's all teasing and without substance, and having nymphs as reserve characters can't justify several hours of bad TV. <br /> <br /> are two fundamental problems that the cast cannot overcome. First of all, the script is * terrible *. Yes, making changes to the myth of Hercules (which is certainly not a monolithic story in the first place) is traditional, but this version is inexorably dull and too often stupid (and sometimes decidedly tremendously unusual), with a terrible rhythm, borrowed bits from here and there (and different parts apparently belonging to different films), and really horrible dialogues. Dialogue is often unbearably bad, in fact, to the point that you feel embarrassed for the actors. Sean Astin, apparently now replaced as a second banana, seems particularly oppressed by one terrible line after another. There is no coherence of tone or atmosphere and little cohesion in the plot. <br /> <br /> Secondly, most of the special effects are really bad. Really bad. From time to time there is quite a bit of CGI, but above all, again, you really feel embarrassed on behalf of the cast. I have no idea what the budget was for this project, but it certainly looks like crap compared to "Clash of the Titans" or even "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" and it doesn't even compare very well to old Lou Ferrigno and Italian film "spaghetti" of Hercules. Only painfully unhappy. <br /> <br /> There are many other problems - the story is unnecessarily complex and cannot compare with itself, and Hercules himself is not presented as a very interesting character. Almost everyone who does not have a European accent tries to pretend a type, which is not simply amateur and dated, but never made sense in the first place: the drama does not become better just because the actors use British accents, after all. But the terrible script and the equally terrible effects sink the whole thing. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, "Hercules" was apparently intended as a four-hour miniseries, but truncated (for this broadcast, anyway) to a three-hour TV movie. I don't know what they cut, but it is possible that the changes have made things worse. I don't think you could make "Hercules" good by adding it, but that doesn't mean that continuity, for example, has not undergone network changes. However, I will not see the US version to see.
