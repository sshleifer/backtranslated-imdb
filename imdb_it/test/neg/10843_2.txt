Ben Affleck, about to get married, is shaken by a plane crash and gets involved with one of the other passengers (Sandra Bullock, forcing himself to act crazy). Whose fault is this inept, ugly stage? It was so badly modified when I looked at the credits that it wasn't the editor's name - it was to see if the person actually took the credit! Rife with clich√©s, stratagems and Sandra Bullock in raccoon eye makeup, the film does not even deal with the creation of chemistry between the two main characters. The laughter is non-existent: the scene in the gay bar with Affleck could have a great laugh if he weren't so stupid (the bar-goers - a bunch of noisy!) Shouting Affleck to strip and start digging their money) It should have no meaning other than to make Ben relax a little, but the direction of the whole scene is wrong, and the result is not seen because the idiot editor cuts away ... or was all the film he had had ? It is a small moment but it is typical of this film, an amateur piece of pop products that wants to be a modern and angular comedy but that has no liver. It is tailor-made for the bottom shelf of your video store. * from ****
