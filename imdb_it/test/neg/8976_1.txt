Honestly, about the death penalty, I could take it or leave it. The problem I have with this documentary is that it is a veritable feast of love for the murderer, without any sympathy for the family. The execution of Wanda Jean, with his completely unilateral vision, only strengthened my opinion that he should have been executed for his crimes. He tried to argue that he was mentally retarded, but nothing in the video supported that vision. He seemed uneducated, but also his entire family, but that doesn't mean they were all retarded. I can completely understand if someone opposes the death penalty, but completely ignoring the crime, as if it didn't happen, and trying to put Wanda on a moral mount, is offensive, and this is not the side of the problem with which I would associated.
