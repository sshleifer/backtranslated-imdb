Three delinquents disturb the tomb of an ancient sorcerer who, after summoning Jack-O (a pumpkin figure less threatening) to send said thugs, continues his sworn revenge to kill all the descendants of the family who gave him away. This includes the young Sean Kelly and his family that loves horror. Obviously it's up to Sean to find a way to save the day. <br /> <br /> A movie B so low budget. The acting is atrocious and the plot is not much better. Throw in an extremely lame killer, a possible pedophile who laughs too much and a couple of stereotypical pairs of cardboard conservatives and you have this movie in a nutshell. It is not really worth spending your time to see how Linnea is superbly aging. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Linnea Quigley is always good for some T&A and does not disappoint here with a long shower scene; Rachel Carter also gets topless (although it could be a double body) <br /> <br /> My Grade: D-
