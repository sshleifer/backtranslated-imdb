This film must go down in the history of bad films as the worst I've ever seen. It wasn't even a bad movie ... I would have rated it as z. The special effects were ridiculous ... err if you could call them special effects. I think the reviewer first hit the nail on the head ... it was the box that sold the film, while the cover was great and the intriguing synopsis (which is why I rented it) was a waste. not only time but also money. I didn't last long. I took it to the store and turned it off for another movie. I think my local video store took it off the shelf because they had made a lot of complaints about this horrible movie. My 6-year-old boy could have done a better job of filming / writing the script!
