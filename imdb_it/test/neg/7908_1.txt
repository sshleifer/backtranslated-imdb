I hate to comment on something I haven't finished, but if I save a person for almost an hour before turning it off in disgust, it's worth it. <br /> <br /> I decided to look at it with an open mind, knowing that it was at the bottom of 100. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. I usually love rough humor or at least tolerate it. I love the so-called "black" comedies. I'm not easily offended either. <br /> <br /> It all started well and quickly went downhill. I laughed a few times (for example, when the main character got stuck in the toilet), but that was it and he didn't compensate for the strong disgust I felt. <br /> <br /> I didn't laugh when the dog was sucked into a jet engine. I usually can't see humor in dying animals (except in Animal House). Neither have I laughed at anything else about malice. I turned it off after an accident involving a blind man and a baked potato that I don't care to repeat the details, except that the wave of nausea hasn't passed over me yet. <br /> <br /> Simply put, it was full of stains and just not fun with almost no storyline. This is one of the times when if you don't have something nice to say, you should let yourself be known. <br /> <br /> Don't say I didn't warn you.
