I got this in The Horror Six-Pack from Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. This is not the worst movie ever made, but it still sucks. In fact, this film made me sick, I don't know how to write this review, especially from 1. I extracted it from the DVD player because I couldn't even watch another second and 2. The hurricane "Ike is coming and God knows how much time it will take me to finish this review. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a scientist and his wife, the scientist receives a precious artifact and examines it when this alleged urban legend known as Skeleton Man kills him, and later on his wife. So ... <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but there's really not much more to say about this POS, except don't worry, I'm currently using the disc as a coaster e, if you see it, you might want to do the same. Casper Van Dien and Michael Rooker must have needed cash ... BAD! <br /> <br /> PS I'm practically reviewing the films in the box and could do a new review on Ghoulies IV.
