Like many people in my general age group, I remember seeing this film as a child in '98 and leaving the theater practically in tears. At the time it seemed to be one of the most important and impressive cinematic experiences of our generation. Armegeddeon, at the same time compelling, full of action, fun, heartbreaking and truly inspiring, has really done everything, up to the song inspired by Aerosmith and the tearful puzzle of an ending. <br /> <br /> Dolce Jebus. What did we smoke? I saw it for the first time in years last night on one of the film's channels, and ... I can't even describe it. This is, indeed, one of the worst films ever made. Where to start also? Leaving aside the plethora of laughable scientific errors ('personal pursuers' on astronauts? Yes, of course, thanks for this, Billy Bob), I should say that the worst thing was the remarkable - dare I say unparalleled - way in which he combined a writing disgusting with disgusting acting. There are too many examples of this even to start listing here, but one in particular comes to mind - the scene where Bruce Willis is telling the feds exactly where to go to track down each of the so deliciously smart members of his oil drilling team ( "check out every bar in New Orleans", "the craps tables in Las Vegas", "the only black guy on a motorcycle in Sturgis" ... all for the music of "Come Together" ... reminded me of a bit of the scene "NEWS TEAM! ASSEMBLE!" from Anchorman, except for serious). Ben Affleck demonstrates, once again, that he is by far the most overpaid actor in Hollywood, having less depth, range and overall talent than anyone else in the industry. Not that Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, OR ANY OTHER IN THIS GODFORSAKEN CLOTHING PLATE was much better. <br /> <br /> (I must say, however, I enjoyed seeing a pre-stardom Owen Wilson is killed in half ... is this the only film in which his character dies? <br /> < br /> Peter Stormare is as perfect as the Russian STEREO PASTORAL COSMONAUT YOU NEVER HAVE A SCENE (Then again, Peter Stormare seems to have a talent for playing exaggerated Eurotypes.) It was really fun like, almost IMMEDIATELY after the Americans they got in touch with the Russian Space Station (which is actually called in the film), Ben Affleck succeeds with one hand in making the whole complex explode in the spectacular Hollywood fashion, I also like the fact that, in the end, "Paris is the only place on Earth to be destroyed and that no one seems to care. And above all, points are literally transformed into simultaneous advertisements for Lockheed Martin and Kerr McGee. Oh, how proud I am to be an American. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of other things d whose complaints, but I will not ... it is enough to say that this is a film really, really, REALLY terrible, that I am ashamed to have ever really appreciated. <br /> <br /> I give him two stars only because of the mockability factor.
