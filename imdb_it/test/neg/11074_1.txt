The person who wrote the review and the enthusiasm for this film is an idiot or a passionate fan of shit movies. From the beginning, this has just talked about a low-cost scam of "The Descent", a far superior film that surely doesn't start slowly. <br /> <br /> From the very earliest moments of "The Cavern", I was amazed at how bad it was, how uninspired it was and how unadorned it was, how badly it was written, misinterpreted and misdirected. This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life, and that's a lot, considering I recently suffered from "Pulse". I can't believe this piece of junk has won awards, which shows that the quality of marijuana and other illegal drugs is much better in Australia and other countries than in the United States. <br /> <br /> The scenes in which the group that is escaping from the "creature" are misdirected, in particular the delayed "upside-down camera", intended to show disorientation, but which only turns out to be a cheap effect that a first-year film student would be properly reprimanded by their teacher. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this "director" will probably continue to make other films, more than likely the same low quality of this "film", since I am sure he has not learned from his mistakes, which in this photo they were excessive. <br /> <br /> If I had my way, the entire cast and crew would be sent to the river for life without words. This film is a crime against humanity.
