This movie tries to snatch Predator, but that movie is so much better. This film has some really terrible special effects and a senseless storyline. The team that enters the forest to find the cause of the disappearances of military and scientists is a combo of rough and robust male delta controls and pretty but robust female rangers. None of them is too bright. All the characters seem to be more than willing to escape to the forest alone and head to head in a spear or sword and their death. Some of the pyrotechnic products are very large and must have cost a package. But the creature's close-ups are laughable like most death scenes. Every clich√© that writers could think of was used. If you are looking for a mindless slaughtering celebration, this could do it. The night I saw it was very slow, so I spent all my time. I have to admit it has been a while since I saw something so bad. There is very little to redeem this film. I am amazed that something like this is produced.
