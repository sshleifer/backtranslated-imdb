I lasted almost ninety minutes through this terrible movie waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or something like that and I gave up! What caused the directors to do this? This is an elderly woman of limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing else. To fill a story without a point, let's take a few things about other people in slavery, his help to the burros and, of course, his ten cats! Don't see this movie. And no longer having anything to do with someone who loved him - they have no idea. There are fascinating people in this world with wonderful stories to tell and ideas to share - but Marta Becket is not one of them. The people I took in this film say that they have forgiven me, but that they will never, ever stop fooling me.
