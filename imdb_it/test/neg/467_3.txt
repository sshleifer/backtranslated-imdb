I wish I could tell you that this film is as exciting as the theories it exposes. But I can not. Another species may have come and changed while I was waiting for some action. For such a controversial man, Darwin lived the most conventional life. If you didn't know crazy theories, you could almost mistake it for a stamp collector. <br /> <br /> The directors have chosen Darwin as a dullard that renders them a bad service. Although he briefly lost his mind due to his tireless theorization, it was not interesting to watch. Perhaps the great thinkers are boring people? I don't know what I've been waiting for: an eccentric who slams his forehead with wild hair and eyes that expose his love for all things of the monkey, the gleam of madness that extends from a wrinkled brow? A long-haired hermit who stammered at animals? A pestiferous madman with eyes lit up like bundles of truth? All of the above would have been fantastic. This is the film for Scorsese's interest. <br /> <br /> But there was none of this. No lightning, no thunder, no wonder, no fear. Only Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly fresh from the Sottotone as Breath School of Method Acting. I imagine that someone with Darwin's ideas had a brain like a speeding train, so why was this film just warming up - chug chug chug - like a slow winter? The disappointment is immeasurable.
