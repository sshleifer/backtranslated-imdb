Allow me to prefigure it by going to disk, I'm a big George Clooney fan and I love John Krasinski in "The Office". Well, I was and I did it. <br /> <br /> This was the worst nail in the world and it took 113 minutes to tear it up. The astonished boredom was interrupted only by my frequent efforts to read my watch and estimate when it would be over. <br /> <br /> Every funny scene was in the previews. All three. There was no real story, no character development, and the script was simply ugly. I had a colonoscopy which was more fun. <br /> <br /> The title should have been SuperDuper Bad. This film is a lock for a Razzie. It should have a whole rip of Razzies. I want my money back.
