This spy and sloppy melodrama of espionage with two Californian children (an idealist, an addict) dealing with KGB secrets never seems to tire enough to withstand tension and suspense before a very slow death dies after two hours. John Schlesinger's finished product gives the impression of being asleep in his director's chair most of the time while the film is late and the actors are sleeping on foot, except for the annoying performance of Sean Penn. <br /> <br /> The altar boys and childhood friends Chris (Tim Hutton) and Daulton (Penn) devise a plan to sell secrets to the KGB when Chris finds a job that allows him access to top secret government materials. Disillusioned by what he sees as US interference in foreign affairs, idealist Chris and drug-hungry Daulton come into contact with the Russians and start channeling their confidential materials. When Chris decides he wants things to begin to unravel at an impractical pace. <br /> <br /> The eighties were not kind to the famous director John Schlesinger. In the 60s and 70s he had a series of critically acclaimed films in both England and America, but then Honky Tonk Freeway arrived in 1981 and marked the beginning of the end. The Falcon and the Snowman have more or less put a lid on it. Lacking the suspense of Marathon Man and quality performances (Hoffman Voight, Christie, Jackson, Finch, Olivier), he had persuaded the lead in the past. Falcon goes around most of the way. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn chews the landscape from beginning to end so hatefully that you find yourself encouraging his torturers to do more for him. Tim Hutton is ruled by his limited acting and most of his scenes show the need for more time for rehearsals. Lori Singer as Hutton's girlfriend almost completely changes it with Schlesinger's content to film her silly expressions. When it does emote you understand why. Only David Suchet as manager of the KGB with a penetrating introspective eye and moderation resumes well.
