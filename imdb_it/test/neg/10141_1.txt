this is really an "ok" series .. everyone in it is pretty good. but I can't take Reba. he is trying to be funny but he is not and then he has a stupid accent !! if they took it out of the show I'd like to see it every day .. <br /> <br /> I watched the show in 10 minutes and as I said before, Reba is destroying the show. anyway the 20-year-old boy (I don't know his name) but it's really fun, and he's really saving everything .. <br /> <br /> so here's the recipe for a great show. kick Reba and then put the 20-year-old boy in the lead role. <br /> <br /> I really hope someone agrees with me and think (like me) that they should kick Reba out of the show and put someone else in the lead role
