No word can describe how horrible this film is. It is as if the director literally took the role of a film and sent it to the public. <br /> <br /> The acting in this film is horrendous, The plot is so stupid and the death of each character is ridiculously evil. Some silly scenes include Akshay Kumar pulling a gun out of nowhere to kill a hologram (yes a hologram), Akshay Kumar carrying a bazooka around the city, Rajat Bedi being beaten by a badly animated skeleton, Rajat Bedi and Siddharth who doubly penetrate Monisha Korella (How did they think it was right?). I would also like to point out that the animations are absolutely terrible. The scene that supports this statement is when Kapal has the bike and somehow gets his glasses. The buying work seems to have been done with microsoft paint. <br /> <br /> The best parts of this film are with Sunny Deol. This man is so strong that he even makes God scared. In one scene, he literally opens the prison door kicking her. The Chuck Norris roundabout has nothing on it! It is even so powerful that you can fly from London to India in 10 minutes! Overall, this film is perhaps the most badly made film in the universe. If you had to watch it, watch it for the hilarity that follows (by the way, this film should be serious)
