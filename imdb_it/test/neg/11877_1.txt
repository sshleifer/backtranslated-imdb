I've seen some bad action movies in my time, but this is just awful. I feel it is a waste of time to write this too, but I will do it shortly. Why does this movie suck? Here are 10 reasons: 1. Directly amateur and cut. 2. Bad bad acting of the whole cast. 3. Stupid dialogues and too many clich√©s. 4. Too many holes in the plot, many scenes do not add up. 5. Bad photography (and a lot of continuity problems). 6. Bad performance by the leading actress. 7. Unreliable action scenes (and not too good, both). 8. Even for a Snipes movie, it shows a great lack of acting material. 9. Outrageous accents (of the whole cast). 10. Last but not least - too many implausible facts, such as a soccer tournament in the United States, the CIA that needs to do background checks to get new information about its employees, a mattress that is explosion proof and etc. Basically - it's a waste of time, it's not fun, it's not funny, not even a joke - DON "WATCH IT !!! Seriously, not really.
