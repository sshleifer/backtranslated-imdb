A film of modern fear? Yes, it is .. <br /> <br /> Hippies, pacifists and environmentalists have come together to give us a film about fear .. I didn't recognize him when I saw only two years ago that it was a scary movie but that is exactly what it is .. <br /> <br /> There is no difference between this film and the Nazi films made about us in ww2 and the same films we have made about them .. this is pure propaganda and he speaks only to those who believe in aliens, conspiracies of 9/11, fake moon landings, peak oil and great environmentalism. What I can say is that this movie makes buttons, makes you ask questions and in the end you don't forget. It's a scary movie .. so if your scars come into your homes, close the doors and stock up on that nuclear winter that we all know is coming when the bush causes the Chinese into nuclear war.
