Seller Lenny Brown (Woods) is quickly losing his ability to sell the proverbial Eskimo ice cream. Given the opportunity to shine in California by a philanthropic entrepreneur, Brown and his wife Linda (Young) live a high life off the tax shelters; a fortune they lose when the federal government changes the tax laws. <br /> <br /> Seven hundred thousand dollars in red, and in need of an 'impulse', the yuppies without wallets begin to suck up large quantities of Colombian marches dusting their fistfights, until they find themselves with rather hungry monkeys on their backs. After cleaning up for a short time, Linda's miscarriage sees Lenny once again in his career as a pinball between the upper and the bottom. Following is living purgatory. <br /> <br /> A contemporary version of Reefer Madness, with perverse echoes of Albert Brooks's Lost In America, The Boost was overshadowed by the tabloid revelations concerning an alleged relationship between Woods and Young, and the their tumultuous fall. Woods, engaged to Sarah Owen (now his ex-wife), condemned a $ 2 million lawsuit for his co-star scorned for "emotional harassment" during filming, citing late-night Fatal Attraction-style phone calls for his fianc√©e and, in a noteworthy accident, presumably leaving a maimed doll on the doorstep of his and Owen's. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the lack of chemistry among the presumably loving conductors is one of the most depressing aspects of this latest exploitation flick - the only real passion Woods demonstrates towards Young is when the he kicks around the room. Even the script is tremendously hilarious, perhaps mitigating Young's almost comatose performance when he is shouted as "stay with me - until I fall from the ground" to emulate. Moreover, given Woods' dramatic personalities, his nervous descent loses all credibility when in reality he seemed to begin like this. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, The Boost must be seen in context: in the 21st century the use of cocaine is omnipresent. However, in 1988, with America still entangled in an incontrovertible "war on drugs", the nation's fiber itself seemed to be in danger - hence one of the most hellish - and for that read hysterical interpretation - of drug abuse.
