I saw this movie last night and, let me tell you, it's the absolute worst thing I've ever seen. The whole film is a train disaster, and it's not the actors. It's the horrible script. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** Ok, Eddie loses work in a monkey. His nerd son is disappointed. The bathroom goes crazy. <br /> <br /> Get a free vacation. Go with Uncle Nick and the original Audry. Their boats crash. They are on an island. They are stupid and don't even bother to look at the hotel nearby. <br /> <br /> OK, that's it. What makes this film pathetic is humor. It's so horrible, hilly and stupid, you can't even laugh. And it's not even a stupid funny humor. I couldn't laugh at all.
