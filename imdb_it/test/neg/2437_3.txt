It is hard to tell who this film is for; the characterization and style of a "Children's ITV" series crossed with an Australian soap, but the topic, nudity and language direct it to an older audience. <br /> <br /> The first half hour has the heroine Justine philosophized about the loss of her virginity and is terribly embarrassing for anyone over 18. A complete "Ferris Bueller" rip-off, from talking to the camera, has been reduced to graphics on the screen. <br /> <Br /> Her nerd friend Chas takes her to a computer fair where an explosion during the use of a virtual reality machine turns her into a man. Or actually, he creates a male alter ego of hers, called Jake. Do not look at me like this; I'm just relating it to the way it was shown. <br /> <br /> After this the film is slightly fun for a while; of all the theatrical school acting episodes, only Rupert Penry-Jones brings a real comic touch to the role of Jake, trapped by a woman in his body. There are some funny scenes with Jake that takes care of his new body and new feelings; nothing you've never seen before, but then in this movie you'll hold on to everything that's fun. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Justine and Jake meet and hilarious jokes come out (I wish), involving the owners of the virtuality machine that wants to kidnap Jake to have sex with him, or examine him, or something like that. However, it is just an excuse to fill an extra half hour with some explosions and car chases; for such a cheap film, the explosions come often and loudly, suggesting that the money has been spent in all the wrong places. <br /> <br /> In the end, the heroine realizes that she can't fall in love with herself, she cancels her alter ego, and ends up in one night with the nerd to lose her virginity (this is presumably this which is destined to pass for a happy ending in the 90s). But only after removing the glasses and putting on a hair gel and a leather jacket; God forbid she have sex with someone who looks like a nerd. Of course, this is a bit subversive - in these days of PC movies that tell you to love and be yourself, and that everyone is special in their own way, it's definitely reactionary to have a movie that screams "CONFORM!" to you, and treat the virgins and the nerds with the contempt they deserve. <br /> <br /> The characterization is simple; the nerd is very nerd (room full of computers, thick glasses, social delay, virginity, no leather jacket), there is a whore, she is very slutty (blonde, tight-fitting clothes, orange tan, vampire music), there is an athlete, he is very ... well, you get the picture. You can get away with this kind of characterization in a vast comedy, but "Virtual Sexuality" is not very funny. It is only slightly fun in parts and excruciating in others. It takes a lot for a cute woman like Justine (played by Laura Fraser) to annoy me, but she runs it. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the title; There is absolutely nothing erotic about the film, and it does not deal with the themes of how new communication technologies are changing the way we look and acquire relationships (unless you think there is a possibility that your PlayStation may blow up and change your sex). <br /> <br />
