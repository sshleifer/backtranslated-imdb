Hollywood will stop at nothing to make money on a film, even if they must continue to drag stereotypes and put them in the most impossible and stupid situations. This effort is a clear example of this and I truly believe in my heart that a film like this is racially irresponsible. Story is about a divorced lawyer named Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) who chatted with a lady on his computer and when he finally meets her turns out to be the opposite of what he expected. Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah) is a robust black woman who does not intend to date Peter but wants him to look at her case in which she was convicted of theft. He wants them to go away forever, but he keeps popping up at inadequate times and to save his work he reluctantly accepts to look at the facts concerning his case. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT *** ** <br /> <br /> Peter has his children with him and Charlene is useful for raising them, but suddenly a news bulletin announces that a inmate named Charlene Morton has been released from prison. Peter tells her to leave when the FBI comes around poking around but finds out he is innocent when his old boyfriend shows up and threatens him. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Adam Shankman who keeps things moving at a good pace and is a technically beautiful film but the script is so unlikely and every character is a stereotype to the point that a 1970 film entitled "The Landlord" is clearly more in tune with the racial relations of this casino. I've always been a big Martin fan and I think he's one of the most talented people around, but he loves to work constantly and sometimes he just seems to choose a script that was delivered to him. On the other hand, I've always had a problem with Latifah and the way it breaks into Martin's life is so exaggerated that she immediately becomes ingratiating. A basic premise that Hollywood loves to use is the black person who shows a white man tense to relax and then transmit a street logic that will help them in life. This is basically what the story is here, but of course they have to let Martin dress in black and exaggerate like a retarded Eminem because Hollywood knows this is what viewers want. Well, I've been pretty much insulted by everything in this movie and it's not because I don't have a sense of humor, but unfortunately (for Hollywood, anyway) I use logic and common sense when I watch a movie. Yes, I liked Eugene Levy's talking jive, but do we really think he would be immediately attracted to Latifah? I imagine stranger things have happened and how many times is a main actor fired just to be saved by something in his pocket? Wouldn't a cell phone break if hit by a bullet? Even if you're the toughest Martin and Latifah fan, I wouldn't recommend it. I know I said it before but this is not an attempt to make a good movie, it's an excuse to try to make money!
