[POSSIBLE NOTICE OF SPOILER] <br /> <br /> It is unlikely that Seagal will again increase the heights of laziness he did with * Su Deadly Ground * (especially since no one will ever let him direct again), but he is sure there try, isn't it? <br /> <br /> This is a small fantasy typically brainless and poorly written about how Indian folk remedies are much more effective than Western medicine. Seagal really seems to believe this absurdity, although he never explains why life expectancy in the Americas and Europe is much higher than it was in 1492. A guy like that never explains how his supposed "water" is engines "work in * on Deadly Ground *. <br /> <br /> Even the action in this sucks.
