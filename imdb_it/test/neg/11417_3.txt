To put it simply, this was a pompous piece of canine poopie. Excessively theatrical and everyone is the queen of melodramatic drama in every single moment. After a while, I was starting to wish that every character in the film was not an anonymous retentive. <br /> <br /> And this film has another one of those really annoying things that came recently in vogue and shouldn't have: all the scenes are in a sort of faded gray, steel blue. Hmmm, the last time I checked, the candles and torches are quite capable of putting a fairly broad spectrum of colors. In fact, the light they emit tends to be more in the warm, orange-yellowish range of colors in the spectrum. So where does all the blue-steel-gray light come from? <br /> <br /> This film has imaginative and gorgeous stage sets cgi-fx, but it's still crazy. It is pathetic rubbish intended for today's movie goers who are easily placated by a pathetic crap. <br /> <br /> I really like vampires and werewolves as the film's plot devices, but this was a total hacking job. <br /> <br /> Universal Studios 1941 "The Wolfman" is infinitely superior to this even though its fx is rather primitive compared to what could be done today. <br /> <br /> I'm done with this franchise. The first movie was pretty decent. The second is still pretty funny. But this I couldn't even finish until the end because it was so boring.
