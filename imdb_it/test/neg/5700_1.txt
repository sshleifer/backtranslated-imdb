It must have been a long time since I saw such a bad movie. I have to say that it's really hard to make a good and / or realistic film about the plane crash, but this film was a waste of time and money. I also think this is an unofficial way of trying to get a bad reputation on Airbus. First, the cockpit looks a lot like an Airbus cockpit, secondly you have a stick, thirdly by using computers to control rudders / elevators / ailerons via "fly by wire". When I saw this film I thought the film's intention was "not to fly with computerized airplanes like Airbus, instead it uses Boeing instead they have a direct connection of rudders and rudders". <br /> <br /> All I can say: bad story, horrible acting (most of the actors), worst movie ever ...
