Bad acting? Yes, but it wasn't a surprise. Stupid story? Yes and then? <br /> <br /> But why, tell me, Mr. Director, why all those crap in slow motion? The fighting scenes were bad, really bad, due to the slow motion and the bad cut. Not because of Seagal. <br /> <br /> "And if I accelerate it for 2 seconds and then slow down the next 5 seconds and then ... Maybe I need to throw the coin to decide?" What were you thinking, Mr. Director ???
