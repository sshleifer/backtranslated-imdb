Imagine if there will be an alternative universe in which someone created SEVEN where instead of a talented cast and crew they launched a politically conscious environmentalist and a stand-up comedian. If your imagination cannot stretch so far, just look at THE GLIMMER MAN as it's the worst thing to do after <br /> <br /> !!!! MILO SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> Jack Cole is a cop with a hidden past and it is very ironic that he is played by Steven Seagal since he is also someone with a hidden past, but don't tell anyone because he is top secret. Perhaps the biggest secret is how someone like Seagal has become a movie star in the first place since THE GLIMMER MAN continues in the vein of all the other Seagal films, as it's a total shit. See the way it is presented as its companion enters his office "Yoi love beads man. In you are in the wrong office" Steven responds with something that is hilariously bragging, or he would if someone could understand a word bloody she said because for most of the movie she just mumbled. In fact, the only time I could understand his dialogue was the scene in the school where he bursts in with the killer holding the class <br /> <br /> "Don't get me killed" <br /> <Is this what a policeman would say to a suicide assassin? I'm just thinking that in another movie where Steven is not the hero (ie a good movie) the cop would say something like "Don't kill me, I have a wife and a couple of kids waiting at home". So, in any case, a suicide assassin goes to blast his head, but Steven saves his life by having them dart both through two windows. It goes without saying that you shouldn't try it at home <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, Steven (I gave up calling him Jack though the credit for the writer for giving Steven a sensible name) becomes involved in a case a plagiarism in which someone has stolen parts of other top movies with serial killers. While Steven finds other victims, you can see him thinking "What was that movie that played Morgan Freeman as a cop?" While inspecting the bodies, oh and the action continues to return to the hero's home life just so we know that this guy is as good as a family man, this guy is very good as a family man, too bad it's as bad as a movie star
