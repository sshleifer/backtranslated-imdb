I can pretend not to know the cinematography or Mr. Angelopoulos. But I know Greece and I love its people. In July my son and my 14-year-old son went to Cappadocia, Turkey, looking for some remains of the neighborhood where his great-grandfather Iordanis lived until the great exodus of the Anatolian Greeks in 1923. Reading the film summary (refugees of Odessa) I thought that maybe I could learn more about forced migration of modern Greeks. If I didn't have a house in Rhodes, if I hadn't been to Greece 28 times in so many years, if I wasn't familiar with dozens of islands and cities in Greece and if I had never enjoyed the friendship of these exuberant, intoxicated people, I may have believed that this complaint had something to do with modern Greece. As a professor at the New Jersey State college, I assure you that I'm familiar with the history of the period covered in the film. In fact, my wife's uncle was assassinated by the communists during the seizure of communist power. My mother-in-law experienced the Italian invasion and the German occupation ... barely. These on-screen characters speak Greek, listen to Greek music but who are they? No, I'm not even vaguely Greek. Of course they are not people at all but simply allegories. They are what the artist invents when life does not completely adapt or is inadequate to its perception of how it was or should have been. All represent some aspects of the Greece of the first world war that greater external forces delivered to a destiny that they did not deserve. As we joked in the late 70s in America: "The revolution did not happen". For an ideologue / artist, this is not a joke. In reality it is a reason for us to spend two and a half hours of torment. And that's all because the various powers (the soliloquy of Eleni of "guards" in different colored uniforms) did not allow the generation after the "aristocrats" of 1919 (Spyros) to follow the call of peace and freedom (the music of Nikos and his fellow musicians, that is the movement, the cause). This dark and surreal revisionism spreads the true and heroic efforts of the Greek people to sustain their lust for life through the tragedies of the 20th century, to get more than any of its other Balkan neighbors, to be so politically evolved and integrated globally .
