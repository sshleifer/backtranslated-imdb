I watched "LOST" with my family since the first episode, it was great. The last season was very disappointing, it seems as if (the writers) didn't know what to do with the show, so they keep trying to make up for it by extending a plot for an entire episode. The current season, which by the way I decided to keep looking only to see Rodrigo Santoro, and also with a small little hope that things would improve; it was a disappointment after another; even my husband and my son stopped watching. First of all, he (Santoro) appears only for 30 seconds in each episode. But the real problem is with the plot, THERE IS NOTHING REALLY HAPPEN, every episode could be shown in 15 minutes. We look at every episode waiting for something that never happens; I'm not asking for all the secrets to be revealed immediately, but how about some variation in the lines of the story? In the first and second seasons, we had several stories, we saw the story of the characters, a bit of action, a bit of romanticism, now it's like a big event that brings the whole episode to reveal. It is almost tiring to watch it, when it ends you have the feeling of having wasted time. Now, it's important to note that the actors are still great. I can't believe they killed Mr. Eko (Adelawale ...) it was fantastic, Jack (Mathew Fox) is still unbelievable, the perfect hero, so kind, magnanimous brave Sawyer (Josh Holloway), the "bad boy" is a kind of softening because of Kate (Evangeline Lylli), but that's fine. I miss Sayid (Naveen Andrews), Sun and Jin (Yoon-jin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim), they are all an important part of the plot (or should be), but we barely see them. I hope that Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) will play a big part in the show; if not, why did you make so many of him to participate in the show (Access Hollywood, etc.)? Sorry if I talked too long, but I feel cheated by this show. When I started watching it it was fantastic, I got used to it and now it's very disappointing to see how it goes. I'll be here, hoping for improvements !!! Katia
