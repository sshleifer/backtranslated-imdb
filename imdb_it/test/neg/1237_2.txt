I must have lost a part of this movie ... I found myself asking who this is? And when did it happen? He seemed to jump around but I kept looking for fear that I would miss something and everything would be explained to me. I loved Lonesome Dove, but this movie didn't make any sense to me. I loved all the actors but what happened to the rest of the film? Made me go "what"? at the beginning of each part ... As for the scenario - I thought it was okay ... It made me feel like I was flipping through a book and leaving the pages out .. The ending confused me a bit even though I imagine the boy was waiting for his father and was destined to leave you wondering if his father would finally come home to his son and become a father since his mother disappeared. I'd like to read the book just to see what I missed the film ... I don't expect this to win any prizes.
