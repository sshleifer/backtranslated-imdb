I liked most of this movie. As other reviews mentioned it has a good cast, the plot is quite interesting. All in all it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> But the ending, I believe, is completely messed up, left me perplexed. Yes, you expect people to cross over and cross each other in this type of film, but do they cross quadruple? Well, if it is justified by the plot then why not? <br /> <br /> But this is the worst part, there is absolutely no need for it. After a certain point it is all intriguing without any meaning. (here comes SPOILER). After the airport scene, Enrico and his accomplices already have the money. I could not understand the need for the rest of the scam. Is it all necessary to just rub Federico's nose in the fact that he was deceived? I don't buy it. <br /> <br /> So 6 out of 10 for 3/4 of the film and 2 out of 10 for the final.
