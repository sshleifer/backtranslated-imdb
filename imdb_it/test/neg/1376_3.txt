I've only seen most of the series since I left the TV as background noise in my dorm. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of Mencia, but this show doesn't do much for me. From time to time he will say or do something to bring out a chuckle, but he has this aura of complacency that ruins it completely. <br /> <br /> I always thought it was funny because of his furious angry man routine this isn't terribly prevalent in this TV series. Instead, he's just smug. I imagine that it only reflects how funny his comedy is: stale and uninteresting when it is not in the right mode of delivery. I've seen him come into his show sometimes, but for the most part, he's sitting there smiling and seemingly smug, and it's not good for him. <br /> <br /> Only my opinion though.
