My wife spotted this movie on the corridor in a local video store. From the cover it looked like a science fiction movie, but after I shot it my wife saw Rebecca St. James in the movie, she realized that it was a Christian movie and suggested we watch it. We are conservative evangelicals but we also know that "Christian" films have a poor reputation in the mainstream. However, we decided to give it a projection. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there were a few things I liked about the movie. The musical score, largely orchestrated, was quite good. Cinematography was also quite good considering it was a low-cost movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, any virtue in the production work of this film has been lost due to an unpleasant script. The film begins with an interesting premise - UFO abduction - but in the middle of the film the plot turns wildly into an evangelistic crusade led by the two main characters of the film ... which then turns wildly into a Rapture treatise. At least the inspired by Frank Peretti "The Visitation" (which was a deeply flawed film) had an ending that tied together the premises of the film. "Unidentified" does not end anywhere near where it started, which is a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> What about acting? Supporting acting varies from decent to bad. (Rebecca St. James plays a bit in part and is passable.) For their part, some of the main characters are quite gifted. Unfortunately, their talents are wasted on characters so one-dimensional in their personality that they are incredible. The "protagonists" are anything but; you know it's bad when two Christian spectators find the Christian character more vocal in the film to be the most annoying. <br /> <br /> A final note on the evangelistic tone of this film, which will be of greater interest to Christian than non-Christian readers. In a word, it's embarrassing. Other Christian films such as "The Champion" by Carmen and "The Hangman's Curse" by Peretti managed to communicate a genuinely intransigent portrait of the Christian faith without appearing to be a preacher or oppressive. This film, on the contrary, is a hammer that feels so heavy and lacking in tact that a non-Christian would have difficulty taking it seriously. <br /> <br /> I believe that the heart of the filmmaker is in the right place and I applaud the efforts to create a good Christian film. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. If your church is looking for a screening of a good Christian movie, consider "Mercy Streets", the nickname "The Champion", or (if you are Pentecostal) the provocative by Robert Duvall "The Apostle". <br /> <br /> Regarding "Unidentified?" Rent it if you have to, but watch it before showing it to a non-Christian audience or to a wider audience.
