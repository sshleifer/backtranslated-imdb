It was so BORING! No plot whatsoever! Basically a watered-down version of the Lion King mingled with Animal Farm. Again, no plot. Horrible! Worst hour and a half of my life! OMG! I had to leave the theater for a few minutes just to get some relief! Maybe I giggled twice. All the semi-fun parts are in the previews. I hate movies like that. Yes, the film was pretty much sucked. I don't know how he got such good reviews and reviews. THERE IS NO PLOT OR HISTORY !! If you go to see this movie, bring a pillow or girlfriend / guy to keep you busy. Terrible. I don't think I ever went to a movie and I didn't like it so much. It was good that the tickets cost only five dollars because I would be angry if I paid $ 7.50 to see this shit.
