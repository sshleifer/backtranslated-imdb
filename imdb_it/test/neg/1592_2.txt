The only reason I didn't give a terrible rating to this film is because I think it was such a terrible film in every respect that it deserves at least a 2/10; to not try. <br /> <br /> The plot is the least of your worries when you are slapped in the face with superior language and scenes like "the singing asshole" in a poor attempt at shock and disgust. Seen as the main objective of this film is that of shock and its main body has not achieved this goal, the final scene disgustingly succeeds in erasing the memory of this incredibly useless film and fulfilling its goal of being the dirtiest film ever. br /> <br /> A really low budget film, played out terribly and the dialogue is incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> I really give him 0/10 !!!
