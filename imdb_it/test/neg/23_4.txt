When people say that children are annoying, you think my little cousins ​​can be boring and I said LITTLE. These children are 10 years old and they are undoubtedly the most annoying kids you will meet (in a movie). Let's start with the blonde - Debbie - She's a girl whore, I mean, she's wearing miniskirts, she has silly frizzy blond hair and a freckley red rabbit face. She acts so innocently. Then we have the second child - the Geek - who thinks he is so strong, with his long-range shots and his use of a silencer (a jacket over his gun) and above all his mischievous smile. The next is the quiet boy you don't care for, so it's all about him. This film made me angry at children's intelligence and the only enjoyment I had was from my cousin who kept complaining about them.
