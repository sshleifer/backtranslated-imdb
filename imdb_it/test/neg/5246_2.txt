Christopher Lambert attracted me to this film. What a waste! The plot has more holes than the special effects weren't very good, it didn't take long to figure out who the creature's mother was and the creature owed Predator more than a small debt. Anti-climatical this film could have been done much better. However, it does raise an interesting point. When will Hollywood discover the rich tradition of European folklore just waiting to be extracted?
