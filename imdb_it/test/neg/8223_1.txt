Garden State was a mediocre film at best. The film looks more like a collection of thoughts that the writer (Zach Braff) had, rather than a cohesive story. The disconnected plot may have been more engaging if it had not been interspersed with useless scenes that were nothing more than "bizarre". Coincidentally, these scenes are often those that are transmitted in conversation (Zack passing by taps that light up as he passes, crazy crazy party scene, screaming on a throat, the list goes on). <br /> <br /> The main character is flat, disenchanted and ultimately unlikely, which is exhibited more in the scene where he talks to his father, selfishly ignoring his father's problems, including a recently deceased wife, and buzzing about his own "What should I do? with my life?" the problem. <br /> <br /> The film ends when Andrew (Zach Braff) decides not to return to Los Angeles because he cannot tear himself away from the love of his life, Sam (Natalie Portman) who he has known for 2 days. Which can only lead me to the conclusion that the message of the film is that love at first sight cures professional dilemmas ... Of course, you could interpret it as an embezzlement of priorities, but if so it could have been done better. Much better. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. A drama, a comedy, a movie set about adolescence, or a range of other things. I say this not as a single gender oriented person, but as a person who loves multi-genre pieces like those dominated by Stanley Kubrick. The reason I think it doesn't work for Garden State is because rather than blending genres together, it comes around; one scene is of a genre, the other is again, and so on. <br /> <br /> I have heard many people tell me to cut some of Zach Braff, after all it was his first feature film and he made his debut as a director, screenwriter and lead actor. As impressive as it was a first movie, I should think that with all the money he has, he could do better. There have been much better feature film directors (Michel Gondry "Human Nature", David Gordon Green "George Washington"). Perhaps if he stayed to write O to direct O to acting it would have been better. Zach Braff is a talented artist, perhaps his second attempt will not be so boring and disjointed.
