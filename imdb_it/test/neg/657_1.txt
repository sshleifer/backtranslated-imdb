According to Hollywood standards, this film was filmed and edited as a Hollywood movie, so it looked like a movie that came out of a big Hollywood production studio. This is the point where something remotely close to the end of Hollywood standards. This was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! I'm not kidding. The story was so incredibly stupid and unrealistic that I couldn't contain my laughter in the cinema while watching this movie. I know what you're saying, "it's a horror movie that shouldn't have a good story that should scare you." Well, let me tell you something, the film isn't even scary in the slightest. It's too full of stupid pieces that nullifies the little suspense that may have been there. Even the acting was horrible, along with the bravado of the murderer, who is constantly seen through flashbacks stuck in a cage. Throughout the film I continued to feel that I was looking at something that was thought, written, produced and directed by a high school student who looks at too much pornography. Please, don't watch this movie, spend $ 8.50 on other things, like a snow cone, which would be much more useful.
