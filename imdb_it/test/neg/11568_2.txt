Cheap cheese, gloriously poor of the 80s, decade of cheeses. I saw this first uncut and an MST3Ked, and it was fun to laugh out loud even without the comments. <br /> <br /> The plot (as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which the AI ​​robots rebelled (seems familiar?) and destroyed almost everything, leaving a world in ruins with the air so strong that nobody can breathe it. The few remaining humans act as slaves of an enigmatic being called Oscuro, who appears to be partly computer and partly organic. The "air slaves" work to produce energy so that this is in exchange for breathable air. From time to time the Dark One has the strongest aerial slave that fights to the death, so that no one will stand as a leader in a revolt against the Dark One. <br /> <br /> Ok, this is the so-called serious stuff. On the nonsense, like the ridiculous, almost futuristic clothing that everyone practices, including "fur" clothing covers, loincloths, spangly things and feather boas (worn mostly by the dark woman of the Dark One, a girl with an unrecognizable and almost incomprehensible accent). Or the wooden acting and the dashed lines flaunted by all the so-called "actors", whose dialogue is full of pretensions and little sense. Or the special shop, including pink socks with teeth glued on them for "deadly" sewer snakes, a bomb made of piano wire and a tin box threaded and terrible "mutants" with Halloween rubber masks. <br /> <br /> A band of air slaves follows their leader, a mysterious tramp who has adapted to the outside air, to go to the power plant to destroy the Dark One. The boy's name is Neo, who explains where the Wachowski brothers got the idea for the Matrix. They meet with a group of Amazons along the way, with the mandatory fighting scene in which the female is beaten (obviously). Has anyone else ever noticed it in every Amazon movie or in t.v. show ever produced, these so-called fantastic warriors always get their kicks kicked by men or women? Amazons are just pansies, I guess. <br /> <br /> This band of determined warriors makes its way through Central Park ... errr ... the devastated lands beyond the last standing city (good way to save on the opaque paintings of a destroyed New York, anyway) and travel in the sewers that lead to the Power Station where the Dark and his go-go girlfriend, Valeria, meet. Here they defeat ferocious beasts like puppet worms, a giant spider that nobody sees and the lobster goofy robot that is one of the Dark's personal guards. <br /> <br /> The final showdown is rather sad. One of the slaves, a girl who was taken by the Dark Father because she had produced a way in which people breathed the stale air, sees that her father was "consumed by the true shape of the Dark One", which implies that he is eaten by a giant avocado until its head protrudes out. The three remaining adventurers destroy the Dark One by turning off some switches, and the robot holocaust dies not with a bang but with a groan. lines, and that's all.
