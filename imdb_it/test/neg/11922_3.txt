It solves. <br /> <br /> Clich√©d. <br /> <br /> Style overdoses to compensate for bad writing. <br /> <br /> Remember when MTV is actually used to broadcast music videos and other reality shows? Aeon Flux (2005) is based on one of these shows ?? a cartoon since the mid-90s ?? starring a superhuman woman in black latex clothes. Aeon, played by the adorable Charlize Theron in this adaptation, is a detached rebellious cold who is as deft as a line dancer and deadly as a viper snake. He needs to be, if he expects to kick the ass of the totalitarian government. <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but I hate the sudden influx of futuristic metaphysical films and half-dormant films-overdosed films like The Island (2005) and Equilibrium (2002) (lower part of the pile). Aeon Flux has all the problems that are present in these films, but amplified. That is, there is nothing original left to show in order to compensate for it with the elegant style that Matrix (1999) catalyzed. The special effects are therefore sensational in Aeon Flux that gains few points, but scratch the surface and there is literally nothing there. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, all the interpretations in this film are atrocious and some actually hurt me to look. The character of Charlize Theron, Aeon Flux, is intertwined with the most picky hard-chick and it seems that the director Karyn Kusama can't decide where to go with her? should it make you more detached or more emotional? She does not know! Let's go in both directions! Imagine taking a rifle, loading it crammed with developments of various kinds of characters and shooting in a random chaos. This is the character of Aeon Flux. <br /> <br /> The film Aeon Flux presents all the "mandatory" ideas in a dystopian society - individual against society, nature against science, emotion against cold reason, etc. You have already seen all this and done better. Go read Orwell, Bradbury or Huxley, or even look at Logan's Run (1976) or Blade Runner (1982) ... anything! Avoid this celebration of perverse cheese for as long as you can. <br /> <br /> 3/10
