I know a couple of people who look just like the main actress of this movie (or, at least, like the character he plays). Everyone gives me the creeps and I'd be the last person to ever give one of them a gun or even a sharp knife. He has a bad and ugly expression. If you can summon a little sympathy for her, let me know. <br /> <br /> Of course I could have the same expressions of concern and fear if I had an imaginary friend who was killing my true friends and acquaintances for the past 15 years. <br /> <br /> And for our European friends on IMDb, I am saddened to say that, yes, some colleges and universities in the United States teach courses on paranormal phenomena, based on the pathetic defense that represents "academic freedom" and inquiry open. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth it. You won't like any of the characters (except Aunt Lydia, which is removed very soon) and the plot doesn't make sense.
