The frustrating thing about a film like this, with real potential for greatness, is that he almost likes to be heavy. We speak of allegory, of metaphor ... but the truth is that there is no way around the fact that there is absolutely no plot or a real character. <br /> <br /> At some point, we know more about who people are ... even if we never understand where they are going. The sheer pretentiousness knocked me down whenever I tried to catch a truth in this film. <br /> <br /> Call it beautiful, beautiful and fantastic ... I call it simply "cheating". All style and no substance. Of course, it's a matter of taste ... but I would never take a confused modernist pastiche of symbols and sketches on the spiritual clarity of Jean Cocteau or Renoir. But if it works for you, I'm all for it. Art is a personal thing, I imagine.
