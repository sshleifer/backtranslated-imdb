I do not 100% agree with the reviewer who was at 100% disagreement with the reviewer who gave this short film an "F" rating. Heavy cashing in political propaganda only obscures Joe Dante's lack of ability to extract another Howling from his baggage of tricks. The Masters of Horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly gruesome stories, except for this episode. <br /> <br /> Despite being hailed by those wishing to promote its political momentum, "Homecoming" is the least effective episode of MOH season one. Unlike the rest of the series, the entry of Dante is a parody of the genre, which is neither a little horror nor humorous in its stubborn interpretation of a trivial political point. <br /> <br /> Dante can only be blamed for extracting this stink from the shelf, as it was not his creation. The subgenus of the zombies is very popular in this decade, and between George Romero's harvest of tributes and the predictable vacuous fantasies there are a number of works designed to push political messages or (ir) relegosi. These works were not written by or intended for true horror fans. Perhaps even Dante is not a true master of horror. What has he done since The Howling, after all? <br /> <br /> If you want a lame anti-war zombie with some references to pop culture passed off as humor, Homecoming could just be your thing. If you're a horror fan looking for something masterful, take ... most of the other episodes of the series. My favorite was "Jenifer" by Dario Argento, based on a classic short film from the Bruce Jones and Berni Wrightson team - really scary.
