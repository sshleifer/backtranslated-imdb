I tried to watch this, and I was very disappointed. Don't expect intelligent and insightful humor for Amy's brother David in the middle of this dreck ... it's the exact opposite. But if you like the jokes of poop, fart and boner, you will be in seventh heaven. This is the sense of bathroom humor, I assume, to those who have had several bongs, which can only explain why many ecstatic reviewers have proclaimed this shit as "the best television script ever". I assume that those who hate such humor have not been able to look long enough to worry about submitting a review, but I am only sending a warning to those unsuspecting spectators who are looking for high-level comedies. The characters exaggerate. The shock factor is set to 10. And the laughter is set to zero (unless, of course, you are looking for youthful and superficial humor). <br /> <br /> I did 40 minutes, praying all the time turning the corner to useful entertainment, but alas, it has become worse and worse. And watch out for the ubiquitous and bitter expression of Amy's bite - it will make your eyes spin. It was nice to see the cameos of recognizable comic actors that I like, but I can only assume that they agreed to participate as a favor to the Sedaris family. <br /> <br /> To those who loved it, I'm sorry .. This is my opinion. It was so bad that it inspired me to write my first review.
