no really, I'm not kidding around here, and I can't believe how many people here gave really good reviews! oh wait, it's the comment section of IMDB, stupid. It is interesting to note that on this date, there were not enough votes to give this film an evaluation of ten, yet there are dozens of comments that excite about the film. what does this mean I wonder? however, the script is terrible. the character changes his personality, motivation and actions in each scene, in order to keep the film flowing along something that vaguely resembles a rhythm. there was not even a stupid behavior, there was also there, but the pure idiocy of the script transcended any stupidity shown by the characters. for example: karl disobeys an order because there are two corpses in the desert and "the killer is out somewhere", so he forces everyone to travel 40 km to find the killer, disobeying orders and driving everyone away. When the hero discovers something bad in the darkness and warns Karl, Karl tells our hero to stop being an idiot and that there is nothing out there, so everyone is going home. the next scene, he refuses to let it go and has to hunt down whatever it is. it's just a joke. yes, the monster is very impressive, but the crap that humans say about it only tries to erase its interesting aspects, and the predator and the alien tears have been very boring. and the ending ... the ending!?!?! jesus .... the worst movie I saw the year, and I saw bug buster!
