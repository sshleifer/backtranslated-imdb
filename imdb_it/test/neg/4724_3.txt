This film was a Mexican horror film from the late 1960s. It's not good, but it's not so bad. There is a lot of schlock and it is filled quite heavily with nudity and violence, but it had a plot and at least it tried to stick to it (although the plot was the same damn Frankenstein inspired "not to tamper with God's dominion" b -movie ) There was some mixed padding in the women's fight, but it was done in Mexico and wrestling seems to be popular in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a doctor wants to save his son, who is dying from leukemia. The other doctors did not give hope to the poor boy, but Dad has the idea of ​​transplanting the heart of a gorilla for his son to save his life (I don't know, I'm a lawyer, not a doctor). The transplant works, but the male child ends up becoming an ape-man who terrorizes naked women and kills anyone who gets in his way. There is also a subplot involving a policeman and his girlfriend who is a wrestler (this really didn't add much, but if they wanted to launch some masked wrestlers here there is a good reason to do so). <br /> <br /> The film was quite cheap, but not too bad for a b-movie of the day. The plot was basically just recycled and there were some things that weren't tied in that good. However, this film is funny in its own way (I don't know why, maybe because it's a Mexican horror film and it stands out in my normal bad film diet). I guess it could be because it's a mixture of some very strange things. <br /> <br /> Watch it if you like foreign films, nudity and female fighters.
