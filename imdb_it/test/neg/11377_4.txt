I was hoping to enjoy this movie, to set myself up for a fun evening. I like Judy Davis and Juliette Lewis, and the premise seemed out of the wall enough to be fun. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found myself dozing again and again. Judy Davis performed well, but had very little to work with. Juliette Lewis was fabulous as expected, but had very little to do. The plot was full of "twists" that were simply silly, and as often happens in films of this type, no one acted in the way a real human being would have acted. And, personally, I thought Marcia Gay Harden was totally misunderstood. <br /> <br /> The film also seemed to move halfway from a black comedy with touches of farce to a total farce with touches of black comedy. A reviewer here notes that other reviews seem to want this film to be something different, and have therefore criticized it. All I can say is that I would have been satisfied that the film was * something * and that it adhered to it. This seems like the director had some great ideas but he wasn't able to get them all out. I give him a 4 out of 10.
