Oh my God, WHY did I lose my precious time in this movie? It's pathetic, mediocre and unrealistic, and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Yes, MY LIFE. I am embarrassed about the films of Yash Raj, the poor boys have to live with the horrible news that yes, they have produced this terrible film. <br /> <br /> This is by far the most scruffy, sexual, eyebrow film I've ever seen from Yash Raj Films. I shudder for them, really. Along with Uday Chopra's terrible acting (or NO acting, for that matter), combined with the lack of talent of "Look At My Boobs" Tanisha, Neal 'n' Nikki has nothing good about it. Even the music is not up to the standard left by YRF. The director, Arjun Sablok, did a terrible awkward job here. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I expected more. Much, much more.
