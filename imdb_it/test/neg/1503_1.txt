I love cheap movies. Including those who are intentionally or unintentionally funny, too much fake blood, violence, etc. <br /> <br /> This, however, is beyond the stupid. Once you see the ending, you will say, what the hell was the point of all the murder scenes with no one around (except in a couple) to witness it. And how was the ending actually (I won't give the ALL the story away for those stupid enough to really look at this) Grandma is like a psychic Jason. First it is outside the window with a body and 15 seconds later it is in the living room to knit. The whole thing is a setup for a newcomer. They bring out scenes of graphic killings, knitting needles in the eyes, which only Chris Angel Mind Freak can pull out. And again, the end itself was Pre-postero. 56 min of lost time. I saw one of the other filmmakers and it was almost as bad. Give me 20 bucks and I could do better. This really deserves a big fat 0.
