If you've ever been shopping at Wal-Mart, you probably know the $ 5 basket found in the electronics department. Well, this is where I found this movie. However, I was deceived! You see, the cover of this particular DVD had a great image of Sandy Bullock on it and even listed its name as "headliner". I considered it thinking "Wow, I didn't know that Sandra Bullock had made this movie?!?!" So I was pumped to go home and watch a Sandra Bullock movie. Much to my surprise, Ms. Bullock had a small role ... a very small role. She plays the girlfriend of the CIA agent's son. Let's talk about the supporting actress. He may have had no more than 2 lines in the film. In addition to being tricked by being a Bullock movie, I looked over and kept watching an "action packed" movie. Negative! At one point, for special effects, a gun was recorded on the camera. You have to watch it to laugh at what's really horrible.
