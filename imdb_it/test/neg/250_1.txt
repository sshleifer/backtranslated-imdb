Despite having a very pretty woman (Rosita Arenas, one of my boy-crushes), acting and directing are examples of what NOT to do while making a film. <br /> <br /> Located in southern Mexico, Popoca, the Aztec mummy (the true Aztecs, by the way, did not make mummies) was awakened by the main characters and began to create problems in the suburbs of Mexico City, during the first film (The Aztec mummy). In this second part, the leading man and woman want to find their mother and put her in her last resting place (a fireplace would have been my first choice ...) <br /> <br /> In this appears The Bat , a criminal and disrespectful stereotype of a criminal genius who creates a "human robot" (an idiot inside a SUIT robot) to control Popoca and (get this) conquer the world. The final match between the robot and the mummy is exhilarating, some of the worst choreographies ever seen. The funniest part is that this film was made and released by a serious Mexican film studio! <br /> <br /> Acting is just as horrible to hear the film in Spanish as in English (they have nicknamed over-acting!). You should watch this movie through MST: 3000. Comments are even more fun.
