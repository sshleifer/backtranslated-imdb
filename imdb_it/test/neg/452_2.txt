Rose ?? Something actually happens in this episode? Introduces our two protagonists, an idiot with a silly grin with the slowness of a doctor and an absolutely uninteresting companion. There is no plot to talk about, a childish humor, mixed with bad and urgent music. What else is there to say, really? <br /> <br /> The End of the World ?? A marginal improvement, as we see our first scenario in outer space. Later questioned by the terrible contemporary humor, by the most subtle logic, by the bad rhythm and by the clichés of science fiction. <br /> <br /> The Unquiet Dead ?? The best episode to date that shows what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode, write dialogues of interesting characters and integrate an intriguing storyline. Only disappointed by the Doctor and Rose. <br /> <br /> Aliens of London / World War Three - Doctor who degenerates into farce. What else can you say. Penelope Wilton carries the proceedings with a bit of gravity, doing her best in terrible circumstances. Some elements of poorly written and misplaced soap operas come to the fore in these two episodes, and a return to poor rhythm, bad plot and deserving humor / satire. <br /> <br /> Dalek ?? Not exceptional, yet still far above the RTD rate to date. The rhythm and the script are fine (even if the Doctor and Rose are still irritating). The effects and threat of the Dalek are introduced well. The ending, however, took an interesting premise that reduced the Doctor's most famous enemy, into a cuddly and touching disorder, and turning a previously unknown threat into a blue rubber squid that looked like a child's toy. <br /> <br /> The Long Game - The first RTD script to show any plot, even if it was in the 80s cliché style. Nonetheless, he was a bit overshadowed by his habitual excessive addiction to youthful jokes, placing him too far in the future to make logical sense, and again a poor pace. Not as bad as his previous efforts, but immediately forgettable. <br /> <br /> Father's Day ?? The initial premise might have been vaguely interesting, but common sense and logic leave this episode from the beginning. Furthermore, we are treated to an entire episode of Soap Opera. Before starting to think, this is all about characterization, remember, there is a big difference between Soap Opera blades and characterization. On the plus side, it shows that RTD is not the worst writer so far. <br /> <br /> The Empty Child / The Doctor Dances - It started in a mediocre way, with some worthwhile moments, and some illogical errors that even a primary school student wouldn't do (windows well lit in a blackout, anyone?) . After this, the first part takes a more interesting and left turn. Florence Hoath really steals these episodes, showing us how it could have been an interesting companion. He could also act. Instead we get the annoying and politically correct Captain Jack as a new companion. The conclusion was a bit hasty, but sufficient. The rhythm and script are improved with a reasonably good storyline, making these two episodes rather suggestive and intriguing. <br /> <br /> Boom Town - I have to be honest, except for a few examples, I was so disillusioned with the current series, that after seeing the trailer for another episode of "Slitheen", I gave up and I didn't subject to torture. <br /> <br /> Bad Wolf - Reality TV, probably the worst aspect of modern media, is basically used as a premise. There is no subtlety whatsoever. Do we get any interesting social commentary like in The Running Man or Truman Show? No of course not. This is in an RTD episode, so I'm basically here to cynically try and attract the audience for those shows. Once again, the logic leaves the window, as there will be 200,000 years in the future. RTD uselessly searches for the horn of a shoe in a "super-stable" story here, with no relevance except its existence and when the bad guys are revealed at the end ... They make empty threats, and the Doctor grins once again like an idiot to the climax! The faster the pace, for the most part, compared to other RTD efforts, this has one or two interesting moments. Otherwise, another dull installment. <br /> <br /> The Parting of the Ways - The big final. More than a wet squid, literally. All of Dalek's threat created in "Dalek" is broken down, becoming rather pathetic. So many holes in the plot emphasize this episode, with the typical mediocre devices. Daleks wants to gather humans like Daleks, but then vaporize entire continents? Can Dalek vaporize those continents, but not destroy the Tardis in space? Is the Tardis now indestructible and can it land anywhere, even on people so they can be saved in it? Can this skill not be used to easily destroy Dalek's "god"? The Daleks can vaporize entire continents, but don't swim the satellite 5 to destroy the doctor, and instead let him play? Is the doctor a pathetic coward without the conviction of his actions, having uprooted his entire species to try to eliminate the Daleks? These and many other holes aside, we are treated to the thinnest solution ever made, combined with an almost useless narrative arc. <br /> <br /> So what can we say about the new series, all-in? <br /> <br /> Would this have earned a second series if it was anything other than Doctor Who, with RTD behind? Most of the episodes were seen as something other than not original and forgettable, if they were anything other than Doctor Who, and the RTD name was attached? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Some people would like us to think we could not say anything against RTD, since we are indebted to them for bringing Doctor Who back to our screens. However, this is at the expense of good characters and stories. Personally, I would prefer not to have a poorly conceived and ill-conceived product, baked at that price. I'd rather wait for someone to come and make a real effort. For the most part, this is the kind of childish trash that gives SF a bad name, ruining what is otherwise the most creative genre.
