You know, as you get older, you somehow think that the movies you didn't like when you were young might have been because of your youth and inexperience. Case in point, when I saw The Godfather at the age of 14, I thought it was boring. 20 years later, it's an incredible film for me. In other words, I grew up and started enjoying great movies. <br /> <br /> So I hired Dirty Dancing with my girlfriend last night at her request, as she loved him at 14 and I hated him the same age. But I was hoping, because I was young and stupid at age 14, maybe this would be a new experience for me. So I sat down with her to watch, hoping to be enlightened. <br /> <br /> Well, the night after seeing Dirty Dancing, I hear a violation. I feel like someone has reached my soul and robbed me of 2 hours of my life watching this cheese festival. <br /> <br /> First, Patrick Swayze is 20 years old, but 35 years old. the premise of the film is to seduce a minor teenager, woo her with her dance moves. Really scary. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is the plot of the clich√© in which the boy of the "wrong part of the tracks" and the "rich intelligent girl" accidentally fall in love with each other. Of course, their love story is fueled by the fact that the "rich girl" doesn't know how to dance, so the "poor hero" teaches her in a week to become an expert dancer for the great weekend show, or something like that . <br /> <br /> But you guessed: the disapproving father soon enters and forbids the two to see each other, and the film progresses into secret meetings of dance and love lessons. All this culminates in the final scene in which the entire resort gathers around the two young lovers while the once antagonist father accepts the 35-year-old dancer as his daughter's new man. <br /> <br /> Even my girlfriend whined at the end of the film, as she admitted, it was nothing like she remembered. I didn't press it, but I smiled a little, and inserted the Godfather Part II into the DVD player.
