This fourth film in the saga of "Angel Guts", which in just a few minutes above an hour (it only feels much longer), is also the shortest, which is perhaps just as valid as the most uninspiring of the series. Nami, a department store employee, is interested in another part-time job. Her workmate at the department store introduces her to modeling for a porn magazine called "red porn". But when his other employers discovered his bad photos, they decided to fire her. And she receives some unwanted admirers. Oh yes and she likes to masturbate ..ALOT. Using various household items. Wall-to-wall wallcapades mask the lack of a recognizable texture and push this too far into the exploitative territory, not surprising, given that the director of this is Toshiharu Ikeda ("Evil Dead Trap", "Beautiful Prey"). Perhaps his sensitivity was not suitable for an Angel Guts movie. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Commentary by Jasper Sharp; Bio / Filmographies; a 36-minute interview with Toshiharu Ikeda; Original Sleeve art; and Trailers for this and 4 more films by Angel Guts (High School Co, Red Classroom, Red Vertigo and Red Porno) are all available in the Box-set of Artsmagik, but for some reason the sixth movie "Angel Guts: Red Flash" does not it's in the set
