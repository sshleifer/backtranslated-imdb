This film was so blurry, rambling and uneven that it was an effort to look at it all. (Actually I thought some interesting elements of the plot could develop.) This was nothing more than a "training by age" film for the thirty-year-old generation. Total fuck and I have no idea what Julianne Moore was doing as it was the only reason I got it from the rental store shelf.
