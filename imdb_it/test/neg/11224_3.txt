What are Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. doing? Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece about problems in low-income schools. While the topic is one that needs to be addressed, the film uses every click in the genre and looks like a textbook popcorn movie. The characters are clippings from the internal version of The Breakfast Club or even The Faculty. Watch this with your children when they turn 13 or 14. With them, it could be an outlet for a lesson on current social problems. For anyone older, it will be nothing but something to watch and spit at 4 am, as I did recently on Bravo. In fact, what was he doing on Bravo?
