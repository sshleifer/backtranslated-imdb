... why watch a TV drama (advertised as a comedy) in which none of the characters is funny or even interesting people? I can see what the writer David Renwick was trying to achieve: the beggars and the bad surprises he put in "A foot in the grave", etc. I admit that the script made a little more effort than most on British TV at the time. But really ... who cares about these people? They are cold fools. <br /> <br /> Another poster mentions the scene where the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her late ex-boyfriend getting fucked. This was the moment when I turned off this program, never to return. <br /> <br /> P.S. It is interesting to note that the posters that did not like this series are all British, while those that praise it are mostly in other countries. This reflects the fact that when the BBC broadcast this series it was ignored by the spectators and sunk like a stone. <br /> <br /> P.P.S. Good news for those who liked it! There will be a second series in the fall of 2007, although without the male lead. It seems that the BBC has decided to turn it into a more conventional 30-minute sitcom.
