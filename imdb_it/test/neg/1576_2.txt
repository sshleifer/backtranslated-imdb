I saw this film while browsing through the infomercials and sitcoms of the 80s on TV, one evening at 2 am. I must say that I didn't expect much and I didn't get much. Although Rose McGowan is sexy, her performance and the rest of the cast were not worthy of Oscar, to say the least. This film has its ups and downs, and it has quite a few twists in the end, but in all honesty it was terrible. Not even a typical slasher movie. No blood, no sex, no nudity, no real violence. Only bad acting. I would give a 3 out of 10.
