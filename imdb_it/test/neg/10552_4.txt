There were nice characters here, played by nice looking actors and actresses, plus he had a famous band and some famous dancers ..... yet the movie didn't work. When it was almost over, I was bored to death. The dialogue was stupid, the humor (mainly that of Milton Berle) was absolutely stupid and the music was not just my alley. <br /> <br /> I've never been a fan of the big band, anyway, and if I hear "In The Mood" I'll throw up again. <br /> <br /> This was my first look at the famous skater-actor Sonja Henie and I have no complaints about her. Almost a part of the problem, at least with humor, is that it is so dated that it is no longer fun. Berle, Phil Silvers, Bob Hope, Red Skeleton, Abate and Costello, etc. Etc. They were hilarious to the crowd in the 40s and 50s but the changes in humor, and what was fun then is not today.
