The plot of Black Mama White Mama, revolves around two prisoners, in a women's prison in the Philippines. One black and one white. These two women are thrown together in the prison. Pam Grier is Lee Daniels Lee is incarcerated in the infernal female prison, to dance as a harem. <br /> <br /> Lee's boyfriend owes his share of his profits from his drug dealing activities. Lee is mainly interested in escaping from prison to take his boyfriend's drug money, so he can leave the Philippines and take on a better life. Margaret Markov plays Karen Brent, a white woman from a privileged environment, who is also a revolutionary. Karen joined a group of revolutionaries, determined to change Phillipino's corrupt political system. She is captured by the authorities of Phillipino and held as a political prisoner. <br /> <br /> The plot takes off, when Karen and Lee escape from the prison where they were together. The two of them were also chained together by the wrist. While they flee, they also fight with each other, because they have different goals to pursue. Of course, they hate being chained together. But they also realize that they have to put aside their differences, to help themselves survive while they escape capture. <br /> <br /> If this movie looks very similar to The Big Bird Cage, it is because most of the cast in the two films are the same, as is their position in the Philippines. Roger Corman has always had a constant stable of actors, which he used in all his films of the 70s. In addition to Pam Grier, Sid Haig, Roberta Collins, Claudia Jennings, Betty Anne Rees and William Smith, they were also among the many actors who were often included in Corman's AIP films. <br /> <br /> Like The Big Bird Cage, Black Mama White Mama, relies on too much bloody violence to be palatable. Pam Grier plays her usual tenacious girl in this film and shows her competence as a female action heroine. Margaret Markov has less effect in her portrait of the revolutionary Karen. She seems fragile and well-groomed, to be a dedicated political guerrilla. Except Sid Haig, like the colorful Ruben, the rest of the cast is forgettable. <br /> <br /> This film has little entertainment value, unless excessive and atrocious acts of violence are your passion. Only the performances of Pam Grier and Sig Haig make this film worth seeing.
