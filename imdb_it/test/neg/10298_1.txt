I don't know what viewers of today's film expect, but after 68 years of watching the movie .. (Well, maybe I haven't seen many movies in the first 9-10 years, so make sure you make 58 years of film) entertained, not bored with tears, attacked by constant swear words (every other word) and idiotic scenes of violence that are presented with no other purpose in mind but to show the blood splattering and the parts of the body being crushed. Surveillance is one of those films made by people who have NO imagination, little or no talent, a total inability to tie the scenes together and an unreasonable trait to let a scene go on and on, long after the purpose for it is spent. That anyone would have ever thought it was a useful movie, when it's nothing but Hollywood trash is beyond me. As a combat veteran I saw violence, blood and blood in many forms, and films like We were soldiers are as violent as a film can get, but have redeemed value. The surveillance must have been imagined by people in a drug induced stupor, without writing skills, without directing training, without experience in film editing and total lack of contact with reality. Just a silly movie of two serial killers posing as FBI agents, creating a scenario to kill some stupid dirty-mouthed cops, etc. A very expensive piece of trash that only an idiot could like ...
