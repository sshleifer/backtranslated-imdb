hair, the film based on the broadway success, fails to achieve any redeemable cinematic quality. you can't really take the game and make it a movie. if one is so tempted by rock music to see this film, that really takes away the quality of a Broadway show. worse than seeing sitcom replicas. musical fiasco, and I cannot believe that others have judged it so high.
