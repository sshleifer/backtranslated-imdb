The Canterville Ghost (1996). The director made this production a little mushy. Maybe it's the generation, but I really liked the Charles Laughton version. There is a time and a place to "emulate" and this production does not translate very well. Patrick Stewart, playing Shakespeare was very good, but still inappropriate. I would not recommend or look again. Close-ups and text and secondary storylines have been lost on me. The addition of foreign material and scenes takes away from a great work. The writer should find another profession in which to place his talent in the wrong way, perhaps afternoon soap operas would be a better place. Take a look at the really good version and pass on this one.
