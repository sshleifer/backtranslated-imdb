Five Fingers is so ugly that I don't know where to start. So, first of all, I admit that I only saw the first half hour. When the first finger was cut, I thought of sleeping a more useful activity. I told my girlfriend the meaning of "five fingers" and she immediately followed my example. <br /> <br /> Can the producer, director and / or screenwriter not consult a chess player? Like me? They should have used a digital clock and not an analogue. This big joke makes the mental pressure exerted on Martijn just a laugh. How, when and why did Martijn go out with a Moroccan girl? This relationship is very rare in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> Calling me late is obviously an insult to all those people who suffer with a much lower average IQ. Also, as far as I know, the retarded don't play chess. I'm doing. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is obviously the script. Just compare the small smart movie Hard Candy. To keep the viewer in a trap, the information must be revealed a little at a time. A nice turn from time to time also helps. I understand from other reviews, that there is a big one at the end of the film. Any intelligent person can guess what it is. This obviously raises more questions - why is the travel guide killed? Oh my, why should I care too? The whole film focuses on one thing: chopped fingers. The producers haven't even learned the lesson from Hitchcock: it's exciting to blow up a bomb. It is more exciting to show that ticking bomb. But no, we don't see the cutter until the impossible countdown is over. I won't waste words on this shit anymore. Go see Hard Candy.
