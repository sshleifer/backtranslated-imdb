It starts as a very serious social comment that makes one quickly think of other Clark films like Kids, Bully, etc. But then just as quickly, it unravels in a senseless mess. Who is the main character? Is it a serious movie or a Gregg Araki-esquire on the goofy top movie? Is it a skate documentary with moments of dialogue inserted? I have no idea. I found myself looking at my watch and wondering when this asshole would end. I kept thinking that there would be a great shocking climax that never arrived. I cut a good 20 minutes out of the movie with fast forward through the useless skate scenes. Yes, it illustrates the landscape that changes among the poor. I got to go back to the beginning. Kids and Bully was made in such a way that I really felt like I was looking at the realities of that group of friends. Wassup felt very staged, badly built and played worse and worse. Teenage Caveman, which Larry did not write but directed, was terrible. But at least it seemed that it was a terrible film that didn't take itself seriously. Wassup Rockers was simply bad.
