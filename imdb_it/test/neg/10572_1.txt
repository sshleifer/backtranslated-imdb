I went with some friends and one of my mum friends, thinking it would be a good way to start the spring break, but the movie turned out to be horrible. We all agree that it should not have been PG-13. More like material R. A lot of sexual dialogues, swearing and referring to parts of boy and girl (under the waist). Not worth the time or the money. We strongly urge you not to go, or rent it when it comes out. If you finish, don't take small children. Not the kind of movie to watch with the family! If you are curious about the content, consult the content consulting section on the Superhero movie page on IMDb. Most of the content that was supposed to be funny was extremely rude. Especially when they make fun of Steven Hawking.
