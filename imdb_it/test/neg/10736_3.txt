I think that this film lacks so much substance that it is not even worth discussing. <br /> <br /> In the first one, the package is really disgusting. Especially the stereotype of filming and photography. Surely, the cinematographic style of Joe Dante was appropriate and interesting in "Gremlins" and "Small Soldiers", I mean the beautiful visual and imaginative story of a Spielberg-wunderkind (I really love these movies), but in "Homecoming" it was completely failure. The attacks of toy soldiers and furry creatures are not simply comparable to the invasions of zombies (dead, stinking, rotten beings that try to kill the living - without any logical reason, just because they hate them). <br /> <br /> Zombie movies are characteristic of simple, direct, unconventional and brutal cinematography. Nothing to see in Joe Dante's debut. Another point is the annoying content: really stupid dialogues between the two main characters, a macabre exploitation of the "elder brother dies and leaves the youngest traumatized" and bad acting. And by the way, "Homecoming" is neither scary nor bloody - and even less fun. See, it's not even a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Zombie films in the decade of their birth - the late 1960s / early 1970s - were revolutionaries, provocative (especially through its macabre, explicit content) and subtle social critic. The original Zombie movie was actually a midnight movie called "Night of the Living Dead" (1968). This was a low-budget film that covered so many controversial themes, it's hard to name them all: a visual style by Hitchcock / Raimi, the American lifestyle of the 70s, political indifference, the imminent conquest of human rights by blacks and racism even more imminent as a result on the side of conservative Americans (recalls the shooting of the main black character at the end of the film). <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the creativity of midnight movies and want to learn more about the most important ones, I recommend "Midnight Movies: From the Margin to the Mainstream". <br /> <br /> So avoid "Homecoming" and also of "Land of the Romero" Dead ".
