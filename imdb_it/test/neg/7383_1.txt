OMG!!!! This was the first Broken Lizard film done in a group (although it recently came to the video), and I've never been more disappointed in my whole life !!! I tell you what, if I had seen this movie before seeing Super Troopers (which, by the way, is a movie A $$ of football !!!), I would never have seen it !! I had read several online reviews, as well as on the cover of the DVD, that had raved about it as "the funniest movie of Broken Lizard ever!" Now, if they referred to the Super Troops as their funniest movie ever, I would agree not to stop, but not this one. Let's talk about dry. It took a good 45 minutes to go to the cinema and, at that point, I was so out of the mood to watch it, that it wasn't even worth it. Maybe you have to be tall to be really funny? I do not know. I love these guys, really, but that movie is by far the worst they ever made. Club Dread was a pretty good movie, but this, just wow. I highly recommend the Super Troopers if you want a good laugh, but if you want some romance, drama, with some fun points, I'd say go with Puddle Cruiser. But only my opinion, everyone has the right to them! :)
