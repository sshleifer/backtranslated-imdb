When I decided to try watching a movie about cryogenic zombies ("crioneids"), I didn't expect much. This is exactly what I got, and then even less. Apart from the lack of special effects (squibs?) And a serious lack of any acting talent, "The Chilling" also sports the worst screenplay I've ever seen in a movie. I had to interrupt the tape several times during the first 45 minutes to repair the damage done to my intellect for having witnessed such atrocious dialogues that were found here. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the character collection is so Formulaic and one-dimensional it is ridiculous: the corrupt doctor; his assistant, played by Linda Blair (we know that she is his "assistant" because he calls her repeatedly from that title); the recently widowed businessman with a heart of gold who develops a romantic interest with the character of Blair; his criminal son; the alcoholic, abusive, unemployed boy of the character of Blair, to whom we are introduced in the most ingenious use of a flashback; and, of course, the rough, hard, bearded security guard who becomes the hero. Apparently, the preservation fluid that some cryogenics laboratories use on its bodies is highly conductive, naturally causing a disaster when all the laboratory containers end up outdoors in an extraordinary sequence of events during a lightning storm (on Halloween night, not less). As for the zombies, if you like to watch people in green latex masks that run in aluminum clothes, then "The Chilling" is the film for you. The action of the zombies is very weak at its best; the method of primary killing of zombies seems to grab people by the shoulders and shake them to death. The businessman and the security guard do most of the fighting against the zombies, including a very intense scene of refueling the undead with liquid nitrogen. Let me tell you, the steelworks scene in "T2" has nothing on "The Chilling" in portraying an enemy that has frozen on its tracks that way. <br /> <br /> How Linda Blair ended up stuck in the middle of this piece of dreck is really a mystery. True, his career didn't exactly skyrocket in the 80s (unfortunately), but this film is embarrassing for her. The script does not even have the decency to put it to good use. The most that his character is given to do is shout things like "Here they come", "Do something", "Hurry!" The only thing I can understand is that poor Linda was compensated for her work on this film in food rations. The hero is played by the same Grizzly Adams, Dan Haggerty. In this photo, he faces the tough competition of his beard and guard dog, and does his best to overcome both. <br /> <br /> The only terrifying part of "The Chilling" is the introduction that brings up the factual elements of cryogenics and suggests that "the film you are about to see could happen in your own community". Since I was counting the number of times some names were repeated in the credits, I was surprised to see Lucasfilm credited. Fortunately, it was only for the production of the sound of the film. 1/10.
