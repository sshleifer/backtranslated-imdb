I can't understand how terrible this movie was. My eyes want to jump out of my head and my ears are gushing blood from the horrible soundtrack of a horrible song. There are four children and a dog who run away from a hospital and then run away stealing two cars and a bus. No one gives them any punishment or something to correct them. The acting is so horrible that it looks like a video of instructions for a social studies lesson. I can't think of anything I like about this movie. Anything. Even the child who loses his dog has made me want to vomit. Bring the dog back without the lady seeing the dog run out the door. Maybe the dog was trying to escape from this movie. Then there is horse manure in the whole mix. Watching this movie was torture. Then at last the older boy says that being together is not a crime and everyone embraces him and loves him. Stealing gas is a crime. Stealing two cars and a bus is a crime and should have gone to the youth room or something. Avoid this movie at all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together.
