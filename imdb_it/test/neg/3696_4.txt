I was interested in seeing him since he was cited as the worst film ever on a 50's science fiction voice in a British magazine from the early 1980s called "The Movie" (incidentally, the Leonard Maltin Film Guide also assigned this the enviable rating BOMB). When it was released on DVD last year, I became interested in buying the "Cult Camp Classics" box set in which it was included (along with QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE [1958] and THE GIANT BEHEMOTH [1959]); however, since I recently purchased QUEEN on DVD-R, I had paid for the idea. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I just came across the DivX movie - however, the print was not selected by Warners DVD (which is said to have a surprisingly pleasant transfer) but rather a muddy TV print ... even if not so much that the detail is lost (in other words, it was like watching the film in sepia instead of black - and white!). Anyway, to get to the question at hand: I have to admit that, in a sense, I was disappointed that the film didn't turn out to be the festival of laughter I had been expecting all this time (Maltin defines it) hilariously horrible "); actually, I found it quite engaging - and fortunately short of just over an hour in length. However, some undeniably fun aspects remain - such as when the old nurse starts to scream her head at the sight of the 50-foot woman, and when the deputy almost invests her boss and the protagonist's butler in her enthusiasm to help in a case so unusual. Not even the special effects struck me as "among the funniest" (Maltin again) on the film - although they are certainly embarrassing! <br /> <br /> OK, so the idea that an alien (in human form of gigantic size, dressed in caveman rags and radioactive to boot!) comes to Earth in a large spaceship in the shape of ball (!) and apparently after the precious heroin necklace is an absolute nonsense - and its almost transparent appearance does not do it at all ... but, in reality, it is human history that holds our attention (relatively speaking). The womanizing husband character is not very interesting, but her two women are: the wealthy but annoying alcoholic wife Allison Hayes and the ambitious and violent girl Yvette Vickers. Also involved in the narrative are Hayes' faithful servant (already mentioned), a couple of policemen (one of them, as noted elsewhere, amiably stupid) and as many doctors (one of whom is called Dr. Cushing [!] And another a specialist which is called when Hayes starts to grow in size after being exposed to radiation. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film could be seen as the inverted female version of THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN (1957) - although it wouldn't be fair compare the two further, since the Jack Arnold / Richard Matheson classic has a much more psychological / intellectual approach, in fact, Hayes does not seem to be so concerned about his "condition" and, in fact, he takes advantage of it to teach her husband a lesson! However, his fury - exaggerated in the movie posters of the time - is rather unique (especially considering that it occurs only in the last ten minutes or so), when it is not shown I see the damage caused by her enormous but very unconvincing hand (especially when raising the puppet that should be her husband!), one sees above all walking for a long time and almost from behind (with her dimensions also incoherent in proportion to the buildings she passes ) !! However, the disappearance of Hayes through electrocution (when he runs into an electric cable) is done competently. <br /> <br /> Finally, I followed him with his 1993 TV remake with Daryl Hannah as the titular creature - which I specifically rented for this purpose.
