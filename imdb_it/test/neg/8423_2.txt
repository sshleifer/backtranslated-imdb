So what can you do if you are a porn star with a faded appearance? I know, become a popstar! This documentary - and I use the term freely - follows Colton's trials and tribulations as he tries to transform from a gay porn star into an electronic music singer (read: dance). I only wish that Mr Ford's voice was as muscular as his arms ... I am sorry to say that his voices are painfully thin. There is not much to do here, but Mrs Ford and her friends are pretty eyes. <br /> <br /> Watch it while recording a song that looks exactly like any other brainless dance tune. Watch him travel to New York to make "connections". Watch him return to L.A. with little success. Look in the mirror and ask, "Why am I wasting my time looking at this mess?"
