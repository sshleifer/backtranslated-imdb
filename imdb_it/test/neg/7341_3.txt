This film was shot in Randolph County in central North Carolina in 1968, when a film crew from the state was a rare thing. The places were the municipalities of Liberty and Ramseur and the surrounding rural countryside. It is not a particularly beautiful film. He had Merle Haggard and brought life to the hinterland for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot is standard shooter. Cinematography is that fuzzy stuff that came out of the late sixties and early seventies. Local people were excited to be part of the company. <br /> <br /> If viewers find it difficult to find a copy of this film, a copy is available in Asheboro, North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Uncredited actors include Ben Jones, Mimi Pravda, Tommy Hull, Bill Nunnery.
