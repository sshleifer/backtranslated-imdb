Even if I hadn't read "Queen of the Damned" by Anne Rice from "Vampire Chronicles", I probably would have thought this movie was just awful. <br /> <br /> It was without taste, without plot, absolutely meaningless. I sat for a while thinking about the plot dissociated from the book, and the more I thought about it, the worse it was. To associate it in some way with the previous Chronicles movie is ridiculous as it is ridiculously inconsistent with that film, not to mention the book. The few ideas taken by Rice's genius in "The Vampire Chronicles" have been massacred and ridiculed. <br /> <br /> It's an absolute insult to Anne Rice fans everywhere and a pathetic excuse for a legacy in being the last Aaliyah movie. Really, it's an insult to Aaliyah fans. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only compliment can be paid to sound effects and some graphics. As much as they may be, it's still not enough to make me regret spending time watching this movie. In fact, I signed up for this registration for the sole reason of telling people that they are concerned about watching this movie (7 years after the release, how it could be) to not waste their time or expect much more than disappointment.
