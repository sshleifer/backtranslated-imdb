"Happy Days" was produced and broadcast from the mid-70s to the early 80s and seems to become more ridiculous with age. At the time of its broadcast, most viewers who grew up in the 1950s were middle-aged with families, and the scenes at Mel's Diner probably brought them an artificial nostalgia. The Fonz was obviously the most cool of the cold (even though the actor Henry Wrinkler has never learned to ride a motorcycle so far). Richie Cunningham was the blond American boy who probably would have been elected president of the student body. Potsie was Richie's best friend - the star of the show must have a best friend, I guess. And Ralph Malph was Fonz's bumbling sidekick, if not the entire group. I loved it when Fonz beat up poor Ralph Malph. And there was Mel, the middle-aged elder who ran Mel's Diner. And of course who could forget Mork's appearance? Was it really 1950? Ironically, films produced in the 1950s, such as "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The Wild One" have improved with age and portray the most honest period of this show that was produced 20 years after the period He portrays. > <br /> Unfortunately, the TV show "Happy Days" is not in the same category as "Rebel without a cause" or "American Graffitti" for that matter. "Happy Days" may have captured some aspects of the 50s with its burger diner, juke box, fantastic machines and plaid shirts, but it is more a nostalgic idealism made strictly for laughter than for an honest representation. "American Graffitti" had something to say about young Americans in the 1950s, while "Happy Days" seemed more about what the middle-aged people of the 70s wanted than the 50s. The result was a type of watered down assembly that really has nothing to do with the 1950s. "Happy Days" is, at best, a fantasy comedy with some of the artificial cultures of the 50s as a background. As pointed out by another reviewer, the American boy Richie Cunningham would probably have been punished for making friends with people like Fonzie. And Mel would probably forbid Fonzie from entering his diner. <br /> <br /> A short story: "Happy Days" was originally a pilot called "Love in the Happy Days" which was refused for transmission. Comedy pilots who had sex and romance themes that failed to direct the air sometimes appeared on the "Love American Style" radio show that was often broadcast in place of baseball games that had rained or other unexpected cancellations of programming and / or alterations. In short, "Love American Style" was a show to throw away that contained all these comedy pilots from an episode that never made their debut. "Love in the Happy Days" appeared as a "Love American Style" show in the early 1970s, but at the time TV executives could not foresee how a show about young people in 1950 would have been popular, particularly during the hey-day comedies focused on middle-aged people, such as The "Mary Tyler Moore Show" (and his subsequent spin-offs like "Rhoda"), "The Bob Newhart Show" and "All in the Family". (How things have changed since most TV sit-coms are dedicated to young people and the industry avoids most shows on middle-aged people like the plague!) <br /> <br /> Next, one of the young stars of "Love in the Happy Days", a child actor of "The Andy Griffith Show" named Ron Howard, had the opportunity to star in a movie about young people from 1959 called "American Graffitti" directed by the relatively unknown George Lucas whose previous "THX 1138" had bombed the box office miserably. Even when it was premiered to film executives, the studios again couldn't see how a movie about young people in the 1950s could become popular because it didn't fit in with what had been popular in the past, even if they didn't make it I realize that much of the cinema audience had been young in the 1950s. As everyone knows, the film was a great success, and the studio executives acknowledged having completely misjudged their audience. Somewhere during the theatrical broadcast of "American Graffitti", television executives realized they had a comedian in their vault that looked very much like "American Graffitti". They reported it with the original cast, plus Henry Wrinkler in the role of "The Fonz", renaming it "Happy Days" and the rest is the history of TV, becoming one of the most popular shows of the 70s. <br /> <br /> "Happy Days" now looks ridiculous. The characters are flat and cardboard, never more or less than what they are superficially. The issues they deal with are trivial. And their reactions seem foolish and even silly. Nowadays, the Fonz character seems to be a caricature of, well, The Fonz. Was the idea to be a kind of parody of the character of Marlon Brando in "The Wild One"? Looking at the show with new eyes, I feel that the producers really missed out on a great opportunity to present the 50s with depth and realism that still could be fun and entertaining. Instead the producers decided to laugh for little money for quick money. This is definitely a show that has not stood the test of time. "American Graffitti" has many external appearances of "Happy Days", but has had an advantage. He had honesty about the characters and their problems. "Happy Days" took on the appearance of "American Graffitti" but failed to take its heart.
