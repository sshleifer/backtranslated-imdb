Imagine watching a slide show where the projector stays on each slide long enough to allow it to be stored completely three times. Now imagine that the images in the slide show are entirely of trivial scenes ?? a small park; and empty tennis court; a piano. Now imagine that the people who run the slide show have a frustrating, slow and semi-lucid conversation about events that only occasionally refer to the slides that show you. Great ?? you just imagined the entirety of the "India Song" movie. <br /> <br /> The film is an agonizingly slow montage of images that do little, if not simply, to shout "Look at me! I am DEEP !!" with such blatant importance that the images themselves and the film as a whole are not only without depth, but COMICALLY without depth, the images could easily be replaced by a series of static images as described above, since it is so rare that there are actually people on the screen, and even when they are, people they move only slightly more often than furniture, they never talk or interact in any meaningful way, they are simply there looking at each other and sometimes crying The most energetic moment of the entire first hour of the film is when three people go through a parking lot in slow motion, in fact, the graphic could be left completely out, because the story is told completely through the narration. na woman who hates India because it is hot, and hates people do not hate India because it is hot (this point is covered several times). He also talks about a man who feels he has the right to sleep with the woman mentioned above, since he will sleep with anyone who asks her to do it, but he can't sleep with her simply because he never asks, and is very upset about it . Then he stares at her as a single tear runs down his cheek. Later, he stares at his bicycle, while a single tear runs down his cheek. Actually, you can't see the single tear running down his cheek when he stares at his bike, but you know it's there anyway, just because it's the kind of movie that it is. <br /> <br /> The best thing is that the narration becomes a background buzz, which serves as a perfect complement to the coma-inducing images. Simply remaining conscious through the totality of this film would require a supreme determination. Looking at it and actually coming away with a serious and meaningful idea of ​​what it should have meant would have induced the same type of migraine to try to read long technical documents in the dark. This film is perhaps the greatest monument of pseudo-artistic claim that man will ever know.
