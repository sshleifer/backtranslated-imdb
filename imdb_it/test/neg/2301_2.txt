This film is the last straw in a list of movies I've seen this week that pushed me over the edge and forced me to join IMDb and spread a warning to the public. It was absolutely horrible. The film was designed and painfully boring. The sound, the effects and even the quality of the images seemed to come from Willow (1988) or perhaps also from Conan the Barbarian (1982). The Battle of Bannockburn was absolutely absurd. This "greatest filmic reconstruction of the medieval battle ever set in the British Isles" made me laugh. There was not even a consistent formation, only some boys with spears and horses crossing them. The scenes of Douglas, especially in the last battle, were simply horrible, as were most of the acting in the film.
