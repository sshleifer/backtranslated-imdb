The original GRUDGE (the original American remake) has surprisingly pulled out just about everything you could do with a ghost movie. He had a suspended, gloomy and moody atmosphere, some good shakes and some really gruesome images. THE GRUDGE 2 tries all these techniques, but ultimately fails, showing us only the same old things we saw in the first film, as well as a messy plot that passes constantly from Tokyo to California. He starts in Tokyo with some students who roam around the house, now heavily blocked by a strip of police tape. One of them comes face to face with a similar ghost-eyed girl while trapped in a closet. She comes out screaming frantically and everyone ends up out of there. So let's go to America where Karen's sister is sent by her mother to Japan to find her and bring her back home. In the end we find ourselves following a very familiar concept that involves a curious boy and girl investigating the history of a mysterious house. We cut back and forth the girls from the beginning that are disappearing one by one, as well as a guy who hears strange noises in the next apartment at night, leading to a very unsatisfactory ending. The "scare" scenes are boring and ineffective. Like The Ring 2, avoid this terrible sequel ...
