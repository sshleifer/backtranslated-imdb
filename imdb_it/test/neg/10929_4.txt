This is a rather simplistic love story. The girl finds the boy, the girl loves the boy, the girl loses the boy, the girl finds the boy. Colleen Moore is the exceptional ingredient of this recipe, offering a wonderfully varied dramatic / romantic show, well deserved by the Oscar. Equally beautiful are the special effects of aerial combat. <br /> <br /> Moore plays a French girl whose mother handed over her field to a British air squadron during the First World War. She is the "daughter of the regiment", loved as a little sister. In this mix comes a compilation for a downed flyer, Gary Cooper. At first they hate each other, then they love each other, then the whole squadron is sent on a suicide mission. Cooper returns but crashes into the village and a red cross removes it. Moore looks for him, he is told in a hospital that he died, then he wanders the streets until he calls from a hospital window and they get together. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful love story, but hardly more than that. Recommended for Ms. Moore and Mr. Cooper fans
