I share the same opinion regarding Underworld as a previous comment. <br /> <br /> I sat through the 1.5 hours of this film wondering what this story was and especially why the author and / or director made certain plot decisions. Overall I found the unbalanced film, consisting of strange sub-frames that (IMHO) actually had nothing to do with the film. Furthermore, by writing a thriller, I would say that you want your viewers to wonder about the story and not the way the plot is filmed ...
