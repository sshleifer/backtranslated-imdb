I saw him at the Madison Horror Film Festival and was disappointed. Some shocking and funny moments (fisting the empty Carla, a harpy urinating in Dreamland) and two interesting premises in competition (similar to New Nightmare with the conviction that brings to life a mythical character and also Lost Highway with a man who lives a fantasy in his head) but had long stretches without movement and inconsistent plot development. Just because you use the structure of dreams or a state of mental escape does not make Lynchian. You need compelling images and gruesome shows. <br /> <br /> Positive things: Dr. Maitland had a real comic timing and all the girls were very nice. Carla's father, Chalmers and Ingrid Pitt seemed to have some fun. And Tom Savini seemed to have his lines memorized and we couldn't see if he was just reading the cue. <br /> <br /> I get the Hammer references, but it seems that the director realized that the script was a snoozer and he just added some shocks to try to get some laughs from any footage he could put together. But they don't work because they are too few and far apart and create an inconsistent tone. Condens this to 30 minutes of all the fun parts and you may have a surreal fool short, but at characteristic length, skip it. It's not "so bad it's beautiful" it's just "so ugly it's boring".
