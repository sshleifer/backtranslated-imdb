I must prefigure this comment with a sort of admission: I suppose I have a soft spot for the original TV series of the 60s and 70s. I think the filmmakers here did it from the beginning with regards to the casting: in a supposed remake, the public would look for hip reflexes, athletic Linc (Clarence Williams III), or the cool, with Michael Cole , and so on. Instead, we get Giovanni Ribisi as a poor poor-white guy who turns out to be pathetic, as if he were in all his roles (in the office where I worked, I once enjoyed creating a fake movie poster, casting various actors as members of the office staff, guess who I chose as the lousy son of the company president?). Danes is OK like the new Julie, but none of the characters has much to do, as the story sits right there, stuck in conventionality. So it's pretty forgettable, too. What was I talking about?
