This film was taken from my mother of friends who worked in a charity shop. He gave it to us along with other unknown shippers. The film itself is a bit rubbish. There are some noteworthy elements to laugh like when his girlfriend gets his head screwed, but in general the film is bland. Interstedly when I saw the trailer for "The Island" I couldn't help but notice the similarities. Could Clonus have been the inspiration for that movie? All in all don't worry about watching this movie because it's boring and boring. We loved it so much when we were 16 years old that we called our band after it. Another sign that this film is a bit crappy is that the shots on the back of the video do not appear in the film? strange
