I rented this movie today ... the worst movie EVER. It was a total waste of time and a horrible story. The acting was horrible, especially from the "Sai" actress. It was so bad that it was ridiculous. I can't say if it was his bad acting or because the character was just stupid in the first place. I can't even think that this movie was horrible and meaningless. I'm surprised someone even thought it was a good idea to film this movie and worry about releasing it. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good Vampire / Horror movie .. this is not the movie for you. To move on! It's a waste of time and money. Heck, I wouldn't even DOWNLOAD this movie if someone paid me. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it doesn't even deserve a "1". I wish I could give a "0"!
