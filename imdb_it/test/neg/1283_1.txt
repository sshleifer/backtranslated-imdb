This film should go in the annals of the fief as one of the worst of all time. I'll just say it's the worst movie ever, just because I haven't seen all the movies yet. I can't make such high statements until then. The story is stale, the acting is horrible, at best, the "special" effects are no more than a couple of pounds. of dry ice and a fan. Someone must have been related to someone to make this film. Mr. Busey sent this in! The dog is well trained and cute, making him the only thing he redeems in this film that should never be done. Two hours and $ 3 of my life I will never go back.
