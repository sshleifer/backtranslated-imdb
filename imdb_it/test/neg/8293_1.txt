This film spends most of the time preaching that it is the script that makes the film, but apparently there was no script when they shot this waste of time! The trailer makes it a comedy, but the film can't decide if it wants to be a comedy, a drama, a love story or an action movie. Press releases indicate that Shatner and Hamlin made this film because they loved the script (what were they thinking?). If you like William Shatner (I do) see "Free Enterprise" instead.
