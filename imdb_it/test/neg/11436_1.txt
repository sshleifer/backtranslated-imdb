I can't understand what Jon Voight could think when he was involved in this tenth, incoherent, pretentious, shocking decay. He helped write the alleged "script" himself, and should be damned shameful. The film (I can't call it a "movie" because it barely moves) is wandering, embarrassing and pretentious, a bit like a bad Oprah Winfrey show, but worse. He wanders wildly back and forth from the Middle Ages to modern Los Angeles, with Voight as a television producer who thinks he is the reincarnation of a medieval prince who must save the kingdom from the machinations of his evil brother, and somehow this is transferred to modern times where Voight must save the country from the bad machinations of an oil company executive. If the bizarre casting (Wilfrid Brimley, Frankie Valli (!), Kaye Ballard and Armand Assante, among others) is not enough to kill him, the stupidly inept direction, the faded photography (it seems that it was shot with a really cheap 16mm camera ), the almost total lack of editing (the scenes go on forever or are cut off in the middle of a sentence) and the embarrassing and apparently fluid "acting" of consciousness is enough to bury it, which is exactly what it should have been to be done with it. A stunning experience. Avoid this dog at all costs.
