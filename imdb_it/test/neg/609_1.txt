A show about an incredibly stupid, a man-child and his hot, bitter wife. 99% of the storylines revolve around Doug doing something incredibly stupid and then a variable arrives: a) or hides it from his wife or b) tells his wife, she disorients him and then it's up to his father-in-law (Arthur: the character typecast of Seinfeld) to aggravate the situation. <br /> <br /> And writers dare to say that he was influenced by "Honeymooners" (an absolute classic) and that the plots are taken from real life situations, unless you live in a cave, you know that it's not true. <br /> <br /> Anyway, let's put it this way. If Kevin James had been skinny, the show would have been canceled by the pilot. If you are 12 or are fond of fat jokes .. be my guest, watch this show (or any other film by Kevin James). <br /> <br /> I've noticed that some posters are comparable to this parody of much higher shows like Friends, Seinfeld and Everybody Loves Raymond - I'm still wondering how anyone could do it
