I don't care what someone says, this movie was shit. The only thing he had was the camera work, which was very well done. As for the dialogue of which I have heard so many people ... he also sucked. Yes, he was honest and true to life, but then, I can hear someone talking like that on the street or in a fast food restaurant. What made the dialogue good in films like Pulp Fiction and Gosford Park was the fact that it is a WRITTEN dialogue, which takes time to reflect. Another thing was that the director should not have been on stage. I think the male character could have been much stronger, but instead he seemed weak. In fact the film seemed to revolve around the male character, and then completely disappears in the last twenty minutes. I found the girl in the film completely repugnant, not in appearance, but in her needy ways in need. Saying that she's in love with a guy, and that he's actually getting jealous of him the next day, what a shitty jerk. Last thing: the sound was terrible, and I hope it was just something that tormented my theater instead of being on the final cut of the film. There was a constant buzzing during several scenes and in reality he was taking away the ongoing talk. The only positive thing was Blood's work like the DP, but the actress who played the main boyfriend's ex-girlfriend did a great job. These two things cannot ultimately save a terrible movie, which I refuse to call a movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
