The Willies start late at night while their brother Josh (Joshua Miller) and Kyle (Jason Horst) camp out with their cousin Michael (Sean Astin), decide to pass the time by telling scary stories ... <br /> <br /> The first is Michael with a story called "Bad Apples" in which a boy named Danny Hollister (Ian Fried) is bullied at school, but the sinister new janitor Mr. Jenkins (James Karen) decides to help him. . <br /> <br /> The next one is Kyle telling a strange story called "Flyboy" in which an overweight bully with a worrying fascination with dead flies gets what he deserves horribly and twisted ... <br / > <br /> Written and directed by Brian Peck The Willies didn't do much for me and I doubt it will do much for you. The script is strange with regards to episodic anthologies, instead of the usual three or four stories it has only two main stories and some bizarre mini scenes of the "urban myth" in the beginning, these consist of the person who orders food from a fast food restaurant only to find a dead rat in his chicken, a man who dies of a heart attack during a ride and someone who tries to dry his poodle in the microwave just so it explodes. I have no idea what the purpose of these scenes is, but they don't add anything to the film, since the two main stories are both weak. To begin with they are too long and this is a big mistake in these types of films, usually the stories in the anthologies are short, sharp and fast with a nice turn at the end that usually involves people getting what they deserved. However in The Willies the stories last for the better part of 40 minutes each which is longer than the average television episode and I must admit that I found both stories very boring, they have very little to do for them and seem to be aimed at children. The first story is the best one to look at as a whole, but it has no end ending as far as I could see while the second has a nice ending "just deserts" but the reconstruction is weak and pulled out without a good reason. I really like horror movies, so The Willies is a disappointment, frankly it drops the genre. <br /> <br /> Director Peck was obviously working on a low budget and overall The Willies is quite difficult to sit on, there are a lot of continuity errors and it is bad. There is no atmosphere, there is no fear, there is no blood, the special effects are scarce and there are many times unnecessary blows of a dirty bathroom. Overall it is a rather unpleasant film to sit on. <br /> <br /> Technically The Willies is approximate to say the least, the effects are far from special and have an extremely gray and grainy appearance. Acting is mediocre, nobody will win any prize for sure. <br /> <br /> The Willies is a poor film, it is not scary, it is not funny, it is not funny and it presents only two too long stories. Definitely not recommended.
