I found this jewel in a rack that the local video rental shop had tapes that are exchanged between the various outlets. 'The man who went down Everest'. Hmm ... I've never heard of it. The box says of a Japanese guy who always wanted to ski down Everest and actually did it. Looks interesting. I rented it As expected, it was a documentary style. The first part can be summed up like this: "I always wanted to ski on Mount Everest". This is followed by some videos of preparation for the event. MANY preparation sequences. OK, I suppose it takes a lot of preparation. Then we are treated for a long time about the skier, the philosophy of life of Yuichiro Miura, etc. More filler follows and I begin to wonder where the ski fits in this show. More preparation is shown and they begin to make the trip to the mountains. More philosophy is shown. Eventually they come to the mountain and maybe maybe they'll go around skiing the damn thing. A lot of material to climb further down is a description of the parachute device intended to slow Miuras's speed down the steep slope. Finally he puts on his skis and gets ready to go. <br /> <br /> He is out ... He skis about ten meters and the skis come out from underneath, he deploys the parachute and falls into an inglorious bundle for a certain distance from the mountain and that's it. End of the story. What on earth was it? <br /> <br /> OK I can buy that you've always wanted to ski down Everest, made extensive preparations and actually tried with the TV crew in tow. It didn't work and ended up collapsing and almost killing itself, so which egregia hybris would have inspired the man to release a movie and call it skiing down Everest? Perhaps the title "The man who got his feet out from under him and slipped on his ass down to Everest" was too long for the cassette.
