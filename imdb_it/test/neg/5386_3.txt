The worst movie I've ever seen in my life. From amateur direction to acting of pornographic quality, it looks like a movie at home that someone decided to shoot because they had nothing else to do with their time. <br /> <br /> Unless you have more hope in life, absolutely avoid this crap. <br /> <br />
