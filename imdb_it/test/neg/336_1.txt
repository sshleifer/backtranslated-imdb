I am proud to be able to sit through everything. I think "if I paid the fee, I will watch it at least". I found the exception to this rule: the planet. I don't know what the exchange rate is, but reading the other comments I can only assume that Â£ 8000 must be around $ 150. I'll go out alone, but this film reminds me of the old Steve Reeves movies of the 1950s. He was a bodybuilder who became an actor. It was in these truly horrible Italian films, nicknamed Reeves' films like Hercules or other heroes tied to muscles. Like a child watching them, you couldn't understand why those movies were smelly - you only knew they did it. Mike Mitchell It's the new Steve Reeves. That's all ... is what it really was - a new story from an old Italian movie "Spaghetti Sand and Sandals". And no joke, where was Reeves born? Glasgow, Montana. This movie is not so bad that it's fun to watch - it's just plain ugly.
