I really enjoyed this movie. Number 5, the film's stellar robot is struck by lightning and something has happened to its circuits. It acts and thinks more like a human being. The robot repeats the advertisements it learns after watching the TV. He then applies these sayings to his situation. The number 5 is intelligent and witty. The character imitates the voices of the stars, try to dance like John Travolta in Staying Alive and many other things. He has a saying for most of his circumstances that he memorized. The actions of the robots are really good. Number 5 wants to guide, cook and please Stefany with all the characteristics of a human being. The way robots move and align is really hysterical. I'm disappointed that the writers couldn't keep everything clean for all the spectators. This film has a surprise that ends something you would not expect. I hate movies that have sworn in them even though I like them, I give them a lower grade. This film had bad words. Jesus Christ was used as a dirty word that offends me and is used at least 3 times. G-d D-m, Bull sh_t etc. It could have been a wonderful film without all this offensive language. There is no sex in this film, some violence like robots that blow up cars and machines.
