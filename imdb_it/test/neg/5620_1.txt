Who wrote this movie? A 15 year old uninspired? <br /> <br /> It may have been written by one of the guys who shot Columbine. <br /> <br /> Totally foolish, not funny at all, boooooooriing ... <br /> <br /> Also: the French don't put their flag everywhere. You do not enter a French bank and you see the tricolor flag displayed in this way. Even on Bastille Day. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the bloodbath thing. It's just that none of these is believable or amusing. Or parodic, or something. <br /> <br /> Ok, those who liked this movie will tell you that I have to be a fascist type, so forget my comment.
