Apparently this was an award winner. Apparently someone had a gun against his head and was forced to name Maize: the movie. <br /> <br /> Or this must have been a mistake. <br /> <br /> This is the most unwatchable movie ever made. Projection and editing are the biggest horror of this film. Two little girls get lost in a wheat field and are chased by someone who can be heard laughing under his rubber mask. The girls meet their hero, dad, and then he runs away from him, W.T.F. The hero dad in the film continues to lose track of them in the few minutes of watching this. <br /> <br /> The girls obviously weren't trained actors and had no common sense for them. They were so annoying and so childish in the film, not even remotely comic. Hearing them scream over and over like a broken record was the reason I got up and left. You can't even listen to this movie without almost having convulsions. <br /> <br /> I can throw up a winner of the best prize of this junk.
