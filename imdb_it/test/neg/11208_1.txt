For many years I have seen this film as a real ninja movie but after studying more about this culture I can only think that this is just another karate movie. A black shinobi and some weapons do not make a ninja, it is much more than that. The ninjas are the most dangerous warrior in Japan because they are trained in every aspect of life to survive anything, killing anything you try to stop them. This film is not about a ninja warrior who talks about a clown trying to be something he can't even understand.
