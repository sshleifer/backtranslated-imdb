Lord David Cecil wrote an interesting book in the early Victorian novelists of the 1930s, where he looked at the works of Dickens, Thackeray, Eliot, Trollope, Mrs. Gaskell, Charlotte Bronte and Emily Bronte. He chose these writers as the popular favorites of the first half of the Victorian period, and explained their strengths and weaknesses (as he saw them) to the reading public. Some of his comments are quite relevant to date, but like all criticisms they give an idea of ​​the spirit of the life of the critic. <br /> <br /> Cecil thought a lot about George Eliot (Mary Ann Cross), who wrote about seven or eight books (including sketches and poems). But for most modern readers, they are usually familiar with his shorter book, SILAS MARNER, which is still read in some school programs. The other books, FELIX HOLT THE RADICAL, DANIEL DERONDA, MIDDEMARK, THE MILL ON THE FLOSS, ADAM BEDE, ROMOLA, SCENES OF CLERICAL LIFE, are still in print (Penguin, for example, has most of these in print), but they are mostly unread. The one of greatest interest today is his latest novel, DERONDA, in which he discusses Jews in English society and an incipient kind of pre-Hertzl Zionism. ROMOLA is his only attempt at a historical novel (on the Savanarola experiment of a religiously pure republic in Florence in 1490). His most beloved novel is MIDDLEMARCH, which deals with English society in the provinces in 1832, the year of Lord Gray's great reform project. I had to read MIDDLEMARCH in college for a literature course. It is certainly a reflective book (Virginia Woolf called it the largest book in English). But he suffers (like all Eliot novels) from a defect - he cannot write a livable and exciting prose. While Dickens is excessively exuberant at times, and Thackeray can become pompous and verbose, and Trollope can become (as Lord Cecil says) very ordinary in his discussion, and Charlotte Bronte may not be able to explain certain relationships well, and Mrs Gaskell seems best deal with female characters, all (and Emily Bronte in her unique novel) arouse the reader's interest. Reading most of Eliot's novels is like trying to chisel sentences with marble blocks with a toothpick! <br /> <br /> To date I have read about fifty pages of MULINO DEI FLOSS. I notice that one of the other reviewers never finished the novel. But I read a synopsis of what it is. The Tullivers (Maggie and his brother Tom) are the central figures: they own the mill in the title. Although close to the beginning of the story, Maggie falls in love with the son of a neighbor whose father is in legal trouble with Mr. Tulliver Sr. Tom takes a poor view of this relationship, and the tragedy of the story is about the split between the brothers, which culminates in their end at the end (Maggie runs back to the mill to save Tom during a heavy flood, and they die together). It must have been a hit with Victorian readers, but it's very sad and depressing for the modern public. <br /> <br /> The film changed a bit of a finale - Maggie (Geraldine Fitzgerald) eventually dies with her lover, and Tom (James Mason) notes their deaths at the conclusion in his book. The story is completely rewritten, except for a double death in the flood at the conclusion. It doesn't really help things. Although Fitzgerald and Mason do quite well with their parts, they can't really bring out the film with their work alone. The end result is a fairly small film, which fortunately did not damage the protagonist's career. The only other thing to note is that the boyfriend was played by Frank Lawton, who two years earlier played David Copperfield when he was big with W.C.Fields, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan. But then, Lawton never had an important film career - he happened to always be around in photos, something good, mediocre.
