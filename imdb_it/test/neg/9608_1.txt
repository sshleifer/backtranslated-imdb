It is really a pity that IMDb does not allow you to give negative votes. This is the most horribly horrible sight ever made about the American public by our usually nice neighbors to the north. Parents are a troglodyte and neurotic witch. It is as fascinating as a well-used fire hydrant, with the same standards of hygiene. It is a wax museum dummy programmed with more neuroses than the entire cast of THE VIEW. Children are not entities if they are feminine and repulsive beyond imagination if they are males, in particular the title character. The boy is a serious contender for the madly smug, smug, arrogant and vain character of Disney, who is saying something. This show was obviously conceived as an anti-BRADY BUNCH, but it comes out as an anti-Christ. And why is photography so obscure?
