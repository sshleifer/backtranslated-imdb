Breaker! Breaker! has Chuck Norris as a truck driver and karate master, talks about juggling in two disparate careers. He gives a load he can't hand over to his younger brother Michael Augenstein and then when the young man doesn't show up, Chuck goes looking for him. <br /> <br /> What young Augenstein has done is a speed-trap handled by Judge George Murdock from Roy Bean's law school. Obviously Norris deals with matters in the usual way Chuck Norris and when he gets into trouble, the call goes off over the OdC because all the truckers come to give their good friend. This speed trap known as Texas City has a bad reputation and pilots are too happy to help a friend. <br /> <br /> Chuck is obviously a little younger and has no facial hair in this. He has the gaze of a man who realizes that the Academy will not look at this gobbler. George Murdock is outrageously exaggerating as the aspiring Judge Roy Bean. <br /> <br /> This is strictly for Chuck Norris fans.
