In the wake of the matrix, this parody of a film with vague connections to virtual reality has been reprinted with the tag "The Matrix has just taken Deadler!", In a box with a cover very inspired by Matrix (still called "Expect to die" ). though). Due to the choice of font, however, the tag-line appears worldwide as "Beablier" says. Anyway. <br /> <br /> To complete the transformation into a wannabe Matrix they mocked a VR fight scene with a Morpheus-a-like on the back of the box. It may be important to know that this character DOES NOT WORK IN THE FILM. <br /> <br /> Overall this film is a disguise at all levels. Jalal Mehri is a terrible actor and does not impress with his martial arts. However, his partner Stone is played by Evan Lurie, who in this film is simply the worst actor I've ever seen. He was clearly chosen to make Jalal look good in comparison. The worst movie I've seen in a long time.
