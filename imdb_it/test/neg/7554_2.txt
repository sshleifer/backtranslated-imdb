The production values ​​in this video are so poor that it is unwatchable. The performance came in second place in the incredibly creative studio album hijinks, with around thirty special effects per minute. It is filmed through a cloud of smoke, only a second or two of duration per shot and often the background reflectors shine directly into the camera. The lighting was terrible for shooting. There is a continuous zoom in and out with a total lack of visual continuity. There may be good dances available for the live audience but video viewers will never know.
