This is a great example of what could have been a great movie and a great idea, but it turned out to be very bad in the process. I was mainly tempted to get this because of the dumb DVD cover, but I did it anyway and I was shocked, in a bad sense. This film is essentially about El Chupacabra that unleashes chaos around Los Angeles and it's up to a local cop and a writer to save the day before two corrupt cops and two evil scientists take them down. The main reason why I didn't like this movie was because of great continuity errors that were hard to miss. Besides a bad acting, the right lighting and nothing disturbing, this film didn't hit me as much as it probably should have. However, compared to other Chupacabra films, this is definitely at the top of the charts, barely barely. <br /> <br /> First of all, the continuity in this film is very far and I mean from the shoulders and the ditch. There were so many points where the characters said or did something and then in the next shot, they weren't doing it or the change never happened. Case in point: the main character has a gun, attacks Chupacabra, pulls a talent out of thin air and distracts and the gun is missing. The girl runs while he defends himself here with the mysterious atmosphere and she didn't have the gun, so the main character is running with the girl and has the gun. Where talent comes from and what happened to the gun. The time of day gets ruined. One minute is sunset and you can still see the sun and then the next minute seems to be midnight. There were some holes in the plot, because there was the Chupacabra there, what were the scientists doing, what happened to this guy and why did he shoot the animal and it's still alive? These things shocked me and none of the questions were answered. <br /> <br /> The next on the list is acting. The boy was wooden and bad. The main character Navarro, played by Eric Algeria, seems a bit too calm in points and too dedicated to finding out what killed some dogs and when a tragedy strikes, his emotion wasn't right there. Elina Madison, who played Starlina, did a pretty poor job. She was the author of a best seller on Chupacabra and she didn't seem to play her role or her interpretation. His acting was ridiculous and poor. Even for an author he knows too much about this and knows how to disable a high security defense system in a hidden laboratory. Tony Criss was okay, but he seemed a little calm for some things that were happening. The film reminds me of a bad re-enactment of the murder for some crime-solving shows, in which actors and actresses are not really engaged in their work. I rarely get this anal when it comes to lighting or editing, but for this movie I couldn't help but be hard at lighting. He took me out of the movie a number of times because the lighting was so poor. There were moments when they tried to be creative by adding colored filters to the scene to make it more "cartoon", but it turned back against it. The worst part is at night when it's black outside, but the scene is so over-saturated with light, it looks like its day. They continue to switch from high intensity light to soft light to random scenes, and the lights seem so bright that the actors squinted. It should not be so bright that there are dark shadows during the night. During sunset, when the lighting was perfect, that was the only time the light was good, except that it was terrible. <br /> <br /> There were no scares in this film. There was only one time I jumped but other than that, it wasn't scary. There were places where it could probably have been scary but it was so damn light, you could see the Chupacabra approaching the man, but if it was dark, it would have been better. The design of the creatures for the Chupacabra was also poor, it looked good but it was a man or a low boy in a jumping suit. They did not hide his face; they showed it without any sense of mystery or enigmatic appearance. There was a good dose of blood, but it seemed unreal. This film wasn't just scary, that's all. <br /> <br /> Overall, they have made American a great South American legend in a blood eater thirsting for humans, which the Chupacabra is not. In fact, he was afraid of people and only killed goats, sheep, dogs and deer because he was said to hate the smell of humans. But then would the story have been? I didn't like this movie for any reason, but I will give them credit for trying to make a good film with good intentions. I would not recommend this movie to any horror fan, but if you like indie or B movies, you should take a look at it. Also, if you are easily tempted by cult classics, you would like this movie. I didn't, I won't see him again, but somehow deeply sedated, I like this kind of film just to see what the other side of Hollywood is doing.
