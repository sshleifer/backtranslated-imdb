SKELETON MAN went well for the first 5 minutes, but as soon as the so-called "Special Force Agents" hit the screen, it went down the hill faster than a fat kid on a sled. <br /> <br /> The opening makes us think that we could have a mischievous but funny horror movie on our hands, but no ... the directors cannot hope that when the "Special Force Agents" will appear. I hope the writer has taken a different path and that the "Skeleton Man" has chased some dull kids until one of them finally gets the better. Instead, the "Skeleton Man" chases some unintelligent "Special Force Agents" and defeats them until their Captain takes over. <br /> <br /> I know the whole "stalking of dark boys of a murderer" as before, but it would have been more suitable for a film like this. <br /> <br /> When "Skeleton Man" finally meets his "so called" departure, in a building that will explode, the "Special Force Agents" Captain is asked the following by a police officer outside the building : "What the hell happened in there?" My answer to this question: "Who the hell cares?"
