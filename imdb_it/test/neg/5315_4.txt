In 1995, Barry Sonnenfeld directed a film that was among the best critics of many critics at the time when the summaries of the year were printed in entertainment publications. The film was Get Shorty and gave the protagonist John Travolta his second big hit in many years after Pulp Fiction brought him back to the paparazzi goals. Based on a novel by Elmore Leonard, the film focused on the essay boy Chili Palmer (Travolta) and his attempts to enter the world of cinema. I, for example, was completely captivated by the different characters and the clear dialogue of the original. So much so that when I heard that there would be a sequel, it seemed to me that I gave up my usual chills that occur when a studio tries to rework what was a good idea over ten years later. The sequel, also based on a novel by Leonard, was this time directed by F. Gary Gray, who in 2003 was Job in Italy, one of the most successful films of the years. Match the group with the now expanding cast to include Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Cedric the Entertainer, The Rock, Vince Vaughn and James Woods and you have all the prerequisites for great continuity in the exploits of one of the most interesting characters of the 90s . This time we take Chili (Travolta) who leaves the world of cinema after being disappointed both by him and the industry for taking part in the making of a sequel to his first successful film. Thanks in small part to his friend Tommy Athens (Woods) and the misfortune of his death, Chili decides to examine the lucrative and dangerous music industry. This first leads to the famous Viper club where Chili meets the singing sensation Linda Moon (Christina Milian) who, as leader of a newborn trio, manages to highlight songs like Whitney Houston (ie, the Whitney before Bobby Brown started to take small packets of sugar home). Linda is under contract with Raji (Vaughn) who, with his excessive gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock), plans to make sure that Linda meets the last five years of his contract, even if that means putting chili on ice. With Linda's future in the balance, Chili weaves an interesting web that will include a record producer (Thurman), a gangsta sound mixer (Cedric), the Russian mafia, the police, Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler and lots of guns angry. pointing. Woo-Wheee! It sounds exciting. So why wasn't it? Be Cool tries too hard, well, be calm. But the result is a film that, unlike the original, has neither heart nor soul. Instead, Be Cool feels as if it were directed by a Saturday Night Live producer as there are individual scenes or scenes that do not intertwine on an entire film. Take for example the scene in which Travolta and Thurman dance together for the first time from Pulp Fiction, while the Black Eyed Peas perform live in the background. The scene is forced and should be finished on the floor of the editing room. Instead, it is coupled between two other useless chapters that do nothing to push the story forward with a real push. The Aerosmith concert and The Rock's journey to a leisure store are also prime examples of single moments that don't make up much of the film when put together. But these are not the only problems with the sequel - which could probably be renamed Product Placement with the quantity of 2-Ways and Diet Pepsi that seem to fix you more intensely than Chili's serious appearance. The story contains almost every imaginable stereotype and everyone has time to shield enough to be slightly offensive or embarrassing. Whether it's a gangster gang or a gay guy with a Sylvester Stallone's Rhinestone poster on the wall, no character offers us something we haven't seen many times before and in much better movies. With the magic of the first film, we ended up with an inferior product that is the second film in the last six months (Ocean's 13 is the other) that fills a group of stars on a marquee only to end up as a film that no actor would bring to a open audition. Be Cool was a big disappointment. I wanted it to be the Get Shorty of the new millennium and I ended up with a film in which the outtakes must have been a gas, but the experience left me with a stinker.
