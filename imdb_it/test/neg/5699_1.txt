I rented this movie because I love Kristanna Loken and I've seen her on many TV shows and since she's now having her 15 minutes of fame with her new T3 movie, I wanted to check what other movies she was in. > <br /> It's just OK in terms of acting. Neither good nor bad. She compensates for everything by being extremely gorgeous. YUMMMMM <br /> <br /> Rodney Rowland was a real surprise like the hero. He provided the only good acting in the film. He is a very good actor and should probably be an action star. <br /> <br /> In addition to Kristanna who is fine and Rodney is doing really well, the rest of this film is rubbish in its purest form. <br /> <br /> A computer hacker slips into the ground plane system and using a joystick tries to slam the plane into a nuclear power plant ..... or something like that. And of course there are the heroes who stand in his way and ruin his game. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst scripts I've ever seen and it doesn't surprise me that it was a low budget movie. <br /> <br /> What is shocking is that this film was made in 2001 and has too many similarities with the September 11 tragedies. <br /> <br /> Why do they make films like this in the first place? <br /> <br /> Panic * - a star (a waste of actors too good) (also a waste of time) (also known as Air Panic)
