First of all, I saw another reviewer said that this film was "fantastic". Well, nothing could be further from the truth! This movie is complete trash !!! A horror comedy that is not even a bit funny !! I do not mean that it is so bad that it is good because it is not. It's a total waste of time and money! <br /> <br /> Here's what I see in this waste of a DVD. A group of friends get together on a weekend, get drunk and then decide to make a video about the courtyard. They take mom and dad's video camera and start inventing scenes on the spot. Everybody has a lot of fun looking at each other in front of the camera. They think that if they think it's funny, everyone will think it's fun. Well, they're wrong. This backyard video is rubbish. The effects of "acting" and comic goths are bad, but I guess you can expect it since this is nothing but a home video. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I imagine that this crap has come out there gives hope to anyone out there who wants to make a movie. If these people could make and release their movie on DVD, anyone can! <br /> <br /> 0/10 - Save money.
