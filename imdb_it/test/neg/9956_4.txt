First of all, I have to say that I'm not generally a big fan of werewolf films in general. It's not that I don't like them, I just don't like them very much. There are some that I liked ... Werewolf of London (1935, Stuart Walker), An American Werewolf in London (1981, John Landis) ... and some that I thought were ok but nothing special ... The Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner), The Howling (1981, Joe Dante), Dog Soldiers (2002, Neil Marshall) are some examples ... but overall, the subgenus of the werewolf is not my favorite. But I had this in one of those 50 movie sets, so I thought I'd give it a watch and see how it was. <br /> <br /> Spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> Mad Monster is a werewolf story, but the werewolf is used primarily as a vehicle for revenge by a mad scientist, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco). Dr. Cameron has discovered a way to turn humans into beasts, particularly wolves, but has been ridiculed and ostracized by the largest scientific community. Forced to leave a prestigious position, he goes mad and plots revenge on those who mocked him in an old country residence, where he lives with his daughter Lenora (the beautiful Anne Nagel) and his assistant Petro (Glenn Strange) with limited mental abilities . Using his serum, Dr. Cameron turns Petro into a werewolf and sends him to kill his old rivals. In the end, however, the Petro werewolf escapes control and both the mad doctor and his creation are killed. <br /> <br /> The film also presents itself as a dramatic murder / crime, with Lenora's claimant journalist (Johnny Downs) investigating the doctor's strange behavior and the eruption of murders. History seems to borrow many elements from other great images that came before. There are memories of Frankenstein (1931, James Whale) in the creation of an exploding monster and the creature that kills an innocent child. The visions of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931, Rouben Mamoulian or 1941, version of Victor Fleming) and The Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner) come to mind. And this is one of the problems with this film in my opinion - it looks like a mediocre fusion of some great films. It doesn't add much to the genre. <br /> <br /> True, there are some saving qualities. George Zucco's performance was convincing, and the scene that shows Dr. Lorenzo talking about his visions / hallucinations of his tormentors works well for me to show his madness. A reasonable character accumulates, at least in the case of his character. But the character of Glenn Strange is not at all convincing, and seems to have this quality of comedy, both intentional and not, I'm not sure, but it just doesn't fit into the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me that it liked more than most IMDb users based on my 4/10 rating, but it was still a below average film. Maybe it's worth seeing if you are a fan of the first werewolf movies or a big fan of the horror movies of the 30s and 40s, but you probably won't like it if you aren't.
