I'm not sure why the producers had to trade on the name of a successful franchise because the title suggests that this is a sequel to the first three films ... which is not the case. Although Marques Houston appeared in "HP3", he played a completely different character (he was eight years older) in this film. Okay ... so Reid and Martin weren't the most talented and they couldn't bring a movie all by themselves ... but exchanging the HP franchise it seems to me that he could have made some sort of reference (even if minor) to the previous films. I'm sure all those who wanted to see it were "deceived" - in thinking they were seeing a sequel - not a completely different film with a familiar name. And I'm sorry ... Kym Whitley isn't funny and couldn't hold a candle to the late Robin Harris, Ketty Lester or DC Curry in previous films. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a substantial visual diversion ... I have to give a THUMBS DOWN !! Just mentioning the movie "Down to the Last Minute" would have been OK. Furthermore, the Hudlin brothers (who produced the first three films) were not involved in the making of this film.
