Looking for a movie for your Turkey Film Festival? THE ROLLER BLADE SEVEN is on my list of the ten worst movies of all time. The plot, the story of a post-apocalyptic roller-bladed samurai warrior, is an intricate shell of cinematic references to everything from STAR WARS to THE SEVEN SAMAURI The acting fluctuates from bland to abyssal. The scene in which the villain tempts the old master is embarrassing to the point of laughing out loud. The Black Knight of Frank Stalone resembles the Black Knight of John Cleese in MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAAL too. (Word of advice, Frank: When you stop to make a film like this, your career is over.) I ran into this little stinky bomb on a low-end cable channel and I couldn't stop watching. It's like looking at a train crash, you can't look away.
