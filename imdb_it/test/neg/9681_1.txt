This film is a completely inaccurate representation of the true story of Noah's Ark. The producers probably haven't even read the Bible. This is the worst movie I've ever seen! Noah's wife was never mentioned by name in the Bible, but the film's authors "gave her the name Naamah". This film describes the destruction of Sodom a thousand years before it happened, and what about Gamorrah? It too was destroyed at the same time that Sodom was. (Perhaps the producers thought it didn't include Gamorrah in the story and showed the city of "Sodoma" as in you-know-what would have raised the eyebrows more). This film is a real mess and makes fun of God and the Bible. It is a wonder that a true Christian would like to participate in the production of this mocking, abominable, repugnant mockery of the Bible.
