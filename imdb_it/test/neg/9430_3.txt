It could be, even if there are still two or three I lost. This film builds an interesting nocturnal night landscape, reminiscent of the many misty scenes in the Sherlock Holmes films, and populates it with sinister Kafkian characters. In their midst, the film drops Mia Farrow, who sounds like he's still playing Hannah, and Woody Allen, who seems to be recovering his hazy role from Play It Again Sam. Should we laugh at his stutter and his torment? I suppose so, if the rest of the film was clearly a comedy, but it is not. At least I don't think it is.
