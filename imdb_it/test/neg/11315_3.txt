Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chan's Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx, and what do you get? You will receive a series of kung fu fights and a lack of madness similar to Magoo. <br /> <br /> The limited plot has Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) put into an international plot, where he steals a gem famous all over the world. Of course he has no idea what he's doing. In fact, he has no idea that he has the gem. <br /> <br /> In thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this. There are some very funny moments like cooking chicken. You will want to be myopic like Magoo. It's a fun movie to watch but it's quite a disaster! You have to love Leslie Nielson because a lot of fun movies have been made. This is not the best, but it does a good job playing Magoo. I thought it was a funny movie, and should be recommended for small children because they will probably think it's very funny.
