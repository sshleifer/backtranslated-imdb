Nothing special to see here, the animation is obsolete and the plot is a typical futuristic era. This film has an original story, but if it has no original storyline or characters, then I don't think it's worth seeing. I'm not saying the film was bad, it was just a typical anime story and I thought I saw this movie a thousand times. So if you're looking for something original, see something else.
