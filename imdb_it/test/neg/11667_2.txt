Initially I wrote what was a sarcastic and scathing review of this pathetic piece of dung, but every time I presented the review I got "this contains a very long word that is not allowed", even the words that were not wrong were judged incorrect. <br /> <br /> Now the word deemed too long has never been identified. After numerous attempts to delete the words I eventually suspected that the IMDb site is politically sensitive and set to automatically reject certain words. Nothing I wrote was obscene or racist in itself. But after eliminating all the longer words, the same message was repeated over and over again, even the words that were not judged wrong were all suddenly considered wrong! <br /> <br /> PC police are everywhere
