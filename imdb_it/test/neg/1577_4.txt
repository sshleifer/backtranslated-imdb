After a snowstorm, the roads are blocked and the agent of the main road Jason (Adam Beach) arrives at his friend Fritz's restaurant (Jurgen Prochnow) and advises his customers that they can only follow their journeys the next day. Among the strange strangers, Jason meets his ex-girlfriend Nancy (Rose McGowan), who has just left her husband in Los Angeles. During the night, without any communication with his base, Jason faces situations of suffering and suspicion with customers, and finds some corpses, indicating that there is a killer among them. <br /> <br /> "The Last Stop" could be a medium thriller, but the script is simply horrible. Most of the characters are despicable people and the reasons for the amazing serial killer are never revealed, and viewers have no further explanation as to why the killer decided to kill the guests. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Encurralados" ("Trapped")
