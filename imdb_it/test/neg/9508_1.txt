<br /> <br /> The game has been heavily modified and the order of the scenes has been completely confused. The acting is scary (especially by Helena Bonham Carter) and the cinematography is scarce. <br /> <br /> The result is a slow, confusing, boring film that will instantly put the new ones on Shakespeare from Shakespeare! <br /> <br /> If you can't see a play, at least see Olivier's version (1948) instead of this drivel!
