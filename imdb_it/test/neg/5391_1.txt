I, like so many others here, bought this movie at my local WM in the "Two for $ 11.00" inexpensive trash. I love B's horror and science fiction films, and this definitely fits this category. Practically what everyone else said here is dead. Yes, it was bad, but that was to be expected. The "main" problem I had with this film is that it was basically BORING. I mean serious yawn-o-rama. The acting was bad, the costumes (K Mart Skeletor outfit circa 1982) were worse, and the editing was horrible. No continuity. Mr. Skeletor eventually dies in an explosion of sorts ... even though he encountered a multiple explosion during this move. I guess the last one just hurt him. Evidently previous encounters with this "military" group (cough) took its toll on his horse ... he would change from red to black in this shit party. Even for a B movie, do yourself a favor and skip it. The only good thing I need now is to add to my DVD collection. I hope no one will recognize him when they look through my movie collection. Thumbs down, big time.
