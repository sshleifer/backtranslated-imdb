Killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1. Bad acting, bad characters, annoying clown, wrong lines, your name. Honestly, I'm not so surprised that more people haven't seen this movie. The only reason I saw Killjoy 2 is because I wanted to think that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes. They didn't. This film is just as bad, if not worse than the first. That clown ... that damn clown ... I hate it! I hate it so much! And I don't hate him because he's a bad villain ... I hate him because he's annoying beyond imagination! I hope the filmmakers realized after having tried and failed once again that this film is not repairable. The last thing we need is a Killjoy 3.
