The AZN TV of the United States has acquired the rights on this film and the network is showing it with the English title THE PICKPOCKET. <br /> <br /> In 1997 THE PICKPOCKET takes the film in home-like style to incredible levels of unpleasantness. The film describes a long series of boring wanderings of a little interesting and confused boy. This main character, Xiao Wu, does not simply walk aimlessly. Viewers, unfortunately, will soon understand that Xiao Wu has an unsurpassed talent to look for and remain idle near the most hateful noises that can be found in China. Clanging empty tin cans are beaten with a stick - he is there. Every old engine in China is in the throes of agony - he is there. A child crying? Yes, you guessed it, he is there! According to THE PICKPOCKET, China is the most disturbing and annoying place on the planet Earth. <br /> <br /> The only worst element of THE PICKPOCKET sound is photography. The camera shakes, shakes and shakes again. Eventually, the camera stops, but then falls to the actor's knees and stays there until someone in the crew realizes the error and starts shaking the camera again. Most of the shaky film is framed in distant, long, long, long shots. The few times that the camera approaches a little, nothing compelling ever happens to connect the viewer to what is happening. <br /> <br /> The photograph is murky, faded and often blurred. The use of color is - well, there is no sign of intelligence that controls the use of color. Most of each shot is kept 20 times too long. Few films are so painful to sit. This film is painful to watch and painful to listen to. And then it simply ends. <br /> <br /> John Woo fans will be able to enjoy listening to the soundtrack of DIE XUE SHUANG XIONG (THE KILLER) while the main character hangs out of a video store for many minutes. However, be warned: THE PICKPOCKET will steal your good time.
