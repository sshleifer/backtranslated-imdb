My jaw dropped so many times to watch this movie, I have bruises. Ok, granted, I didn't really expect the quality of, for example, The Others or even Thirteen Ghosts (the new, which was simply terrible and is still the head and shoulders above this madness). Someone else noticed the skinny characters ... I wouldn't call them "skinny". "Thin" implies that there may be something for them. How about almost non-existent? In no particular order do we have: The girl who will scream; The American who will be able to understand everything; The macho boy who will go by himself to everything until he is killed: the wise black man who will soon die; The extra guy who has to die first; The extra woman who is there to play hard. That's all. This is your list of characters and this is what they are and what remains from beginning to end. If they were "thin", they could at least change a little from start to finish. But they don't. Well, ok, the American guy decides that he will stay with the fieldwork at the end and the Screaming Girl will come back from where he comes. This is change. Apart from that, they all act according to their assigned roles and rarely betray any real emotion when they finally meet the threat. <br /> <br /> Now, the producers get props for an original threat, I will say. I realized that the story would be "Tremors" but with ants instead of giant worms. I give credit to the writer: these are very beautiful and scary ants and what they do with bones is excellent. (The first time the "bone snatcher" appears, I admit I missed a few feet). Unfortunately, the very interesting concept becomes Alien in the Desert very quickly. We receive many comments on the ants that may or may not be true, but we don't take much of the mythology on which the threat is based. And let's make sure that all the clichés about cinema monsters have ever been made. People go to places that know they shouldn't and when they have no good reason to do so. Moral characters try to hinder our heroes and die for it. A character has the double duty of "scientist who does not want to kill the monster but studies it". A Very Cool gadget was introduced only so the American can tell everyone something about ants that, well, I hope everyone knows that anyway. So the gadget is broken. Our heroes end up the only thing that can keep the threat at bay. And then there is that final, bored moment when we know that the threat is still with us - and I wonder exactly how and how the hero or heroine happened. It completely renders all that has been done before useless and false. <br /> <br /> Three stars for the fresh use of ants and bones. Nothing at all for clichés, clumsy dialogues and dark characters of the light bulb.
