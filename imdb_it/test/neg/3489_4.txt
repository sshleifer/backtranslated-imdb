The "plot" of this film contains some holes where you could drive a huge truck, but I don't think it's always the top priority for horror. Two elderly sisters in rural England have kept their brother in the cellar for over 30 years. Now, he fled and started a murderous madness, focusing on the military that are made from the house nearby. "We just thought it was better for him" they keep repeating and ?? strangely ?? all army officers love these women and do not question their sincerity, even though 5 of their men died. I don't know whether to find the revelation near the end of suspense ?? or boring! In a sense, this film reminded me of "arsenic and old lace". In that classic of black comedy, two semi-crazy brothers mother their stupid little brother, yet they kill there. Older women in "The Beast in the Cellar" are no less crazy, though. The horror in this movie from the 70s is very amateurish and cheap, but there are some attempts to increase the tension. Too many "old women" talk about the good old days, and that is rarely something you look for in a horror movie with such an attractive title. Flora Robson, who can be recognized by classic cinema fans, plays one of the sisters. It gave the image to the Queen of England is the legendary Spoleto film Errol Flynn, the Sea Hawk.
