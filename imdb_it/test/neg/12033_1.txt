First of all, I would like to start by saying this very interesting SOUNDED film: a serial killer who copies the works of Edgar Allan Poe (who is one of my writers of all time). Sounds great, right? Yes, definitely not. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Never. And it's not an exaggeration. I've seen a lot of bad movies. This takes the cake. And I had even prepared for a bad movie before getting into it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the writer should have studied some police procedure: if you have the name of the killer, his entire life story, a criminal record, and his ADDRESS, where is the first place you should look ? Hmm. . . possibly. . . his home? What?! NO! It's an absurd idea, Anthony! How could you suggest something so obvious and balanced rather than going to a bowling alley? * end spoiler * Honestly, sometimes I can forgive a movie if the writing is good but the acting is bad, or vice versa. . . but this just got it all wrong. <br /> <br /> I think my biggest gripe was the behavior of the police / FBI. <br /> <br /> For example: FBI black agent: "Ok, woman in danger of extinction, sit here in this car in an empty parking lot while I go in and look around the potential crime scene where a serial killer should be "Do you like it?" Moorish female FBI agent: "Yes, it sounds good to me, go ahead, I'll be sure not to focus on what's around me or at least to control the perimeter." Black FBI agent: "Excellent, that's what I would do!" Honestly, if you want to be a law enforcement officer, rent this movie so you can learn how not to act. . . or if you are a human and want to learn the same. <br /> <br /> 0.5 / 10: A half point just to get a film produced and in stores. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
