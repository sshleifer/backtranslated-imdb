The Concorde ... The '79 airport starts in Washington where a man named Carl Parker (Macon (McCalman) contacts high-profile television journalist Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely) to deliver secret documents proving her boss Kevin Harriosn ( Robert Wagner The owner and president of Harrison Industries who develops weapons for the military illegally sold these weapons to foreign countries, but Maggie sees Carl murdered and can barely save himself from life, Maggie must take the Concorde to Moscow via Paris the next morning and intends to whistle Harrison, who is also her boyfriend who would ruin him. Determined to save himself, he reprograms his "Buzzard" hobbyist to intercept and destroy the Concorde during a test that kills everyone on board & destroying the documented evidence. .. <br /> <br /> Renamed Airport '80 - Concorde for its cinema and first home video releases because it was published here, in 1980, piuttos that in 1979 this last entry into the airport franchise was directed by David Lowell Rich and is a notoriously ugly film apparently derided during the press screenings and tests that prompted Universal to promote the film as an action comedy. The first thing to say is that The Concorde ... Airport '79 is a stupid and definitely stupid film but on a purely entertainment basis I can think of much worse films to spend 108 minutes watching, I can really. I quite liked the absurd plot of a rich industrialist who wants to kill his TV girlfriend's reporter before she can expose him as an illegal arms dealer but this guy doesn't do it subtle and decides the best way to do it is to explode Concorde with his own a guided missile and then a Fench fighter pilot to try to shoot him down before sabotaging him, so in reality there are three unlucky mini warriors in one as every super pilot Joe Patroni manages to save the situation. You know that Joe Patroni played by George Kennedy appears in all four airport films and goes from the mechanic to the first in the extracinema of the Concorde in this, I also think he is a bit unlucky because in the space of nine years he was involved with four major air disasters. I think the real reason why the airport series stopped here is because Patrons retired after this and the misfortune was lifted. Some of the things that happen here are just nonsense, Patrons rolls the barrels, flips upside-down maneuvers and out of a guided missile in a huge Concorde not to mention the fact that it crashes into it and fires bullets fired from its window to destroy the missile all while maintaining a calm head. This guy is good, very good. Then there's the character, there's a saxophone who plays a black guy who smokes weed in the bathrooms, an old woman with a bladder problem and a team of Russian gymnasts with bad accents. Furthermore, despite having been shot down with a missile and then attacked by a Jet fighter, the passengers of Concorde do not seem to be disturbed and willingly return on board the next day, I don't know about you, but after that I would probably find a safer way to travel and why don't the police or the authorities question anyone? Why is Patroni, the captain of the Concordia, allowed to go to sleep with a French prostitute? The Concorde ... The '79 airport is certainly not boring and is full of memorable moments and I was entertained in a certain way even if it is far from a good movie and the modern public may not have the patience with it, the hell liked it for what it was in a silly way but it's not a classic. <br /> <br /> Although the Concorde does not fly anymore, it is still a very nice looking plane and there is a lot of footage here, the one used in The Concorde ... The airport of '79 was the seventh built. This Concorde was also the same plane that crashed after a tire hit caused a fuel tank to break and the leaking fuel caught fire on July 25, 2000, while it took off in Paris causing the death of 109 passengers and crew on board and 4 people on the ground. When it was aired on TV in the United States in 1982, nearly twenty minutes of new footage was included with most, if not all, recently resumed two years after the end of the original production. I know the effects here take a hit from most but I don't think they are too ugly, when you consider that it was done in the late 70s, I think they come across pretty well. The camera moves during the shooting of effects, a real take on real planes is used rather than models of toys which, in my opinion, would have seemed much worse and I could certainly see what the producers were trying to do with limited funds and technology limited. In a strange way they are really impressive, without ever seeming so beautiful if you understand what I mean. Probably the most eventful film of all airport films contains missiles, explosive planes, rushing landings, assassins and a boy named Robert Palmer (no, not the singer) who gives his head to a woman in a hot tub. <br /> <br /> IMDb says this has a budget of around $ 14,000,000 which is actually more than I thought, maybe those special effects aren't all that impressive. Shot in Utah, Washington, Los Angeles and France. Acting here isn't great, people don't seem worried enough that they're going to die. Goerge Kennedy gets bad jokes while Robert Wagner plays the bad guy. <br /> <br /> The Concorde ... The '79 airport is fun for bad movie fans from all over the world and to be brutally honest I prefer to watch this fun casino movie of more than two hours of boredom nominated to the Oscar.
