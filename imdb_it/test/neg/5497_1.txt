Such a stupid film should never see the light of day. Acting is lame, violence is everywhere, the furtive ending is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> It is a lawyer who saw a murder committed by R.I.C.C.O. team. No one has ever seen him, not even the same killers. So he and a beautiful lady are on the run trying to find the head of this R.I.C.C.O. team before they find them. <br /> <br /> Then the film continues with a love story, shooting and voodoo. Now the devil has come into this. Never see this movie if your life depends on it. Trust me!!!!!!!!
