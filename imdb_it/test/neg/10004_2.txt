Something funny happened to me while I was watching "Mosquito": on the one hand, the hero is deaf and dumb and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does (mutilating the mannequins ... er, excuse me, corpses) through his images. On the other hand, the English version is very badly dubbed. So I found myself wishing that there had been more and less dialogue at the same time! This film is stupid (it's funny how this guy has access to all the cemeteries and morgues in his city) and dark (where would we be in a exploiter of the 70s without our free lesbian scene?). Not to mention the "romantic" aspect (oh, what sweetness!) ... Miss. (*)
