I read the book after seeing the film and I didn't like it, finding it a bit shabby; but trash books often make good films, and this certainly could have. The story of an adolescent girl's exploration of her attractive power over boys, which she finds irresistibly stimulating as it is arguably controllable, and which has an even closer grip on her than on a normal girl because it hits her through her shell - - this story would have a clear fascination for the young public for whom the films are made: an appeal of a type to the girls, and of another type to the boys: and I don't understand how the filmmakers could be blind to this and shoot the story in one with little appeal to anyone. <br /> <br /> To begin with, take the title (which is the best thing in the book): it is taken from a quote by Hesse, also used as an epigraph, about a person who ran in fear and tasted blood and chocolate in the his mouth, one that looked worse than the other. This is a wonderful metaphor for the status of heroin: divided between its human side and its wolf, which savors each of them but is equally afraid of both. The film does without the epigraph and instead introduces the character who works in his aunt's chocolate shop! I can understand how the title of the book could have suggested to the filmmakers the chocolates full of eroticism of "Like Water for Chocolate" and led them to want to connect the same symbol to the werewolves. But they didn't; so why is it in the movie? In the book the characters are in high school - or inside and out, as with the Five, a band of teenagers who prefer black jeans and T-shirts, and fall somewhere between being nemesis of the heroine and her creatures. In the film they became decadent club-goers. In the book, the heroine is 16 years old, just an age to discover how her sexuality works on the boy she wants, as well as on herself; she is the one who initiates the contact, then takes a step back, re-starts and so on. In the film she is no longer a girl but a woman, and the boy is no longer a high school poet on the fringes of campus life, but a fugitive from the law (and a comic artist, to start), he is the one who arrives to her, in a way so unattractive as that of her cousin worm. Initially he interrupts him, but then he gives up, since he is sure he will: hey, you know you want him. I would have thought that a director would have seized the opportunity that the book offered to show a female protagonist in an unconventional and proactive role; but no. <br /> <br /> In the book the heroin clan is driven from their home due to the delinquent behavior of the Five; in the film it's because she went for a run (!). She is a great runner, prone to kick-off, and both she and her clanmates climb buildings in a flash; very similar to heroes of martial arts films and very different from wolves, or something that looks like them. In the book they are not transformed into real wolves, but things greater than wolves; in the film they are just normal wolves. In the book they metamorphose in "Howling" style, with the creaking of thorns; this is one of the things that make the heroine aware of the pain her body brings her, as well as pleasure. In the film the werewolves became magical acrobats, making large swan dives and turning in mid-air, sparkling yellow like Tinker-Bell; it looks beautiful, it means nothing. <br /> <br /> In the book the clan is a somewhat white-trash family that moved from West Virginia to Maryland. In the film they live in Bucharest but everyone speaks in different accents, no Romanian. In the book almost the entire pack wants to lead a normal life and agree that to ensure that - and indeed, their survival - a necessity is to keep their true nature secret from humans. And so the characters keep saying in the film; however the head of the clan is a sort of clandestine leader - but apparently he is not a crime leader, since he despises criminals - and has an agreement with the police, which provides him with "meat" for the pack. This seems a great exception to the rule of preventing humans from knowing; but perhaps the police are considered safe because of their known tolerance for eccentricity and sectarian murder. <br /> <br /> At the end of the book the heroine learns that it cannot be something that is not when, in her effort to live a divided life, she remains stuck between human and animal states, unable to be a thing or the other. Her boyfriend is not sure or strong enough to accept her for what she is, the pack cannot risk having him around, and the two are forced to separate. In the film she saves him as Lassie and they go to Paris (why Paris?), In a final that is smiling, but not very happy, since the conflicts between their natures - among their natures - remain unresolved. <br /> <br /> But the difference in the film that hinders more the fun is that while the characters of the book behave in a conventional way, in the realm of novels for young adults, those of the film for some reason have been rendered the most annoying possible. Every other line is a threat or some other kind of baptismal art: you will regret it; you do not belong to this place; you will not get rid of me; I gave you your chance; etc. I prefer to stay away from people who behave this way. <br /> <br /> There have been many good vampire movies, never a good werewolf movie. If this had remained in the book, it would have been the first. <br /> <br /> But no.
