An Almodovar film - it makes me shiver down my spine every time. The capital letter that opens the latest feature film by the Spanish eurologue instantly induces memories of salacious nuns, kind necrophilia, passionate sexual jokes and I have not even reached the point where the child - terrible - has critically criticized the first works. And after a beautiful opening montage, with the camera going through a windswept cemetery animated by a pile of widows who feverishly clean tombstones, I thought Pedro had me back under his evil spell. <br /> <br /> Once again my longing had calmed down, there was very little to fill his place. For a director who enjoys bringing humanity to murderers and rapists, he does a very poor job of finding an emotional depth or captivating quality in his women. Penelope Cruz is Raimunda, a stubborn housewife whose life is complicated by the accidental killing of her violent husband's daughter. Fortunately, he lives in Almodovar Spain, where your friends will very happily help you have a corpse for a cocktail tour. Add to the melody the ghost of Raimunda's mother and a myriad of other matriarchs with an eccentric heart. "Volver" literally means coming back, and Pedro seems to recycle old material. The sub-plot of the incest feels like it is attached as the mandatory "taboo". Instead of commenting or subverting the problem, as with his treatment of pedophilia in Bad Education, he feels forced and unconvincing in the midst of the film's chick-flick sentimentality. I suggest that Almodovar call his next film Salir (to move on).
