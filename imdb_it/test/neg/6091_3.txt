What the hell is this? Kelly (jennifer) seems to abandon all moral behavior as soon as he arrives on the island. Do you find this existing and exotic Juan P (Manuel), even if you witnessed it when he slapped his ex in the face, which also justifies later in the film, right or wrong? These two boys are the first to be on the island. Kelly is totally lost in every sense and the great Juan P can fish and build a house in some way. Mr. Handyman. They seem to be enjoying themselves. Then comes Billy Zane (Jack, the husband of Kellys characters) and, of course, two days without knowing what his wife is doing with this beautiful Juan P, he is a little jealous. Billy Z is the rich stereotype and perhaps not the most beautiful man in the world. He doesn't like Juan P (for beating his girlfriend at the dock, who can blame him? Hes is also arrogant, but he paid a lot of money to rent that boat and Juan P, who is the waiter / all can not even bring him a beer in 20 minutes Wouldn't you be upset, but Billy is probably the type you want to punch in the face if you meet him, but at the same time, he's not to be blamed for, suspicious about the diving goggles that Manuel has Kelly and Billy just have lost some dear friends! How comfortable it is for him to understand, no matter what!). However, for some strange reason Kelly likes this girl to hit Manuel and start hating Billy for being jealous. OK, Billy is exaggerating, that's for sure, but Kelly isn't doing much to convince him. He spends more time with Juan P and even wants him to sleep with them since she was so kind (and even though Manuel yelled at her and called to ask some intimate questions, but Kelly is so forgiving ...). Yeah, for sure. And then he starts having sex with this Juan P. It must be said that Kelly and Billy seem to have a working relationship before this incident on the island, at least, they have an intimate relationship on the boat and talk like people do when they like each other. Now, you can think that this scenario is possible. But really, isn't it? Are you betraying your husband after two days on a coconut island just because he is jealous and behaves like a drunk at the bar? (I wouldn't disagree if the relationship was really bad but the director doesn't give many suggestions if that is the case). For God's sake, Juan P has not really shown himself to be a good person. Catch some fish and build a wooden house to get into someone's panties, is that showing a good side? Don't try to make friends with Kellys' husband in any case (which would be very easy by leaving them alone most of the time on the island, just being respectful). He doesn't care about their relationship (and Kelly can't understand it), he just wants to have sex with Kelly. The character of Kellys is not reliable (if she is blocked with Billy and another attractive girl, she would not be upset or what?!). Or maybe it is? Billy Zane plays a not very nice person, and Juan P is actually not much better if you really think about it. And poor Kelly is so confused and believes that having sex with Juan P will solve everything because her husband is so strange and aggressive towards poor Juan P? So ... for all of you who read this ... What do you think? If you were Kelly's character, you would consider your husband's betrayal, knowing that one day you will return to real life, and suddenly Billys may not be that horrible person after all. He is simply too jealous. And if you were to play the Billys character, what do you say, was he totally wrong in his behavior? And the character of Juan P what you really think of him. One thing is certain. There are Manuels! Ps ... The voodoo thing is completely wrong here! What the hell was that? Seriously! Anyone tell me?
