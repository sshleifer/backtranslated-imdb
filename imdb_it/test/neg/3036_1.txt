Sorry, this movie was a bad TV movie. Is the rest of you drugged when you look at it? I thought that hair, makeup and characters were two-dimensional types. The story is doubtful, especially since all the main characters are dead or nearly dead. I think it wasn't well acted ... what did that hair do on the main turtle boy? It looked badly glued and the sideburns seemed to fall at any time. It didn't seem like something new was revealed in the band's history and how the members met other bands and people. I laughed to the hilt, Frank Zappa looked stupid, so did my mother Cass and so did the Beatles. They were made to look stupid and ridiculous. Even the other members of the group like Jim Morrison, also Donovan, have had great success in showing themselves stupid. Kind of terrible, if that's how you remember these people. It's a lesson in poor music history, it's fiction as it was made.
