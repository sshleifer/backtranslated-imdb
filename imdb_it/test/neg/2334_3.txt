Although we still have to persevere with this mistaken belief that when a director produces a grandiose and innovative work, all future work "cannot be so bad after all, he did such and such". <Br /> <br /> Mulholland Drive is a case in point, and is indeed absolute garbage. The performances are excellent, in particular from Watts and Theroux, but a good film that does not necessarily produce. What Lynch has clearly forgotten is that just making a movie unnecessarily strange only works when it surprises the audience. When the public expects the film to make no sense, then the film must have a certain substance to keep the audience interested. Lynch succeeds in the first half of the film, with the mystery of the murder set with a lot of twists and false herrings, and then ... plop! History declines in a quagmire of bizarre and useless followings. It seems to me that Lynch realized how confused the film was, and threw the grueling lesbian scenes to the awake audience and to prevent male spectators from getting up and leaving. <br /> <br /> Watching the film premiere, I was surrounded by Lynchophiles who had no idea what was going on, but left the theater commenting on the "layers and layers" of Lynch's film. Sorry but these people are the same idiots who are in art galleries staring at white-painted canvases that comment on the "courage of the artist in painting such a courageous work". Movies like these are made because (a) Lynch is traded on his previous job; and (b) because people are convinced that the incomprehensible film is art and, therefore, must be good. I questioned a number of Lynchophiles about what they really liked in the film and only the answer I received was not a "layered" answer, it's that they liked it when the "chicks took off the kit". > <br /> Nuff said.
