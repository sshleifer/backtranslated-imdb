The producers of this film should be sued for the false representation of copyrighted materials, in particular the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Player Manual. Fear and ignorance generate the kind of mindless propaganda that inspires garbage like this movie. If any of you have any doubts about the innocence of Dungeons & Dragons, why don't you go to your hobby shop and see you sit down with a gaming group, so you can see for yourself that D & D has nothing to be afraid of.
