I'm a big fan of Shirley Temple. When I saw this movie, it made me appreciate how good Shirley was actually. Ashley Rose Orr did perhaps the worst Shirley on screen. Imagine an 11-year-old boy who plays Shirley Temple from the age of 5. In itself wrong. But make her "imitate" Shirley's voice? And his singing is sad. The dance was good, I'll say it. As previous users have said, there were few dramatic scenes, nothing to make the story interesting. Not even Amelia Earhart ... I would have liked to have seen more of the worldwide phenomenon created by Shirley Temple. There was too much attention on the Wizard of Oz, when in reality Shirley was only considered for Dorothy. The film portrays him as if it was the end of the world when she doesn't get the role. Shirley herself said that she is happy that Judy Garland played it. For me the star of the show was the lady who played Gertrude Temple. Otherwise, stay away! For the great Shirley Temple films, look at Heidi, Poor Little Rich Girl and Little Miss Broadway.
