I saw this film over 20 years ago and I had a good memory of it. Taking up this month on Cinemax, I realized how little discernment I had about the films of that time. This is absolutely normal spaghetti, with absolutely nothing to note. Script, directing, acting, photography are all a great blah. Follow Sergio Leone's westerns!
