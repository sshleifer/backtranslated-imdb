I simply cannot understand how someone who supports, or simply anyone can find this horrible, lazy, misplaced abomination even remotely amusing. It is so embarrassing under the peer that it qualifies as a real tragedy. The potential for this was huge, it could have been great. Too bad that all that acting talent, the sets, the props, the good will of all those involved was so pathetically wasted by a script that should have been burned. <br /> <br /> There is a clear lack of rigorous production and quality control here. Like those Hollywood Hollywood movies (madly crazy world, casino royale) in which the stars are just attacking each other and "having fun" that basically means taking a check to do nothing. <br /> <br /> I might have written better Who sends in my sleep. In fact I have, even if awake. I did it in year 10 in high school and I did it with a group of classmates. It was better, now I look at it and the gags are more fun. Steven Moffat YOU'RE NOT A TALENT BUM! What a waste, what a wasted opportunity. It makes me want to cry ...
