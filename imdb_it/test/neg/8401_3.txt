It is difficult to decide who or what the target audience for this film is. Jean-Pierre Limousin presumably had the chance to explore the problems of amnesia on a serious level and instead opted to use it as an excuse to make a soft-porn movie. Having seen, loved, admired and respected Se Souvenir des belles chose to explore memory loss - albeit as the result of Alzheimer's - in a deep and heartbreaking way, not least in Isabelle Carre's bright performance, I find Novo to be an insult to the Souvenir. I have no problem with soft porn by itself - and even if I had to give up on going to films so popular today - but I have a problem with writers / directors who try to repulse it by hiding it like a medical research. The sad thing is that beautiful actresses like Julie Gayet - so wonderful in Clara et Moi - and Anna Mouglalis - who seems to have had a double game since last week's Le Deluge and now this - are wasting their time with waste like this.
