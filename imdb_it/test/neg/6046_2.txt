An original of the Sci-Fi network. Not the best. Not far from being the worst. An electrician (Richard Grieco) stumbles upon a "key" that can breach a parallel Earth that has been detected by mutant spiders. Mutations have been controlled by a super-sized alien queen for the past thirty years. He has already eaten the population of this parallel world that resembles Chicago's fewer inhabitants. Guess what? Now she has to find another world to feed. The electrician leads a team of four men who reluctantly finds himself in charge of saving the world. The final showdown is probably the best part of the whole movie. The cast also includes: Richard Yearwood, Colin Fox, Kate Greenhouse, Jason Jones and David Newman. It would have been thought that the science fiction network could have spent more on special effects.
