... So some people might argue that this can't be the worst movie ever made, and no it isn't. I've seen films with weaker plots, worse acting and so on. <br /> <br /> So why do I hate this movie? Well, it's basically a man, who gets kidnapped for many years, and when he comes out, he tries to find out who did it and why, to get revenge. The problem I have with this film has nothing to do with gore or horror, but <br /> <br /> *** MAIN SPOILERS STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW *** <br /> < br /> our main character is basically induced to have sex with her daughter, and wants to cut her tongue so her enemy won't tell her, because she didn't know. It is so humiliating as it crawls on its knees like a dog in total submission. And why did he deserve it? Because many years ago, he saw a brother and sister having a moment of tenderness - the wrong way. He went ahead and told some people, and as a result he committed suicide. And viola, it's the brother who put our main character through all of that just for that. I asked myself: maybe I hate this movie so much because I think its punishment is too hard. Perhaps because I feel that this film does not condemn incest, but somehow confuses it with love. Maybe it's because I was expecting something else. <br /> <br /> *** END OF SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Believe me, nobody deserves what happens to our main character in the end, and I'm very serious; do you know how some films pass under your skin and stay there? Well, I felt damn dirty after watching this movie, and I really wish I'd ever seen it. He stayed with me for days, and someone might ask: well, isn't this the purpose of a good movie? The ability to influence us in these ways? Yes, it may be, but this film not only made me sick, it made me feel violated.
