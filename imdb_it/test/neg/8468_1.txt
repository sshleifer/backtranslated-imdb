It's a complete nonsense. I studied Nazism and read many manuscripts of the day - the "parallels" use most of the classical apocryphal depraved myths of Nazism and then compare it with complete and specious generalizations about what constitutes 1/3 of the planet. It is designed for Polly-Anna's complacency audience who feeds heavily on meaningless arguments powered by the spoon, horribly thought out arguments, irrational conclusions, fallacious ideas and senseless logic. <br /> <br /> Who made this peace strike? Easy. <br /> <br /> When all has been said and done; Que Bono? I mean, who benefits in the long run? <br /> <br /> You don't. You sacrificed money and rights. Muslims don't, they take our bombs. Try again. Answer this and you've unlocked a main door.
