I saw this film while I was in France and I must say that it confused me. It is the story of a jewel thief and a young singer who meet in Morocco at the same time, meet and form a connection. Simple enough? Well, the problem is that this is the kind of film that has ambiguity in both histories (the film is not reproduced entirely in order) and in reality (did it do what I just saw happen really, or was it just a dream? ). Given those parameters, as the film is bilingual, it was really difficult to follow, and I wasn't sure what happened in the end. I imagine that some types of deep limbs can understand this film better than I could and may require more than a vision to understand.
