I couldn't wait for the end. This is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. If you thought that anyone could make a watchable movie, these people show that a minimum skill set is required. This is a film with no saving features whatsoever. Gets a zero in each department. This is more than just an 'amateur' since the public is not given consideration or consideration. There is no serious attempt to act or entertain. The plot is aimless, meaningless and meaningless. The cast looks very uncomfortable and completely devoid of direction. The technical aspects of the film are scarce. <br /> <br /> Like a DVD makes a good drink coaster.
