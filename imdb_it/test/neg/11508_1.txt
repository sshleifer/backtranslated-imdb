Every time I broadcast this show on TV, I absolutely and sincerely want to stretch my eyes and tear my ears off. It's incredibly horrible. The jokes are not funny, the acting is completely terrible and the whole show is one of the biggest disappointments. I hate the courage of Charlotte Arnold, and I just want to punch her in the face or stab her with a knife every time I hear her talk. It is not a talent, a low IQ, a big loss of society, and I think it would do the whole world a favor if it shut up and went away for a long time. Please, I say it with all my heart, NOT ALSO WATCHING AN EPISODE OF THIS SHOW !!!!!! It's not even worth 30 minutes of your life, and there are thousands of better things to do, including killing yourself, watching this show for half an hour.
