One might think that with the incredible scenario of Stalingrad's Second World War the writers invented a script. No. There is no story here! It's like porn, vignettes of violence interrupted by a pathetic, mechanical and meaningless dialogue. <br /> <br /> A group of Germans march around shooting and shooting. Slowly there are fewer Germans marching, shooting and shooting themselves. Then there are no Germans on the march, they shoot and shoot. <br /> <br /> Bad. <br /> <br /> Chilcoot
