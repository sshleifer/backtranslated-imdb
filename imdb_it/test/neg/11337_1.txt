Have you thought of "Traumschiff Surprise" that the German comedy can't get worse? Can he. This comedy is yet another attempt to perpetuate stereotypes of gay men masked by a beautiful comedy. The initial concept (openly gay in football sports) would have been a great opportunity to erase some stereotypes, but ... The film's real message seems to be how homosexuals are so different from heterosexual men. Absolutely foolish, of course. Gay sex is also considered to be of lesser value than straight sex. This film only tries to serve a straight audience that wants to laugh at stereotypical gay men. Well, don't waste your time with German comedy movies!
