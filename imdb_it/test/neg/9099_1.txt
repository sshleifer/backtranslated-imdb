Looking at the first moments, you realize that it will be a parody - and certainly * it is * a parody, but I'm not sure what (a fairy tale? An opera? A Hollywood movie by C?) and I can assure you that it is not worth looking at. It is simply a useless film (a good parody is anything but useless), with pretentious and superficial discourses of extremely sketchy characters. It's like a commedia dell'arte. Or rather, it's like a messy commedia dell'arte. And the score ... sung in an intentionally incompetent way (something that Greenaway will use much more efficiently), * is * painful to listen to (unless you wear sate-of-the-art earplugs, haha). Go for quality movies (eg A. Mitta's How Czar, Peter the Great Married Off His Moor, 1976) and avoid this mistake.
