Well, I have to admit that when I saw the trailer for this movie, I couldn't wait. I'm generally a fan of romantic comedies with a tender heart and trailer, it's the impression I got of this movie. However, I spent most of the film waiting for the comedy to start. Although there were a couple of funny scenes, in general the movie was rather depressing. I also found it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters since they all seemed a bit underdeveloped, the time the director could have used to explore characters taken from an unnecessary excessive use of Opera, making the film dragged out and slow. <br /> <br /> All in all, even if there are some moving scenes, the trailer is quite deceptive and I would suggest you just go and see this if there really isn't anything else that excites your imagination. <br /> <br /> Not fantastic, and as I said before; Bland.
