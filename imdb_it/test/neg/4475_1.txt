This was one of the worst movies you can ever remember seeing. I'm sure I've seen worse, though, if it slows me down. <br /> <br /> Humor is not fun, there are stupid stereotypes of jokes that, again, are not funny. I was a public prisoner on a plane and saw this movie. It was a complete waste of time. I liked Martin in the previous films, but not this one. Same thing for Queen Latifah, it was excellent in Chicago and in Set it Off she was also good, but this role was horrible. <br /> <br /> I especially deserve the failure of bad script writing. I feel strongly that it is not possible to save a formidable script, not funny with decent actors, this film as an example. However, all those involved should have been wise enough not to participate in this film. I am simply amazed that something so ugly can be brought to light, produced, theatrically released and promoted.
