The hot female numbers on this show are breathtaking. They can also talk as if there were no tomorrow. Otherwise, this show would go to the bathroom quickly. How much money they earn with all the people who write, with that hope of being called back to win, $ 100.oo, or whatever. Boy, now it's a scam !!! Can I buy shares in this money maker ??? Let's face it, with today's technology, thousands of people could call every minute. And, with ten thousand channels and nothing of value, thousands of people watch this show. "Oh, I know this answer!", It is probably a super common line among listeners. With these super hotties constantly saying that the "living room" needs callers, I think it's a bunch of B.S. Frequently, someone who manages to pass seems surprised by the fact that they are talking to the host. Many of them seem depressed and worn out probably waiting so long and trying so many times to climb and score some change. Wow, the producers simply need to rake it. No wonder there are so few commercials. The commercials are just to give more time (mainly losers) to send text messages and wait, and hope, and dream, and fantasize about --- what? --- win enough money for a gas tank and a Mc dinner ... something? I only watch it now and then on my TV brothers, because he likes watching it when he's at the computer. I will sit there for 15-20 minutes and watch Mel (one of the tastiest women on TV) and laugh at the scam in front of me. So, I have to leave; even if I don't! People who have an active life can only take this show in extreme moderation. Mel, put yourself in the movies, or TV sitcoms, or something like that. Many of us are infatuated with you! Even with the super cuy, I'm amazed that this show is still active!
