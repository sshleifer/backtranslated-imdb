I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and I have to say: it didn't hit me at all. I'm part of the other posters when it comes to good performances, but some good performances don't make a good movie. <br /> <br /> On the discussion forum, I found a review of an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points. He says: "'Deed Poll' is a film that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few: a film that is disturbing and above any attempt at categorization, an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama, despite some shocking scenes. by Barbara Kowa and André Schneider, the partly very impressive editing and the good work of shooting (Steffen Ritter) compensate for the holes in the plot and some technical glides (especially in the sound), but the boredom with which the audience has to compete for 40 minutes left. " Unfortunately, this is true. I was not at all fascinated by history. The protagonists are cold people, without ambitions. They do a lot of drugs and have a lot of sex (incestuous). So? For many times, the management seemed to be practically non-existent, not to mention the technical aspect: the poor sound quality was enormously disturbing. <br /> <br /> What is the point of the film? What is the message behind all this? The anonymous analyst said: "Somehow Biermann failed to clarify the point and the film remains suspended in midair without a message, so the boredom I blame for the film: the film is reserved and emotionless , cold, almost neutral and it doesn't take much to see the defects: for long stretches the characters of Sean and Ivy are not credible (they clearly have difficulty with the English pronunciation), the character of the dumb brother is not developed very well. they are very promising though - in the scene where the call boy is flayed (the only real love scene) an intensity is reached that one would expect to see the entire film for a long time, as a spectator one must regret the possibilities offered ". Again, I have to agree. I liked the final scene, especially for the wonderfully captured faces of Gianni Meurer and André Schneider, but it was nothing compared to the boredom I had to suffer for the first thirty minutes. (The sex scenes, however, were aesthetically scripted and perfectly modified.) <br /> <br /> All in all, "Deed Poll" was not my cup of tea - a controversial wasted good idea - but it was an interesting see how a movie can be made with virtually no money. Perhaps if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director, this would become a better movie.
