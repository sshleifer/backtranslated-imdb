During a flight back from London, I looked at She's the Man; apparently Air Canada has a shitty policy. Maybe it's not the best way to start a review of this movie. Amanda Bynes plays a girl who loves football so much that she pretends to be her twin brother to join a team in a boarding school in the city. Even if you check your mind at the door (in a 6-hour flight you have to do it), the plot is implausible and ridiculous. There are some moments of humor, mostly from comedian David Cross as a principle, but the intricate polygon of love does not really inspire emotions, although it is intelligently mixed (with the warning of a plausible inclination). The ending is just as hopelessly foolish as the rest. I imagine that if I were a 12 year old girl, I could really enjoy it.
