And you'd be right. Black Mama, White Mama, also known as "Women in Chains", is exactly the scruffy and lousy b-movie type that the premise suggests. Pam Grier has been thrown into a prison on a small island with many other women, and this place seriously makes the summer camp where Martha Stewart is locked up at the moment seems like a maximum security prison. Not five minutes have passed in the film that one of the hottie guards utters the 'Strip' em and sucks her, and then we are presented with a prison life that resembles the fantasy of a university freshman on what the inside is of a sorority home is like. <br /> <br /> The prisoners soap and rub themselves in the shower as if it were a shooting of Girls Gone Wild, then they find themselves all together in their dorm, openly smoking pots and discussing in a big group what would be the best way to escape. I've never been in prison alone, but I have a feeling that escape plans are the kind of thing you want less people to know, prisoners or guards or otherwise. The biggest difference between this life in prison and a fantastic sisterhood life is that the women in this movie all wear orange cardigans (and no pants), which they say PRISON on the back. They must be those generic prison clothes for prisons that can't afford expensive accessories like the name of the prison or prisoner numbers for their uniforms. <br /> <br /> And how can one expect a prison that cannot afford to put the identification of prisoners on the back of the uniforms obviously cannot claim to be able to find guards who are interested in protecting prisoners as much as they are in having sex with the prisoners and with each other. <br /> <br /> The conflict the title of the film refers to the fact that Lee Daniels (Pam Grier) spends most of the time handcuffed to a blond prisoner named Karen while on the run from the police after escaping from prison . I won't go into details about how they escape, except to say that you could have seen something like this in The Fugitive if they hadn't been able to afford to stage a train disaster, and that leads into the confusing story of the conflicting interests they pursue these two women for different reasons. Karen and Lee both have their own bands of people, each of which hopes to save their respective escaped prisoner, and the cops are both after all the time. <br /> <br /> (spoiler) So Karen is involved with a group of hippies who want to revolutionize life as they know it. Meanwhile, Karen just wants to get off the island, something she's been trying to do for years, and it's just not perfect that everyone needs to go to completely opposite areas of the island to achieve their goals. So we get this strange pair and, given that they are a strange couple, it is not difficult to predict that they will hate each other for the vast majority of the film, but in the end they will become attached to each other. <br /> <br /> In a film with so many conflicting interests, especially when those conflicting interests not only push the two main characters in opposite directions while pursuing their goals, it is not unreasonable to expect that there will be a climax that will involve rival gangs at some point in the film. Not leaving anyone unsatisfied, they throw a stupid gang at the end of the movie, where everyone shoots at each other with machine guns, killing each other en masse as the two women paddle safely and calmly across the river in a small boat. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Even better, at the end of the film, after a huge massacre in which many people are shot and give off bright red paint everywhere, the police captain looks beyond the masses of criminal deaths covered by terrible and terrible special effects and we learn that it will be a major before dinner. It's not a bad way to finish the film, the criminals kill each other and the cops get all the credit, but here's the last line of the movie ?? "It's better to win, isn't it?" <br /> <br /> Is this the reason why the Captain will be promoted to major? Why did he understand ??
