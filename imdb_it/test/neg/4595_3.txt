I saw the unclassified version of this film and, as a person who studied Speck's life and crimes closely, I must say that this film is an imperfect but ambitious vision of the true story. While capturing Speck's true horror and murders, this film makes the following factual errors. 1. Speck didn't inject drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the film. In reality he was primarily an alcoholic and a pill that rarely took drugs with a syringe. 2. The Asian nurse who survived the Speck massacre did not make her way down the stairs and under the living room sofa as depicted in the film. This would have been impossible. In real life he hid under a bed while Speck systematically eliminated his 8 victims. 3. The film describes Speck as violent and brutal with women as soon as he meets them. Not true. In reality Speck was calm and gentle at first, reassuring women that he would not harm them. That's how he managed to tie each of them. 4. The real Richard Speck was not the deep thinker that the film portrays to be. The FBI profiler Robert Ressler interviewed Speck in the 1980s and said that Speck not only knew DID'NT why he committed the murders, but he was not interested in learning because he could shed light on why. It was known that the Speck was of an inferior intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this film. If the story were not so tragic and horrible, the voice would be laughable. All in all, Doug Cole's performance is adequately threatening and cold-blooded even though I don't think the real Speck was that far in his violence. No doubt he was a very violent person when he was under the influence, but he was also known, after all, for being a rather astute scammer, able to put people at ease before victimizing them. Beverly Ann Sotelo's performance as a surviving nurse is the most beautiful in the film. She is a very good actress. If you are picky, don't watch this movie. It is very graphic and disturbing.
