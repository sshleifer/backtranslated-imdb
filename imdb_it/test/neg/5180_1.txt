The Motion Picture Association of America has seen fit to advise potential viewers and this is particularly useful for parents and guardians who are given an "R" rating in this movie called "Frostbite". The "R" rating has specific information that allows any person who knows nothing about a movie to know something about what this movie provides. The "R" was established for sexual content including Nudity and Perverse dialogues, language, crude sense of humor and drug use. a film although it would be useful to know if this could be removed as a possibility to everyone I would like this review to remove such a possibility. This is a film in which only a 1 was not equal to a number as it did not qualify as a movie for to be counted, in fact that purpose is with this film, so it should be such a purpose with this film. It is an unhealthy and undesirable offer that should be interpreted in a much more rigorous way because at no time is a conduct or language suitable for viewing and this type of film might want a blacklist rather than a more rigid definition for regarding its content. It is suggested with what the strictest definition would allow, it is here a criminal charge. This is an unpleasant world that would harm any person who watches this film as its purpose is to commit a crime. It is a crime and is offensive in its purpose. There is no sense of humor in the film, but a depraved and indifferent purpose as to its undesirable submission. Without reservations it is a list of not seeing and perhaps not entirely necessary to say to all the adults who consider, but to those whose interests concern the environment in which children grow up, do not allow or give to any young person the vision of this film is rude. Often the company sends a wrong message when these types of problems are in the public domain, let it not be one of those times.
