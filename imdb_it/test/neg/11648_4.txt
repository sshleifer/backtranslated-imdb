The plot was not good. <br /> <br /> The special effects were not. <br /> <br /> The acting was ... not very good at all. <br /> <br /> I like others, I felt that there were many holes in the plot that you could fly, well, a space shuttle. <br /> <br /> I thought the ending was pretty incredible. <br /> <br /> About kids, about the "torch to blow into space". <br /> <br /> Blow torches have their own oxygen supply (hence the name "oxyacetylene torch"). Two tubes run from the torch: one to an acetylene bottle and one to an oxygen cylinder. <br /> <br /> So a "blow of a torch" would work perfectly in space.
