OK, I thought the trailer was pretty good, so I was hoping for this movie, plus, with the cast, I was sure I couldn't get less than 6 in my books. However, I was bothered for half an hour in the story ... right where the normal films are good, this film has hit the bottom. <br /> <br /> SPOILER * The guy everyone is trying to help is so attentive to other people who get hurt in the midst of the hustle and bustle he turns to his colleagues to save a tramp and then shut himself up in one of the armored trucks. Not only that, he constantly tries to attract the attention of other peoples with whom he ends up endangering more people and in short, the result is that he is responsible not only for the death of vagabonds, but also for a fired policeman and the kidnapping of his younger brother ... oh and all 5 of his colleagues are dying in disgrace. <br /> <br /> But in the end he is HAPPY because he came to his senses halfway through, and then if all his colleagues died, instead of sticking to the plan and becoming millionaires. This film has tried to be so politically correct that it makes me sick! He ruined a good story. Too bad indeed.
