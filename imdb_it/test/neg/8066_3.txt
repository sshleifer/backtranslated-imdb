This film was a mess. There was nothing really interesting. The only character that caught the eye was Bobbie Phillips' Maya and it wasn't worth it. <br /> <br /> The plot is standard, double crossing of the double double-pass cruiser. With a few too many double crosses to make sense. Sometimes this means that "it makes you guess" in this case "makes you wait". In the end I just wanted everyone to be put in jail or shot.
