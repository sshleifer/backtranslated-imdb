About the spoiler alert? It is not "may contain", but contains spoilers. Readers are careful. <br /> <br /> Okay, first I need you to know that I'm not hitting the actors. They are just working with what they gave. The problem was the script. It was awful. Nothing was credible to NOTHING. Of course, when you have a movie based on a killer hitchhiker, there will be a bad mistake here and there that will catapult you into the terribly horrible and film-worthy situation. But these girls just made a stupid decision after a stupid decision. The only girl smart enough to try and call the police was the girl added towards the end because she had already killed one and hit another with a car. Speaking of hitting her with a car ... why the hell did you try running on a truck rather than running sideways like a normal person? Also, whoever wrote the script honestly to God believes that the cops will not investigate a blood-covered door? Frankly, it wasn't even suspenseful. The only suspense I was experiencing was the frustration with how late the girls were. Well, this outburst has gone on longer than I intended for such a bad movie, so I won't worry about touching the end other than the fact that it's unrealistic and lame.
