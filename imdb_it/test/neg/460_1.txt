Alien was excellent. Many writers have tried to copy it. They did a bad job (or almost). But Dead Space is the worst copy of Alien. For the bad actors, the bad special effects, the BAD scenario and other bad things (it would take about 3 pages to tell everything that is bad in this film. The film was not very long and this is a very good thing ( 'unique) You can't laugh because it's too serious ... it's a bad thing because, in almost every B-series science fiction movie, you can laugh all the time, it can be great sometimes, but instead of watching this stupidity, just look at Alien or Event Horizon ... these are much better !!! I give them 1 out of 5.
