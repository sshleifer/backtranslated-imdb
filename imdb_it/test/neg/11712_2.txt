I'm not a fan of the original book, but I expected to see a better adaptation of Natalie Portman's film, which I found horrible. This version is even worse. <br /> <br /> First, there is very little of Ms. Gregory's book in this script. The entire subplot of George Boleyn's sexuality is completely eliminated and in this version George is nothing but a clumsy rift between his duty to the Boleyn family and his duty to the king. I thought the book's title referred to Mary as the least known of the Boleyn sisters, but here it is used to refer to Anne. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the script has the characters that periodically address the audience as if in confession. Apparently this is intended to give some history back and explain their motivations, but it is an amateurish performance. <br /> <br /> In addition to the bad script, the director is incredibly ugly. There are too many shots taken with a camera that is not too stable at best and definitely flickering at worst. Many of the speeches are given on a provisional basis, as if they were in a first trial. The production values ​​for Henry's flaming court are minimal. The costumes vary: some are copies of historical portraits and others are the result of the feverish imagination of some costume designers. And the King, the source of all power and favors, is often shown ONLY. No courtiers doing court, no servants in the background - where are all the people ?? I'm used to Hollywood turning the story into fantasy, but I expected better from a BBC production. Also on the basis of an imperfect book this production is MALE.
