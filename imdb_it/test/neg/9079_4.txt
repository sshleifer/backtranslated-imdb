"The Evil That Men Do" begins with a truly repellent torture scene, followed, somewhat later, by verbal graphical descriptions of equally repulsive torture methods that the wicked, senseless evil loves to use. But despite the use of such effects strictly for shock, filmmakers can't really hide the fact that this is just a boring, low-quality Bronson vehicle. Bronson himself is solid here, but he should have chosen a better script.
