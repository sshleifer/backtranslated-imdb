The concept of this film is quite compelling: zombie children coming out of an abandoned mine to take revenge for their death in the woods of Pennsylvania. Cold. The problem I had with the film is the lack of creativity in dealing with zombies. The producers might have really flavored the film with some terror images like "The Ring", like the stop action, the reverse on foot or something like that. When the zombie children are walking through the woods they look like a group of 9-year-olds going to a playground in West Philadelphia. Instead of pickaxes and shovels they could easily carry baseball bats and gloves. Why should I fear these kids? Anyone could run straight to safety. Moreover, who was sane would have stayed a night with their children in that disturbing and dilapidated house? The moment I opened that door and looked around I would have said "Mm-hmm Mm-hmm. Son, go and start the car, I go around peeing on a bush and then we're out of here". Absolutely incredible movie. Do not waste time.
