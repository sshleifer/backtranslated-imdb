I couldn't wait to see this movie, it seemed that whoever saw it loved it. I was completely disappointed. The acting was so exaggerated. The script seemed that the writer had collected 25 different scripts from various films and randomly selected the dialogues and put them together to form a plagarized script. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: was there any clich√©s omitted in this film? There was a coup of mobstyle, homosexuality, prostitution, a serial killer, a fire, numerous wannabees of the godfather, the main character in love with the prostitute, the disguise, the torture of the police, the mutilations of Hannibal Lechter, I could go on forever . <br /> <br /> Line as (the godfather wannabe to the prostitute) <br /> <br /> - "Ben senin arik calismani istemiyorum" (I don't want you to work anymore) <br /> <br /> - "Ben calismasam kirayi kim odeyecek?" (Who would pay the rent if I hadn't worked) <br /> <br /> Unrealistic scenes: we never saw a policeman during the serial killer scenes, but when the main character disappeared, his father was taken by the police and tortured for weeks. <br /> <br /> The only way I can make sense of this whole movie is if the version I had of the scene had been seriously modified by the original. I certainly wouldn't recommend it, and I would very much like to discuss it further with anyone interested in doing so. <br /> <br />
