The video of this film reads "a story of beauty, passion and forbidden fruit". Are they talking about the same movie I've just seen ?! They can't be, because the film I just saw was beautiful, but there was no passion and as far as the fruit is concerned, this is all smoke to entice the potential spectator to see this film. If only he had a certain passion or a little life, I would have loved this film very much. Instead, it was a slow-moving and not particularly interesting film that I would not like to review. It's not that it's a bad movie (after all it's very well shot), but it's boring beyond imagination. I kept waiting for something exciting or interesting to happen, but then the movie just ended. There was not a great sense of excitement, mystery or anything else - just a rather unexciting story about a girl who becomes a maid and spends the next 10 years of her life working as a waitress.
