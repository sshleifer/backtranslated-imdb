Extremely formidable with logical holes of cosmic dimensions and a fiction to the comedy. Aw, poor New York lawyer! He's just trying to understand, and when he gets a pay cut he doesn't go out to find another job, although he's one of the most respected lawyers in the area. We see him arguing in court so that others arrive and congratulate him on his ardent and captivating delivery, but he cannot resist anyone in his company. At home, problems are ignored until people leave home. <br /> <br /> The only character you want to root for is the last maid, who looks like a real human being who uses logic and communication to survive in the world. How ridiculous it is that the waitress take the lawyer and his wife to get a chicken and a wine for New Year's because he feels sorry for them! (The bit is not reproduced for laughter.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, just too incredible and with a ** SPOILER ** pat, everyone turns at 180 degrees. How did they get top quality stars for this? If I had been in the studio, I would have sent it back for a complete rewrite.
