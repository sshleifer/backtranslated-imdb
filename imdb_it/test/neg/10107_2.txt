OK, it was a "risky" move to rent this movie, but I thought I had nothing to lose. Well, I was wrong. This is, next to "Bloodsurf", the worst "horrormovie" I've ever seen. Lousy actors, disgusting technical production, lousy history and so on. The soundtrack, however, is not bad. That's why I give him a vote on the vote and not just a 1. And of course cats are a positive surprise. By far the top actors in this movie ..... Don't rent or buy it. Stay away from me and hope that this horrible and horrible film vanishes into some obscure existence and does not become a "cult classic". It certainly does not deserve any recognition.
