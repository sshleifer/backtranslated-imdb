The Nun is a photo of revenge for which a very strict nun is killed by her rebel garbage charges and returns years later to arrive even when the adults now visit their old school. The plot is predictable in spades and does not reserve surprises as it slowly approaches the end. It is a scream of a movie with passable acting and screenplay and screenplay below average. Most of the special effects are low level and in the final battle there is almost zero credibility. Still, if you look beyond these there are some jewels of suspense and acting. If you like senseless screaming, you will like it, otherwise you should pass.
