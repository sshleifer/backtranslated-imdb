I took this movie a few years ago, one night, and it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. However, since it should be an action movie, I can't give it more stars since the humor wasn't intentional. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris plays a truck driver who returns home from the street to see his family, and within the first five minutes the conflict arises that leads Chuck to seek revenge for the rest of the film. Well also, 'because the sub-par that acts from all the subjects involved is starting to age very quickly. Actually, the judge was good enough, but I can't really describe what makes it work, you will have to check it for yourself. <br /> <br /> And the van Chuck Norris custom units are horribly classic!
