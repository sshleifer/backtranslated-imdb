I think this film had a bad production value. The lack of acting makes me think that they should mark it as a first docudrama. He may not have money available to make it. I'm sorry it was a major league ride for Jackie Robinson. I think it was much better than many of the white players of his time. It had to be truly exceptional to break the chromatic barrier of time. Don't go around that this was a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I wish there was more information about its creators. They may have been limited by the quality of the actors who were willing to participate in the project. Maybe there is no money to be good people.
