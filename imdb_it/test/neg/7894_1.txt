With horrible movies like this that is considered even if not done, it's very easy to see why Hollywood is in serious trouble with wrong plots and worse makeovers all the time. <br /> <br /> I believe the viewer is supposed to laugh at their rear ends over the "black" bars, the "inflated" aspect and the "bling". It's so unbelievable 'over the top' and so bad that it's even past the 'So bad it's funny again' mark and they fell into 'totally embarrassing for anyone involved'. <br /> <br /> I am very, very sorry for every single minute I have wasted on this. I want my time back! <br /> <br /> Save yourself the agony, DO NOT watch this. The only reason I even gave 1 point in the evaluation is that 0 was not an option.
