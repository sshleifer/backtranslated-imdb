Apart from the scene of the gunfight, I felt that the film was a waste of celluloid. Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner and Annette Bening could have played those roles in sleep. The dialogue was marginally tolerable (and there was a lot of it - no one sat quietly in this film), the plot was everywhere on the map as if they couldn't decide how many themes to put into the story, there was no subtlety everything - the preface struck you between the eyes and they guided you through most of the story (I think they added all the dialogue to make sure you didn't lose anything), and the editing really needed to be tightened (each screenwriter's display time was more quantity than quality - again, too much dialogue). <br /> <br /> The whole story happened within a few days, but everything that happened took on epic proportions, much like how daily events seemed HUGE to you in high school, but in the grand scheme in actually they were not so important. Yes, the bad guys beat and killed Mose, they beat Button, they killed the dog - all of which would have made Boss and Charley raise their blood. But the importance was mitigated by all the "deep and meaningful" conversations that dominated much of the film. Have these guys worked together for 10 years and are they talking about these things now? The only time there wasn't much dialogue was in the scene of the gunfight - which is probably why I liked it. <br /> <br /> Finally someone gives Annette Bening a hairbrush! The tufts of hair strands around the face that were (I suppose) made her look a little more romantic actually made her look a bit unbalanced. If he had worked outside the home, it would have made more sense. Also, why wasn't she already married? There seemed to be several "kind and kind" (his words) single men in the city besides the marshal and his cronies. In fact, none of the villains seemed to want it (a normal plot device in other movies). She had been locked up at home most of the time and didn't seem to have much connection with the people of the city. It makes you wonder ...... <br /> <br /> In all, the film was too long, too talkative and too invented for me. It looked like a stellar vehicle with a lot of time on the screen for the big stars, but not enough depth of character to interest me, despite all the dialogue.
