The lives of Megan (Jackie Kresler) and Dylan (Shane Elliott) change in the Nevada desert between Reno and Las Vegas. They stop to eat in a small greasy spoon where, reluctantly, they learn about the notorious Area 51 from the bar owner (Jonathan Breck). After returning to the street in their forty-year-old Lincoln, the radio becomes a bit crazy to broadcast Hitler's speech at the 1836 Olympics and then a 1958 Elvis Presley newsletter is drafted into the army. The car breaks down slowly and the two give themselves to fear of their lives as mysterious and inexplicable things happen in the lonely desert poisoned by radiation; remains of nuclear tests. Megan meets a missing child (Channing Nichols) and a wounded WWII soldier. The nightmare journey does not end here. Kresler is impressive for a degree and writer / director James Lay makes good use of Patsy Cline's songs. All in all, moderately interesting Sci-Fi.
