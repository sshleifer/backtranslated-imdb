It is difficult to compete against classic greatness, but once you have made that choice and the decision is at stake, you need to find the best and brightest resources to keep your first product drawer and at the cutting edge of quality. If your intention is to aim for the second or third (or fourth) best, why try also? It is with this that I wonder why this version of the Ten Commandments was written, produced and transmitted. I would ask the producers: "What were you thinking about? Were you trying to create an expected deficit?" If perhaps the producers thought, "We want to examine this biblical story from another point of view ..." Then I would say "OK, I watched the show, now what's the point of view?" The premise of this "theory of the possible point of view" escapes me. Generally I can look at programs and (right or wrong) at least understand what the creators were trying to do. Not so here. I recognize names like "Robert Halmi" (the producer) and I can associate his work with an appealing product; Tin Man, Earthsea, Flash Gordon, Jason and the Argonauts. Low budget entertainment based on the myth, history and entertainment of comics. A perfect genre for Sci-Fi Channel. So I still have to ask Robert Halmi ... "What was the point of THIS TEN COMMANDS, what were you thinking about?" ???????? FJS
