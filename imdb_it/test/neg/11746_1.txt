Ok, first of all, who in their right mind could do Hitchcock again and second, who would shoot him? I admit I wasn't going to watch this movie for that same reason. The original Psycho is one of my favorite films of all time and this seemed to me a degrading photocopy. I watched it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed less than five minutes on this shit that was terrible. First of all, as mentioned, they fired it by the shot. Where is the originality? Why redo a movie that is almost perfect EXACTLY as it was made the first time? Why redo a film like that to begin with? If you're going to do something again, do something that doesn't work and make it BETTER! <br /> <br /> Secondly, they used the exact same script as the 1960 version. The dialog no longer works. It works perfectly and looks perfect for the 1960 version, but it seems strange and pungent to come out of modern actors. Why not update the dialog box? Hitch didn't write the script, you could rewrite it. <br /> <br /> This film had a very good talent and was wasted by imitation of the original actors. The actor who played the car salesman looked as if he were playing John Anderson's performance as a car salesman in the original. It seemed to all the actors that the only direction they were given was the characters in the original film. Vince Vaughn may seem a little more disturbing than Anthony Perkins, but in doing so, you lose the sympathy you should have for Norman. Having Norman masturbating while he watched Marion undressing was going too far and he lost the character's innocence which I think Tony Perkins captured so well in his performance. Viggo Mortensen's accent was annoying and Rita Wilson was too old to play Caroline. His jokes turned out to be desperate rather than young and fun like Patricia Hitchcock's performance. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I saw of the film is that Gus Van Sant was able to open the film with the shot that Hitch had imagined. Hitch wanted to open with a long shot on Phoenix but couldn't at that time, so he had to settle for a series of cross-dissolved shots together. This film realized that vision with a helicopter shot entering the hotel window. After that, even if the film has become a useless waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> If you are curious about how to destroy a wonderful film, look at this, but DO NOT look at it under any circumstances BEFORE looking at the original. This is a faded photocopy of the original and should never have been lit in green. Stick to the master's film, not imitation.
