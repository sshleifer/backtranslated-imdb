Wow, this movie is bad. Think "Flashdance" with the ninjas. The worst part is when a sword should float in mid-air, but you can see the strings. Or maybe the worst part is the giant eye patch (which looks like a coaster) that the good ninja wears. Actually, there are so many bad parts, I can't decide which one is the worst. I can't believe someone actually put the money to do this. The only saving value is that it's nice to laugh.
