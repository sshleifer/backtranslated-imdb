I can't believe how stupid this movie is. the plot (written by keira's mother Knightley) is what ruins the film to the extreme. it's definitely boring, absurd, and makes absolutely no sense ... <br /> <br /> this movie has remained so bad for most of it, especially in the beginning. the story kept talking about their daily flirtations, often times it looks like a trio. In this movie, you have a boring deadbeat couple (the poet and his wife) who are completely drunk from the beginning. his wife sleeps around with other men to make ends meet, while the poet is a pervert who lives with whistles and cheap women. his wife, who too soon becomes a friend of her former childhood lover (played by Keira) suddenly becomes jealous, knowing full well that the two were lovers since they were children. something doesn't seem right here ... I mean, come on ... get the program girl! what do you expect <br /> <br /> the bottom line is: the former lovers meet again with the new wife who embraces her, then becomes jealous, then the former lover gets married and her husband becomes jealous, bombards the house of crazy drunk, the crazy husband calls the police, and they end up going to court for the attempted murder charges of the man. this is summarized in a few words ... <br /> <br /> this film had moments like Cillian Murphy's quality and good acting, but other than that, I can't believe I saw it ... I complained about it during the film and some family members who watched him fell asleep. I decided to give him a chance and I should have kept to my first instinct.
