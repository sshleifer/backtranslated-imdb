I have been an avid fan of Jane Austen for many years. I had never seen this adaptation before, so when I heard about it, I came here and read all the excellent reviews. On this basis I impatiently ordered it from Netflix. What a cruel disappointment! They took one of the most subtle and brilliant comic novels and made it boring. It seems that each character has been assigned a single facial expression, a single tone on which to base their flat characters. Although this adaptation seems to have used every word written by Jane Austen, it appears to have been randomly transmitted to the characters. Although it was made as a miniseries, this adaptation manages to get confused and feel rushed as if it were made as a movie of the week. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bennett is too strict, Mrs. Bennet is just a chatty squirrel, Mr. Darcy lifeless like a nutcracker, Bennett's girls almost indistinguishable and Mr. Wickham a man no one would look at two times - barely the attractive! I'm quite off!
