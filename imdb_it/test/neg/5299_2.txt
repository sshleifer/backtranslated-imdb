"Get Shorty", "Out of Sight", "Jackie Brown" (and also "52 Pick-Up") - In the end people were finally right about Elmore Leonard, making good films come out of his work. So, despite my students' warnings of how bad this movie would have been, I couldn't resist being able to rent it. I thought, how bad can it be? Oy, what a mistake, especially in the wake of reading the book, which was lame (and even circularly self-referential, too) compared to the rest of Elmore Leonard's books. However, the book was better than the film. Leonard returns to beat the weak and inexperienced screenwriters who try to take over his book. The dialogue written for Steven Tyler was painful to watch. And the lyrics of the first song of Linda Moon's character? My middle school students write more deeply. Sad sad sad. Why even give it a star? Because Harvey Keitel and Uma Thurman are still fun to watch on the screen, and Andre 3000 didn't make a fool of himself.
