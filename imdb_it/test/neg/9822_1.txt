Where do we start with an offer like this? I almost said film, but it would be a step too far. The only infernal thing about this film is that it is certainly a marriage made in hell, between nothing and nonsense, nonsense and nonsense. These films should bring a warning of physiological health so as not to damage one's spirit to the point where one can believe that all good filmmakers have left the planet and their resources have been delivered to the unfortunates who made this classic piece of trivial garbage as if it were a sister of arms "League of Extraordinary Twaddle". They are neither science fiction nor facts, amusing or stimulating, humorous or heavy but they are in a twilight zone devoid of any equipment that attracts people to renounce their precious time, sit in a dark room and are generally more enlightened, animated or happy at the end of it. If we could assign "Turkey" points for films like this, this would be a turnip, since we would have gone through turkey, ham, potatoes, sprouts, gravy and all the other embellishments before reaching the bottom.
