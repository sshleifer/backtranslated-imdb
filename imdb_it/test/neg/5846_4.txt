I only saw this movie late last night. I remember the clamor of his release and to be honest if I had seen it, maybe I wouldn't have been so generous. I hate hype, it can ruin a movie. I think the film flew over the characters and placed too much emphasis on Woody. He was good too, though he kept wondering if he had been stoned all the time. He never went too deep. Redford was dark but not too dark and his character disappointed me in the end. For me he should have been more aggressive with Demi - throw her out or tell her that she had been paid. After all, he would investigate them before he made the proposal - this is not shown in the film, but no one in his perceived position would have made an offer to anyone. He was cruel enough to break them and the last straw was the house, but had Demi fallen for him? The passages that give an idea of ​​the relationship between Demi and Woody were the best part of the film. There was an intense depth that exceeded the superficiality of the character of John Gages. He could have been much stronger and, as other people have alluded to, I think the love card of the film was Redford and they didn't want to blur his "image". I say what the hell Robert was old in this movie! The characters of Woody and Demi were naive in a sense, but I think it was very intentional to lure you to their situation and support their decision. But the reality is that they were losing their dream home and where did they go? Las Vegas? bet the little they had left and then accept a proposal from an insanely rich billionaire. I found their naivety when Redford was seducing them a little too unrealistic. The film could have been much more and other actors would have made the difference, but having said it on TV late at night - it was fun and I if you don't think too much about it - it was also palatable
