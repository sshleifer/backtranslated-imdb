This movie is really quite strange. Clearly certain * events * portraits identify the main protagonist as the Dublin criminal known as "The General", but almost everything else is simply wrong. We are not talking about a distortion of ancient history ... but a complete distortion of irrefutable and documented facts. The question is really why? The gards are shown as the last Keystone cops, his gang as non-threatening and the man himself as ... Kevin Spacey. Almost pure fiction anyway, why bother trying to give a semblance of realism? That being said, it's a bad exercise * any * way you want to watch it. It is not worth a second of anyone's time.
