I took this film from the library and saw that there were many actors that I liked (John Cleese, Ian Holm, Ralph Richardson, etc.), so I took it and looked at it. I had expected Cleese to play an important role since he had his first billing, I was surprised to find he had about five minutes on screen, along with all the others I liked. This film is incredibly useless, the characters are noble, the plot is non-existent and the ending is one of the worst endings I've ever seen. There were some fun parts, but that's it. Stay away from this movie if you want to avoid going "What?" and "Huh?", a lot. And if you don't want to waste time. Ignore people who say this is a very funny movie ... it's not. Stay away at all costs ... please.
