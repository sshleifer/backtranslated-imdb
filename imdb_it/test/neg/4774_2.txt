He had potential ... really. But there is so much of the film that was ridiculous and ridiculous. I'm a horror movie and I thought it was stupid; how did my thirteen year old! I expected to be at least scared. And yes, the coarse factor of the screws that writhed in people was there; however, the advance to get to the ruins is just stupid, stupid, stupid. <br /> <br /> I really mean those who make an excursion ... in a jungle ... with a total stranger ... with a little water and some snacks ... IN FLIP FLOP, NO LESS ?! Puh-lease! Better yet, who goes to a foreign country and leaves the tourist area without an interpreter or is he able to speak a little of the language? Are these people completely deficient? <br /> <br /> Is the German brother not listened to and does not require assistance? Who doesn't? Find only some Greeks and Americans to do a little research and find?
