The sun was not shining, it was too wet to play, so I went to the cinema that cold, cold and wet day. <br /> <br /> "The cat with the hat" was the name of the film, and when it was over, my stomach was sick. Mike Myers played the Cat, his humor was lame, and children don't need to see it, humor was not docile. <br /> <the film was like drinking milk from an angry cow, so it's fun to have fun, but the filmmakers don't know how. <br /> <br /> This film, in short, is atrocious. The acting was very bad, the plot was changed too much, and the humor was surprisingly very raw. <br /> <br /> It starts with Conrad and Sally, a violator of rules and a future sheriff. When their mom has to go to work, she gets Ms. Kwan from babysitting. Perhaps the only funny part of the movie is when Ms. Kwan is looking at a room in the Taiwanese court, a C-SPAN. Soon he falls asleep, and here comes the Cat. <br /> <br /> The film starts spiraling out of control. The cat has come to try to entertain the children. He has Thing 1 and Thing 2, who suddenly start ruining the house. Make an Infomercial TV and accidentally cut the tail. And when the Cat fills Carmen Miranda, it's not funny. Perhaps his only funny disguise is like a hippie activist. And there is a fish trying to warn the Cat's children. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that he didn't warn us that this film was as much fun as sour milk, or cut the tail. <br /> <br /> Soon the kids are out looking for the family dog, which has the key to a chest on the collar. If the crate is not locked, their home will host the Cat universe. Here it becomes a little more interesting, but not enough to save the film. <br /> <br /> Acting, overall, is horrible. Mike Meyers brings his brand of Austin Powers irreverent humor to the cat, saying things like "You dirty ho" and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a joke in his testicles as he poses like a pinata. Spencer Breslin is as good as Conrad, and Dakota Fanning is as cute as Sally, even though he is not alone enough to save this horrendous aortic dissection waiting to kill John Ritter (an accident waiting to happen). Alec Baldwin's filthy and slimy Lawrence Quinn is disgusting, always trying to woo the children's mom, played by Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes is Mr. Humberfloob, the head of the mother, and is also the voice of the fish. These last three are also insignificant. <br /> <br /> In general, if I were a parent I would not take my children who are in humor, because there is plenty of it and more. Save your $ 7.00 and see something else. As the great Dr. Seuss once said, <br /> <br /> it's fun to have fun, but you need to know how. Really, universal, enough! Theodore is already turning in his grave. <br /> <br /> As my mom always says, "Curiosity has killed the cat" .- The cat in the hat * of *****
