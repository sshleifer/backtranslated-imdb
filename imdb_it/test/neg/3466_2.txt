I thought this movie would be good. Absolutely not, despite the main winners of the Oscars. I might have laughed once, and I've never heard anyone else laugh in the theater. Renee Zellweger's pancake make-up was really unbecoming. It seems that everyone is trying so hard in this movie, running in imitation of slapstick but not pulling it out. I think maybe the film should have sounded good, but something got lost in the translation. Are the roaring 20s really like that? I do not think so. Everything looks a little artificial. Randy Newman's score was annoying. The film is in sepia tones, just like any other film that takes place in the 20s or 30s. There is not only so much originality here.
