Lance Henriksen paid something to appear in this. I hope it was a lot. <br /> <br /> Former US champion gymnast, Kristie Phillips starts as Charlie Case, a secret gymnast agent (because it's very common for munchkin gymnasts to become government spies ...) <br /> < br /> There is a truly hysterical opening scene in which the irregular routine of Charlie's jokes is sabotaged by a competitor from the Eastern bloc. What follows is one of the most ridiculous stunt scenes I've ever witnessed ... and they want you to take it seriously! Don't worry ... he puts his horse on. <br /> <br /> All that follows is just a messy, reckless spy movie. Watch the first fifteen minutes for campy gymnastics, then run for cover.
