If you are a North American TOURIST looking for a 'TRAP' here it is here. Was this "Trading Spaces visiting TUSCANY?" There were too many stereotypes. Little attention has been given to the character and development of the plot. YAWN. The film's highlight: the launch of the flag. Poor boy! I thought he would lose an eye!
