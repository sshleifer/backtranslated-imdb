Or is that what the directors would like you to believe anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie looks so hard to be cool it's ridiculous. Everything from film look, to film, to editing, to dialogue and acting, is ready in super cool mode from the start. Just to make sure no one touches how beautiful this movie is, there's a soundtrack of really cool rock n roll songs and a western-surf-tex western Texas guitar that constantly plays throughout the movie. As a last reminder of how beautiful this film is, all the actors were asked to speak in a hoarse voice, because, as we all know, it's a tough thing. <br /> <br /> The plot (if there really is one) seems pretty simple. But as someone else has already pointed out, the director and the protagonist of the film, seem fiercely determined not to tell that story, focusing instead on a plethora of naked girls and dialogues that should be tough, but tires surprisingly quickly (they have a contest to see how many times could they contain the words "pussy" and "f * ck" and its derivatives in an 80-minute movie? <br /> <br /> This film was absolutely horrible.
