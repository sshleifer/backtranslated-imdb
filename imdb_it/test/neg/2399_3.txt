I am sure that the people who made this film think they are doing something wonderfully politically correct, because they are able to criticize the American wars in Afghanistan and in particular in Iraq, suggesting that the United States does well the war, but they do not clean up afterwards, sowing so the seeds for future problems. Moreover, they do so without making the Islamists the enemy AND without making the Republicans the enemy, since it is the Republicans who are in charge and are doing this seemingly grandiose thing, overthrowing the Soviet Union by secretly providing a war in Afghanistan . <br /> <br /> But seriously now. . . we really want a movie that repeatedly says "let's go kill some Russians!" like it's the best thing a red-blooded American could do? And should we find this Congressman adorable because he surrounds himself with women with big hair and revealing clothes? Even his seemingly intelligent assistant, who is always professionally dressed, continues to look at Charlie as if he were the most wonderful, the most beautiful, the greatest boy around. Like it's Nancy Reagan with her Ronnie. Julia Roberts does a stunning job in her role, but basically the women are really diminished in this film, and it was really annoying.
