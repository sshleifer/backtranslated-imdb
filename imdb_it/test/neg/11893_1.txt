Can you please stop believing everything this man says? Take your facts <br /> before you start praising this liar. It is not even from <br /> by Flint. He says it only to keep his "blue collar" look. It is <br /> from a rich suburb near Flint. I mean he went to a private school. <br /> <br /> His parents paid him to go to school. Wow, it looks like <br /> <br /> suffered a lot from Flint going to the dumps. He was also born in Canada. Oh wait, this makes him a Canadian citizen. I wish he moved there. Instead, he lives here in his $ 1 million New York apartment. This is the working class right there. I can't wait for his DVD set to come out. I want here to talk about how bad big corporations are. Where will I get those DVDs? Oh yes, at Target and Wal-Mart. The two largest companies in America, which were also the only two stores, allowed them to be sold.
