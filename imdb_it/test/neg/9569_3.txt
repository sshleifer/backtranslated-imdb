Well, I saw this movie during the last San Sebastian Festival. The reaction to it was ... let's say funny how the film is not intentionally. It happened that they showed a copy with subtitles in Spanish terribly wrong. They seemed to be a translation from Chinese to English and then from Spanish. It was all confused, the sexes had changed (the girls looked like boys and boys like girls), and my friends and I remember great jokes ... but because they were so absurd. All in all it's not a good movie, but if they ever show it on TV, and you have nothing to do, and if you want to laugh (again, not so much with the film), then go ahead, "Visible Secret" is yours movie.
