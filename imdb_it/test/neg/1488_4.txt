Like many history buffs in western Pennsylvania, I couldn't wait to see this much-announced PBS program produced by the Pittsburgh WQED. However, I must say that I was a little disappointed. On the positive side, I believe that overall this film has done a good job of explaining the main problems and describing the events of the so-called French and Indian war. In particular, his presentation of the Indian point of view was somewhat new and rather interesting, although at the moment it was certainly too emphasized. Also on the positive side, the mixture of narrative scenes and action scenes was well done and turned out to be a little better than many of these typical documentaries consisting of "expert" interviews and frames (a la Ken Burns). On the negative side, many of the battles looked a bit "staged" and many important aspects of the war were overlooked. Above all I was very disappointed and frustrated by the little importance given to Forbes' successful campaign of 1758 against Fort Duquesne compared to previous failures of 1754 by Washington and 1755 by Braddock. In particular, I was a little incredulous that there was no mention of Colonel Henry Bouquet, the Swiss mercenary at the British service who was the main responsible for Forbes' success. In the end I could not believe the complete omission of the Battle of Bushy Run of 1763 which began as a repetition of Braddock's defeat but ended up as the victory that decided the outcome of Pontiac's War thanks to the tricks of Colonel Bouquet himself who certainly should rank as one of the most successful British commanders of this war.
