K, one day my father took a film with a clean cover. I came home with my mom and we were like we could watch this new movie we had never seen before! .. Ok so it started ... interesting start, fantastic robots and disgusting gore (eek) on a strange planet (actually it was Pluto no?) ... Blablabla I could tell the whole story but I NEVER point, NEVER NEVER EVER take a movie with an idiotic name, and seriously I do not NEVER EVER intend to judge a book by its cover (err tape ..) it seemed like an interesting film HOWEVER it was a slap in the face for science fiction movies, its DISGUSTING. I mean it was so bad that I just started laughing (I swear he tried to be serious) CANT 'DESCRIBE STUPIDITY! It has killed more than a million brain cells that I can't even write a descent criticism. YOUR BAD! Argh and I prepare you for something "weird" * COUGH COUGH * p3n1 mechanic * COUGH COUGH * Sorry I had to say it, it's so funny, think of it as a comedy or a genre parody for science fiction movies. His classic batman laughs but in a new package. What the hell was this director thinking?
