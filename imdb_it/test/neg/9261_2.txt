I bought this movie for 99 cents at the K-mart several years ago (along with "Hawken's Breed") and I guess anything with Gabriel Byrne and Amanda Donahoe is definitely worth it. It wasn't. "Dark Obsession" (the title I bought below) was a slight cut above "Hawken's Breed" (IMBD valued at 2.4), but not enough to allow me to keep it at home. I threw both films in the trash. <br /> <br /> This thing fails on so many levels it's hard to narrow it down, but let's say it's bad, unbelievable, boring, hedonistic, confusing and even 100 minutes, too long. <br /> <br /> I love Byrne as an actor, but this schlock looks really bad in his resume.
