This is just a long advertisement for the movie "The Death Tunnel". Although it is an interesting story of the Waverly Hills Sanatorium, the whole ghost theory depends on your interpretation. Other "Ghost Orb" that you can duplicate with dust in front of a flash camera, and "Ectoplasmic Mist" is just the smoke of someone's cigarette lit with the camera flash. I couldn't see any "Shadow People" until they drew an outline around the fuzzy distortion of the image. No scientific explanation has been suggested for the phenomena, only paranormal. Maybe these are just the events you should see to believe, so make sure you make plans to visit the Sanatorium for your next vacation in Louisville, Kentucky.
