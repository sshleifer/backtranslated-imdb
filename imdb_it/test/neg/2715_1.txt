Yes, it was a terrible film, but there was a song near the beginning of the film, I think, called "I got a Woody" or something like that. I would like to find a soundtrack of that if there is one available. I saw this song on MST 3K, and as horrible as it was, it had its moments, and that song was one of those. <br /> <br /> If you like girls in bikinis, this is the movie for you, but if you don't, then don't worry. It was an exceptional material for MST 3K, I have to admit though. I would really like to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack. Not just that song, but another pair were really fun, and they're classics for me.
