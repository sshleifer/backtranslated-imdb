The monster will seem very familiar to you. So will the rest of the film, if you've seen half a dozen of these films of kids trapped in the woods. Ok, so they're not teenagers this time, but they might be too. Three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out an almost abandoned ghost town, hoping to find the gold that people have been killed over a century and a half before. You would think that with a title like "Miner's Massacre" interesting things could happen. They don't. In fact, only about 1/10 of the film actually takes place in the mine. I had imagined groups of terrified miners running around their lives in the cavernous boundaries of their workplace, praying that black lung disease would take them before the Grim Reaper demanded his revenge, but instead I received twenty-year-old terrestrials who furnished - in one case, defecating - in the woods, a band of morons with a collective IQ who would have had difficulty tearing a plastic ring from a box of Cracker Jacks, much less a treasure buried by an abandoned mine. No suspense, no fear and a couple of embarrassing shows. Someone forgot to tell writers that "Gold of the Fool" refers to the genuineness of gold, not to the people who seek it. 3/10
