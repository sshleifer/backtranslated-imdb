This is beyond the stupid. <br /> <br /> Two graduates go to Nantucket for the summer and find situations that are absolutely revolting. <br /> <br /> Demi Moore is co-star in this. While the film was in 1986, was Ashton Kutcher just a child in the woods at that time? <br /> <br /> Moore's grandfather died and his house is about to be sold to ruthless people with a father and son who bring new meaning to the term means. <br /> <br /> Bobcat Goldthwait, with that nasty voice is in the film, as well as two brothers, who make stupid and ever more intelligent stupid. <br /> <br /> The writing is absolutely ridiculous. The salient points of stupidity are where one person says to the other: "Did you ever notice that when people die, they go in alphabetical order in the newspapers?" <br /> <br /> I rest my case.
