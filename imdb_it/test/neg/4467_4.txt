Being a Steve Martin fan for a long time, it hurts to see him in a movie with such a dramatic script. The writer must have just rented some videos and taken a piece here and a piece there - it's certainly the least imaginative film I've seen in a long time - I knew exactly what would happen in every scene as soon as it started. African-American stereotypes and slave references are also quite offensive. But the worst thing for me was seeing Martin in a movie without a trace of spirit. He is probably one of the most intelligent actors and here he has completely sold himself to a totally stupid script. He must be back in his food to be in a lame effort.
