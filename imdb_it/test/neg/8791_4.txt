Ridiculous movie in which two university students move to California and one becomes a movie star and the other his manager. <br /> <br /> As the 10 years pass, the star's popularity is diminishing, so it is determined that there will be a TV show where women will compete for her affection. <br /> <br /> The film is hateful and ridiculous. The girls competing for the lover boy are made to look silly. Only one girl seems to be the choice of the producer of the show. She is a true amateur against some of the other women, but she is healthy and brings good grades to the show. <br /> <br /> With the third scene you realize that the manager is falling for her. <br /> <br /> We know that Ryan really wanted to be a bachelor. While the ending is pretty nice, you really know where it went.
